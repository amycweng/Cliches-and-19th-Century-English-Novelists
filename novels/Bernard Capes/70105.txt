shining flood he dabbed at the reply form fuming and sputtering i desire to be put into communication with this this is a pleasantry mr balm he said a little monkeylike figure of a man balancing on a windowsill the young lady gave a scream which shivered to the stars look sir he said them cushions where she sat gilead balm prologue gilead balm had most things to recommend himyouth comeliness a bright intelligence an excellent heart a flawless digestion best of all an indestructible capacity for interesting himself in the affairs of the world into which he was born he was fresh fair shapely and of that graceful height which as representing the classic perfection of symmetry disposes the vision at the most reasonable level for contemplating the true stature of things and their relative mundane proportions his eyes were calm and fearless his voice soft his courtesy unimpeachable if he had a weakness it was for seeing two sides to a question one or the other of which was apt to tickle his sense of humour but humour after all is the saving grace of mankind and without it there may be much achievement but little charity with all these advantages pleasantly worn at the age of twentyfour gilead lacked in the worlds eyes the crowning advantage of an income or at least such an one as he enjoyed was far from adequately representing the value of his qualities he was in fact a second division clerk higher grade to the charity commissioners at whitehall on a salary of two hundred and fifty pounds a year and to that barring promotion he must look for his living he was an orphan his parents had diedfortunately after launching him on his careerinsolvent he had no negotiable prospects so far as he knew actual or problematic but nature had endowed him to his content and if at times some dream of affluence would come to disturb him its motif was as far removed from an unworthy lust of gain as his soul was from the ambitions and appetites of the majority of his fellows yet what of vulgar acquisitiveness lacked in him was supplied somewhat by the spirit of the romantic quest his bright soul would occasionally covet a larger scope for its experiences and to that end the meansthe only earthly meansto their enlargement if he ever thought of money it was as the golden key to the complex heart of the world it was his custom during the luncheon hour to read the daily post all government clerks read the daily post because it is the organ of the lite gilead differed from the most however in that he read the daily post wholly and solely for the sake of its front page advertisements and he was wise leading articles will be prejudiced reporters unscrupulous foreign telegrams will illustrate the art of political selection only in the calling of wares the births deaths and marriages the cries of the agony column does nature speak in unequivocal terms it was upon the agony column of the daily post that gilead was wont to whet his appetite for the emotional truths of life we all know this agony column it is unique amongst its daily fellowsmore stirring more motley more shrill with the personal note than any other it is not that its ciphers are more elegantly cryptic that its moneylenders are more largehearted and openhanded in a princely unsuspecting sort of way that its private enquiry agencies are more distinguished or its facecreams more modish than those to be found quoted in other agony columnsthough to be sure a certain aroma of exclusiveness might be claimed for the sellers of wares advertised under the gis of an aristocratic name it is its perpetual undaunted appeals to the rich and benevolent or to the fashionable and needy which make it wholly singular among its class reading and pondering these day by day gilead came to the conclusion that the daily post was not so much the organ of the tariff or of any other reformers as the organ of benevolence pure and simple how otherwise could this persistent cry for help be maintained in it there must be some response to justify its clamour he seldom read further than that first page its matter perennially fascinated and haunted him he would have liked to trace every one of those essentially human cries to its source and according to its motive still it or give it cause to howl on a different note and if he had wealth he would do it he told himself to play the haroun alraschid to suffering worth to alleviate misery and expose imposture by way of the countless channels offered by a popular dailywhat a rare purpose it would give to unmitigated opulence and what an interest no picturegalleries no freelibraries no lifting of international cups for ostentations sake but just an unnoticed pursuit of the individual submerged one and his quiet resuscitation and wellcomforted dismissal but there was another and even more attractive side to the picture and that was the mysteries his quest would penetrate and of which the agony column of the daily post afforded some potential examples how might not one gratify here ones lovingkindness and ones romanticism in a breath the imaginative prospect was quite captivating to gilead he divided the advertisements generally into five classes cosmetic private enquiry situations which revealed some others of the oddest nondescript including anything from remember the cats to a request to some titled lady to act as godmother to a gentlemans child or a suggestion that a third lady should join two others in arranging and paying for a series of painful experiments on human subjects and last and most numerous of all requests for loans many of these found gilead doubtful while the appeals from clergymen and others on behalf of poor parishes ruined homes unemployed labour and so forth affected him so sensibly that he would have liked to be able to answer every one of them with help proportionate to the needs it voiced there were certain piteous entreaties for cash which left him cold they smacked too much of the cunning and versatility of the professional mendicant somehow they seemed a little shy of the inquisition of those clear contemplative eyes of his under their level brows at the best they were couched in that key which argued if not a constitutional absence at least a temporary surrender of pride and selfrespect but he was no pharisee and very remote from judging wrung poverty by the standards of comfort and a competence the question was the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and to the pursuit of that he would have rejoiced to devote whatever fortune the fates might allot him and perhaps because his aspirations were so singular in a very ordinary world taken with the fact that his temperament was even a curiously calm and virginal one the fates who are a rather spinstery and spiteful triplet on the whole were moved to do the unexpected thing by himand in a very handsome and appropriate mannerby causing messrs plover stone and company the respectable solicitors to insert an advertisement in the agony column of that very daily post inviting the nextofkin of the late mr lemuel lamb to call upon them and hear of something considerably to his advantage gilead read the advertisement in due course and considered it with characteristic sobriety and an even pulse if he thought there is anything out of the common in this i shall not forget my pledge to the quest he finished his chop placidly recalling some traits of the departed lemuel who he could little doubt though with a philosophic reservation for contingencies had been his sole surviving relative on the mothers side he remembered with a certain easy gratification how this disregarded uncle of his from being a scapegrace and rather impossible waster had been reportedfrom australia whither he had withdrawna reformed character of late years which he had devoted to the amassing of a considerable fortune made out of stockbut whether soup or sheep gilead did not know nor did he care in the least all money was dirty stuff in the making the moral of acquisition was in the cleansing of the hands that followed he brushed a crumb or two from his waistcoat paid his bill and returned to whitehall to request a short leave of absence none might have guessed from his exterior the issues which turned upon that petition it is not my purpose to recount the details of the interview which followed or the processes by which identification was secured and a claim substantiated suffice it to say that loquacious lemuel as he was known in the land of his adoption had turned his natural predatory instincts to phenomenal profit during the few years that opportunity had allotted him for their full play and had then in a mood of magnificent atonement bequeathed the whole of his gigantic fortune to the credulous brotherinlaw in england whom he had once been instrumental in impoverishing and whose sole heir gilead remained by will the young manto jump formalities and eschew all bewildering calculations of figuresentered upon his new world rich in the stereotyped phrase beyond the dreams of avariceas if avarice ever had any dreams worth mentioning but of orts and candleends but he faced his position with a clear brain and a full appreciation of the ten thousand rapacities and importunities it would invite as to that his plans were quite decided he would employ a confidential secretary and some subordinate agents and amanuenses and to them entrust the active business of philanthropy while he himself would stand in the background the unconfessed one the nominis umbra like junius to direct operations and give his personal attention to such cases as seemed to offer scope for the romantic quest he advertised somewhat in the following terms private secretary wanted by a gentleman of means good salary offered to one willing to devote himself wholly to the interests of his employer address in the first instance here followed the number of a house in victoria street a suite of rooms in which gilead had already furnished and turned into a central bureau for his operations the result gave him food for thought he received seven hundred and fortynine replies one hundred and sixtyeight of which were delivered on the date of the advertisement he recognized at once his single incapacity for dealing with that vast stack of correspondence and put on his hat and went to see mr plover in arundel street mr plovers appearance and expression needed perhaps the assurance of his firms timehonoured reputation to make them convincing he was a slacklipped beautifully whitewhiskered old gentleman wearing goldrimmed pincenez which being near the tip of his nose were wont occasionally to topple over and get in the way of his speech one had to put some force upon oneself to read legal profundity in features which seemed to betray even an excess of amiable vacuity but one knew that the antiquity of the firm and its weighty connexions stood behind and so one resigned oneself like longfellows good christian to a pious confidence in the things which are not what they seem mr plover applied to the difficulties of this immensely important new client that napoleonic method which resolves all complexities by annihilation seven hundred and fortynine said he dear dear now take my advice and make a bonfire of the lot and start afresh would that be fair said gilead only one can succeed you know said mr plover make it the seven hundred and fiftieth he sat back in his chair tilted his head and his glasses lost their balance seven hundred and fiftieth he mumbled crookedly behind their lenses yes said gilead calmly inquisitorial i venture to think i know the very man for your purpose said mr plover smiling with the glasses in place once more yes said gilead again his name is nestle said the lawyerherbert nestle he is a man of immense industry and capacity and at present out of a situation what was his last asked the client he was conveyancing clerk said mr plover to broker and borrodaile since in liquidation there was some question of trust funds and nestle was scandalously misused a man with clean handshe has my strong personal recommendation mr balm if that counts for anything with you it settles a difficulty said gilead rising he left mr plover preparing to draw out and sign several folio pages of cheques a task deputed to him by his partners which he greatly enjoyed and executed with the minutest care and precision ruling all the cross lines chapter i the quest of the sleeping beauty mr herbert nestle knocking confidently and entering softly laid the mornings daily post before his chief who had just entered and was pulling off his gloves anything especial asked gilead i have thumbmarked one said the secretary which seemed to me perhaps worth your personal attention the bureauknown as lambs agencywas already in working order and daily settling into its pace its operations so far had seemed wholly to justify its existence and its founder was satisfied during this first month of its being some score of deserving cases had been helped and almost as many shams exposed the world was happier and cleaner by that measure and for the future professional cadgers promised to grow shy of risking the inquisition of a body so merciless in its penetration behind which stood a force so mysterious in its origin and having apparently such inexhaustible funds at its disposal gilead kept his little private office on the floor above the agency and from that shrouded adytum issued the motive power to the mechanism below there he sat or thence departed unheard unapproachable an enigmatic formidable figure to his employs holding vast destinies in the hollow of his hand no one of them saving the privileged secretary was permitted to apply to him on general grounds and to his rare appearances in the offices was accorded particularly by the two lady typewriters a hushed deference almost religious in its character much of this was due no doubt to the halo of countless gold which surrounded him but indeed gileads charm of person serene passionless cleareyed as an angels and as coldly beautiful had at least its influence on the flutterings of susceptible hearts his establishment comprised in addition to the secretary and the two ladies half a dozen correspondents or bookkeepers and as many active agents sound men and sagacious whose business it was to visit and report upon the cases to them was entrusted the investigation of the oh please do help petitionsthe five or fifteen or fifty or fivehundred pound loanrequests for the saving of a home or the buying of a business or the stocking of a fashionable millinery or the settling of debts incurred through bridge or speculation or the enabling a sporting curate to purchase a motorbicycle or the shipping of a promising family to canada or the feeding of a clergymans sick aunt on jellies and port wine the plaints many from titled lips soon became susceptible to classification and were found generally weakest on the side which betrayed the most agonized derangement of epitaphs and the most fervent ejaculations the result in all ways was instructive as much in its revelation of the systematic fraud which battened on timid uninvestigating charity as of the pitiful flimsiness of the bulwark which stood between the light of social respectability with a name and a number on its door on the one side and the outer darkness with its obliteration of all personality on the other gileads heart often grew sick as this dissected stuff of craft and misery of shamefulness and shamelessness was submitted to his judgment but his comfort lay in the sanitary acumen of his bureau and so long as that continued to work unimpaired he had no intention of taking his hand from the lever the month so far as his individual quest was concerned had proved a dull one void of romantic incitement he received therefore his secretarys statement with some quickening of interest quiet and unemotional in his decisions he had satisfied himself that mr plovers eulogium on this man had been justified he found him acute resourceful penetrative energetic humanesuch a coadjutor as he could most have desired nestle virtually managed the agency on its practical side and possessed his chiefs full confidence his features and unjarring personality were pleasant things moreover to his master who was habitually fastidious in the matters of conduct and appearance the secretary was a very goodlooking young man in a fair boyish way and so gentle in voice and manner that one might never have guessed the spirit of determination which underlay that soft exterior in suggestion he was subordinate angel to the other though somewhat older and far more full of worldly wisdom but the only visible mundane feature about him was his spectacles gilead sat down in his padded officechair and crossing his legs easily consulted the paper lying on the desk before him indeed nestle he said which is it the secretary bending respectfully over ran a fresh whitenailed finger down the agony column and stopped it at a threeline advertisement lady young a victim to persecution seeks honourable employment to extricate her from pressing difficulties good typewriter and linguist address viatrix rufus cottage knights hill west norwood gilead read and considered his hand thoughtfully caressing his chin then he looked up you think it promising he said the secretary withdrawn a little deferred to his employer if i am right sir in interpreting your mood gilead reflected there has been a monotony i admit hitherto he said you differentiate this somehow from the others it is if i may use the expression sir manlyno cringing there are tokens of culture and the hint of persecution the mystery puts it in another category certainly it is a ladyand young you have misread me nestle said his master if you can hint that as an objection i should be a useless agent in this business were i constitutionally susceptible the sex has never more than an abstract attraction for me and any desire i may have to possess it is limited to its idealised presentments in art he returned to the advertisement frowning a little while the secretary murmured an apology presently he looked up with decision i will undertake he said this case in person you will of course allow no hint of the fact to escape you of course mr balm they spent the subsequent hour or two in discussing the business of the bureau and at two oclock gilead having lunched lightly at victoria station took a train thence for west norwood alighted there and enquiring his way he found himself in a decent suburban road which ascended at a steepish angle between a broken double line of houses detached or in ranks there were terraces some shops many raw modern villas a few large mansions of an older date standing in their own grounds and here and there contemporaneous with these a detached cottage or maisonette almost hidden behind the shrubs and foliage of its front garden reading rufus cottage upon the gatepost of one of these last situated high on the hill gilead turned into a tiny drive and rang the door bell of a little sober brownbrick house built after the sturdy architecture of the fifties as he waited he had time to observe that the scrap of lawn behind the shrubs was weedgrown and neglected and the general atmosphere of the place fuscous and wetsmelling like an overripe walnut and the next instant the door was opened by a weeping servant maid i am sorry said gilead chivalrous to all is anything the matter she was small and moist of the tweenie breed and her emotion had inflamed her little nose and shaken her cap awry she gazed at him openmouthed seeing an angel alighted on her step but she answered nothing i called about the advertisement he began tentatively but of course she caught at a sob to interrupt him i was to show anyone in as did o dear dear i doesnt know what to do the mystery it seemed was already crying on the threshold that was quite as he would have had it come he said i am here to help tell me what is wrong child a telegram come for her said the girl gasping and wiping her eyes on her apron and shed no sooner read it but what she gave a eave and fell down flat on the sofy and theres shes laid ever since you are speaking of said gilead my mistress answered the girl how long ago was that moren half an hour o dear and im all alone with her and i cant get her to speak or move and i doesnt know what to do hadnt you better run for the doctor the girl hesitated whos to look after her while im gone i will said gilead she gaped at him aghast blinking her swollen lids you she whispered then added please whats your name he told her something in the answer vaguely associating it with a sundayschool memory of peace and righteousness appeared to reassure her she backed against the wall to let him enter he found himself in a cool dark little hall having a door ajar and a flight of stairs to the left and a closed door in front this last the girl approached snuffling and on tiptoe and opening it softly revealed a pleasant greentoned room which gave through french windows upon a square of embowered garden she peeped fearfully round the dooredge hesitated then reemerged and beckoned the visitor there she is she whispered hysterically jest as she went down gilead stepped gently into the room it was quite warm and cosy and stilllike a bower almost to the little green pleasance beyond and in keeping with its vernal privacy it had its sleeping nymph she lay upon a green sofa like a waxen figure upon a property bank gileads first thought was of the lovely st amaranthe in the tussaud exhibition which had once haunted his childish dreams only the artificial figure had seemed to breathe more naturally than this there were here however the same beautiful immobile face the same rosepetal complexioncream just rounding into pink under the closed eyesthe same ripe perfection of form the same suggestion of eternal restfulness that other figure he remembered had always stood to his innocent mind for the embodiment of the sleeping beauty and here she was incarnated out of wax her dressof velvet or velveteen a deeper shade of green than the sofafell in a slumberous bloom of folds one milkwhite arm half buried under a coil of brown hair cushioned her head the other limp and motionless trailed its relaxed fingers upon the carpet whereon lay a telegraph form gilead stood some moments regarding the beautiful picture with the enthusiasm of a virtuoso it would be a black shame was something of his thought to let this fine work fall into the clutches of a vandal the terms of the advertisement were in his mind it looks like a cataleptic seizure he said to the girl is she subject to them do you know the tweenie shook her poor little watery noddle ive never known her do the like she said since i come here how long ago was that a week sir said the girl ive been with her ever since she took the ouse a week ago well he said youd better go for the doctor at once the words were hardly out of his mouth when the girl gasped i see her lids twitch shes acomin to it appeared that she was right some perceptible emotion stirred under the waxlike surface the flush of pink deepened in the rounded cheeks the suddenness of the change confirmed gilead in his suspicion these instant recoveries he thought are characteristic of the complaint he backed towards the door she mustnt find me here he whispered the shock might cause a relapse ill wait outside let me know by and by if she wishes or does not wish to see me even as he spoke a deep sigh issued from the sleepers lips and he went hastily from the room closing the door behind him he had not however lingered the most scrupulous of intruders ten minutes in the little cold hall when the girl came out to him radiant shed like to see you now sir if you please she said chapter ii the quest of the sleeping beauty continued gilead reentered the quiet little room with a feeling as if he were desecrating a woodland shrine as yet he could not associate that figure of immortal loveliness with the piteous vision of the advertisement he saw her risen to greet him all warm and flushed a maid yet seeming youngmotherly in the soft plenitude of her form with evidences of some suppressed emotion in her eyes her drooped right hand held the telegram she addressed him in a voice of sweet low embarrassment your visit i am afraid was badly timedfor me i am so sorry it has reference i understand to my advertisement in the daily post will you please tell me in what way she motioned him to seat himself and herself sank somewhat languidly upon the sofa she had just quitted i trust he began but she stopped him please do not speak of it it was a momentary recurrence of a seizure which had overtaken me once before and was due she paused to the receipt of a telegram he suggested gently she turned her head away then refaced him with a deeper flush on her cheeks i am quite recovered she said i am very much to blame for my weakness i beg you not to think me impertinent said gilead your servant volunteered the information she smiled a little wanly well it is quite true she said and i can have no purpose in denying it you must pardon me said the young man if i associate this seizure somehow with the persecution complained of in your advertisement she looked down twisting the telegram in her lap in an agitated manner yes she said in a low voice i must admit it have you the least objection he asked earnestly to giving me your name she hesitated a moment then raised her eyes to his steadily would it not be right for you to acquaint me first she said of the object of your visit here as always he answered with measured clearness to succour the unfortunate or unhappy a little irrepressible sigh escaped her naturally he continued you will ask my credentials is it possible that you have heard mention of lambs agency she shook her head slightly it was founded said gilead by a person having great wealth and a keen desire to apply it to the most helpful uses any wronged or persecuted innocence has a first claim upon it i may say my name is gilead balm and i represent the agency in this instance her eyes opened upon him wonderingly does such an institution exist she murmured i am very fortunate he bowed gravely the good fortune is ours madam where our purpose is vindicated i understand you she said you must guard against the wiles of the unscrupulous an exhaustive investigation is the only way he said that needs no apology she answered flushing a little i cannot be blind to the fact that the terms of my advertisement invited some comment i was indeed very distracted when i wrote it you will not then said gilead attribute to mere prying impertinence on my part a desire to ascertain the nature of this persecution whether to arm myself for your protection against it or or she interrupted him with a faint smile to form your own opinion as to the truth of my story as to our capacity for assisting you he corrected her staidly and courteously thank you for putting it that way she said quietly my name is vera halifax were i to give you the outlines of my history you would accept the statement as a confidence i am sure most certainly he answered i mean a personal confidence said the girl if you should desire it i do desire it if you please illchosen as were no doubt the terms of my appeal i never proposed to myself to enlarge upon them save to the sympathy which should seem to justify my trust by its practical sincerity you will understand me i am sure mr balm when i ask you how you propose to deal with my difficulties if convinced of their reality why how can i answer he said breaking into a smile until i know their nature she looked down toying with the telegraph form i should have thought she said that that mention of my poor accomplishments would have been sufficiently illuminating pardon me then he answered for being explicit you are threatened i am to assume with a loss of livelihood yes utter she said low very well he answered then you are to understand please that we will endeavour to compensate you in proportion as our estimate of the wrong you have suffered tallies with yours compensate she exclaimed i mean he said with all respect for your independence you shall work for your livingif you desire it at the agency itself she glanced at him swiftly and away there were signs of tears in her beautiful eyes i can only acknowledge such consideration such generosity she said with a full confession of the truth would you wish to hear it i seek it perpetually he answered and from many lips if it is an ugly truth here even yours shall not redeem it or win its pardon she blushed deeply and half averting her face held out to him the telegram which had been responsible for her seizure will you glance at that first she murmured you will not understand it but it will pave the way to an explanation he took the paper from her hand and read these four enigmatic words be prepared winsom wyllie winsom wyllie he ejaculated in astonishment looking up she shivered and gave a little gulp he is the cause he is the cause she whispered and appeared for the moment incapable of further speech and then suddenly she collected herself i must appear insane to you she said perhaps it is true that an exaggerated fear has unhinged my mind for the moment but i will tell you my story if you please he said and she began my mother died when i was quite young leaving me the sole charge of a preoccupied father he was a man of science devoted to the pursuit of insects and for the greater part of his life was engaged in procuring material for his great work on the butterflies of europe after my mothers death i was put to a school in cheltenham where i remained for a number of years forgotten but on the whole happy doing fair credit to my training and spending my holidays for the most part at the homes of the various mistresses when i was eighteen a chance visit to the cotswold hills reminded my father of my existence he was growing old and his eyesight dim and it occurred to him that i might prove useful to him in his occupation he took me from school and thenceforth i was his companion and assistant in his varied journeyings at home and abroad i had no other relation in the world and no fixed home but i confess i enjoyed the life with its freedom from restraint and its perpetual charms of change and openair employment my father as each specimen was captured was in the habit of sitting down and making on the spot an exact watercolour drawing of it to scale this work finding i had a natural facility with the brush he deputed to me as also much of the netting of the insects themselves at which being active and clearsighted i soon proved myself an expert i was quite happy and engrossed in my curious life until the day when there entered into it a stranger of an unusual and sinister cast his name was winsom wyllie she paused a moment in some agitation and putting her handkerchief to her lips averted her face yet a little more he professed a profound interest in the great work she continued presently and was indeed not a little forward in contributing to it he attached himself to us accompanied us everywhere and quickly made himself indispensable to my father who regarded his skill and courage with something approaching infatuation there was no rock so high no swamp so perilous but mr wyllie would dare it in pursuit of valuable specimens he seemed endowed with a demoniac energy to possess a charmed life he was wonderful i admit but there was always something about him that repelled me that made me conscious of an instinctive antipathy in his presence my dear father would habitually when possible revive and release the drugged insects after finishing with them mr wyllie on the contrary would strip off their beautiful wings with a savage zest or crush them between his coarse fingers into glittering meal he was a dangerous man and he always carried about with him pinned into the inside crown of his flattopped felt hat a dried specimen of the moth called the deaths head it was his piratical emblem he would declare and indeed it was a suitable one judge then of my horror and disgust when i came to realize as i did that his pursuit all this time was not of my fathers interests but of my fathers unhappy child her fair head drooped and she spoke in a lower voice i will not dwell upon the details of my discovery but will hasten to the conclusion unthwarted by my declared aversion confident in my fathers sympathy this man made no secret after his first avowal and repulse of his intention to possess me my father was blind to my misery and deaf to my protestations the other held him in complete moral subjugation i was at this time grown to be a woman and of an age to assert myself i was forming some wild scheme of escape when the blow fell that for a while deprived me of my reason one day my father having rashly climbed a cliffside in pursuit of a specimen slipped and was hurled lifeless at my very feet the shock threw me into a cataleptic trance from which i did not recover for several weeks that occurred in switzerland in the zermatt valley and when i awoke to my senses it was to find myself lying in a little hospice at st niklaus which latterly we had been making our headquarters and mr wyllie assuming the sole charge of my fortune and destinies i cannot describe the feelings with which i realized my unhappy orphaned position or the intensified horror with which i regarded this man now justified in some measure in claiming my gratitude he had devoted himself while i lay insensible to my affairs and my comfort and might have expected some acknowledgment but i looked upon him with an indescribable loathing which struggle as i would i could make but a poor show of concealing he was fully conscious of my attitude of course and finding all efforts to conciliate me useless brought matters very quickly to a crisis one day he asked me abruptly what i proposed doing for a living if i persisted in my refusal to join my fortunes with his i stared at him in amazement when he informed me with the utmost sangfroid that by a lately executed will my father had left him all his small fortune including the material for the book in trust for me provided that i married him within a year of the testators death and to him solely in the event of my rejecting that condition furthermore he acquainted me with the facts that a considerable undischarged debt lay to my discredit at the hospice that so far as he knew i was entirely without means and that if he came forward to assist me it must be on the express stipulation that i would give myself to him in pledge for that accommodation when he would hope to convince me in time of the wisdom and policy of my subscribing to the terms of the will mr balm i seemed to see in a flash the whole black depravity of the man more i remembered then that he had been on the hill with my father on the day of the fatal accident and in a fit of ungovernable passion and horror i denounced him to his face i accused him of having coerced my father into making the will and then in order to secure the permanency of its provisions of tempting my unhappy parent to his destruction i thought for a moment he would have killed me and then he answered i wish never again to invite a scene so appalling in its revelation of the secret abysses of wickedness utterly unnerved and overcome i stammered out some propitiatory phrases and escaped to my room my only thought my only hope was flight i had a sum of money in my possessionfor of late years my father had committed to me the business of our expenditureand with that and my small stock of jewels i stole out in the grey of the next dawn and made my way to visp i need not trouble you with the details of my flightits happy accidents and living apprehensions it is enough to say that i succeeded eventually in reaching london in safety the experience of my later life had taught me wisdom and caution and i was fortunate in keeping my head and my wits in somewhat bewildering circumstances i parted with my jewels for a fair sum and then wishing to remove myself as far as possible from the likely arena of my persecutors enquiries decided to bury myself in some obscure district of the suburbs where i could rally my small forces and think out the means to procure myself a livelihood my travels combined with my early studies had made me fairly proficient in several european languages and my father had always carried about with him for his correspondence a portable typewriter which i had soon learned to manipulate finally accident established me here where i have now lived in doubt and agitation for a little over a week she ended and for a full minute a profound silence succeeded her narration pardon me said gilead then there is something more the telegram she answered with a broken most pitiful sigh o mr balm i can only assume that ambiguous as i had supposed my advertisement to be he must have seen and profited by it to get upon my tracks it reached me only shortly before your arrival and upon its receipt i had a short return of the illness with whose first attack he had been so fatally associated he may be even here now close by somewhere in the neighbourhood she rose with the word in great agitation and stood holding her hand to her bosom gilead rose also i beg you to calm yourself he said what have you to fear from him fear she whispered with an awful significance ah you do not know him he will break me to his will no that must not be said the young man has this creature no permanent address indeed none that i know of she faltered and the will was indisputable quite i fear we might contest it upon the grounds of undue influence and in the meantime she gazed at him with her wide haunted eyes certainly the flowery lepidopteral ways had produced a very comely nymph yes she whispered you must come with me please mr balm she exclaimed in astonishment do you know what you say perfectly he answered quite selfpossessed by your own showing you invite your ultimate ruin by staying here the man is obviously a villain and if we cannot expose we can defy him i will make it my business to discover his whereabouts and to payoff your debt to him in the meanwhile a lady member of our staff will procure you suitable lodgings near the agency and any obligation you may owe to us it shall be in your power to discharge by way of services to our office tomorrow one of our agents shall visit here to make such arrangements with your landlord as are necessary for acquitting you of your agreement with him and to dismiss your servant you can trust to my absolute honour and sincerity in the whole matter it is for such purposes that we exist you will greatly oblige me by consenting she appeared genuinely moved and perplexed she could find no answer for some moments i dont know what to say she murmured at last say nothing he answered but if i may venture to suggest make a little bag of your immediate necessaries and come straight away with me the rest can follow while she was gone from the room a thing or two relative to the unreasoned extravagances of women did occur to him thus he thought they will when in dire distress and within sight of absolute penury rent a neat little furnished house and hire a servant when cheap lodgings would have served all their purpose but he dismissed the reflection as bearing too hardly upon the small worldlywisdom of one bred in comparative luxury without experience and very young in yearsprobably not much over twenty and for the rest he contemplated with serene gratification his return from his first romantic quest in company with this visible beautiful earnest of its success chapter iii the quest of the empty house man wanted immediately to assist in practical refutation of calumny apply judex raxes private hotel aldwych the above advertisement met gileads eyes a day or two after his adventure with the beautiful lepidopterist he fastened upon it at once i shall follow this up he said to the secretary what can a practical refutation mean nestle shook his head with a smile i really cant guess sir he said unless it refers to the argumentum baculinum gilead mused a little it says immediately he reflected i must go at once then or i shall be forestalled he rose and looked about him miss halifax enters today you understand he said upon her duties as my personal typewriter and amanuensis you will see that she is made comfortable here in my absence perhaps the ghost of a smile twitched the softspeaking secretarys mouth as he answered that his chiefs commands should be scrupulously obeyed gilead took a cab to raxes hotel and enquired at once for judex he seemed conscious of a twinkle in the right eye of the hallporter who took his name and of that of the boy who went off with it as if some telegraphic levity had passed between them but in a little the boy came back with a perfectly sober face and informed him that mr judex would see him he was shown upstairs into a private sittingroom where by a table sat a little old man shrewd and withered but of a very spruce appearance his eyes were piercing black his lips kept a perpetual chewing motion like a crabs a few threads of white hair clung to the barren slopes of his scalp but he was very neatly dressed in grey twill frockcoat and trousers with a shepherds plaid bow at his neck image imagesimgjpg caption a little old man shrewd and withered mr judex said gilead my name sir said the stranger you thought it a pseudonym no doubt now usher the exclamation was addressed to the boy who vanished i called in answer to your advertisement said gilead not unprepared for surprises be seated said the stranger the bright eyes bent upon him you are young and a gentleman i take note mr balm he said a hardup oneeh no not hardup what then a seeker after the truth said gilead i pursue it day by day through the columns of the daily post money is no object to me the little old man bent forward and eagerly scanned his visitor if that is so he said fortune could not have sent me a better coadjutor you are dispassionate disinterested wholehearted entirely said gilead the old man rubbed his palms gleefully together it is a providence he said it is to demonstrate a truth a momentous truth that i advertised for an agent may i ask said gilead what truth hushshsh said mr judex putting a finger to his lips with exaggerated gravity it lies to prove in the winecellar of number fortyone belgrave crescenta very deep and dark cellar gileads eyes opened a little but he sat calm and collected he thought he perceived that he had to do here with an eccentric not to say a daft old gentleman but if the quest was to bear fruit he must betray nothing of his feelings the other stretched out and put a soft impressive hand upon his arm have you a clean conscience he said i believe i may claim one answered the young man smiling no sense of guilt anywhere within nothing to trouble me exactly you are not afraid of being alone with your thoughts o no even in the dark even in the dark if you were consciencestricken on the other hand you might dread your own company unspeakably it is very likely i think especially in the dark i daresay so much so as to be urged to any means to escape it perhaps indeed said gilead i could not answer for myself under the circumstances mr judex threw himself back in his chair with galvanic quickness and a beaming face nothing could be happier he said delightedly it lies in your power to exonerate me from a very gross and cruel accusation so far as my conscious probity is concerned said gilead i am at your service the old man bent forward again and patted him three times on the knee meet me he said at nine oclockthis eveningoutside number fortyonebelgrave crescent for one moment gilead hesitated the oddity of the request the lateness of the hour named the suggestion of something sinister and uncanny connected with that abysmal crypt so darkly alluded to impressed him with a sense of some unseemliness in prospect which it would be wiser in him to leave unexplored what could possibly bear upon the refutation of a calumny in those obscure depths an aspersed bin he reflected with concern that he had no palate for bouquets a deceased butler an immured traducer like him in the terrific mr poes cask of amontillado nothing he hoped to do with buried corpses or concealed swag but in the end the spirit of the romantic quest decided him i will be punctual to the appointment he said and rose from his chair he returned to the bureau to find miss halifax already installed in his private office she struck him as looking a supremely attractive amanuensis and he congratulated himself on the good fortune which had attended his first personal venture if she should prove as sympathetic to his aims as she was grateful to his vision he would come to hold he told himself having the perfect feminine on one side of him and the perfect male on the other the most admirable balance between reason and emotion in fact he informed her so quite frankly and quietly and she blushed as she made a very pretty and modest acknowledgment of his kindness and of her determination to win his good opinion mr winsom wyllie is first down among my mental notes he told her i shall not forget him he went indeed that very afternoon to somerset house in order to ascertain if the will had as yet been proved but was unsuccessful in his search never mind he thought such a rapacious scoundrel will not be long in realizing his illgotten gains and in a very short time i fancy we shall be possessed of a clue he was as little inclined to effusive confidences as to senseless reticence but for some reason he told miss halifax about his forthcoming venture to his surprise she received his story with some signs of emotion i dont think it sounds nice she said i wish you would let one of the others go instead he looked at her kindly what do you doubt he answered my proficiency or my discretion or my savoirfaire none of these she saidor your courage or generosity forgive me and my presumption in offering advice so soon i should have thought said he smiling that the success of my first essay would have inclined you to a greater confidence in my judgment she seemed to hang her head a little biting her full lower lip i have no right whatever to speak she murmured only please please be on your guard trust me he said but timidity you must remember miss halifax never won to a vision of the grail she raised her head and looked at him a moment with shining eyes then returned to her work the evening closed in dark and sinister bringing with it black rushes of wind and sudden avalanches of rain gilead despatched a simple but recherch dinner at a choice restaurant and at twenty minutes to nine betook himself on foot to the rendezvous it was part of his principle to avoid every show of ostentation in his adventures he wished to decide them on their own exclusive merits and any confession of his resources would have tended to confuse the issues exactly at the hour appointed he stood battling with his umbrella outside number fortyone belgrave crescent the street in this stately district was almost entirely deserted at this midprandial hour the dark garden which contained one side of it stood not more lifeless in suggestion than the black housefronts opposite here and there a gaslamp winked in the driven tumult here and there a thread of light under a blind gleamed like a gold stitch in the curtain of night far up a solitary motorcar throbbed against the kerb the thunder of remote traffic spoke like a distant surge other token of human contiguity there was none in such a universal eclipse of things there was little to differentiate one respectable building from another wherefore the watcher was unable to draw any exclusively portentous suggestion from the gloom and silence of the house he faced it appeared like any other of its neighbours in the essentials of brown brick and closed shutters and the rain that plashed off its sills into the deep area was burdened with no exceptional sound of omen or melancholy the brass knocker was hospitably bright the antique extinguishers on the railposts of the steps were even suggestive of home and an asylum gained at last from obscure wanderings in the streets gilead moved closer to examine one of them faithful achates said a small voice at his elbow he started and turned about he had come up and upon him without a sound a little weird blown figure hopping under an umbrella like some oddwinged nightfowl his eyes gleamed like drops of ink he pinched gileads arm in a shrewd ecstasy while that young man momentarily paralysed stood speechless in truth the apparition had taken him from an unexpected quarter he had looked to mr judex for some reason to emerge from the house itself as they dwelt thus an instant a clap of wind took the little figure and seemed to blow it clean up the steps quick he whispered from that eyrie closing his umbrella i am pressed for time in all things these daysquick a little reluctantly gilead joined him pressed for time repeated the other bending and fumbling and my movements must be swift and secret this is excellently fine of you your reward shall consist in the vindication of a calumniated soul quick we will make straight for the cellar he was busy with a labelled latchkey as he spoke fitting it into the lock procured from the house agents he murmured my own key and my own house but they werent to know that the door fell open with the word revealing a cavern of chill blackness involuntarily gilead shrunk a little the other noticed and protested there is nothing to apprehendneither goblins nor conspirators he said you were quite confident as to the dark you know with a blush of shame gilead entered and instantly the little man shut the door softly upon them both and producing an electric lamp from his breastpocket switched on a spark whose tiny brilliancy hung in the gloom like a fencandle obscurely peopling its thickness but it was enough to reveal a desert of bare walls carpetless floors and lightless ceilings gilead after one look around addressed his companion firmly this is your house you say unquestionably it is emptyunoccupied but it is my house all the same the young man considered a deserted building a conceivably demented owner and the rest of the circumstances what was he to conclude he seemed to be on the verge of some disturbing discovery but it was his duty to himself and his bureau to proceed certain diffident tremors in him had of late weakened of their force he had enjoyed his incredible possessions long enough to evolve that sixth sense of omnipotence which is peculiar to plutocracy all risks appeared easily negotiable to him endowed with that fortunatuss purse luckily for the world as it happened the chances that tempted him were all on the side of chivalry and justice will you come said mr judex he went before treading softly and holding his lamp high overhead gilead followed as quietly through the empty hall to the head of the basement stairs and down them into a vortex of reeling night domestic catacombs rows of cobwebby bells disconnected gasmeters a remote gurgle of drainwater horrible secret suggestive of bloodchoked lungs labouring somewhere in the darkness a clammy smell of distempered walls and icy flagsall these things glimpsed or divined in passing were spectrally impressed upon his consciousness as he pursued the tiny jackolantern dancing before him into foundering glooms and then suddenly turning off into a deep alcove they had brought up before a door strong and solid standing slightly ajar with a great key in its lock the winecellar whispered his guide and he gingerly swung open the door and backed to the wall i await your solution of the problem sir he said will you oblige me by pronouncing upon it with a curious tingling in his nerves gilead entered at the other end if you will favour me said mr judex thrilling in the prospect of some unconscionable discovery gilead advanced an uncertain step or two on the instant the light went out and a heavy slam and snap at his back told him that the door had been shut and locked upon him he stood for some moments absolutely still and incredulous then turned in a labouring way and saw the intense darkness split low down with a faintest edge of light he stumbled towards it and found the door mr judex he criedmr judex a tiny chuckling laugh reached him from without how can i resolve the problem without light he pleaded conscious of a sudden moisture breaking out over his face and chest again the small laugh came to him followed by a voice darkness is the very essence of the problem mr balm i wish you to remain there entirely by yourself until the morning when i will return to release you mr judex why in gods name why mr judex he dwelt in anguish on the answer shall i tell you said the voice apparently after consideration i wish you no harmi wish you no harm whatever mr balm on the contrary in your mastery of fate lies my hope did you ever hear of mr justice starkey yes i am he mr balm and this is my house you will pardon i am sure the deception excusable and necessary under the circumstances i desired to demonstrate to the world the wickedness of its conclusions in holding me primarily responsible for the man maudsleys suicide confinement in the dark cell would i am convinced never drive a guiltless conscience to selfdestruction it remains with you if you have not lied to me to substantiate that truth somewhere in his racing thoughts gilead found and caught at a memory it was of a notorious recent case in which a prisoner sentenced to a term of penal servitude and too late proved innocent had strangled himself in the dark cell to which he had been committed for insubordination there had been considerable press comment on the matter when aired and mr justice starkey who had summed up flagrantly against the accused in despite of a strong presumption in his favour had met with some caustic criticism with the result that he had shortly after retired from the bench and withdrawn into seclusion into the seclusion of a madhouse thought gilead appalled and he has either escaped or been discharged from it such indeed appeared the fair presumption he leaned against the solid door gasping for speech i daresay the man he began and stopped he had been going to say was guilty after all but even in that crisis he would not commit his soul to a conscious untruth yes enquired the voice was unsophisticated unselfpossessed in the sense of educated reason he finished i admit that the cases are not parallel answered the voice the advantage is certainly on your side in that respect i would submit said gilead that the test to be adequate should be applied to a like unintelligence i am dogged and spied upon said the voice the time is too short and the risk of delay too instant a bird in the handeh and you make it your interest to pursue the truth i am sure you will surmount the ordeal triumphantly goodnight i shall be here again in the morning the thread of light went out gilead threw himself against the door yelling and battering but its jambs were solidly sunk in the brickwork and he barked his knuckles in vain pausing in the midst of his frenzy he heard a far distant boom as of the hall door shutting and knew that he was left alone immured deep down in the deserted house on the instant he recollected himself and with a violent wrench of will brought all his reason to bear on the situation to be buried for a few hours in a dark crypt what was there in that to appal an educated mind he tried to laugh but stopped aghast to hear his own voice in that tremendous silence it seemed to evoke somewhere a wicked response that was nonsense of course there was nothing inherently sinister in his position or his surroundings he was merely shut into the commonplace winecellar of a commonplace house let him consider the prospect and its obvious necessities the first was to forget himselfin sleep if possible that should be obtainable by a calm method of reflection he had not moved as yethad not dared to the blackness was gross terrific now all of a sudden he remembered his matchbox and with a sigh of relief felt for and found it opening it with infinite caution he fingered a couple of matches no more one on the instant slipped from his nervous hold and fell to the floor taking an instinctive step to recover it his foot trod out a little flare and explosion gone in a moment and only a single match remained to him he clutched it as a drowning man a straw should he nurse that little potential sparkkeep the moral of its consolation always between himself and despair better he thought to resolve at once the mystery of his prison than to torment himself with imagined terrors the match was a stout wax one giving himself no time for reflection he struck it and guarding the flame jealously held it aloft the cellar he found himself in was fairly deep but nothing out of the common stone bins pigeonholed all one side of it the other was the bare wall moving pallidly gilead examined all its brickedup length at the last moment he recollected the door and thinking to return to it and investigate the lock found the match burned low in his fingers only a second or two of life remained to it he was standing by the ultimate bin when he perceived a heap of sacking lying within it he dragged the mass hurriedly out and casting it on the floor observed a solitary bottle which it had concealed he had but time to grasp this by the neck when the match burned his fingers and with a gasping exclamation he dropped it and was in utter darkness once more feeling for the sacking he let himself down upon it hugging his find and now in truth he was committed to the ordeal with only a bottle for his companion he was a completely temperate man and in any case he had no idea what the bottle contained yet somehow the feel of its sleek sides was a solace to him unopened it seemed to cheer and inebriate as the presence of a jovial comrade might though fast asleep by ones side in a haunted house he patted it fondly and closed his eyes the blackness weighed upon them instantly and horribly he opened them with a start as if he had only emerged just in time from drowning waters but they took no comfort from that sightless recovery he strove to concentrate his thoughts on his interests his ambition even his gold it was all useless light he realized or at least some dilution of darkness was necessary to sane thought as it was to healthy growth without it all things stagnated and fed upon themselves the coffers of his banks might be bursting with his hoards they were impotent to buy him one moment of selfforgetfulness all his omnipotence could not command him a right ray of reason this will not do he thought it is childish and contemptible lying on his side he closed his lids again determinedly and straight with the action it seemed there was shut into his mind a torturing demon the innocent man it kept whispering to him failed for all his innocence to keep his reason no selfconscious probity can be proof for long against these supernormal conditions a hardened conscience could resist them more effectually he reviled the tempter hated him found himself suddenly listening to him with his forehead all clammy and his hands shaking to be goaded into strangling himself in this black and loathsome pit the thought was monstrous incredibleand it clung to him he sat up in a gasping panic he forced himself to repeat hundreds of lines and passages from memory presently he found that his tongue was running involuntarily into inanities and blasphemies and he stopped what on earth is the matter with me he reflected for the moment a redawn of sanity glowed within him his pulses slowed it is too utterly ridiculous he said aloud he rose to his feet and feeling by the wall went up and down up and down hoping to tire himself in a normal way but gradually he seemed to become conscious every time he approached the door of some evil invisible presence lurking outside the vast emptiness of the house above occurred to him with a horror even greater than his cell inspired they are trooping down he thought awfully to listen at my door who the they were only his excited imagination might say little by little he contracted his area until he was standing once more motionless by the heap of sacking solitary confinement in a dark cell is an unutterable wickednessan unutterable wickedness he kept repeating to himself then in a spasm of horror he turned and clawed blindly at the wall like a trapped animal he dared not go near the door again or he would have concentrated all his strength on one frenzied effort to burst it open but he had come to dread horribly the thought of evoking an uproar in that blind silence as long as he was quiet they might keep outside presently his legs seeming to give under him he sank down again upon his rough couch an hour went by in such mental suffering as he had never before experienced or conceived and then suddenly with a ghastly groan he pulled himself together and sat up i can stand no more he whispered and reaching for the bottle knocked its head off against the wall a gush of liquid came over his hand a stinging fragrance to his nostrilsbrandy thank god he ejaculated fervently and without hesitation put his mouth to the shattered edge indifferent to consequences and gulping once or twice replaced the bottle on the stones the potent stuff poured into his veins its fumes rose to his brain like any overtaken sot he toppled prone and lapsed into quick insensibility a cry in his brain a pertinacious worry of light in his eyes awoke him and he raised his head there were people in the cellarhis secretary miss halifax a curious stranger a police constable holding a darklantern the lady from whom the pitystricken exclamation seemed to have come stood one hand poised at her lips a little apart the secretary bent over him its all right sir he said hes caught thank god gilead with assistance staggered to his feet whatwhere he exclaimed wildlymr justice starkey ah said the secretary you know his name then he told me plain enough said gilead faintlyand his purpose but that was after hed locked me in how did you know how did you find me it was miss halifax sir said the secretary you told her about the appointment you know and the thing worried herworried her to that degree that in the evening she must come round to confide her fears to me i didnt like the sound of it myself and after consultation we decided to take a cab to raxes hotel and discover what we could about mr judex that was near ten oclock and we reached the place to find it in a commotion over the man himself it appeared that he had escaped from a private asylum at sutton and had eluded recapture until his own advertisement gave him away the attendants had been waiting for his return to the hotel and had nabbed him just before our arrival i stated our fears to them and sure enough on overhauling him they found in his possession the key of his own frontdoor which he had procured under his assumed name from the houseagents this gentleman representing the asylum we all came on together and engaging the services of a constable entered the house from a hint let fall by the madman we gathered that we should find you locked in somewhere down here and your snoring sir led us to the spot gilead with a faint blush glanced down at the telltale bottle he said it was his wish to demonstrate he murmured how the dark cell could hold no terrors for the impeccable conscience and how therefore arguing per contra the man maudsley must have been guilty of the crime for which he was sentenced the constable put in a word he went mad on it sir did his lordship the papers and his own conscience druv him off of his head thank you said gilead quietly and thank you too nestle he crossed with some sign of emotion to where miss halifax stood by the wall you advised me he said and i have had a fine lesson in selfsufficiency it is humiliating to have to own that i owe my reason such as it is to a chance bottle of brandy which i found in one of the bins but for that i am afraid you would have exhumed a gibbering idiot i shall think more mercifully of one form of drunkard for the future and less confidently of myself he turned if this gentleman he added courteously will favour me with his address i shall take pleasure in acquitting myself of my considerable obligations to him you constable will no doubt find an opportunity of calling at lambs agency some time during your offhours when a closed envelope will be put into your hands he bowed punctiliously to each offered his arm to miss halifax and waiting for the constable to lead quitted the place of durance chapter iv the quest of the dog gilead had often encountered in the daily postsandwiched say between a heartmoving appeal on behalf of the outcast and houseless and a last drowning cry for help from a soul almost submergeda plea for some dog or cat seeking a kind home and had reflected on the curious variety and varied quality of the petitions which a medium for benevolence was calculated to attract he hoped that those thus fondly appealing to charity for their animal beloveds were in the habit of scrutinizing the lists in which their advertisements appeared and of justifying their own title to help in one form by vouchsafing it in another but he believed he had always noticed that an excessive devotion to animals entailed a rather ironic attitude towards the needs of the human family and it was in no very sympathetic mood therefore that he read the first words of the following advertisement which his secretary one morning pointed out to him will anyone give a kind home to pilot a dog o please do help this is genuine no moneylenders need apply address judy marshlock old rectory shiptononthames why do you show me this nestle he said looking up excuse me sir said the secretary have you read to the end gilead bent to the paper again and smiled what a very odd advertisement he said is it nonsense or innocence do you think the secretary shrugged his shoulders slightly supposing we ask miss halifaxs opinion mr balm gilead said certainly and leaned back in his chair as the secretary carried the paper to the young lady who was engaged at her desk over correspondence do you take that for a hoax miss halifax the beautiful amanuensis read and considered no mr balm she said this was written i am sure by some distressed child whose people take in the daily post if it were a hoax some covering address would have been given gilead rose give me the paper please he said she smiled rather wistfully i knew the very suggestion of a child would win you she said he looked at her kindly it is your feminine perspicacity that wins me he said i cannot tell you how it touches me to find us all three in such accord over this business of humanitarianism and so superior in its pursuit to ignoble jealousies and misunderstandings that was a tribute to the secretary who had never shewn the least resentment over the ladys inclusion in the inner confidences of his chief nestle stood quiet a moment or two as gilead having spoken left the room and then moving softly addressed a word to the amanuensis she waved him away and he saw at once to his curious concern that she was crying gilead foreseeing a long day and a queer experience drove to paddington station whence he took a train presently to a distant upriver junction from which a short branch line carried him leisurely to shiptononthames it was a quiet torrid day in late april hot as the ideal midsummer and after asking his direction he started on foot across the fields for the old rectory which it appeared was situated at no great distance away on the banks of the river his path was a pleasant one remote and peaceful leading him by sweetsmelling pastures and lanes to a waterside hamlet where a scrap of churchtower ruined and ivygrown and a fragment of antique graveyard at its foot spoke of some ancient benefice long since discontinued or translated he was looking about in this sleepy retreat for someone to correct his way for him when a sound of youthful voices breaking out if a leafy road reached his ears and he saw two children a boy and a girl turn a corner and make in his direction he advanced to meet them can you tell me the way to the old rectory he asked the boy went on without answering but finding that his little companion had stopped embarrassed swaggered round and came back beg your pardon he said gilead repeated his question well were going there said the boy you can come with us if you like he was a meaty youth of some twelve summers with an imbecile selfsatisfied face and porky eyes but his stylish white flannels and little oxfordblue blazer with the yellow badge on its pocket spoke him quite the riverside dandy gilead fell into pace with the two and the little girl kept peeping up at him from the other side of her cavalier she was the dearest charmer of nine dressed in a sort of sweet directory frock with heliotrope sprays and the shepherds straw hat on her head had its mauve ribbon poked full of real daisies presently the boy shouldering his companion a little apart spoke something in her ear and she whispered back o georgy and flushed as pink as an appleblossom please she said being nudged to the soft impeachment georgy says he believes you must have come about pilot gilead smiled oddly enlightened the dog mentioned in the advertisement he said did you put it in no i did said the boy sniggering i say what a lark have you really come about him supposing i have said gilead what then the boy grinned but did not answer is this judy by any chance asked the young man yes it is said the boy your sister not much i say you know exclaimed the youth her names brown my names george wimble my fathers captain wimble we live at the court i only made it up for her and got old gask the stationer to send it on i see said gilead what was that about no moneylenders applying o i dont know said the boy you arent one are you no im not one i made it up out of the advertisements said master wimble they always put in that sort of thing i did it for her father said i might ventured the little girl between apology and selfdefence at leastways he said i might try and find a good home for him he didnt mean that way you bet said the boy glancing slyly up at the stranger no said judy her small mouth tightening a little when he saw it in the newspaper this morning he was simply furiated he is a very boracic man the boy stifled an explosion isnt she funny he whispered o boracic said gilead and added in some vague association of ideas is he a doctoro no a clergyman i suppose the boy plucked his sleeve hes neither the one nor the other he confided to his private ear hes a radical he spoke the word with a weight of social significance he stood for henley in the last byelection but our man beat him at the post he doesnt live here hes only taken the house for the summer he isnt a gentleman you know hes a radical but shes all right the magnificence of the distinction quite silenced gilead he walked on while the boy strutted on but suddenly he was moved very sweetly to feel little confiding fingers thrust into his please said the little girl who had slipped round to his side have you really and truly come about pilot really and truly said gilead looking down with a smile do you want to part with him no said the child flushing very pink perhaps someone else does suggested gilead yes father shall i see him about it then she did not answer whats wrong with himthe dog i mean asked the young man the boy answered for her with a contemptuous laugh he bit somebody anybody would have her gilead kept a discreet silence heres the gate of the rectory if you want to see mr brown said the boy stopping and then gilead saw that the little girl was in floods of tears he bent down very concerned if he has to go judy he whispered he shall find a good friend o dont be such a ninny said the boy whats a dog anyway im not going to go fishing with you you know if youre going on like this he walked off whistling she sniffed once or twice dried her eyes on her sleeve and fled after him gilead watching the two a moment turned through a gate into a leafy drive which swept round a semicircle of lawn to the front of a whitelatticed creeperhung house of two storeys where ringing the bell he sent in his card to mr brown he had not waited a minute in an untidy tobaccoreeking study into which he had been informally and rather suspiciously shown when a gentleman came hurrying in with an air of effusive cordiality which took him completely by surprise mr balm said the gentleman this is kind of youthis is more than kind to come in person to answer my appeal i had not expected such distinction such consideration and it makes me proud pray take a chair sir and let us discuss this matter gilead immensely perplexed bowed and seated himself he saw before him a fluffy fiery little man wearing spectacles like burning glasses and clad in a blazing rhubarb tweed with knickerbockers and bright brown shoes he was snappy in his movements jerky in his speech and in disposition he alternated it seemed between white heats of enthusiasm and dead ashes of depression your agency sir he said justifies its title to being the most prompt and princely institution of its kind i am favoured in a visit from its founder its representative corrected gilead mr brown raised his hands and eyes with an air of polite deprecation true he said we know your humour and respect it mr balm i say no more i am completely dumb well said gilead a little chilly as to the purpose of my visit sir i was led to suppose that thethe form of appeal somewhat lacked your sanction not at all said mr brown with a surprised look how could you have gathered that impression when i dictated its terms myself o i didnt know said the visitor i was misenlightened no doubtmade the victim very possibly of a trifling hoax he smiled then the little ladys name was an intentional mask i dont know sir what you mean by a mask said mr brown with some apparent heat it was quoted to illustrate a very genuine sentiment if you had said a bait i might have admitted the impeachment a bait then said gileadand a sweet one i am indebted to you for the term mr balm said the gentleman with a certain dry dignity but i can hold it hardly applicable to a personality endowed with such supreme gifts of force and intelligence i would as soon call the mother of the gracchi sweet sir for my part gilead felt himself at a loss for words could it be possible that the little girl so contradicted her appearance as to be an infant phenomenon of an advanced type well sir he said utterly at seaa bait of whatever nature you please in any case i am to understand its purpose was to find someone who would be willing to take this discarded pet off your hands mr brown rose from his chair sirmr balm he exclaimed to secure a kind home for it explained gilead whether because it is old or because it bites or mr brown seized up a heavy paperweight poised it an instant furiously and replaced it on the desk calmly i think i am sure he said that there must be some mistake gilead risen also faced him gravely would you mind telling me he said to what you are alluding all this time i am alluding sir said mr brown with sarcastic emphasis to the letter i had the honour of addressing to you yesterday and the substance of which i flattered myself you had come to answer in person my name is brown i am unfortunate said gilead i have much correspondence and a poor memory and a name however distinctive is apt to slip me i devoted i am afraid but a cursory examination to this mornings letters the penalty is mine mr brown bowed stiffly assuredly not sir since it seems i have appealed to your munificence in vain the misfortune sir said gilead is by your favour easily amended for both of us his courtesy was so charming that the indignant gentleman was instantly mollified you are very good he said your frankness invites a warmer confidence than that i had already ventured in a sacred cause you are acquainted no doubt with the name of mrs craddock flight gilead bowed of all the militant sisterhood said mr brown the bright particular star it was she if you remember who chained herself to the wheel of the prime ministers carriage just as he was about to enter it to drive to the house of commons and so forced him to seek his infamous destination on foot a woman of extraordinary resource and originality extraordinary said gilead if i recollect she was nearly killed by the horses becoming restive before she could be released she would have been glad to die sir said brown in that glorious situationa second st catherine broken on the wheel for her faith he looked at his visitor searchingly do not distress me mr balm he said by affirming that the cause is to be denied its share of the vast resources at your disposal no no you must be with us sir it was for that purpose that i wrote to you it was for that purpose that i identified myself in my letter with a name calculated to shed refulgence on any propaganda to which it should elect to give itselfthe name of mrs craddock flight that name sir and that cause lack nothing but the devotion of a sympathetic capitalist to ensure their immortality it was to that stately name that i questioned the right application of so sugary an epithet as sweet finally sir that nameif i may dare the confidencehas pledged itself to become on a single condition my priceless possession to adorn with its widowed lustre my no less widowed insignificance i confess sir that i yearn to bask in that reflected gloryto follow in the tail of its cometlike flight to the new world its radiance is destined to discover to the enraptured vision of posterity you allude said gilead i allude said mr brown to a world reconsecrated through the political enfranchisement of woman to reason justice and purity everything you will grant is wrong as it is civilization as a male imposition has proved itself a depressing failure men on true premises labour to false conclusions women on false jump to true their unerring moral sensitiveness penetrates all massed and complicated sophistries and pierces in a flash to the heart of the real unbiassed by formulas untrammelled by dogma they will blow through our corrupt institutions like a cleansing gale whirling the dead leaves of discredited systems before them woman is not conscientious so to speak in the prescriptive sense she will strip from equity justice and the moral law the trappings in which they have been too long confounded and show us nature again primitive and fearless indeed said gilead you surprise me there will be many surprises when the time comes said mr brown grandiloquently and on the very word suffered a surprising change of countenance why why he cried flushing scarlet my lettermy letter sir in which i expatiated at some length on this very subject you have not seen it you say to what then am i to attribute the honour of your visit to an advertisement sir said gilead quietly about a dog the effect of his words was startling mr brown seemed to burst at the head like an overcharged bottle of gingerbeer and thence to spout a volume of incoherent expletives he then as if impelled by some uncontrollable emotion went racing up and down the room until the pressure slacking he gradually slowed and finally came to a stop opposite his visitor the steam so to speak all out of him i see it all he said in a state of the limpest depression by an irony of circumstance scarce credible the sympathies i sought to engage have been forestalled by my own child in a trivial matter by a young friend of your child sir if i am correctly informed said gilead kindly you mean the boy wimble said mr brown bitterly no doubt sir your information it was at first hand put in the visitor smiling i met the young people outside and got into talk with them the boy he himself confessed to me composed and inserted the advertisement the grotesque impertinence of it cried mr brown boiling over the assurance and the inopportuneness i understand said gilead that you authorized the little lady to find if possible a home for the animal go on sir go on said mr brown resignedly tell me that i authorized her to hold her father up to ridicule before the world nay sir said gilead i am quite at sea in the matter i will acquaint you mr balm said the father dismally with the facts of the caseespecially as they bear in some measure on a confidence i have already reposed in you mrs craddock flight sir made it a condition of our union that the dog should be destroyed it was the single condition to which you referred i assume said the visitor may i venture to ask what suggested it the dog had bitten her sir they will take these unaccountable aversions it was during a short visit she lately paid us pardon me said gilead if i enquire if your little girl is not very attached to the animal there is no denying said mr brown that judy is devoted to pilot and pilot to judy it was on that account that i was moved to sanction the compromise of a new home in which compromise i have not the least doubt mrs flights superior reason will acquiesce particularly when she is informed of the character of the applicant gilead bowed may i see the dog he asked mr brown shrugged his shoulders and threw up his hands in a manner of patient repudiation with pleasure he said and evidently without the least we will go at once he led the visitor out by a back door across a fair but neglected lawn through a space of untended kitchen garden and so down to the river bank where by some water steps and a little boathouse stood a dogkennel of considerable dimensions and straight on the sound of their approach there issued from this last with a rattle of iron links a magnificent newfoundland gilead exclaimed but he is superb i am quite astonished his value mr brown the master was engaged in releasing swivel from collar the beautiful dog fawning and delighted made up to him endearingly judy i am sure said judys father in a suppressed voice would never dream of making a transaction of her pet yes theres your little mistress boy the great dog released went bounding joyously and sniffing riverwards there was a punt out there in midstream and a small meaty boy was upright in it endeavouring to find soft bottom for fishing purposes with one of its poles a little girl in a flowered hat sat in the stern it seems a harsh necessity said the father in a voice which made gilead approve him for the first time but the cause sir the cause is paramount gilead quite fascinated called to the dogapproached him at that instant there came a shrill cry from the father sit down judy sit down my god there was an answering screech from the river a splash the small boy slipping his hold in a panic went down among the thwarts and the punt leaving its pole sticking in the mud began to swing downstream judy in anguish of the scene enacting on the banks thinking to see her pet ravished away before her eyes had stood up and blind with grief had lost her footing and tumbled overboard she could not swim neither of the men could swim the boy in the punt nerveless and blubbered was worse then inept a dreadful moment of paralysis followed and then two little arms and a draggled head came above the surface image imagesimgjpg caption a soft seallike head was seen driving across the shining flood gilead in agony stumbled for the boathouse the father sobbing and staring was already waistdeep in the water my little child he gaspedmy little childthere went by them both a great bound and surge and swift and unerring a soft seallike head was seen driving across the shining flood they stood like things of stone hardly breathingand then there came a swirl a reasoned snap and the little face wild and choking was lifted above the surface good pilot loyal and lovely friend he brought her crying to the steps and there having deposited her shook himself and crouched somewhat appealing as if he had taken a liberty the little girl wellfrightened but unharmed was asleep upstairs the greater dog lay blinking on the hearthrug gilead by his hosts particular desire delayed his departure yet a little very few words had passed between them and the young man was considering with what manner of blessing he could best terminate a visit whose prolongation in view of the subdued and obviously selftormented figure before him seemed an impertinence when a ring at the bell sounded through the silent house and its master was presented with a telegram its perusal appeared to act upon him like an instant and amazing stimulant he rose his spectacles seemed to glare his head to bristle patently on the verge of an explosion he stepped across to gilead with an exaggerated softness and laid the paper before him oblige me by reading that he said the young man wondering obeyed have just seen advertisement either the dog must be destroyed or our compact ends answer prepaid isabella gilead looked up yes from her said mr brown still with an icy quietude in answer to the mute enquiry and then the burst cameonly a little rent at the outset but rapidly roaring to a breach now isnt that just like a womanwithout reason or justice or decencymere venomous spite indifferent to the consequences to others so long as it can injure the object of its resentment sympathy nonsense tell me why in the university boatrace on this river nine women out of ten will be cambridge out of pity for its persistent illsuccess not in the least sir simply because they think the colour the more becoming the breach widened consistency bosh with minds the sport of any chance mood veering as the compasschangeable as the weatheryou may forecast em fair in the morning and be drenched or frozen by em in the afternoon the breach split resoundingly principles lunacy their one indestructible principle is vanity and in their wild rush for personal notoriety of any sort all principles and all decencies may go to the devil the breach with a roar rent from hem to hem from this moment i repudiate the cause shouted mr brown glaring and dancing from this moment i refuse to identify myself with a sex so utterly deficient in the moral sense votes for women not unless we wish to see our national character for reason and fairplay thrown by the board not unless we wish to see our most cherished institutions of order and justice degraded to the uses of irresponsible malice incapable of governing even themselvesa set of chattering harpies lusting for the blood of heroes he ended with a roar gilead rose to his feet the maid is waiting for an answer sir he said and indeed the poor girl stood as if petrified give me the paper yelled mr brown he snatched it from the young mans ready hand slung out a pencil from his watchchain dabbed at the reply form fuming and sputtering image imagesimgjpg caption he dabbed at the reply form fuming and sputtering the dog must die must he he panted ironically my child must be sacrificed to a swollenheaded harpys caprice a useful lesson i thank you madamand he dashed off the following message gilead had the assurance to glance at it as he handed it to the girl offer declined the dog remains with me theophilus a minute later gilead being assured of the departure of the telegraph boy took his own with much satisfaction leaving mr brown fondly stroking the head of the great dog as he lay upon the rug chapter v the quest of the marble statuette gilead the most disinterested of utilitarians had no sympathy with that order of state socialism which would deprive all personal effort of its motive and initiative by illegalising private capital on the contrary he perceived in individual wealth the drivingwheels to an immense multitude of lesser parts which without that stimulus would move sluggishly or not at all theoretic equality was no doubt a beautiful vision only as long as man should go lacking the eight beatitudes he did not believe it a practical one disorder was the order of the human race and that being so no monotonous perfection once attained would long be suffered in peace it was the way of the world which builds on change and destruction and will always of choice prefer the excitement of a picturesque and dangerous situation to the security of a tame one now while exhibiting in himself as complete a justification of capital as the world could afford gilead had by no means any qualms about spending his money exactly as he pleased he was a young man of cultivated and artistic tastes and these tastes he did not hesitate to indulge liberally he had taken a set of rooms in the albany and was much interested in their equipment on a certain occasion he spent three whole days hunting japanese colour prints with an art expert whom he much employed without once going near the agency but on the fourth he recovered the thread of his duties herbert nestle having as usual placed a copy of the daily post before his principal stood by to await his comments one soon followed propos the following advertisement which gilead read out aloud young lady urgently in need of financial assistance to avert ruin every enquiry courted no securities but will repay honourably by installments address daily post i think said gilead i shall make this my personal affair he looked across at miss halifax who conscious of the implied challenge answered evenly but with a slight flush on her beautiful cheek losses at bridge probably or motor fever granting that it sounds plausible mr balm she was by this time an experienced and perspicacious gileadite why i think so too said her employer the little bait she ventured is the only questionable part bait what bait she might have omitted the young you see said the amanuensis people may construe it into an invitation to a personal interview well what harm then miss halifax turned one instant to him and looking down again without speaking resumed her work he sat with his eyes fixed on her her sympathy and sweet reasonableness were generally so dependable that this sudden confession of the feminine sting in her a little surprised him he did not like to think of it as wilful his admiration for her was very great and sometimes disturbing to himself she had taken latterly to a black dress as most becoming her official position and the contrast it made with her creamy neck and flowerlike face and lovely hair was sometimes dazzling he found it often difficult to dissociate the beauty of her soul and body or to estimate from which she drew her greater attractiveness he went out almost immediately and without another word and the moment he was well away the young lady turned on the secretary why did you let him see that advertisement at all it is its third appearance in three days answered nestle and i judged it no good to keep from him what he had probably already noticed what is it you fear he took a calendar containing a scrap of mirror from the mantelpiece and put it down before her face she pushed his hand away with a peevish shrug of her shoulders and he laughed and went off about his business in the meanwhile gilead had taken his way to the business offices of the daily post where he made an enquiry at the desk appropriated to the reference number advertisements i desire said he to be put into communication with this and he signified to the clerk the appeal already quoted image imagesimgjpg caption i desire to be put into communication with this the man accepted it with a profound deference gilead was well known at the bureau and the privileges accorded to incalculable wealth with a known tendency to giving were always his without the asking the editor himself would have rejoiced if personally approached to put his entire resources at his disposal but the young plutocrat with a very proper pride of fitness would allow no claims of his own to ride at any time superior to the ordinary claims of courtesy or goodbreeding somewhat to his surprise the clerk having rapidly scanned the item leaned forward to invite his ear to the opening in the brass wire netting which divided him from the public theres the advertiser herself mr balm he whispered standing by the swing door he signified the entrance into the street this atrium to the great establishment was extensive and glossy with mahogany and brass counters ran down either side of it and its doors were as imposing as a banks by one of these stood a slight young woman awaiting apparently the termination of a sudden shower which was deluging the streets she made a quite insignificant figure among the many that thronged the hall one word said gilead she has been to enquire about answers i suppose were there any not one mr balm gilead nodded and turned away a slight smile was on his lips the bait he was thinking does not appear to have been a very killing one at that moment the young lady moved pushed at the swingdoors and disappeared into the open gilead following started in pursuit and very quickly overtook her she went before him down fleet street into the strand and at wellington street turned to cross the bridge she walked fast and he had enough to do to keep pace with her it was still raining and it struck him as curious that although she was quite daintily attired she never seemed to think of opening the umbrella she carried in her hand the fact gave him a qualm and in some way prepared him for the scene to follow about the middle of the bridge he was delayed by a momentary pressure in the foot traffic and darting round and beyond the obstruction suddenly saw his quarry in the grasp of a policeman the next instant he formed one of the group sympathetic and protective she was going over constable he whispered is that so the man recognized him at once he was known to half the force i see it in her eye mr balm he said shed have gone the next moment he held the girl by the elbow and gilead saw her face for the first time it was youth stricken into instant age white stunned breathless she made no effort to speak or escapeindeed she could not the strung nerves had snapped at a touch and she was paralyzed ill make myself responsible for her said gilead quick we mustnt let a crowd gather the constable prompt man bent down to the half blind half deaf young face youre took bad missy he said you arent yourself now you just go with this gentleman wholl do you more good than all the doctors in the world he held her spoke to her shouldered away an overofficious bystander or so and stopped an empty fourwheeler all with that comprehensiveness of resource which characterizes the london policeman in another minute gilead was rolling away in charge of his poor little capture he did not address her for some time not until cowered into her corner she suddenly gave a moan and put her hands before her face and then he spoke in the voice that was like his name you mustnt be frightened you mustnt mistrust me i had come to answer your advertisement to offer you help when you were pointed out to me and i followed you now the help is very nearas near as the end of your trouble i am sure she appeared to listen but no power was yet hers to answer i know said gilead i know some misery someones wickednesswe have many such cases and i know i am going to take you where you will find rest and sympathy and strong wills to back you you must just believe me and not speak a word he had his intention formed and drove straight to the luxurious little flat situated in the neighbourhood of victoria street which his princely liberality had enabled miss halifax to take and furnish he desired to retort upon that young lady with the fruits of her own scepticism and to make her goodhumouredly answer for it by succumbing to the bait which she had erstwhile depreciated arrived there he delivered his charge now partly recovered but dazed and inclined to tears to the liftporter with orders that he was to convey her to miss halifaxs rooms and there keep her under unobtrusive observation until his return having done which he returned to his office and confided the whole business to his fair amanuensis now said he i know nothing personally about the attractiveness of the bait but i am very sure that no appeal is necessary to you to swallow it with a perfect grace i have asked no questions and penetrated no secrets why should i when in the loving sympathy and understanding of one of her own sex she could seek the confidence which it would have been only an unjustified impertinence in me to offer she looked at him with her eyes shining i think mr balm she said softly that the quest of the holy grail is still inspiring some knightly spirits in the worlda cryptic utterance which he could not quite interpret they lost no time in returning to the flat she addressed her lovely face to him on the threshold i believe she said smiling that you have never once yet condescended to visit the beautiful home which i owe to your kindness i merely found the setting for a thing of value he said with perfect sincerity i can only say that it seemed to me when i first went over it something less than an adequate acknowledgement of your great services to the office she sighed a very little sigh and they entered the lift together he never had a doubt of the solace he was bringing to the poor little life above with its broken wings and indeed the instant the child saw vera enter she rose and standing breathless a little with her face like a white wet flower threw herself suddenly into the warm generous arms and abandoned herself and her cause to that lovely refuge gilead turned away and while he stood thus he heard the first words of understanding uttered and of reassurance and of mastering control then a door shut and he was alone in the room he was quite satisfied and prepared to await developments as long as necessary the appointments of the room pleased him extremely he had hardly expected such taste remembering the norwood villa but that he reflected had not represented miss halifaxs independent views here all was simple and harmonious straight lines and flat tones with rich sombre gleams of brass and pottery for their sole emphasis the only photograph blest deficiency that was visible stood on a sheraton bureau in a dusky corner by the window venturing to inspect it gilead discovered to his concern that it was one of herbert nestle he shrank away as if he had unwittingly surprised a secret an odd pang shot through his breast he turned and stood for a long while staring at nothing out of the window and then he came about with a grave smile and a resolve in his heart why should i wonder he thought and still more why should i grudge it it would be after all an ideal union of interests and there is no reason why it should separate us on the contrary it might very well cement our partnership i will certainly use my best unobtrusive efforts to promote the match when miss halifax returned to him which she did only after a pretty long interval he received her with a manner of courteous distinction which as eschewing all claim to familiarity evidently surprised and disturbed her she looked about her for a reason and being astonishingly quickwitted instantly divined the right one she bit her lip and went a trifle pale but immediately controlled herself and proceeded to the matter in hand i have heard the whole story she said it has made my blood boil mr balm the poor little thing heaven certainly sent her her protecting angel to retort upon a villain no said gilead perfectly unconsciously the retort is my business tell me as much of the story as is necessary to my taking action in the matter there is nothing to conceal answered miss halifax save she flushed a littleones natural disgust in handling a reptile his victimor his intended victim thank goodnesshas been candid to me with the candour of a child i have completely won her confidence and trust she is asleep now quite worn out i shall keep her with me mr balm until you have decided upon the course you will pursue with her gilead bowed with his eyes kindling of course he said i knew if i ever found myself mistaken in you miss halifax i think i should close the agency and abjure my whole faith in human nature she looked down wreathing her fingers in her lap for some moments she seemed unable to proceed the child she said at length with a resolute effort at selfcommand is no more than eighteen her name is clarissa snowe she is an orphan these two years during which time she had kept until latterly a little post of nurserygoverness in a small family at clapham some two or three months ago however her health broke down and she had to cease work for a while on her recovery she failed utterly failed to secure a fresh situation she is very pretty as no doubt you noticed she paused gilead shook his head i was thinking of her misery poor soul he murmuredand employers continued miss halifax especially of domestic labour do not favour attractiveness of that sort clarissa had her little lodging in battersea and there she cherished a few heirlooms which had descended to her from her father who in his turn had inherited them from his with these owing to her unhappy situation and the debts she had incurred during her illness she was obliged to part one by oneand no doubt at absurdly small figuresuntil there remained to her of them all only a single marble statuette of a child with a bird she had kept this to the last as her father she knew had always referred to it as a thing of value but now urged by desperation she resolved to sell it somebody recommended to her globesteins the great art dealers in chalk street piccadilly and thither she bore the statuette in a cab gilead nodded i have had some considerable dealings with mr globestein he said he is one of the first experts in london and one of the greatest cheats and villains cried miss halifax indignantly i hope mr balm you had someone to advise you gilead smiled it is very possible you are right he said but as there is no morality in art you can hardly expect it in its dealers did miss snowe inform you of the name of the sculptor of this statuette yes it was pigalle or something of that sort pigalle indeed and mr globestein bought it of her for ten pounds gilead wincedin his lips and frowned and nodded o cried miss halifax if it was as i suppose a wicked fraud that was only the beginning of his villainy mr globesteinwho is it seems unmarriedafter asking the poor thing a few penetrating questions suggested that she should become governesscompanion to his motherless children she consented of course happy beyond measure over her good fortune and removed her small belongings to his private house there were no children there and she was put off from day to day with plausible accounts of their present absence and soon return the rest i may hurry over once secured in his home this man persuaded her to take occasionally a hand at cards with himself and some of his friends she lost of course he advanced her money at length things reached the point at which he had been aiming and he had her completely in his power it was ruin for her either way he threatened gilead put up a gentle hand spare yourself the pain she was good she was desperatei understandand as a final resource she decided to implore the help of strangers through the public press the barrenness of the result the inhuman silence drove her in the end to her last chance of escape through selfdestruction i hold the child a heroine great god the stony indifference of the world to her appealno wonder it killed her heart this man is a particular scoundrel he shall bleed miss halifax he shall bleed i promise you she did not know actually if he implied a moral or a physical bloodletting and she did not care he was to her like a god whose decrees were never to be questioned if he had killed and said this is just she would have believed him she rose as he did and looked at him with her bosom heaving and without another word spoken by either he left her a few minutes later he telephoned from his private office for his art adviser to come and see him at once dexter he said when that gentleman was closeted with him what is the market value of a statuette by pigalle marble mr balm yes if indisputable and his best work anything from one to two thousand guineas and upwards an example not so long ago fetched three thousand guineas at public auction globestein has lately secured one for ten pounds i want you to bear that in mind i will not forget it mr balm it is quite likely the man is a clever rogue very well now come with me to his place they found mr globestein in he came hurrying all smiles to greet his most distinguished patron his rooms were luxurious caves of treasuretrove to the gathering of which he had sacrificed whatever conscience he had once possessed he was a tall blackmoustached man neither illlooking nor ostentatious in dress but if anything somewhat over glossy in appearance he gave one the impression of having rubbed shoulders with gentlefolks to the extent of acquiring all their superficial polish and nothing more his nose was fleshy his lips were a little gross there was a suggestion in his smile assured but a trifle sickly of a challenge to justice to prove a case against him mr globestein said gilead i have been told that you have a statuette by pigalle for sale is that so tell me plainly i desire no huckstering he the prince of courtesy could be unmerciful to baseness he treated this famous expert with a haughty intolerance which should have closed all dealings on the spot it is perfectly true mr balm said the dealer smoothly there is no reason why i should deny it you know best sir answered gilead you will let us see it if you please mr globestein conducted them into a further room enriched like the other and led them to a pedestal on which stood a little marble figure of a girl with a bird settled on her uplifted hand they all stood silent by it for a while well dexter said gilead presently unimpeachable answered the adviser and a first example mr globestein laughed you do me proud mr dexter sir he said with a shadow of mockery in his voice i was really afraid you were going to impugn my judgment the adviser came erect with a smile surely mr globestein he said you should be the last to recommend the buying of a pig in a poke enough sir said gilead tell me if you please what is the price you ask for this the dealer shrugged his shoulders slightly and extended his hands pigalles he said are scarce and costly mr balm they rarely very rarely occur i could not in justice to myself ask a penny less than three thousand guineas it is too much mr globestein sighed shrugged again and said nothing it is too much i say i will not deny mr balm said the expert that your patronage and good opinion are of the first importance to me i will make a concession to them unprofitable enough to me but i will trust to you to make it up in other directions you shall have the statuette for three thousand guineas less the shillings the exact price i gave for it you will let me have the statuette for the exact price you gave for it that is so mr balm dexter said gilead you mark that the adviser answered in the affirmative wondering what was to come gilead went to a desk produced a chequebook wrote out a cheque and handed it to the dealer mr globestein accepted the draft obsequiously glanced at the amount smilingly started imperceptibly and paled obviously this is a pleasantry mr balm he said in a jocular voice that quaked somewhat your cheque is for ten pounds only image imagesimgjpg caption this is a pleasantry mr balm he said the exact price sir you gave for the statuette he rose frowning in the sternness of his anger and the dealer in the very effort at a protest cowered and shrunk silent before him perhaps sir said gilead it may have occurred to you by now that the nature of the task i have set myself brings me acquainted with the secrets of many underhand dealings this morning was fortunate in revealing to me the destined victim of a piece of quite unexampled cupidity and basenessyour own it need not concern you to know how but it may to learn that a certain young lady has found the friends and protectors of whom she stood most sorely in need you may refuse to permit me to remove this statuette which is most surely mine on your own undertaking in that case i shall take particular care to acquaint the world of the nature of your dealings with what effect to yourself coming from such a source you may judge if on the other hand you are wise you shall still possess the opportunity to reacquire by private treaty if you wish and at the figure at which you implied it was worth your while to obtain it the object in question you shall have mr globestein the statuette back at the price of three thousand guineas or you can cancel all obligations by accepting this cheque for ten pounds here and now which is it to be mr globestein speechless and white to the lips could only wave his hand renunciatory towards the pedestal dexter said gilead have this carried down and oblige me by calling a cab he returned with perfectly recovered serenity upon the dealer mr globestein he said you must permit me to congratulate you on the acumen which still does not fail you in a deal you need not fear that i shall abandon you in your need of a prosperous customer in your line you are invaluable and no one would dream of accusing you of attempting to palm off upon inexperience a sham pigalle but in morality you are no expert and it would do you no harm to take a lesson or so from much humbler individuals now it may interest you to know that i shall very probablyalways granting you the first refusalretain this statuette for my own while investing in the name of its former possessor a sum equal to your highest valuation for the rest it is quite likely that i shall be visiting you on business in the course of a few days what a pity it is that you do not interest yourself in japanese prints i am investing quite a sum in koriusais and haronobus and yeishis and the rest i wish you a very good morning mr globestein good morning mr balm good morning sir said the dealerand thank you chapter vi the quest of the rosering i wanted old parrakeet skins in particular the roseringed description green plumage black band extending from chin nearly to nape rosecoloured collar length about inches a fair price given for all and suitable apply a lower marsh westminster bridge rd herbert nestle the astute the resourceful stood questioningly behind his principal as the latter ran through the above advertisement submitted to his consideration gilead looked up with a slightly puzzled expression certainly an odd requirement nestle he said but what do you see in it nothing indeed sir answered the secretary but its oddity it is a somewhat strange thing that the identical advertisement is repeated in another part of the paper under the usual wants heading the demand for parrakeet skins especially for one description of parrakeet skins should be urgent are they the vogue miss halifax tells me not signallynot more than any other attractive plumage nor rare and costly no i think not but of course i know little about such things well nestle one might imagine sir that it was not parrakeet skins in general but one parrakeet skin in particular that the advertiser had in view the roseringed you see is the only one described in detail perhaps it is the most marketable yes sir perhaps you do not think that that is the reason no frankly sir i do notnot a sufficient one to account for the distinction what is then ah that sir i cannot guess an inquiry might yield a very ordinary solution or it might yield a surprising or even a dramatic one things have been quiet of late i thought no more than that here was a possible opportunity for you well i am obliged to you nestle i will think it over gilead cogitated the matter in fact until he quite kindled to its possibilities it looked trivial enough on the surface to be sure but by now he had had a sufficient experience of the tragedies often hidden under the blandest masks of commonplace at the end of an hour he separated folded and put in his pocket the front page of the daily post and leaving the office took a taxicab for the natural history museum at south kensington where he enquired for a certain assistant keeper in the ornithological department who happened to be a personal friend of his dereham he said abruptly after an exchange of greetings please to tell me about the family of parrakeets their names and their points mr dereham laughed he was accustomed like many another of gileads intimates to regard the young plutocrat as the most courteous admirable and lovable of cranks o certainly he said and reeled off a string of names there are the blue mountain the crimsonfronted the jerryang the ground parrot the dulang the coolich the familiar budgerigar the kings parrot head neck and body scarlet tail shot black and green the new holland with a yellow crest and greybrown body the alexandrine the roseringed green with a red collar and black stock the stop thats the one i want o indeed is it rare not in the least i mean any reason for attaching an especial value to it or to choice specimens of it none whatever its a quite common species where does it come from o india and the malay archipelago and thereabouts could i do you think procure a specimen of itunstuffed its skin i mean dozens i have no doubt any taxidermist could do your business thanks immensely dereham im sorry to have bothered you dont mention it whats in the wind now gilead laughed shook hands and bolted a couple of days later he walked into lower marsh street with a brownpaper parcel under his arm it was a dreary depressing morning brown grease under foot and brown fog in the air the street from its appearance might have been sinking into the ooze and slime of the old lambeth marshes from which it took its name the basement windows of its houses were blinded with mud a steady precipitate of soot descended upon it from impenetrable glooms the moist squalor of the scene the low unclassified shops the shambling traffic and half stealthy half sinister aspect of a majority of the populace wrought sombrely upon the young mans spirits it was in such places he reflected that the breed of human carrionflies was hatched swarming to poison civilization out of these bodies contaminate and decomposing carcases of houses a sense of foreboding was already on him as he paused in front of a seemingly unoccupied shop and read written on the headboard over its closed door and empty window a j jenniver clearstarcher a of all trades the least appropriate one might have thought to the district gilead hesitating a moment looked about him it came to him suddenly how empty the street was of policemen he had not remembered to be sure its contiguity to the new cut he was standing in the close vicinity of penny gaffs and penny dreadfuls of the indigenous coster and the cosmopolitan flatcatcher of brokers shops sunday trading chronic drunkenness buffetted faces and vice in its most sodden aspect but if the realization gave him a thrill it left his nerves unshocked he was always imperturbable in his unselfconscious sanctity of motive he felt his strength to be as the strength of ten because his heart was purethough he did not like sir galahad applaud the fact in the first person now suddenly as he stood indetermined and wondering if after all this quest was proper to his custom the door of the shop opened and there appeared in the aperture the figure of a young woman speaking back as she emerged to someone within yes same place as the other doddington grove i say i must hurry solong georgy she ran outa slight anmic girl a sempstress by her pallor soberly dressed but elaborate as to her head and low as to her neckand with a wondering stare at gilead sped on her way towards the tram terminus hard by regarding her retreat an instant gilead turned to see the figure of a man standing conning him from the shopdoor he was a pert wiry truculentlooking young fellow the very type of combative cockneyism his nose was retrouss his cheeks pink an incipient redgold moustache on his lip had been coaxed into two little upstanding stings or spikes his cloth cap tilted back from his forehead revealed a rudimentary cowlick elaborated from a somewhat cropped head of the same apollonian hue he stood whistling softly with his hands thrust loosely into his trouser pockets gilead stepped towards him jenniver he said is that the name you may lay on it my lord answered the young man coolly blocking the way o said gilead and produced his newspaper extract i came about an advertisement the stranger nodded eyeing the brownpaper parcel yus he said i have a skin or two here of the sort you mention o have you said the young man he appeared to consider a moment well no harm in looking at em he said come in he led the way into a little dirty dismal shop with shelves and a counter and all as empty as the window a door at the back seemed to give upon remote and silent regions there was not a sign of traffic of any description whatever in the whole place the stranger accepted the parcel opened it and revealed half a dozen parrakeet skins of sorts he turned them over examining each minutely and looked up youve forgotten about the old he said old echoed gilead now look here said the young man in a sudden access of violence what the hells your little game gilead taken completely by surprise lacked words to answer youre a toff went on the stranger these skins aint old but freshbought with the importers labels still on em what the devil do you mean by trying to pass them off on me as old i really didnt realize that age was a sine qua non said the customer sine what said the young man o didnt you now youre a pusson of observation you are now what do you mean frankly said gilead who had recovered his selfpossession i dont quite know my object was to find out what you did o was it said the dealer with a violently derisive emphasis jest so theres a skin there said gilead which answers exactly to the description of the one you most require so i see said the dealer only its not old only its not old well i suppose theres a virtue in antiquity dont you know there is being a toff i confess said gilead that mangy plumes excite no emotion in me youd understand their use maybe if you was curator to a perishing museum answered the dealer gilead opened his eyes is that the explanation he said i humbly beg your pardon mr jenniver my curiosity is rebuked come i apologize but the advertisement really seemed to me such an odd one that i couldnt resist following it up well said the young man with some appearance of relief you let your friends know my object and well say no more about it i dussay as theres plenty of fine ladies of your acquaintance what would like to get a price for their castoffs its likely enough said gilead im sorry to have seemed so obtrusive good morning mr jenniver the young man did not answer and the customer left the shop he walked rapidly at first urged by a certain sense of humiliation but in a little his steps had slackened and he was proceeding on his way sunk deep in reverie the fact was that the dealers explanation accepted as so plausible in its first utterance was as he reconsidered it failing more and more to satisfy him perishing museums forsooth was it in reason to arrest decay by patching it with decay besides surely secondhand stuff of the sort was easily procurable without having recourse to expensive advertisements the elucidation appeared to him on reflection to have been rather inspired and on the instant by his own comments and then the empty shop the sinister neighbourhood the aggressiveness and obvious suspicion of the dealer that he was being got at no he was convinced that he had actually touched the hem of some mystery harmless possibly but so far without a shadow of a clue to its meaning and yet the more puzzling it appeared the more was he stimulated to persist in an endeavour to unravel it he confided his nonsuccess to nestle when he reached the office the secretary listened very attentively to the end in a matter of this sort sir he said any word linking an outer with an inner association is of value the young woman you say mentioned doddington grove well my advice is transfer your investigations to doddington grove it seems ridiculous nestle what possible base have i to my inquiries a morbid craving for old parrakeet skins sir said the secretary gilead laughed i am half afraid he said that the cause of the quest has given me a morbid craving for mares nests where is doddington grove it was not likely that there would be a second of that name and in fact referring to the map of london they traced the street they sought to the locality of kennington park gilead made his way thither that very afternoon he found the grove to occupy one side of a dully respectable little congeries of squares and places covering a considerable estate to the north of the park there was nothing more remarkable about it than about any other semisuburban avenue of bricks and mortar the houses were the substantial middleclass houses of an orthodox neighbourhood detached for the most part and cased in stucco a parrot in a brass cage standing in a window was the nearest approach to a clue vouchsafed him clearly the place itself was utterly barren of suggestion and indeed what else could he have expected pausing at length and gazing about him the young gentleman lapsed into a goodhumoured smile and turned to retreat no he cogitated i havent the faculty im afraid i cant produce a rabbit or even a parrakeet from an empty hat so he decided and walked awayand there in a moment before his eyes lay the end of the very clue he sought to follow fate no doubt had been captivated as always by the sweetness and modesty of his disposition for many days succeeding that excursion mr balm during his somewhat rare visits to the agency appeared deeply preoccupied and rather unapproachable even the privileged amanuensis would venture no attempt to penetrate his reserve though the heart in her fair breast suffered some pangs thereby which in a baser nature might have been attributed to jealousy she would have been indeed quite satisfied to leave him to himself were she assured that that was the sole company he affected but men she knew were often when appearing most alone most particularly visvis with visionary comrades and the image of some rival to her own and the secretarys interests occupying that silent and inscrutable mind would occasionally rise to perturb her how her apprehensions were relieved will appear in the sequel where we are to pass at a leap from the meagre opening to the prolific close of that same little affair of the birdskins ii mr ingram chief superintendent of the criminal investigation department was sitting in his office at scotland yard one chill afternoon when a respected visitor mr gilead balm sent in his name with a request for an immediate interview on a matter of urgency the gentleman was at once shown in gilead courteous and quiet as ever failed nevertheless to conceal from the astute officer some evidences of suppressed excitement in his demeanour there was a suggestion in his face of a subdued selfsatisfaction of a conscious victoriousness as it were which both impressed and tickled the superintendent well mr balm he said youve pulled it off singlehanded this time and no mistake gilead taking the chair offered him with an expression in which astonishment and a certain twinkling sobriety fought for mastery asked pulled what off i havent a notion said the superintendent gilead stared a moment and then laughed what is my manner such an index he said well i confess i am just a little elatedor conceited please to read that ingram the superintendent accepted and examined the page of the daily post offered him the marked ad he asked yes well ive read it sir what do you make of it make the superintendent quite at a loss shook his head in a guarded way anything suspicious demanded the client not that i can see ah gilead mutely requested the return of the paper folded and restored it to his pocket now ill tell you ingram he said quietly that advertisement represents a quite transcendent piece of fraud and trickery and with no more to go upon than you see ive traced it as i believe to its source could any one of your men have done better do you think but i wont believe he could and im just as proud as punch of my success if im wrong i will cry off all detective work for the future but i may be right and yet miss my quarry through circumstance or misjudgment i want you to lend me a plainclothes officer a strong skilful and trustworthy man certainly mr balm will you tell me ill tell you nothing ingram im going to claim to myself all the honour and glory of this business ill tell you nothing butyes ill ask you a question do you know george lightfoot by name waitwaitgeorge lightfoot yes sir i remember the man and the crime for which he was sentenced yes to be sure would it be legal to arrest him on a charge of larceny arising out of that crime but subsequent to it better take out a warrant very well procure me a warrant for the arrest of george lightfoot and send it on with the officer to the agency you wont tell me the charge no well sir we must stretch a point for you what time do you want them at six oclock this evening punctually i undertake full responsibility for this course you understand ingram if anything in any way should miscarry i am the one to blame his manner had grown suddenly very grave and earnest he left the superintendent curious but impressed against his will at six oclock to the tick the detective arrived at the office presenting the appearance of a stalwart silent man who knew how to keep his thoughts to himself gilead after a few words of instruction slipped an electric torch into his pocket a precaution impressed upon him through his late experiences in the empty house locked up the place and descending to the hall deposited the keys with the porter and issued with his companion into the street it was a shrill inclement evening bitter northeasterly winds had succeeded to the fogs of the week past and the mud in the roads was long crumbled into an arid dust which was swept up in clouds and blown in stormy veils above the housetops the pavements were as white as picked bones the very flames of the lamps shivered in their little glasshouses one took the stinging blasts headforemost grinding them in palpable grit between ones teeth and detesting all things and people butted aggressive into struggling pedestrians and gloried in the proverbial coldness of charity gilead was constitutionally incapable of such spleen yet even his invincible courtesy found a difficulty in keeping so to speak its equilibrium and when as it once happened a little cold grimy hand gripping a couple of matchboxes was thrust across his path he drove halfconsciously upon the obstruction and scattered it to the winds the act repented as soon as done had been due more to a sense of urgency than of irritation but it had the effect of checking his somewhat excited career and of restoring to him his moral balance the fortunate urchin having profited by it to the tune of a gold piece dropped voicelessly behind the two men beating up victoria street and across the cold comfort of broad sanctuary headed for westminster bridge with set teeth if they had attempted speech the wind would have howled them down it was a charging voice a destructive terrorist that shivered the lamps on the river into splinters of light and hammered screeching on the doors and windows of the timid and blew such an accumulation of human fuel into the publichouse bars that they blazed and roared again it was for this reason no doubt that lower marsh exhibited when they turned into it a darkly depopulated aspect its traffic seemed shrunk to a minimum the bones of its squalid ugliness were laid bare the small grime of humanity that drifted down its pavements appeared of less account than the dust whirled about its lampposts it was in the shadowy neutral ground between two of these that gilead halted his companion and pointed to the name of j jenniver written above their heads its here he whisperedand so is he a weak perpendicular edge of light drawn upon the lowered blind of the shop seemed indeed to witness to the presence of someone in the back room the door of which was patently ajar i never doubted that he would be whispered gilead excusably vainglorious wed better not delay hes vicious and suspicious now officer and be prepared for contingencies you wont wait then sir for the young womans arrival no i think not better make sure of our bird in the hand we shall find her more amenable to argument when once weve settled with her confederate shes little to blame poor creaturehis tool no worse now very well sir stand by its like hell take us for her he tapped on the door almost with the sound the streak of light vanished from the blind and left all in darkness no response followed they waited a breathless minute queer muttered the detective the young woman cant have arrived before us i suppose not if im right in my calculations said gilead try again the officer knocked a second time and louder its all right he whispered in a moment i hear steps hes coming but still the door was not openedonly some indefinable consciousness of a presence standing silent behind it was conveyed to them the detective rapped again then suddenly so close that it made gilead start a voice spoke through the keyholean odd strained little voice with a hiccup in it whos there what dyou want gilead glancing at the detective put his finger to his lips and bent to respond ive brought some bird skins i dont want no bird skins answered the voice but you advertised i dont care ive got all i need wont you look at them no just a squint while i stand here im short of cash wos that to me you clear out you advertised you know im not going to be put off without a reason if you wont open ill kick the door in gosh will you now look ere ill consider of em just this once to oblige you if youll pass em in and take my answer and git is that a bargain all right a chain rattled a key was turned the door opened an inch or twoand quick as thought the detective shot into the aperture an inflexible munition boot there followed an oath a crash the vicious elastic figure of mr lightfoot alias jenniver glimmered one moment in semidarkness and the next they were in and the man was gone the room behind quick cried gilead they were round and into it on the echo of his cry as they stumbled forward blindlyfor the light had been extinguisheda flash and explosion met them full face and gilead tripped and half fell against the wall but in the very act he remembered his electric torch and whipped it out and pressed the button the sudden flash revealed two men down upon the floor wrestling together in a mortal grip make for his revolver gasped the detectivequick before he can get at it gilead saw where the weapon had fallen and snatching at it on the instant presented it at the young dealers head give in lightfoot he said in a voice as cool as judgment i allow you two seconds with a ghastly groan the man rolled over and surrendered they got him to his feet and handcuffed from the moment of his defeat he appeared void of all volition his face was as grey as streaked putty the sockets of his eyes were white drops of sweat stood on his forehead they relit the gas and helped him all limp into a chair where he sat halfcollapsed good god whispered gilead has he shot himself not he said the detective coolly picking the dust of the fray from his coat a mercy he didnt one of us youre all right sir yes and you a bit scorchedno more i wonder at you lightfoot youve made a bad mess of this business my lad gilead uttered a sudden cry its there look the room was empty save for a common chair or two and a bare deal table and in the middle of the latter lay a single folded parrakeet skin green with a rose and black collar round its neck he stood staring a moment then went and lifted and balanced the thing in his hand and so holding it he turned with a lost expression on his face why he said i must have miscalculated after all and shes been here before us the detective uttered a quick exclamation look at the man whats taken him he was writhing and tearing at his bonds suddenly he broke into a whining unearthly cry that tailed off into a string of inarticulate blasphemies officer said gilead whitely theres something beyond what i looked for in this businesssomething i believe infinitely blacker and more deadly stay you here while i go over the house the prisoner straightening himself convulsively moved as if to spring all right sir said the detective prompt to interpose you can leave him to me gilead clipping his little torch into flame hurried instantly out of the room a deadly constricted feeling was at his heart he looked with certainty for some horror to be revealed in a moment yet he had no least reason for blaming himself he had merely watched not directed the course of events indeed providence it might be said had appointed in him its unconscious nemesis would only that it had permitted him to forestall in that character the deed he feared in the passage he paused an instant to shut and relock the front door which had remained open from their first entrance then he turned to consider his ground a narrow flight of stairs rose before him beyond at the black end of the passage a second dropped into the basement he mounted the former in the first instance his heart beating thickly and came to a little cluster of rooms three in all which revealed nothing but dust and emptiness and peeling wallpaper satisfied that they contained and could contain no secret he left them and returning to the passage descended to the basement he knew now that what he sought if it existed must be hidden somewhere here a sense of something monstrous to be revealed tingled in his veins stealthy things seemed to rustle and escape before him at the bottom of the flight he hesitated momentarily sickened from his quest what business was it of his a bugbear very likely of his own fancy the shock of unforeseen defection in an act of larceny was no doubt sufficient to account for the state of the man above a glow came to his face in the darkness he was glad that heaven and he had been alone together with that shameful thought he breathed out all his pusillanimity in a great scornful sighand the sigh was answered he stood a moment as if paralysed it had been little and tremulous but unmistakablean echo perhaps of his own vaulted darkness gasped at him in front exhaling a smell of cold flags and cold soot close beside him was the nearclosed door of the coalcellar in a sudden spasm of horror he pushed this open and casting his light before him saw the body of a young girl lying prone upon her back on the stones now a great sorrow and pity came on the instant to nerve him he bent to look into the bloodless face and saw its eyes closed its white lips parted but the nostrils quivered slightly and he knew that she still lived there was little need to question what had struck her down high on the bosom of the cheap frock she wore was a crimson splash and from under her shoulder spread and crawled a black and sluggish little pool but she was not dead god help him yet to mend a deed so foul and inhuman he rosehope was to the swift as he turned to go he saw leaning against the wall a spade and mattock and he shuddered in the knowledge of their purpose it was with a face as set as stone that he came hurrying into the little room above he has shot her he said she is lying in the cellarbut she still breathes look to him there while i run for a doctor he was gone before the officer could speak but at his words the abject figure in the chair had ceased to moan and writhe it sat up it made an attempt with its damp manacled hands to repoint the little red spurs on its lip it spoke even in a thick unsteady voice ill make you all pay hell for this its a plot to rob me she shot herselfshe did on my living oath what have you done with my rosering the detective exerted some cool pressure its my duty to warn you lightfoot he said that ive a warrant for your arrest in my pocket and that whatever you say now will be used as evidence before the magistrate iii of course it is an acquired taste said gilead all education is acquired do you like olives no i cant bear them said miss halifax making a face over the unexpected question they are invaluable he answered in bringing out the bouquet of claret so it is with that japanese print he was standing with her before a fine hachirakaki by masonobu which hung upon the wall take it in the right spirit and then see what that exquisite little arrangement by whistler yonder owes to it why you yourself you know are truly insensible of your obligations to this same masonobu among others it was a sunday afternoon and he had invited his secretary and amanuensis to tea with him in the albany with the express purpose of relating to them for their personal and private edification the history in detail of the birdskins about which during the whole day preceding he had maintained an amused but impenetrable reserve they knew that he had been successful in his quest and they knew little else he tantalized them even now by delaying the recital my obligations said the young lady raising her brows in a very pretty puzzled way how mr balm why said he to what beyond a naturally refined taste do you think you owe the judgment so charmingly displayed in the decoration of your own rooms it was these early japanese artists who were as responsible as any for the growth among us of a spirit of true appreciation of the beauty and value of line in decorative composition you must really learn to honour your artistic ancestry miss halifax she sighed i will try only i do wish my ancestry had adopted a more attractive convention for its faces they have no more expression than eggs it will do i suppose if i taste masonobu and drink in whistler you tell me you know to love the wine for the olive and not the olive for the wine he laughed that is well answered but i dont despair of you yet you shall come by and by to love the olive for its own sake yes that is the pigalle isnt it a dear she exclaimed this time with a wholehearted admiration it ought to be he answered i gave three thousand guineas for it she smiled lovelily on him thanking him silently for the little whimsical significant confidence mr balm she said plaintively when please are we to hear about the quest at once he answered i was only waiting your command i am just spoiling as the americans say for an audience you shall own nestle that i have managed in spite of the french proverb to draw oil from a wall he brought and settled them snugly about the fire went to a cabinet and returning with some article in his hand placed a little occasional table in their midst ready for its reception you will remember he said the terms of the advertisement and the emphasis laid on a particular species of parrakeet skinthe roseringed in short it was from the first our astute secretarys opinion miss halifax that the advertiser had in view less that species than a single example of that species and he was perfectly right i hold the proof in my hand he offered it for their inspection nestle uttering an exclamation bent to look take it said gilead examine it weigh it and return it to me what do you make of it it answers to the description certainly said the secretarygreen plumage rose and black band it is about sixteen inches long and it has been worn two things only strike me what the weight of its head and the fact that it has eyes precisely now will you lay it down here awhile it came into my hands the night before last under pretty tragic circumstances there was an attempt at murderyes indeed there was miss halifaxof which an unhappy girl was the victim i arrived on the scene too late to prevent the crime but not too late to have the criminal arrested redhanded it was only then that i reached a final solution of the problem i had set myself to unravel and which solution it needed no more than a single piece of corroborative evidence since supplied to confirm by the courtesy or perhaps i should say the particular favour of chief superintendent ingram i am allowed the temporary custody of these picesdeconviction yes miss halifax the girl the poor victim she is not i am happy to say so mortally hurt as at first it was feared there is a chance at least of her recovery the bullet has been extracted the bullet i am beginning you see at the end like a chinese book o please to go on i will not interrupt you again as often and as much as you like by the way where am i to begin o from your visit to doddington grove i know so far very well now as you may suppose i found nothing whatever in doddington grove a respectable street in a respectable neighbourhood to afford me the slightest clue to what i sought i had in fact after a hopeless investigation come to realise my complete inability to make bricks without straw when chance or providence directed my steps in retreating past a shop in the kennington road in the window of which i saw something which brought me to an instant stand this something was nothing less than a bundle of brightcoloured birdskins tied round with a piece of red tape i went at once into the shop it was one of those secondhand concerns used by small brokers for the disposal of articles picked up by them at sales and i ascertained without any difficulty that the packet of skinswhich i bought there and thenrepresented the remainder of a considerable parcel the bulk of which had been sold to a hat and bonnet shop proprietor in the borough the original lot had i learned figured in its entirety among the effects in a sale at a house in doddington grove and with small pains i was able to discover the number of that house the date of the auction and the name of the late tenant who it appeared had been a mrs barclay rivers a widow so far so good i had secured at length a definite base from which to conduct operations and i felt considerably elated i must beg you both to bear always in mind that from first to last i was my own sole detective in this matter any doubt in that respect would seem to tarnish my laurels of which i am inordinately vain now to continue there was here you will perceive at least a certain relation established between a mrs barclay rivers and a packet of birdskins with the man and girl in lower marsh for the hyphen connecting them as it were how to ascertain the nature of the relationship the degree of kindred so to speak was the question obviously the simplest course was to hunt out the widow herself and to make a frank offer to her of my services and that was the course i adopted the auctioneers who had sold the property were fortunately in a position to acquaint me with the present address of the lady she was living in lodgings in the earls court road they informed me and to supplement her income which was small she gave music lessons they opined that her husbands deathwhich occurred in the malay peninsula some eighteen months agohad left her very ill provided for and that the sale of her household effects had been due to that cause i must confess that both here and elsewhere i did not hesitate to quote when necessary my credentials you may think that hardly playing the game in which case i offer no defence but it saved a world of explanations i called upon mrs rivers she was accessible of course professionally and i took the opportunity to introduce myself and to state my object in visiting her fortunately she was well acquainted with the reputation of our agency and from that first moment all so far as she was concerned was plain sailing it is unnecessary for me to enter into particulars but i may say generally that she gave me her complete confidence miss halifax fluttering butterfly lashes shot one glance at the secretary he sat absorbed and intent and her lids fell again she was the widow it appeared continued gilead of a captain barclay rivers who at the time of his death had been abroad on a scientific expedition in the malay peninsula and its contiguous islands some few weeks before the news of his death had reached her there had arrived from him through a shipping agency and directed in his handwriting a small bale of birdskins but unaccompanied by any letter or notification of their despatch there was nothing about the parcel to lead her to attach any particular significance to its contents or to any part of its contents and she put the skins aside after a brief examination fully expecting to hear from her husband by the next mail instead there came to her the tragic information of his death from swamp fever she was leftneedless to elaborate the reasonsin such restricted circumstances that it became necessary for her to realize on her every stick of property and to retire into obscurity the parcel of skins was included in the sale and it found a purchaser such was the sum total of her testimony she had no reason for assuming that the parcel had contained anything extraordinary and interested as she was in my view of the case she was inclined to the belief i fancy that it would lead me to no more than the discovery of a beautiful maresnest questioned about the contents of the bale she admitted that to the best of her memory it had contained a single skin of the sort described but she could not in the least recollect if that especial skin had been included in the lot sold by auction she had however no reason for supposing otherwise well here was something more gained if a little less than suggestive i had of course already minutely examined my purchase it included no rosering and yielded no solution my next step was to return to the brokers shop to enquire if any previous customer had overhauled the packet that i had bought judge of my gratification when i learned that a week or two before a man answering in every description to my friend of lower marsh had considered and after a careful scrutiny had declined the purchase from that moment i saw the connection proved and knew that it needed no more than tact and persistence to bring me to the heart of the mystery now it occurred to me that the bonnet shop in the boroughknown as mlanieswhich had acquired from the broker the bulk of the lot purchased by him should form my next subject for enquiry and thither i bent my steps one morning about midday as i reached the place by a truly extraordinary chance the hands were trooping out to dinner and amongst them i saw and recognised at once the figure of the girl whom i had seen issuing from the empty shop in lower marsh fortunately i passed unobserved by her or she might have suspected something but it came to me in a flash that she was in league with jenniver or whatever the mans name might be to trace the rosering to some customer of the firm and that since she had been presumably unsuccessful the rosering could not figure among the stock at mlanies and therefore it was useless my pursuing my enquiries further in that direction really i think miss halifax i was inspired in all this i am sure you were mr balm what was your next step why to induce mrs barclay rivers to come with me to see if by any chance she could identify the man jenniver himself it was just possible and it might explain everything and did she she came with great reluctance but i was by then i am afraid so eager in the quest that i would have abducted her had she refused my intention was to introduce her to the man as one of those fashionable acquaintances whose custom he had desired but he saved me the trouble as we approached the shop he himself accompanied by the identical young woman of my former acquaintance issued from it and the two unconscious of our presence it was raining and our umbrellas were up went down the street before us there he is i whispered and the very girl i told you about with him quick do you recognize either both i am sure answered mrs rivers much agitated the girl i am certain is annie milner a former maid of mine whom i had to send away for misconduct and hewaiti seem to know him but im so flustered at that moment the two stopped at a door and the man knockeda double rap o said my companion on the instant i know him he was a postman in our district i started i turned her swiftly about i almost ran her from the neighbourhoodfor she had given me in those few words the clue i desired and from that moment everything was clear to me mr balm how o please go on one moment i went straight after seeing her home to scotland yard and by virtue of those same credentials secured an examination of the portraits of convicted criminals the man of lower marsh figured amongst them who is he i asked george lightfoot was the answer a kennington postman sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for letterstealing and discharged after serving his term within the last few weeks there miss halifax o but im not there indeed why you see captain barclay rivers had written a letter to his wife telling her that he was forwarding the bale of skins and mentioning a secret connected with one of them and that letter lightfoot had stolen amongst others but before he could formulate any plan for acting upon the information contained in it he was trapped and arrested on another charge and sent to prison only to find upon his release that the lady had been made a widow and the bale sold and its contents scattered during his confinement hence his advertisement and generally his determined efforts to trace the several items of the parcel hence moreover his subornation and ruin of the unhappy girl at mlanies whom he had known and courted when he was a postman and she a maid at mrs riverss and whom he had since his release tracked to the shop in the borough and won to his nefarious purposes and you saw through it all in that single instant i will not go so far but i had at least a vision of the truth still there remained to discover the nature of the secret and the whereabouts of the lost skinfor by now i was convinced that the rosering and the rosering alone the one specimen of its kind which it would seem the parcel contained held the solution of the mystery well i discovered it but at a fatal moment for one poor creature o dont stop i must hurry rather there is much ground to cover in a few words you will take for granted miss halifax the tedious process of inquiry they represent in brief i questioned mrs rivers as to her former mnage and learned that in the time of annie milner there had been but one other servant in the house namely a cook bessie cotton by name it was just possible that she might know something about the lost rosering i traced this girl to the situation she had procured through her former mistress from that situation to another finally to small lodgings she was occupying in the neighbourhood of newington butts i found her at home and opened upon her at once on the subject of the rosering to my amazement she broke into a passion of tears and half coherent protestations denouncing as i understood her former fellowservant annie milner for having brought the law on heras she supposed in my person it was long before i could convince her that i was not a plainclothes constable long before i could quiet and reassure her but i succeeded at length and persuaded her little by little to make a full confession to me of the truth and what do you think it was it was she who had stolen the rosering it was shea mere impulsive misdemeanoura mere sin of vanity committed for the purpose of adorning a cherished hatwhich hat still survived so adorned seeing the parcel of bright skins so little regarded she had succumbed one day to the temptation of the rosering attracted by its eyes and its singularity and had appropriated it to herself but now observe the irony of circumstanceor was it perhaps an instance of subconscious telepathy of simultaneous suggestion anyhow it appeared annie milner and i had conceived at the same moment the same hypothesis about this girl her former fellowservant onlyannie had been an hour or so beforehand with me in giving practical effect to her hypothesis in short she had paid a visit that very morning to bessie cotton during her dinner hour had wormed the truth out of her and had demanded the hat itself as the price of her silence and bessie had yielded up her plunder intact and annie had carried it awaywhither for a moment as you may imagine i felt completely nonplussed and then it occurred to me that annie having already sacrificed her dinner time to this quest would for certain postpone carrying her prize to lower marsh until after business hours i acted promptly upon that conjecturewhich fortunately proved the correct oneyou shall hear with what result gilead then related to his absorbed listeners the adventure with which we are already acquainted we cannot gather he said at the end whether the villain had predetermined upon murdering his victim with a view to silencing an untrustworthy confederate or whether as he himself declares she drove him to madness at the last by coquetting with him witholding her capture and threatening to give the whole thing away unless he agreed to her extravagant terms the fact that he made a jealous preserve of the premiseswhich he was renting for a few weeks at a few shillings a week from a local landlordthe fact of the spade and mattock in the cellarthese are at least subjects for grave suspicion but likely enough we shall never know the truth and the mystery mr balm o mr balmplease gilead laughed at the impatient young lady as he raised the parrakeetskin from the table i told you he said that there was but one missing link needed to complete the chain of evidence that missing link was of course captain barclay riverss letter which was found on lightfoot it told in brief of the captains startling discovery among the ruins of a temple of kandy in ceylon of an almost priceless gem of his apprehensions that this treasure might be lost or stolen from him in his varied wanderings and of his final determination to send it home in a parcel of the skins of birds shot by him concealed within the head of a roseringed parrakeet the only specimen of its kind he was careful to explainwith an elaborate description of the bird for his wifes instructionthat the bundle contained with these words gilead lowering the skin for the eager scrutiny of his two guests laid open the body and showed them how the whole cavity of the skull was filled with a single dark stone which projecting to the sockets seemed to form the eyes then delicately inserting a finger and thumb he produced the gem for their inspection it is an incomparable sapphire he saidin a fine state always one of the most precious of precious stones this example may be pronounced in bulk and depth of colour no less than superlative as he spoke his man entered the room what is it david he exclaimed a lady to see you sir what name man why dont you show her in hearing you had visitors sir she begged if you would come to her instead he proffered a card it is mrs barclay rivers herself said gilead turning gleefully to his guests i had halfexpected her excuse me a moment as he left the room miss halifax with a heartfelt sigh turned to the secretary damn said that young gentleman laconically im convinced shes young and beautiful and romantic murmured the amanuensis unhappily did you notice how shyly he referred to their confidences a designing creature visitors indeed ive a presentiment were going to have our poor little noses put out of joint herbert hush he whispered voices were audible in the passage and the next moment gilead laughingly reentered the room ushering in his visitor miss halifax rose with a frigid demeanour and a cold feeling at her heartand encountered the figure of a buxom redfaced woman of sixty waddling in like a jovial duck well im blessed said mrs barclay rivers if this aint like a scene out of dickens and the conspirators all met together in old joes rag shop what a pretty frock my dear miss halifax with a delicious laugh ran to take the hand offered chapter vii the quest of the wax hand it was not to be supposed that the agency so catholic so philanthropic so disinterested in its labours and withal so boundlessly endowed would long escape the notice of those social powers which through all changes of creed and government work steadily on in the cause of the human decencies with these gileads name was soon to become an almost apostolic one and gradually as he proceeded on his way the executive the police the home office itself became his informal allies a latitude was permitted him in the matter of technical infringements of the law and he was made secure against official and officious interference in his clean and fearless spirit of knighterrantry he probably realized little of the indulgence granted him and in cases where his way was made inexplicably smooth accounted the fact to nothing more than the inherent rightness of things on more than one occasion indeed scotland yard flagrantly abetted him in acts which strictly speaking were illegal but then if it had withheld its support a scoundrelism or so would have prospered it is true that gilead was accustomed to give practical expression to his admiration of the force in princely gifts to its charities and awards to individual merit but i for one will not believe that such generosity would if construed into bribery have induced it to condone for a moment a real offence in him the police favoured him because he contributed and contributed largely to their power for good one morning the following advertisement thumbmarked by the secretary for his consideration engaged gileads attention in despair a young man in urgent need of asks the help of the rich and benevolent to save him from complete ruin no repayment but will give services in any capacity required the usual reference number followed gilead thought a moment then looked up this nestle said he is hardly out of the common hardly sir replied the secretary only the offer of services guarantees it as genuine but if you would rather it went through the ordinary channels no said gilead if you have nothing better to offer i will take it romance after all must walk sometimes on the highway if we have the eyes to distinguish her i will undertake this nestle he requested miss halifax to make an appointment with the advertiser to call on the morning next but one and there left the matter for the time being at the hour specified the expected visitor arrived and was shut in to his interview with the head miss halifax as usual being present gileads ready sympathy was awakened on his first sight of the young man who in addition to a nervous white complexion and troubled eyes was disfigured by the loss of his right hand the place of which was supplied by a stump and hook the calm eyes of the young plutocrat would yield at first however no ground to sentiment enough experience had taught him to safeguard his emotions you advertised for help he said may i ask in the first instance your name dobell sir answered the stranger in a low voicefelix dobell he hung his head he was patently in great mental suffering his age appeared to be about that of his questioners but some illness of life had lined his face prematurely in appearance he might have stoodon that line of social demarcation which divides the accepted from the not quite acceptablefor a clerk on the lower grade but his speech was educated and his dress quiet and your vocation asked gilead i was cashier sir to a firm of law stationers was he noticed and emphasised the past tense i was forced to leave sir said the visitor scarce audibly forced again he accentuated the word quietly but significantly no not in that way sir answered the othernot indeed it was because i feared to be tempted to it that i left i come to you with clean hands so far indeed i do sir he put out his arms with an instinctive movement and withdrew them as quickly miss halifax leaning over her table shaded her eyes with her palm but gilead sat to all appearance as cold as judgment you will forgive me he said it is necessary you proposed if i remember rightly some indiscriminate form of service in return for this loan i have trained my left hand sir answered the visitor eagerly to do the work of my right and better anything in my power i will do gladly fifty pounds is a large sum for what purpose do you require it to pay a debt again the answer was hardly audible very well said gileadand if i accept your terms and require you in exchange for the gift to pick a mans pocket for me miss halifax rose in soft amazement the stranger rose too i have come to the wrong place he said it is only a judgment i suppose buto let me go sir let me go before i make a fool of myself you wont do it no the amanuensis forestalled him at the door mr balm she whispered in a voice from which every expression but wonder was gone gilead rose with a smile and crossing the room swiftly put a firm detaining hand on the young mans shoulder come he said tell us all about it from beginning to end his tone was unmistakable with one amazed look at him the young fellow dropped his face into his single palm and bowed his shoulders as if quite broken with grief come said gilead a second time it was a test no more dont you know us man it was evident that he did not in a few sweet sympathetic words miss halifax informed him of the nature of the harbour of refuge into which he had driftedin despair it appeared almost without a hope even when he realized at last his happy fortune it was minutes before they could restore him to a frame of mind meet for explanations but at length abashed grateful half stunned in the prospect of help he faltered out a desire to be questionedand condemned if need be that is very well then said gilead you must tell us if you will as much about your life and circumstances as is necessary to an elucidation of the matter if you will only begin by questioning me sir answered the visitor evidently greatly overcome as he seated himself diffidently on the chair to which he was motioned i thinki believe that i should find it easier to answer than explain there is so much that is bewildering as well as so much that is shameful in my story but i will speak the whole truth i will leave out nothing only question me gilead seated opposite nodded his assent reassuringly i am sure you will he said tell me in the first place who you are my father answered the young man was a respectable printseller and framemaker in southampton row he gave me a good education my mother who died young i never knew and yourself asked gilead when i was twentyone said the young man a sudden pink suffusing his wan features my father procured me a situation in the studio of mr auguste lerroux who dealt with him he appeared to have prepared himself for the slight start which his words evoked he looked up quickly and dropped his eyes again a deadly pallor replacing the momentary flush on his cheeks the wellknown artist and sculptor asked gilead resolutely commanding himself well my father went on the visitor in a low voice overestimated some small ability which i possessed and persuaded mr lerroux to take me on as his assistant with a view to better things i had not been with mr lerroux a year when my father died he paused in painful embarrassment and again gilead encouraged him to proceed my father continued the young man with evident difficulty was always i fear improvident and unpractical it was deemed necessary after his death to sell the stock and goodwill of the business in order to discharge the debts with which it was encumbered they proved greater than expected and for nett result i found myself thrown virtually penniless upon the world it was then that i succumbed to temptation ah said gilead in a tone which he strove to make appear unconcerned and now we come to it mr dobell yes sir said the visitor he looked up his eyes shining but there was a piteous tremor about his lips i succumbed sir he said and to my everlasting shame i want to put it before you quite plainly without extenuation or selfdefence it was this way mr lerroux had engaged to pay me a certain small salary but as a matter of fact he did not keep to his promise or only so scantily and fitfully that at the time of my fathers death i had been able to put by no more than a pound or two which represented my entire savings there was a reason for this as i knew my employer figured large before the world of critics but he was not a popular artist and his patrons were few he was generally hardpressed for cash and i knew and know now most bitterly to my cost that he had recourse to the moneylenders at the time of which i speak he was in a desperate state and i must believe that he had no choice but to discharge me anyhow he did discharge me i thought harshly and cruelly and at twentytwo i found myself cast adrift without means or prospects he paused come said gilead we are no pharisees here at first said the young man lowering his eyes i hardly realised my position i was strong and hopeful and foresaw no great difficulty in procuring a situation i did not understand that without especial attainments my chance was almost nothing in the struggle for existence but i was quickly disillusioned in a few weeks time i was utterly destitute and at my wits end to know what to do or where to turn i was used to frequent a free library in the district where i lodged to read the advertisements in the papers and answer such of them as i thought promising one day the devil put it into my head that the walls of this room offered a resource to a starved and desperate man there were hung on them a number of japanese prints gilead stirred and drew in his breath the gift of an eccentric patron some of which my knowledge gained under mr lerroux told me were of considerable market value what loss moral or material would their removal entail upon the frequenters of such a place christmas cartoons i thought would prove infinitely more to their taste i dismissed the temptation but it returned again and again and each time more formidable presently half involuntarily i satisfied myself of the ease with which the room could be entered at night from the back which abutted upon an empty yard and thenand then sir at last i fell trembling all over he took from his breast a pocketbook and from the book a number of papers one of which he selected and rising carried across to gilead will you please to read it sir he said it is a damning witness but a reminder and a warning which i can never make up my mind to part with he stood with bowed head while gilead accepted and examined the slip presented to him it was merely a printed paragraph a cutting of a newspaper report and it ran as follows gilead read it out in a low voice that miss halifax might hear late on wednesday night the b free library was broken into and an attempt made to steal a number of japanese colour prints from the walls of the readingroom the thief procured an entrance through a window easy of access from an unoccupied yard at the back of the premises and was in the act of removing the prints from their frames for the purpose of making an inconspicuous parcel of them when he was alarmed it is conjectured by the movements of the caretaker above and decamped leaving his spoil behind him the prominence lately given through the happer and other sales to the commercial value of these works of art was no doubt accountable for the attempt which should prove instructive to the librarian the police have a clue it is said in some fingermarks and in one thumb mark in particular left by the burglar upon the wet plaster of a wall in the window embrasure which that very day had undergone some repairs gilead looked up with a reassuring smile let him that is without sin among us cast the first stone he said the young fellow gave an irrepressible gasp god bless you he said god bless you sir for that but there is worse to followsomething infinitely more horrible and distressing his listeners brow darkened a little some later crime he asked softly i will noti must not say another word answered the visitor in agony until you have gone through this also it is dated only three days later half dreading what was to come gilead accepted a second newspaper cutting from his hand and bending with compressed lips read it out as he had the former it is our painful duty to record the deathwhether by his own hand or that of another it remains to proveof the wellknown artist and sculptor mr auguste lerroux mr lerroux occupied a maisonette and studio in edwards square off the kensington road and upon entering the latter apartment at seven oclock yesterday morning to light the fire the maid servant discovered to her horror her master lying dead upon the floor with a bullet wound through his head the weapon an airpistol with which the injury had been inflicted lay beside the body and the shot from it had apparently penetrated the brain through the right eye no adequate cause can be assigned for the unfortunate gentlemans suicide and at present the affair remains a mystery the police who were summoned at once are very reticent in the matter but it is hinted that they are in possession of a certain clue which in some mysterious way associates the crime if crime it be with an attempted theft of japanese prints from the b free library as reported in our columns some days ago gilead looked up from his perusal of the paper without a word no sir cried the young manbefore god i am guiltless you must believe it or there is an end of all hope for me i believe it mr dobell said the soft clear voice of miss halifax gilead smiled you have your advocate you see sir he said and now if you please you will give us your true version of this affair the main particulars of which are of course known to me it will spare you pain perhaps if i recall them my lerroux was known to have possessed a pistol of this description he was known to be in embarrassed even in desperate circumstances and he had been heard to threaten selfdestruction at the same time the mere fact of his possessing the pistol was held to be no necessary proof of his having used it against himself and the hint of a second party in the studio gave an ugly complexion to the affair the evidence as to mr lerrouxs habits was inconclusive the medical testimony was inconclusive and in the end if i remember rightly the coroners jury brought in a open verdict they did sir said the young man in great emotion but for detective purposes all reference to the clue which the police possessed had been withheld from them but i knew what it wasi knew i knew that i had touched blood and printed with it upon the doorpost the very damning sign that had already once marked me down sign exclaimed gilead i had said the other hardly able to articulate a crosscut an old wound upon the thumb of my right hand which once detected could not fail to betray me your right hand miss halifax standing a little apart breathed out the words between pity and amazement the young man fought to command himself and presently continued in a stronger voice listen to me sironly listen to me and god helping i will win your belief and pity i tried to rob the libraryit is all trueand at the last moment my courage failed me i got home got to bed the most abased cowering reptile on gods earth rising the next day to the full horror of my fall i read in the evening paper of my own mad attempt and of the clue i had left behind mea thumbmark on the wall from that moment hell seemed to have opened i pretended to have cut myself and enclosed my thumb in a stall while in the very act a thought like a stab struck into my heart i might take what precautions i might there was another witness to that telltale scar in the studio of mr lerroux if the police were to secure it before i could my doom was sealed i threw away the useless stalli was mad by then with shame and apprehension incapable of judging the extreme improbability of their alighting on this remote piece of evidence at first i thought i would call on mr lerroux and implore him to give me the thing i needed but the terror of exciting suspicion thereby and so defeating my own ends was a sufficient deterrent then in a moment my acquaintance with his house and way of life rushed upon me he lived alone somewhat freely and was careless of precautions i knew that after dinner he never went near his studio and that to enter it from the back where a door gave upon a strip of garden should be a very easy matter i ask you to believe sir that i was by then in a state of mind beyond the reach of reason moreover i only intended to appropriate what was already in a manner my own about ten oclock i crept round the studio side treading upon flowerbeds and found as i had expected the door unlocked i listened a moment and then opened it with infinite caution all was silent and dark within save for a red gleam from the stove which stood to one side a little away from the wall i knew where the thing i had come to seek was deposited but fearful of stumbling over some obstruction i decided to kindle momentarily a spill of paper in order to take my bearings stealing to the stove on tiptoe i saw an envelope or wrapper lying handy and stooped to secure it my fingers came up wet and sticky and as i kindled the paper and turned with it in my hand i sawo my godmy old master lying dead on the floor in a pool of blood grey as ashes the narrator unable longer to support himself sank back into the chair from which he had risen his listeners hurried to sustain and reassure him say no more my poor fellow said gilead it is all plain and you shall spare yourself it was like this was it not in the midst of your horror the awful responsibility the awful peril you had incurred smote you out of stupefaction and without giving another thought to your purpose you turned and fled leaving that tragic thumbmark for a clue to your pursuers the young man thanked him with a look full of pathos and gratitude i thought i should die mercifully die he whispered when i heard what i had done it must have been on the doorpost which i clutched to save myself from falling somehow i got home unobserved and washed my hands and theno my god the cruel irony of fatei found a letter awaiting me offering me a post in a big lawprinters and stationers to whom i had applied if it had only come a week earlier miss halifax with a motion of infinite pity touched his mutilated arm her intuition had already guessed the truth he looked up at her with a faint smile yes miss he saidthe day that i began work i was standing by a printing machine when i heard one of my companions read out that very description of the suicide i showed you and learnt for the first time of the clue i had left i was again wearing my thumbstall and not out of courage but in a simple impulsive frenzy i thrust my hand among the moving machinery and the next moment fainted when i came definitely to my senses it was to find myselfwith joy and reliefsecure for ever from the witness i most feared but heaven help me it was only a respite the firm were very good to me and kept me on as having been injured accidentally as it was supposed in their service and i tried to repay them by devotion to my work in time the capacities of my two hands seemed all concentrated in the one left and i became expert with it as i had never been with my right months past and nothing happening to alarm me further i grew by degrees to a certain confidence and to a hope that the police had ceased to interest themselves in the matter of the thumbmarks and then one day all in an instant my silly selfdelusion was scattered to the winds i received a visit in my lodgings from an enemy i had never conceived or dreamed of he passed a hand across his damp forehead gilead patted his shoulder reassuringly you remember sir continued the young man my reference to moneylenders there was one of these a mr raphael colfox of great queen street who was often with my employer mr lerroux i think he not only bled him pretty freely but with an eye to future possibilities was in the habit of acquiring from him at nominal prices works of his among those that had passed into his possession was it appeared that very piece which i had risked my soul to obtain he had come to tell me so with the intimation that his late appearance in the matter was due to nothing more than the difficulty he had found hitherto in running me to earth he had seen he said the thumbmark on the post and had at once identified it with another in his possession and he offered me his silence at a price all my explanations and protests were in vain and he ended by convincing me that he held my life in his hands the narrator whose voice had sunk lower and lower gave a little choke here and stopped i see said gilead i am beginning to see very clearly tell me only if you can what was this article you desired so much to get into your own possession it was a cast of my right hand palm uppermost sir that mr lerroux had taken most beautifully in wax and my name was on it there followed a short silence and then gilead spoke in the soft ominous voice that it always thrilled miss halifax to hear this is all quite plain mr dobell and i thank you for coming to us in your difficulty i should like to ask you a final question or so this first visit of mr colfoxswhen did it occur about six months ago sir and he has beenwe wont mince mattersblackmailing you ever since he forced me to accept a promissory note sir for an imaginary accommodation and he has beenyes he has been bleeding me on it ever since i owe him fifty pounds at this moment and he is pressing for its payment under threat of exposure i had to leave my situation a month ago or i dont know what would have happened i am not strong and this constant misfortune and persecution seem to unbalance my reason it was his own suggestion that i should advertise as i did in the daily post exactly you are convinced of course that he actually possesses the wax cast i have seen it sir where he keeps it in a safe in his office does he do you know sleep on the premises no i am sure he does not sir i know his private address very well mr dobell and now i am going to place you in the hands of my secretary mr nestle who will make himself responsible for your present custody and wellbeing be assured that you have nothing to fear and everything to hope that this nightmare shall not be permitted to demoralise you much longer come the young man tried to articulate his thanks but utterly failing gilead took him gently by the arm and led him from the room half an hour later mr balm presented himself at scotland yard and requesting an interview with the chief superintendent of the criminal investigation department was immediately shown in to that weighty official mr ingram said the visitor i want you to introduce to me an extremely expert burglar the superintendent laughed and leaning his elbows on his desk and propping his chin on his clasped hands regarded the other humorously come mr balm he said whats your latest little game their interview was a long one and its termination left the superintendent immensely interested and surprised he whistled reflectively to himself more than once so said he this is the explanation of the thumbmarksas odd a coincidence as ive known sir how about my burglar asked gilead the superintendent slapped his hand softly on the desk mr balm he said youre an odd oneupon my word youre an odd one sir but i like your idea whats the harm now nothing interfered with and nothing taken i think i may say you may look to us in the matter of course if the thing remained and the man chose to produce it your prodigy might have a devil of a business to clear himself and we should be forced to take action with what result the lord only knows but this alternative if you can carry it through ends the matter and without loss to anyone but the skunk that deserves the worst go and see him sir and make sure if you can and then come back and report to me in the meantime theres a manjerry trimmers his namewell its my opinion that if you were to lock up that man nekked in a safe hed find means to bore his way out somehow ill make enquiries about him mr raphael colfox had his offices in a dull stuccoed block of building that neighboured on the northeast corner of lincolns inn fields here high up he laid his web for the hardpressed flies that always came buzzing in plenty about that legal honeypot gilead being brought in to him by way of a dismal little anteden smelling of damp ledgers and having a shrewd anmic child in it for clerk found his gentleman a genial strongvoiced figure of sixty or so with stubby white eyebrows stubby white moustache and white hair brushed forward of his ears at the temples he wore a full grassgreen bow at his neck his frock coat bulged a little in the waist and the only spot of colour in his face was supplied by his nose which was somewhat shapeless and inflamed and sown with short white hairs and now sir said he after some brief preliminaries what can we do for you gileads natural repugnance for the fellow made him a little short in his answers his own clear candour never took such offence as it did at those who experience told him would be ready to flout him unknown and to lick his plutocratic boots were he to reveal himself he had no mercy on such toadeaters and found any dissimulation even for the best ends difficult in their presence that remains to see sir he said nothing i may premise in the way of loans or accommodations not mr colfox sitting back at his ease raised his eyebrows and nothing else i will come to the point at once said gilead i am something of a collector a virtuoso and i am told that you possess works which you may not be unwilling to sell by the late auguste lerroux the moneylender pricked up his ears here for the first time was shadowing itself out a justification of his foresight his nerve of cupidity thrilled he must make the best of this chance he nodded his head agreeably you are told he said may i ask by whom i employ an art agent and adviser said gilead frowning over even that harmless prevarication i asked you a question sir it is immaterial who or what prompted it the moneylender recognized an imperious client he recognized also a patently affluent one his manner became propitiatory well it is true he said i speculate a trifle sometimes in this form of property but it is hardly worth my whilethe profits are so small however as it happens i have a little bust by the master in that safe now if you would care to look at it i acquired it only a short time before his death and it represents i may say his finished style a few other more important works are in my possession if i will look at the bust said gilead rising his veins were pulsing with excitement but he allowed no sign of it to appear on his face there was a safe in the room set upon a stand in one corner but it was not to that sleek in green and brass that the moneylender had referred he went to a panel in the wall which he unbuttoned and revealed a second safeplain black iron and of a much older and smaller patternwhich was sunk into the brickwork gilead looking over his shoulder as he unlocked this was aware of a little throng of bijoutry within of the bust in question and quite unmistakably of a cast of a hand in wax his fingers itched to pluck out the witness and cast it into the fire mr colfox unsuspecting as an infant withdrew the bust and held it to the light for the visitors inspection not much wrong with that sir i think said he gilead gave a diplomatic interval to its examination and your price he enquired looking up it is an exquisite thing said the moneylenderlerroux quite at his best it wouldnt be worth my while to part with it under a hundred gilead handed back the treasure nor mine to give it he said i will call again and in the meantime think of fifty good morning he was out and clattering down the stairs before the other could interpose as he dropped he heard the voice of the moneylender fading above him in plaintive remonstrance his heart was stern with anger and resolve and a heat of triumph it would be glorious to catch this scoundrel in his own springe a few hours later saw him closeted at the agency with superintendent ingram and an extremely small man of a somewhat aggrieved and fretful cast this latter sat upon the edge of his chair his knees together his hands fingering his cap on them and his little legs tucked under he was a mere shred of a creature with a thin shaved face a cross mouth and eyes and a dyspeptic cough he wore a suit of gingercoloured dittos and a scarf round his neck of a chessboard pattern well trimmer said the superintendent the little man jumped there he said i wish you wouldnt take me so sudden mr ingram im bilious thats what i am these late hours play old harry with a man of my constitution you make me nervous well im sorry said the superintendent it was thoughtless of me you were at a party last night no doubt you should take more care of yourself at your age you know one of these days youll be laid up for good and all trimmer a ghost of a smile twitched mr trimmers lips its a question with me between a sanatorium and a monastery mr ingram he said but i must finish my little bit of a fling first well said the superintendent this is without prejudice to your choice you know do you think you can do it think i can do it the little man winked at gilead ask a cardsharper if he thinks he could play old maid you know what youve got to do and leave no sign you said mr trimmer play your part and ill play mine the gentleman i understand guarantees the blunt fifty for the attempt and fifty more if you succeed said gilead smiling he vastly preferred this sort of rascal to the colfox mr trimmer would condescend to no further discussion of his ways and means i was cracking nuts he said to the superintendent before youd got your milk teeth bribes says a french proverb can get in without knocking that very night a little monkeylike figure of a man balancing on a window sill which he had reached from an empty suite of chambers next door forced a latch and dropped softly into that section of the queen street building which contained mr colfoxs office by a very curious coincidence the caretaker was engaged at the moment at the hall door down below in a close discussion with a policeman who had knocked him up to enquire as to his knowledge or observation of some suspicious characters who had been seen lately hanging about the neighbourhood while they talked mr trimmer had entered by means known to himself the private sanctum of the moneylender and was proceeding with swift sure touches about his business image imagesimgjpg caption a little monkeylike figure of a man balancing on a windowsill the burglar wore a loose overcoat or wraprascal shall we call it with surprise pockets from these he produced a darklantern whose light he exposed and concentrated on a certain spot and a couple of electric coils with a quantity of wire and fixings attached an electric lamp stuck from the wall as he had ascertained from observant gilead within close reach of the embedded safe removing the bulb he applied the long end of his wire already fitted with an attachment to the place rested one of the coils on the floor and placing the other handy for the safe which he had exposed rapidly switched on the current and picking up the second coil with a pair of insulated tongs applied it to the front of the safe in a few moments a smell of warming iron pervaded the spot the coil grew from pink to red and the heat became excessive the safe was of a crude discarded pattern and unpainted or the essay would have been fruitless as it was the door became soon too hot to touch with the hand and mr trimmer was satisfied secure of his confederate however he gave the experiment plenty of time and only desisted when its success was beyond question then removing his apparatus and readjusting everything to its former state he pocketed his belongings and returned as he had come making all secure behind him it is true that he did linger in some doubt and chagrin while his coil was cooling to leave it at that he thought disconsolately regarding the safe why it would be easier than picking periwinkles with a pin however he remembered the hundred pounds and forbore honour among thieves passing the halldoor presently he saw a policeman in discussion with the porter well goodnight said that officer to his gossip and keep your eyeballs skinned the next day mr colfox was both surprised and gratified to receive a second visit from his virtuoso client i thought youd think better of it sir he said these lerrouxs are not to be picked up for the asking let me see the bust again if you please said gilead his heart was beating a little as the moneylender approached and exposed the safe he was concerned and relieved in one to observe that it showed no signs of its baking mr colfox opened the door uttered a sharp exclamation and fell back a step but he was too astute a rascal to betray the cause of his agitation the next moment he had produced the bust and swung to the door upon his secret but not quickly enough for the observant eyes that had followed him in that moment gilead had seen the hand or rather what remained of itand it was sunk into just a shapeless pancake of wax upon the floor of the safe colfoxs face was a little white and his lips a little shaky as he placed the bust on the table there it is sir he said and the offer stands gilead a stern triumphant light in his eyes faced him i have changed my mind sir he said i desire a deal but in paper not in marble where is the promissory note you hold in the name of felix dobell the moneylender turned momentarily as white as the bust itself but recovered his nerve and stood staring between astonishment and anger whats this he exclaimed who the devil are you my name sir answered the client is gilead balm gilead the man started back then fawned in the most fulsome spirit of sycophancy mr balmyouyou surprise me sir i wish for that paper you shall have it sir he slunk to the other safe extracted a note and returned with it you shall have it sirim sure sir to oblige mr balmat the price of the accommodation gilead accepted the draft and tore it into fifty pieces there is your accommodation sir he said i give you what you gave for itnothing he strode to the door and turned the other cowering white and speechless made no attempt to follow him your villainy sir said gilead is known and recorded against you any further attempt on your part to blackmail the unhappy young man the victim of this your most cowardly method of persecution will be made very effectively to recoil upon your own head all my wealth sir all the influence i possess should be devoted to the destruction of a reptile so noisome you can produce your proofs if you will they will avail nothing against the truth which has been very clearly exposed in their despite think it enough if they serve to defend you in the charge of felony which will most certainly follow your least endeavour to reset the toils which have been broken the law sir the law is already acquainted with your practices he flung out of the room so violently that he literally floored the anmic boy who had been listening at the keyhole for some minutes after he had gone the moneylender stood in a state of semistupefaction looking from one safe to the other then with an explosive sigh he tottered to the smaller everything intact he whispered not a sign of its having been tampered with it was certainly very warm yesterday butdamme he screamed it must have been the ghost of that hottempered devil lerroux himself chapter viii the quest of the redmorocco handbag a young lady asks immediate assistance from some benevolent capitalist to enable her to recover property of considerable value address d l daily post gilead looked up from a perusal of the above advertisement with a twinkle in his eye a young lady again said he upon my word i dont know if i dare to risk the bait a second time you mean the implied invitation answered miss halifax with a smile i mustnt venture to advise mr balm your judgments put us all to shame thats just it he said i dont want to spoil the reputation i made over that marble statuette affair supposing we divide the responsibility and invite the advertiser to an interview at which we will both be present in this room we can form our independent opinions then and act upon them as each thinks fit if we differ the result shall justify the better do you agree o yes indeed said miss halifax nothing could please me more she meant it sincerely and was gratified by the compromise from every point of view the glow of pleasure was in the face she raised to herbert nestle who came in at that moment with some correspondence for her gilead bent to his desk with a conscious smile he fanciedrecently enlightened as he supposed himself to bethat he could frequently now detect an interchange between the secretary and amanuensis of looks of a particular meaning and intelligence signs of a closer familiarity in their intercourse than he had hitherto observed often occurred to him and he had to put force upon himself to avoid the appearance of watching for them he only awaited indeed some definite confirmation of his suspicions to bestow his official blessing upon the pair he was prepared to do it and anxious to end a somewhat invidious situation yet it was a fact that reason with himself as he might about the ideal nature of the union the prospect of it always made him feel a little lonely and outcast now having answered the advertisement as arranged he dismissed the matter from his mind he was engaged the next morning with miss halifax over divers matters of moment when nestle brought him a message that his correspondent had answered his letter in person and was soliciting an interview he carried with him a card on which was engraved the name of miss daisy limner and being instructed in a few moments ushered in the lady herself whom he left with his principal and the amanuensis gilead invited his visitor to a seat which she accepted with shyness and disposed herself in with selfpossession she was slight of an engaging figure and most becomingly dressed in a slim highwaisted frock of a dove colour and a beehive hat of not exaggerated proportions her eyes were limpid and appealing and her age obviously justified its claim a touch of powder on her cheek of scarlet on her lip emphasised nothing more than the irreclaimable tendency of her sex to paint the lily but indeed it was so delicately done that it completely imposed upon gilead i am at your service madam said he you can bestow if you will your confidence upon us with perfect security the young lady at the plural pronoun glanced askance with an appearance of surprise at the amanuensis you can trust said gilead in miss halifax as in me miss halifax is my fiduciary and adviser in the most private business of the office the stranger bowed slightly but it was to be remarked that in the interview which followed she was at pains to ignore entirely the presence of the beautiful confidante you make it sir i understand she said nervously shifting as she spoke and twining her fingers in her lap your interest to succour the wronged and afflicted her voice in itself was musical and caressing but its pronunciation was curiously deliberate suggesting the meticulous caution of one who was feeling her way through the many snares of the parts of speech that is so said gilead it is for what we exist i owe my information said the visitor to the lady in whose humble abode i have taken a temporary refuge may i ask her name said gilead i should be glad to recall the occasion and the nature of the services which procured us this testimony with favour sir said the young lady i would rather not reveal it at present even to you i have reason to believe i may be followed and spied and the apprehension makes me nervous i would rather not if you see no objection none whatever said gilead whoever she is continued miss limner she spoke in that way of you that i saw at once i could do no better than confide to your hands if you would accept of it the very delicate business about which i have come to consult you if you will acquaint me of its nature said gilead i can the better estimate our capacities for dealing with it the young lady sighed i am sure you are very good she said i had better begin at the beginning hadnt i and tell you who i am if you please said gilead my father said the visitor looking down and appearing to deliberate her phrases was once a distinguished financier in the city somewhat late in life he married for his second wife a lady connected with the stage she was extremely beautiful and i was the only pledge of their union it has always been a grief to me to be told i took after her for indeed though i say it as shouldnt she disgraced herself as a lady by eloping with her husbands best friend my father never got over the blow but retired from business and to the continent taking me with him who was then no more than a child of nine we lived at flushing where i grew up one day a gentleman called and had a private interview with my father and from that moment everything went wrong with us he had discovered as i know now something umbrageous about my dear fathers transactions in the past and though as a fact my father had only been victimized by a sneak he used the knowledge to get money out of him he was a terrible man and his name which was like himself was dark presently he quartered himself on us and to cut a long story short ended by getting my father completely under his thumb he controlled all our expenses ran the household as he liked and worst of all compelled me at the price of silence to listen to his hateful addresses sometimes my father in a wild effort to escape from his clutches would flame up and defy him but these convulsions of his were always succeeded by a state of prostration which enabled our enemy to rivet more firmly than ever the chains in which he held us and then at last came the crash one day after a terrible scene between them my father had a stroke the young lady pausing and taking a little silken sachet from her skirt touched her pretty cheeks with it as if to dry from them any suggestion of emotion that she continued after a little quieted things for a time but i could not believe that the end was more than postponed in this dreadful situation i was sitting one morning with my poor father when he suddenly turned to me and in a low eager voice told me to give him all my ears naturally startled i looked at him his face was as white as a teacup but a new resolution had come to it hush he said hush my little innocent daisy i am much better but i do not wish it to be suspected we have reached a crisis and must either dare or perish mr dark has gone away for a few days leaving me as he thinks helpless we must seize the opportunity to secure to ourselves what remnant of our fortune remains there are my first wifes jewels the existence of which i have concealed from you and which a natural sentiment has hitherto prevented me from turning into capital now at last they must be used to provide for us in our extremities i am innocent my sweet child though appearances are made by that villain to tell against me and he informed me for the first time of the nature of the wicked hold on him which i will not wrong him by mentioning for if the truth were told it was something greatly to his credit now he said the plan i have formed to baffle him is this you must cross at once and by yourself to england taking with you the jewels and what cash i can provide you must go straight to london to a certain humble lodging i will tell you where you must wait for me in hiding until i am recovered enough to follow in the meantime i will tell dark when he returns that you have heard of a situation across the water that required your immediate application and so will hope to keep him quiet until i am in a condition to give him the slip and join you heaven my darling child prosper us in this venture which seems to be our last resource in the vortex of gloom and despair into which we are plunged go and if all is well expect to welcome me to your arms in the course of a few days the young lady greatly agitated rose to her feet at this point and faced her attentive listener startled overcome as i was she said in a low voice by the suddenness of the proposal a short reflection convinced me that my dear father was right after a little hesitation a few natural tears i obeyed his wishes and carrying the jewels with me in a red morocco handbag hurried down to the quay and took my passage for queenboro in the boat which fortunately or unfortunately was on the point of starting followed by a thousand apprehensions faced by as many of the strange unknown life that lay before me my journey was not as you may suppose a happy one but fate had worse in store for me near sheerness we ran into a thick fog and colliding with another vessel our own was sunk in a few minutes gilead rose in his turn great heaven he criedthe prinz karl were you a passenger by her but she foundered in shallow water and all on board escaped in time i believe every one said the visitor i was in the ladies saloon at the moment and distracted with fear rushed on deck leaving all my little belongings on the seat which i had occupied i forgot everything in the terror of the shock it was only when we had been hurriedly transferred to the vessel which had struck us and had backed from the sinking steamer that i came slowly to realize how our fortune had gone down in her and that this was the news with which i had to greet my father gilead drew a relieved breath and smiled she will be raised of course said he it is only a question of time before you recover your property o no indeed cried the young in an agonized voice it is a question of much moreof life or death for us time is our worst enemy it is that very delay and publicity which will give our persecutor the clue to our whereabouts for which he will be seeking in what way asked gilead this happened answered the visitor three days ago at any moment now i may expect my father his flight you may be sure will not be long unsuspected by mr dark who will see in this our double desertion a ruse to outwit him he will follow instantly with nose and ears open to every scent and rumour if we claim our property he will be down on us in a moment if we do not we are ruined gilead considered a little well madam he said presently you have if i am not mistaken a suggestion to make the young lady advanced an impulsive step towards him with clasped hands and burning eyes if only she saido if only i could recover the jewels before my fathers arrival and so forestall our persecutor it was for that purpose i advertised it is to implore that assistance that i now stand before you a very helpless very unhappy girl gilead never deaf to an emotional appeal glanced across at miss halifax she sat with a pen between her red lips arranging some typescript in a very calm and businesslike way she ignored his look though she was quite conscious of it i conclude he said looking down and frowning very slightly that their recovery is practicable i understand perfectly answered the young lady the funnelheads of the prinz karl are almost visible at low tide and all that is wanted is a diver the company to whom i have applied admit the fact but decline to make a speciality of my case they refer me to the salvage operations which would mean a delay as i have explained fatal to our interests i am nearly penniless sir and quite incapable of undertaking the cost which would be considerable on my own account if only you would bear it for me claiming if you would your share gilead lifted a majestic hand we are not a commission agency madam he said in a tone so grave that the young lady started and lifted appealing eyes to him o she whispered in a drowned voice i did not mean to offend you but i did not knowi am so young and inexperienced he smiled reassuringly you could not advance a better claim on the agency he said well i will make in justice both to yourself and us such inquiries as are necessary to the case and report the result to you together with our decision when she entreated hardly able to articulate if you will call the first thing tomorrow morning he saidthe office opens at ten oclocki shall hope to be in a position to afford you the assistance you desire the company must be consulted your claim admitted permission given you understand she looked at him intently a little with large haunting eyes then whispering that she would trust in him implicitly that she placed her destiny in his hands withdrew without another word having to pass near miss halifax on her way out she gathered her skirts with a scarce perceptible movement from contact with that young lady well said gilead the moment that she was gone appealing to his amanuensis miss halifax went on writing but with a slight flush on her cheek does anything strike you he said persisting only perhaps she answered softly that for an ingnue she showed considerable resourcefulness and selfpossession hm said gilead he reseated himself and leaning back tapped his fingers together between doubt and a small sense of irritation we must remember her continental training perhaps as to her father and her fathers friends i must confess to some sort of suspicion but the quality of the graft miss halifax is not to be judged by the briar i see no reason to question the main truth of her story but anyhow it is easily put to the proof the steamer was certainly sunk as she described if she was a passenger by it and the company being questioned admits her claim that surely is all that is necessary to our taking action in the matter do you not agree with me for the first time the young lady glanced across at him in an agitated way i must she said low on the face of things it is only thethe guilefulness of my own sex its plausibility and its imaginative readiness in concocting fables toto delude the noble and the generous that make me sceptical i cant help comparing this story with some others we have heard but i daresay my experiences have robbed me of some delusions about womenindeed i am sure they have and as much to my shame as to my good he looked at her with a sudden light of remorse in his eyes i never thought of that in my selfcentred blindness he saidthat you might suffer from contact with vice indeed no she answered very earnestly i suffer but it is the fires of purification i am a better woman i hope than i was please do what you think right in this case mr balm your judgments as i said before put us constantly to shame he was not satisfied but he let the subject drop and went out to make the enquiries he had promised at the offices of the shipping company i can discover nothing he said when he returned to justify any disbelief in the young womans statement the manager who treated me with extreme courtesy acknowledges her name and claim and is perfectly willing that an attempt should be made to recover the red morocco handbag stipulating only that an inventory of its contents shall be placed in the hands of their representative who will accompany us that all expenses shall be borne by me and that i will hold myself personally responsible for the good faith of the transaction he has telephoned to sheerness to put a diver employed by the company especially at my service and in short the attempt is to be made as early as practicable tomorrow morning she smiled how prompt and resourceful you are i do hope most sincerely that success in every way will reward you miss daisy limner came punctually to her appointment the office doors were scarcely open before she applied at them when she heard the gratifying news her joy and relief almost overcame her you are a good sort she said blinking away a genuine tear or two with a heartiness which a little staggered gilead they caught the earliest train available from victoria where they took up the agent of the company who in his turn took down en route the list supplied very readily by miss limner of jewels contained in the red morocco handbag it made quite a goodly show and impressed gilead with a proper sense of the disaster implied in their loss mr limner he thought must have exhibited an extraordinary fondness and delicacy of feeling in forbearing to realize on them until the last moment since they appeared to represent on their face value a quite handsome investment it bettered his opinion of the hardpressed gentleman and made him feel more kindly disposed towards him especially as a number of the stones being unset no very personal sentiment could be assumed to attach to them all the journey down the young lady having relieved her mind seemed given over to the highest spirits now and again even a topical allusion a spice of slang would come to garnish her discourse and give gilead a painful idea of the nature of the company which her young destiny had ruled her she chaffed the shipping clerk demurely and plied him with her eyes in a way which dreadfully embarrassed that susceptible youth who was obviously torn between his admiration for so much beauty and liveliness and an almost irresistible desire to respond in kind and his respectful awe of the young plutocrat whose steps he attended gilead in short was glad when the journey had come to an end and they stepped out upon the platform at sheerness the barge which was to convey them to the sunken vessel was already in waiting by the hard with a couple of men in her in addition to the diver who fully apparelled but for his helmet sat beside the apparatus which was to supply him with air they put off at once for the flow was running strong and a pull of a mile was needed to carry them to the spot where a lighter flying a danger signal was moored above the invisible prinz karl it was a lovely glowing day mist and water blended in that luminous haze which seems to obliterate the boundaries between death and existence and to drug the soul in lethe swimming within that neutral commingling of elements air melting into liquid and liquid into air the boat drifted like a bubble all sense of gravity appeared lost the world was a remote thing the town they had left a mirage all sounds coming from it were subdued to a soft humming and tinkling like noises in a dream they only jarring note to gilead at least was supplied by miss limner the young lady did not somehow seem to fit into the picture he could hardly believe that this was the identical artless daisy that had blinked her dewy lashes at him in his office a few hours earlier she sparkled but it was more now with the sweet sting of champagne in the exhilaration of the trip and its assumed happy termination her speech threw off more and more its trammels of formality she was sportive with the stolid mariners she coquetted her way to their deeplyembedded hearts and smiling on the shippingclerk who had turned green with jealousy asked him not to feel bound to her if he would rather look another way even the majestic diver himself did not escape her but was questioned as to the aggravation he must feel when he came across mermaids and was unable to kiss them she made a toy of every detail of his harness and when at last they had anchored and the ladder was hung over the bargeside and the helmet was screwed into place and the airpump got into position she actually did with a chirrup of laughter drop a butterfly kiss on the glass plate through which his face looked and bid the grotesque figure as it valued her favour return with the bag or not return at all and after that the silence of nervous suspense which came to reign was a relief to one person the diver had his minute instructions as to where to find the red morocco handbag and his essay was to be confined solely to that item of treasuretrove many anxious minutes passed howeverwhile the pump squeaked and thumped monotonously and the gear was spasmodically paid outbefore a rising swirl in the water indicated the return of the submerged venturer but when at last his head and arms did appear over the side the young lady gave a scream which shivered to the stars image imagesimgjpg caption the young lady gave a scream which shivered to the stars oo you sweet you duck you beauty he laid the red morocco bag at her feet and so the object of the mission was accomplished gilead satisfied so far had been nursing secret designs of sending miss limner and the shippingclerk back to london together while he followed by a later train finding however to his discomfiture that the clerk after formally identifying the property which was packed away thrillingly among natty little articles of ornament and attire had instructions to remain at sheerness his gallantry would leave him no alternative but to escort the lady back to town himself a further coup de la fortune consigned them to a compartment in the train of which they remained the sole undisturbed possessors miss limner a very new expression on her face half insolence half exultation lolled back against the cushions regarding the young man with an eye of saucy selfpossession she did not open her mouth however until they were well started on their return journey and then she spoke suddenly and to disturbing effect you have been very kind to me she said would you like to kiss me the momentary shock of which gilead was conscious did not escape her observation she laughed musically o she said it was only a try but a pretty forlorn one you are satisfied with virtue for its own sake arent you the worse for the girls for you are a jolly goodlooking fellow am i my dear he said drily he used the term without design it was simply an involuntary expression of his estimate of her value and she recognized it as such im not in the least offended she answered i meant to pay you back a trifle of what i owed you that was all and youre quite right to refuse to compromise with a penny in the pound what does it feel like to respect yourself i wish youd tell me i dont know that i can he said i can only answer in a negative way by thinking what i should feel like if i didnt like what like you perhaps o she said you devil but i dont mind it takes all sorts to make a world she settled herself comfortably putting out her little feet and crossing her ankles tell me she said what sort of a woman do you admire that ladyclerk of yours i will answer again said gilead negatively i dont admire you why not im pretty gilead shrugged his shoulders o she said ive mental gifts toodont you ever doubt itand then she added seemingly irrelevantly i hate that ladyclerk gilead saw that he had to conciliate a perversity and he lent himself to the task with all the humour and tact of which he was capable one could regard life from flushing he perceived with as much worldly acumen as from london he talked and talked about momentous nothings until he had won her to a train of interests outside their individual selves nevertheless he felt curiously abashed and humiliated all the time he shied instinctively from any allusion to her story or comment on her proposed future proceedings and he welcomed the lights of victoria station when at length they ran into them with a sigh of most heartfelt relief he was a moment or two in following her out of the carriageand then he perceived that she was standing impassively in the custody of a couple of plainclothes constables one of whom was known to him nicked she said and no mistake i wonder if that ladyclerk of yours had a hand in this its all right mr balm said the detectivehe held the red morocco bag secure in his handyou didnt know what you were doing sir but were obliged to you none the less we guessed you would return by this train and weve been looking out for you whats in the bag said gilead recovering himself with a gasp why said the detective thats it just the proceeds sir of the great jewellery robbery from kruiers shop in brussels wed been wondering where theyd gone and now we know come along miss topsy well let you hear further about it by and by mr balm she turned and blew a kiss over her shoulder to gilead tell her she cried ill be her first bridesmaid at the wedding ill remember you to papa and mr dark and she went off jauntily with a laugh standing a minute in stupefaction gilead turned at last and hailing a cab drove to the office and finding it closed went on to miss halifaxs flat the young lady met him with a blush and a deprecating look in her eyes im so sorry she said im so sorry mr balm has she been arrested but i see by your face that she has please forgive me for what he asked i could not believe in her she said lowering her lids i simply could not the strange similarity of her story to othersi seemed to recognize the breed andand i simply could not the moment you were gone i went to visit chief superintendent ingram at scotland yardhes a great friend of mine you knowand i asked him to let me see the photographs of people wanted and she was amongst them i could not be mistakenher name is topsy london and she was suspected of being mixed up in this affair all her story about the wreck must have been quite true but nothing else was anyhow they thought it worth their while to be at the station and i see that it was it was the inspectors opinion and i believe him right that she had heard of the agency and had put the advertisement into the daily post with the express intention of drawing you a smile flickered on gileads lips the bait he murmured she flushed and answered in a curiously distressed voice dontplease dont but dont you think it likely and the principals the actual burglars did not of course dare to appear in the matter tell me you arent offended with me gilead caught at the warm young hand drooped limp before him offended he said kindly it is you who put my judgments to shame i will never again trust myself away from your apronstrings i he checked himself suddenly sighed and added but thats nonsense i must learn some time to walk alone chapter ix the quest of the registered parcel the typical agony column of the daily post was built up in courses which varied in little but their diurnal degree of thickness starting from a plinth say of dancing and gymnastics it would rise by successive stages through castoff clothes skinbeautifiers and superfluoushair removers patentmedicines and specialcure treatments detective agencies payingguest and social introduction offers to personal appeals whence soaring through clubfixtures and lost property advertisements it would flower at length into a capital of the true agonizings crowned sometimes at irregular intervals by an apocalyptic warning to the worldly and thoughtless to set their houses in order gilead from mere force of habit was wont to run his eye down these successive courses from top to basethough his proper business lay with the personal appeal section alonewhich was the reason why the following brief supplication momentarily arrested his attention on a certain november day jennett return and all will be forgiven it was just the commonplace cry prescriptively uttered yet though potential of any possible tragedy and full in implication of sorrow and significance it lay off the track of his questing and he would hardly have given it a thought had it not been for the oddness of the titlename janet jeannette jennythese were familiar forms but jennett evidently anglicised from the gallic the confidence shown by the advertiser in the exclusiveness of its appeal witnessed to the unusualness of the spelling if jennett was the only jennett in england and jennett saw jennett must understand then gilead passed on to other matters and forgot all about it now one of the penalties imposed upon the growing reputation of the agency consisted in the increasing number of unsolicited applications for its help originally designed for the purpose of voluntarily enquiring into the merits of advertised appeals greed and hypocrisy had quickly discovered the wideness of its operations and the munificence displayed in its dealings and were not slow in endeavouring to take advantage of them so complete by this time however was the machinery of the bureau that very little base coin was permitted to pass it undetected but the greater surveillance rendered necessary thereby threw such an amount of additional work on the staff that gilead was obliged at length to rule that the cachet of an advertisement was obligatory before a case could be considered and to that rule he rigidly adhered allowing no exceptions one day herbert nestle during his morning consultation with his chief ventured to draw his attention to an advertisement in the days paper help earnestly solicited mrs b did you notice it sir he asked yes answered gilead with a smile i noticed it and wondered it reminded me of an article on dead letters that i read years ago specimen addresses were quoted one of which ran mrsi forget the namebehind the church england the secretary laughed this advertisement was put in at my instance sir it was merely a draw inserted to comply with your rule mrs b or mrs baxter applied to me personally and thinking her case a reasonable one i advised her to approach us according to form you did very right nestle who is mrs baxter her son sir was a postman in the southwest district i dont know if you happened to notice the case he was convicted of stealing a registered letter and was condemned at the middlesex quarter sessions last week to eighteen months hard labour no i did not well there was nothing i confess very outoftheway about the affair unless it was the recklessness of the deed in the face of sure detection gilead shook his head that is the commonest of criminologic problems he said but pardon me sir answered the secretary does its commonness compel one to jump to the common conclusion say that a a criminal is reckless must b therefore who is reckless equal a i stand corrected nestle what was in the registered packet diamonds sir they had been forwarded from a dealer in hatton garden to an address in the vauxhall bridge road and the parcel was registered up to four hundred pounds and it was not delivered it was accounted for as far as baxter and baxter could produce no receipt for its delivery by him compensation was claimed by mr hamlin the dealer the post office had to pay up and baxter went to prison what was his defence o innocence complete and childlike he swore he had been given the receipt the addressee swore he had not received the parcelthere was virtually no defence had he ever been in trouble before that was the damning part of it he had once been convicted of pledging unpaidfor goods and had been bound over as a first offender there was a girl in the case then i believe and no doubt he had wanted to pose before her as the monied gentleman well nestle well said gilead after a short pause you have your reasons no doubt for encouraging mrs baxter you have given me none so far for meddling with a case which appears to have been decided equitably on its merits it would be the grossest abuse of privilege as of course you are aware for the agency to interfere in the clear processes of justice save on some exceptionally plausible assumption of their miscarriage i have my reasons certainly mr balm or i should not have ventured to approach you on the matter i do so now with extreme diffidence your clear candour of souli am speaking purely officiallyis preeminent amongst us in the recognition of truth there may be miscarriage of justice here or there may not be i ask you only to take the responsibility of deciding out of my hands lest helpless innocence should suffer i am not going to prejudice the case by a word and i should take it as a great kindness sir if you would yourself see and interrogate mrs baxter she is hereat this moment she is here sir awaiting your decision very well i will see her he called softly after the secretary as the latter was leaving the room nestle yes mr balm you are a good fellow nestle the secretary bowed gravely and disappeared he returned in a few moments ushering in a little worn woman dressed in decent black and neither common nor pretentious in appearance her age might have been fifty but the wrinkles of a hundred years lined her forehead and the very tragedy of death in life haunted her dim eyes gilead always sensitive to sorrow rose and motioning nestle to leave them alone together placed a chair for the visitor and seated himself where he could best command without embarrassing her am i right mrs baxter he said in assuming that you are a nurse something neatly formal in her habit may have suggested the hypothesis it was a correct one in any case yes sir she answered with a faint expression of surprise ah he said that is to establish at the outset a claim upon ones sympathies now i am acquainted with the bare facts of this unhappy story mrs baxter what have you to say to qualify them i ask you to speak to me with perfect confidence and freedom thank you sir from my heart i know the value of conciseness and i will not say a word more than i must very well you are convinced of your sons innocence charlie is innocent sir just so now as to the proofs if such there were sir i need not have troubled you to be sure you need not let us say then the admissible likelihoods it would have been the act of a madman would it not knowing that he must be found out yesvery well i do not propose to comment for the moment secure of such wealth sir and having yielded to the temptation is it likely he would have returned straight to the office with the property upon him to risk discovery at the very beginning now mrs baxter you must understand that what i say is said with the view to make clear to myself the pros and cons of this business and is without prejudice to the real truth of the case i do not know what is the procedure of the post office in such matters but in the event say of your son not having been called upon in the hurry of business to produce his receipt until the complaints of the sender of the packet made its production imperative he would have had plenty of time would he not to dispose of the goods he was never sir a penny the richer by it i am afraid that proves nothing and no doubt all these assumptions were taken into consideration at the trial the visitors small face flushed and for the first time she bit her lip to keep back the tears it was hard sir she said that his very innocence should have been used to witness against him and that his sentence was made the severer because he would not confess to the whereabouts of things he had never stolen she was staunch to her fine belief gilead felt very pitifully towards the broken little soul and then she cried to bring up that old affair against him when it had proved the very making of his character the error of a boy sir ignorant of what he was doing though i dont defend it but he had pledged things for his father when alive and he knew nothing of the law it was a girl egged him on to it and charlie never could resist a pretty face but it was a lesson and a warning that he never forgotno not as the dear god shall witness when he walked on that last round that ruined him she blinked away the tears that would come it is very sad said gileadhorribly sad indeed yes sir she answered it is sad but i did not come to urge the feelings of a mother or her love and faith in her boy all that could be said was said as you concluded at the trial and appearances being what they were no other verdict could have been expected i remember my promise to you and i am not going to suppose that what was argued in his defence without avail by a clever lawyer can be put more convincingly by me what i founded the only hope i possess on is what brought me to pray mr nestle to procure me if possible this interview with you i want to know sir what part the girl jennett had in my sons ruin gilead had been looking down he raised his head with a start who did you say he asked quickly jennett the little visitor had been groping in her pocket from which she now produced a paper which she unfolded and brought across to him it was a front page of the daily post dated some days back and marked round in red ink was the very advertisement which had excited the young mans curiosity he looked up in surprised enquiry is it not an uncommon name sir she said a most uncommon one i should think he answered i saw and remarked upon it at the time the person that advertised it must have been so sure of its uncommonness she said that he felt nothing more was needed to explain the who to and where from gilead nodded the little shrewd wellspoken woman had echoed his own thoughts she bent and touched his arm softly impressively jennett sir she said was the name of the servantgirl that took the packet from my sons hand at the door and went away and returned with the signed receipt and afterwards swore at the trial that she had never taken the packet and never given a receipt gilead had risen and was listening attentively with a wondering look on his face whos advertising for her said the visitor and what has she done to need forgiveness that should be my sons business i think her treachery was what cut him to the heart he knew her and had often exchanged jokes with her at the door during the short time she was in the house i told you sir that he loved a pretty face this girl was pretty and in an impudent lively way he told mebut indeed i was able to see for myself and though a mothers eyes are prejudiced i am not going to deny her an attraction of a sort she gave the receipt to your son you sayor he says he told me sir that he was never so shocked and horrified in his life as when returning from his round he found it missing but if she gave it to him that is so sir she put a hand momentarily to her eyes i must speak the whole truth she said in a low troubled voice charlie was reticent about that morning i felt that he was hiding something from menot his guilt no sir no but i believe that as a fact he was courting the girl and i cant help thinking that his silence about particulars was designed in some way to screen her what has become of her have you tried to see her since she has left her situation sir which makes me the more certain that this advertisement refers to her softly mrs baxter we mustnt jump too surely to conclusions there may be other jennetts in the world there may be sir or there may have been once theres a tombstone in hampshire im told with the name on it spelt that way but not in london local wants would be advertised in local papers she had evidently considered the case in all its bearings i should like she said to have a word with jennetts employer well why not asked gilead because sir he too has shut up his house and gone she answered now let me think out things a bit said gilead he paced the room for some minutes deeply absorbed presently with a sigh he stopped before his visitor you must kindly leave your address with my secretary mrs baxter he said i can promise you nothing but that i will look into this businesswith what result you shall be informed no later than tomorrow morning any comments of mine on it at this stage would be superfluous and cruel she just gazed at him a moment with shining eyes charlie is innocent she said god bless you sirand she went hurriedly from the room a little later saw gilead closeted with chief superintendent ingram of scotland yard no mr balm the officer was saying im afraid youll make nothing of it the case was as plain as the nose on your face and as wellshaped if youll excuse my saying it from a professional point of view he laughed it seems youre fated he said to be involved in these post office affairs but you wont come out of this one i greatly fear with such credit to yourself as you did out of the last very well ingram answered gilead but its justice i desire not credit justice you may take my word for it sir was properly dealt do you know anything about this mr hamlin nothing to his harm certainly hes one of the garden lot not amongst the swells but substantial so far as i know do you nothing whatever and the otherthe addressee in the case valkenburg he is a hollander by birtha bonafide dealer in diamonds in diamonds and known of course to mr hamlin naturally the enclosure in question was forwarded by hamlin to him in the ordinary course of business but why by post hatton garden and the vauxhall bridge roadit was there this valkenburg lived wasnt it yes number b well they arent such leagues apart the superintendent shrugged his shoulders its quite a common custom of the trade he said one can conceive a dozen reasons for it in the press of business really mr balm such an act affords no grounds whatever for suspicion do you know that valkenburg has shut up his house since the trial and gone away has he to south africa like enough its quite probable and that the girl his servant who denied having received the parcel has gone too to south africa no i mean she has left her situation well now he wouldnt want to leave her shut up in the empty house would he he sniggered his hairy face creasing all over no mr balm he said i see what youre driving at but it wont wash sir there was never a hint of collusion between the two of course if he had bolted and taken the girl with him there might have been some shadow of a reason for suspicion but i believe upon my word sir that youre taking away the mans character you must remember that if anyone was to profit by such a fraud it would not be valkenburg but hamlin gilead rose well yes it would seem so he said seem so the chief superintendent rose too i dont know whats got into your head about this business mr balm he said but unless youve something up your sleeve he paused in sudden wonder have you he askedsomething unguessed at by us here good morning ingram said gilead ill tell you the truth ive got a vaccination mark up my sleeve dont say anything about it the superintendent stood some moments frowning after he was left alone i wonder if he has he mused darkly it wouldnt in my opinion be quite playing the game but there angels like him must claim their privileges i suppose but indeed gileads sleeve was innocent of the least suggestion of a hidden trump and he was playing the game squarely and with the slightest of prospects of scoring anything out of it he could not honestly convince himself that any real significance was to be extracted from the coincidence of the names and what urged him alone to persevere perhaps was the inspired conviction of the little mother as to her sons innocence in any case he was pledged to her to sift the matter to its grounds and in truth to himself he would not shirk that undertaking calm and fearless in his sense of right he bent his steps straightway to hatton garden and sought the office of mr abel hamlin he was fortunate in finding that gentleman at home in a tiny dark room on the second floor of a pile of offices so mouldy and decrepit that it seemed they must have fallen but for the sturdy support of the warehouses on either side there were a pedestal desk in this cabin a safe and some rows of littered shelves along the walls and a table in a corner at which a young woman sat typewriting she turned as the visitor entered and revealed an extremely pretty face but saucy in suggestion and overdressed as to its hair which was golden and plentiful mr hamlin himself rising from the desk displayed the figure of a neat youngish gentleman olivecomplexioned and darkeyed with thick brows and a little close moustache of strongest black he spoke with the suspicion of a foreign accent challenging the visitor with a yes sir gilead accepted his surroundings with a glance of some surprise was it from dens like this that priceless gems were to be unearthed i must apologize for intruding mr hamlin he said especially as my motive is an unprofessional one permit me to introduce myself the dealer glanced at the card offered him started a little smiled and bowed it is possible said gilead that you may know me by name it is very possible sir and the character of the agency i represent that sir is also not of the unlikeliest i am interested in the case of the young man charles baxter mr hamlin indeed mr balm in your opinion has this advertisement which appeared recently in the columns of the daily post any connection with or bearing upon the issues of that trial he produced and handed over the extract given him by mrs baxter the dealer accepted it courteously miss barnes he said after a glance at the paper you can go to your dinner if you will be so good he turned away shifting some letters on his desk during the few moments occupied by the girl in putting on her hat and jacket she passed gilead with a stare of curiosity and a little pert jerk of her chin as the sound of her footsteps receded mr hamlin came about again an engaging smile on his lips he was a handsome rather swarthy young fellow and his teeth looked glaringly white i am quite at a loss for your meaning sir he said for me i can see no connection not in the least you will recall said gilead that mr valkenburgs servant gave evidence at the trialevidence damning to the prisoner her name was jennett and spelt in this peculiar way yes mr hamlins voice and manner expressed some obvious bewilderment i may say continued gilead in this very peculiar and perhaps unique way ah that is so and what then mr balm what then in very truth all in one amazed instant gilead seemed to recognize the preposterous character of his mission even supposing the jennett of the trial were the jennett of the advertisement what then exactly a sudden consciousness of absurdity bubbled up in himan inclination to hysterical laughter upon my word i dont know he said with a little gasp a sense of reciprocal humour seemed to tickle the dealer his cheeks rounded his teeth showed dazzlingly o this is too ridiculous said gilead steadying himself i dont know why im here i dont know what to say next theres nothing for it now but unqualified frankness he then explained to the dealer the rather forlorn promise which had been extracted from him by his recent visitor and the shadowy justification it had seemed to possess in the advertisement and that justification is gone somehow he said i dont know whats become of it there must be a hole in my mind and its slipped through and now only a sense of empty impertinence remains he was winningly apologetic mr hamlin smiled and nodded at him staring in his face but he hardly spoke a word in reply finally gilead turning to go paused to put a question i feel he said that i owe mr valkenburg a like explanation but i understand that he has left his house yes yes said the dealer he is gone o yesto kimberley he would be much amused he is a friend of yours and no doubt a gentleman of the highest reputation i dont know how to excuse my visit it was unpardonable i do not understand answered the other you have said nothing to give offence for valkenburg he would appreciate your excellent intentions as i do and were he at home would give you i am sure all the information you desire that lambs agency has the claim to much privilege mr balm there seemed no conscious irony in his voice or in his fixed smile it is good of you to put it in that way said gilead i can only repeat my apologies good morning mr hamlin goodmorning answered the dealer without moving from where he stood as gilead ran down the stairs he met a telegraph boy coming up in his hurry he collided with the youth and almost bowled him over that illustrates my fatuity he thought as he went on his way in trying to put one postal official on his legs i knock down another he felt considerably depresseda state of mind to which the weather in its especial degree contributed the day had opened with a brooding menace of foga threat amply justified in the sequel hour by hour as the morning wore on the squalid cloud had drooped and thickened until now at one oclock in the afternoon the street lamps were all alight and the shops blazing like dull furnaces so motionless and so heavy grew the atmosphere that to breathe became a physical consciousness and one almost felt the process going on in ones lungs of selection and rejection with a gasp now and again over a mistaken choice if all the world according to the poet had been a stage nature could not have come more equal to the occasion with a miseenscne of cloudcastles and a makeup pencil better adapted to paint every eye with a sooty rim for some reasonfor which he neither accounted nor troubled to account to himselfthe discomfited and vaguely uneasy young gentleman turned his steps towards the vauxhall bridge road perhaps he still entertained a forlorn hope of somehow justifying himself to himself and to mrs baxter in his venture perhaps a mere morbid desire common enough in its attraction to visit the spot of a murdered delusion impelled him he felt sore and at the same time unaccountably troubled it seemed to him now that he had allowed himself to be convinced over readily in any case it was his instinct to fulfil a promise to the letter or to what his chivalrous conscience chose to consider the letter at the corner of dorset street after what appeared to him an interminable groping down a murky sewer he found the house he sought the fog was so thick that peering over the area railings he could distinguish few of its details but he could just make out that it was a corner house of a long row and superficially in nowise superior to its neighbours in general dullness and unattractiveness why should it be indeed and then suddenly he observed that a bill was pasted within one of its shuttered windows he found the gate opened it and entered to read to be let furnished apply etc the name of a local houseagent was given at the foot now what prompted him to the act gilead never knew but in a moment he had decided to procure the key of the house and enter to make an examination on his difficult way to the address given he ran across a friend who particularly desired a talk with him one minute said gilead and running in to the agents stated his wishes i am in a hurry he said would it trouble you to send the key on to my office his name asked and given the agent was all smiles certainly mr balmo most certainly sir would you wish our representative to accompany you no no send the key and i will choose my own time he was bowed out and the rest of the afternoon he spent over business matters it was not till nearly six oclock that set free he bethought himself of his purposed exploration and of his definite promise to mrs baxter and started a second time for the vauxhall bridge road the fog had so deepened during the interval that walking proved a difficulty and in some ways a danger however gilead was naturally well acquainted with the locality and the perils of no more than a single crossing were there to beset him he reached the house at last after a calculated progress and mounting the shallow flight of steps to the door paused a moment before fitting in the latchkey he was feeling suddenly odd and disenchanted with his quest conscious of a strong reluctance to leave even that turbid streetwith its running links and flares of sudden omnibuses and boom of life however obscuredand enter into the darkness and mysticism of the empty house he had ascertained that its owner desired to let it furnished during the period of his temporary absence abroad and what then he himself did not want to take it neither was it possible for him in this murk and at this time of the evening to conduct any investigation worth the name what an ass i am he thought havent i had enough of empty houses and at that and the flush of sudden shame the memory evoked he ran the key resolutely in opened the door entered and clicked to the latch behind him tingling in every vein as he stood there in the numb half paralyzing darkness he felt for his electric torch and switched on the little friendly spark its tiny light only seemed to make the gloom more terrific he advanced a step or twoand a host of shadows seemed to scatter and fly noiselessly before him they sped up the stairs they disappeared round open doors things ticked and scuttled stealing into corners and squatting to whisper looking over his shoulder in a panic he saw a white face watching him and almost dropped the torch in the start he gave the rumble of a passing omnibus came like a rally to his nerves he turned resolutely though his hands were wetand saw that the face was the pictured face of an old gentleman hanging upon the wall again he turned reassuredand felt that the painted eyes were following him he stopped its no good he thought and worse than useless ill just make a cursory examination and come again tomorrow stepping on tiptoe as though fearful of attracting secret attentions he turned from the hall into the first of the two rooms that opened from it to his right and flashed his little torch to and fro so far as he could gather it was merely like the hall commonplace from the usual oilcloth and the usual marbled paper he had passed to the usual lace curtains cheap plush chairs rickety tripod tables antimacassars and an ebony overmantel painted with birds and adorned with tawdry glass vases from the sixpennyhalfpenny shop its unimaginative philistinism was so utter as to convey a certain comfort no ghost of the past could possibly walk in such an atmosphere of raw newness gilead breathed out a little easing sigh and turned to go his foot was on the threshold when he heard a sound that brought him to a stop instant and startled someone outside was softly fitting a latchkey into the hall door he backed into the room clicking off his light and halfclosing the door stood motionless behind it the act had been instinctive unreflecting but being done must abide its own consequences in the meantime hardly breathing he was conscious that some human presence was in the hall and the next moment he heard the front door softly closed ah said a voice subdued but perfectly clear that is well done so far what a good luck that you had the thought to secure valkenburgs key hamlins voicethe voice whose intonation still hung familiarly in his ear gileads nerves in this sudden stress of danger felt but undefined tightened like bowstrings i think of things perhaps youll get to understand that and do me justice in time it was a girl who answered low and distinct what are you doing with that matchbox she said what does one generally do with a matchbox well dont do it it might attract a neighbour or a policeman i know the place well enough to find my way about it in the dark youre a clever girl jennett gilead gave ever so slight a start you can find your way to everything i hardly expected you would turn up to your appointment in this fog how long had you been waiting i got here when i told you in my wire that i should and with the key and all by why here why not in the old place what a cur you are tizzy dont you understand because shes polluted it for me if you want me back you must find me another place than that you might have got through that little time of separation i think without filling it in with a fresh fancy ah there you were the most unreasonably jealous my darling was i you are lying you know what a dd fool you must take me for well just assure me please that your answer to my wire was gods truth you have got rid of her yes on my honour jennett she is gone thats well for you it is you dont mean to tell me you would really have gone those lengths in revenge wouldnt i and further after all that id trusted to you what did i trust to you i played my part faithfully didnt idid the housemaid proper goosed the poor postmanhis face is before me now with its sick gone look as i palmed the receipt that i pretended to put with a kiss into his pouch why valkenburg made proposals to me too and handsome ones i never told you that but he did and i was true to you and all the time you were filling my place with that barnes devil i wonder i didnt murder you both but luckily i had a safer and a surer means to pay you outthe dummy parcel itself which i hadnt destroyed as you wanted me to but had kept and hidden against accidents you know that now dont you and are willing to do anything to save your beastly skin ah you are very hard and cruel what have you done with it all in good time you thought you had got me safe enough didnt you when i perjured my soul for your sake to ruin that miserable young fellow i hadnt found out about you then but knowing you i had had the wit to keep my piece of evidence as a precaution my word would have gone for nothing by itself but with that to back it you were dished and done for tizzy i got just a fragment of pleasure out of the thought of your face when you received my letter without an address telling you what id kept and had in my power to use did you that is very well i tell you it almost breaks the heart that loves you so much such cruel treachery well it was lucky for you i saw your advertisement and now just tell me what you meant by talking about forgiveness in it it seems so base of you little girl you had chosen to misunderstand my connection with miss barnes was one of sympathy and mutual assistance in a difficulty you were never once forgotten by meno never and i had to have a typewriter im a fool tizzy i despise you and i mistrust you but god help me i love you i shall know why someday i daresay i dont now but i cant help it do you know why i wired you to meet me here how can i it is hidden in this house where i knew i could get it when i wanted it having valkenburgs key i didnt fancy the risk of keeping it about me where jennett little darling shall i tell you at last if you want to save your poor unhappy lover jennett it is just time there are suspicions awakened only today i had a visit from that stupid interfering ass balm of lambs agency who came to enquire about things on behalf of the postmans old mother it is hidden behind that picture on the wall ah my god what a rash place valkenburgs old father let me go while i fetch it tizzy the girl by her voice was crying hysterically not for a moment think what i have done for your sake tizzy im going to drop take me into the back roomthere is a sofa there gilead the skin of his scalp prickling heard the two move slowly along the hall and enter the room beyond his face was white and stern the providence which had brought him acquainted with the details of this infernal plot to ruin an innocent man would surely not stultify its own design at the last the girl was still sobbing bracing every nerve to his task he lost not an instant but treading like a cat stole out into the hall and reaching the picture felt behind it unavailingly the sobs ceased suddenly desperate he switched on his torch saw a little white packet stuck between frame and canvas seized his prize and made for the door even as he lifted the latch there came a rush from the room behind him a mad oath a flash and slam and a bullet splintered the panel close by his head in another moment he was out and plunging for the steps something took his hat with a plop and then the merciful fog received him and he was runningrunning bareheaded for his life a sense of uproar of crackling fires seemed to goad him on and wing his steps instinctively he had turned the corner out of the main road and was flying along dorset street and then all in a moment he became conscious that his own racing heart was his sole company and recovering his reason he slowed down and began to consider his bearings mr abel hamlin ran straight into the arms of a contiguous police officer who had been attracted by the sound of the shots the revolver still being clutched in his hand and his explanation failing to give satisfaction he was incarcerated pending enquiries these resultedgilead in the meantime having found his way by desperate courses to scotland yardin his indefinite detention on the twin charges of conspiracy to defraud and attempted murder it was a heartless business as it came to be revealed hamlin superintendent ingram to the contrary had really been in a ruinous financial fix he was a creature all selfishness and sensuality and the scheme cleverly worked seemed fairly safe from detection the girl jennett his mistress and decoy an actress and prestidigitateur by profession had imposed herself as a servant upon valkenburg to whom she was unknown the dutchman though perfectly innocent of any share in the plot was susceptible the girl pretty and the bait took valkenburg a traveller in diamonds was led to expect the receipt of a parcel of stones from hamlin with whom he had had some past dealings the parcel as he was able to swear was never delivered hamlin wrote to enquire as to the nonacknowledgment of its receipt and so the conspiracy was launched the decoy in the meantime had been plying the unhappy young postman with her coquetries he took fire readily on the morning of the delivery of the registered packet she pretended to procure her masters signature to the receipt which in the course of some playful passages under the mistletoeit was christmas timeshe feigned to return with her own fair fingers to baxters pocketbook sending her victim on his way to doom and disgrace with a bounding heart and a mind wholly absorbed in its own amorous raptures to the last the poor dupe had believed in her affection and had hoped against hope that she would exonerate him but miss jennett when once he was disposed of had discovered a more personal call upon her interests in the infidelity of her confederate and the means he had taken to kill time during the weeks of their enforced separation promptly she had disappeared and from some unknown address written to upbraid the delinquent with his treachery and to inform him as to her precautionary preservation of the registered packet it was found when opened by gilead in the presence of superintendent ingram to contain a few fragments of coal addressed of course to valkenburg in hamlins writing and of her intention to use it for the purpose of revenging herself on him the advertisement in the agony column had resulted and finally after a struggle with herself she had telegraphed to her scoundrel to meet her outside the house in the vauxhall bridge roadwith what result here witnesseth the villain in chief received an exemplary sentence and baxter his majestys gracious pardon for being innocent but the post office naturally enough would not employ him again and gilead great to the end found a situation for him as to miss jennett she simply repeated her former tactics and disappeared chapter x the quest of the shadow there came a certain september evening whose memory was destined to imprint itself ineffaceably on the souls of the three most intimately associated in the conduct of the agency gilead had left the office betimes to attend a meeting convened for the purpose of discussing the arts education bill a measure which it was proposed to bring before parliament and for whose actual initiation he himself was more than anyone responsible its main purpose was to reform and direct popular taste in all matters which met the eye to prevent the disfigurement of the land to see that desirable sites were ennobled with suitable erections to control the abuse of advertisements to lead the common view by the ways of beauty and fitness to an appreciation of both the promoters of the bill men of a rare educational foresight founded their propaganda on the truth that while learning is subjective taste is objective and that it is of little use thinking to conduct towards a millennium of good taste through groves of architectural and other abominations which outrage every principle of it their idea was that as oxygen enters by the mouth to purify the living blood so taste must be taken in at the eyes to illuminate and refine the intellectual process and that forcibly to educate the community to an understanding of good things while confronting and environing it with the very opposite is to be likened to putting a man into a lazaretto for a restcure in short they believed that the era of universal gentlehood which we all desire and can only at present see squalidly foreshadowed in the cheap presumption engendered of compulsory education is to be approached through the eyes rather than the intellect and that every desecrated site every wanton outrage on nature every vulgar tasteless and pretentious edifice allowed to be erected is by so much a setback to the progress of racerefinement wherefore they proposed in the first instance the establishment of a governmental board of callaesthetics or beautyscience whose expenses should be met by a levy on the local rates and whose business it should be to consider the external plans of every building public and private it was proposed to alter or erect and to approve or if offensive to the cultivated eye reject the same the control of structural details was to remain in the hands of municipal and local bodies since these were business matters fit for men of business and demanding only practical qualifications the scheme a very fond one to gileads heart need not here be discussed in detail it aimed generally at the overthrow of the tyranny of the vulgarian embodied a central committee of artexperts with official representatives in every capital town and was immensely farreaching in its purposes and if it was doomed to failure it was not so doomed on practical grounds but on the unquestionable liberty of the subject to make himself as offensive as he likes within the law on the night in question gilead after attending the meeting had dined en famille with a cabinet minister in sympathy with its objects he left early purposing to pay a visit to the agencylongclosed of coursein order to consult some papers bearing on the matter as nodding to the porter who admitted him he climbed the long stairs to his private room a queer sense of something accompanying seized upon him all in an instant it was a quite odd and unusual feeling breaking into a preoccupation which had been profound he looked right and left in a curious way stopped considered a minutethen with a little laugh moved on and up the feeling had gone perhaps he thought it had outstripped him in that momentary pause the little shock and throb of nerve evoked by the thought stopped him a second time he gave a selfconscious look first upwards then backwards saw the hall empty and the porter gone laughed once more but uneasily and turned the corner of the stairs that mounted to his room certainly he did pause in a quick trepidation as he fitted in the key his breath fluttered uncomfortably a sense of enormous isolation in those attics of swimming night gripped and astounded him he began to think of the things that might come bubbling up from the wells of gloom beneath but his courage was always the master of his imagination potent as that was and the next instant he had turned the key and entered as he switched on the electric light he saw a young woman standing above the desk by the blinded window in the first moment of discovery he would not doubt but that the figure was that of miss halifax herself either remaining or returned after hours to get through some arrears of work he would not doubt i say though he had never yet known the amanuensis moved to such a course but in reality he was fighting for nerve and resolution to meet a shock which he foresaw to be inevitable and the next instant it came the figure turned revealing itself that of a stranger seemed to look at him intently and in the very fact was gone for minutes gilead remained perfectly motionless where he stood heroes like monarchs should meet death erect and so had not he met and overcome it he thought that if he had moved in the first shudder of the blow he would have fallen and died the realization that hehe himselfhad seen an apparition had endured that mortal experience from whose fear all take refuge in scepticism was like a sudden shocking revelation of a friends treachery reason alone could surmount the horror and he waited rigidly for reason to return when it did he was surprised to find what emotions swept in with it he had looked into the eyes of a tragedy deep beyond sounding what it meant he could not know yet some intimacy engendered of that soulsearching had awakened in him a pity profound beyond terror his face was very pale but his lips were firmly set as he went about his business of investigating he found and expected to find nothing to explain the appearance the room was empty of all but its customary appointments having satisfied himselfeven as to the absurdest most attenuated lurkingplaceshe switched off the light locked the door deliberately behind him and descending the stairs summoned the porter he had just a single question to ask the man he put it to him as nonchalantly as possible he supposed in short that no lady had come to request an interview with him after closingtime or had been invited to await his possible return the answer was uncompromising indignantly selfrighteous reassuring for the best of its worth the porter knew his duty better he was not to be bought or wheedled into such an abuse of trust gilead congratulated him and went out into the night its familiar commonplaces both comforted and jarred upon him he felt like a convalescent from some nearmortal illness welcoming back life while halfregretting his balked escape from it but the direction he instinctively took brought solace to him with every step it was over miss halifaxs desk that the apparition had bent it was to miss halifax that he turned for reassurance and explanation would she have gone to bed he put on agitated pace with the thought the flat was close by and he was not long in reaching it finding the liftporter absent he ran up the stairs in his impatience and came upon the gentleman himself in whispering colloquy with the maid at the young ladys door the two were full of confusion he put it and them pleasantly by intimating that he would announce himself a sound of music came from the drawingroom and without ceremony in his urgency he opened the door softly and entered miss halifax was seated at the piano and over her his arm familiarly wreathed about her neck stood herbert nestle they both started and turning on the instant the girl rose to her feet mr balm she whispered the colour fled from her face as he looked at her the secretary stood as he had stepped suddenly back hanging his head sheepishly without a moments hesitation and with a smile on his lips gilead shut the door and hurried forward o you must forgive me he said it is quite undesignedquite but being so let us all congratulate ourselves on this accident i have long suspected this believe me and i wish you both happiness with all my heart but why would you never tell me be assured i should have honoured and rejoiced in the confidence veras lips moved but no sound came from them she glanced at the secretary he lifted his head and cleared his throat in a sudden spasm his face was as pale as the young ladys his eyes seen through his glasses expressed even a magnified perturbation ii was on the point of going sir he said youyou implyyou anticipate at least i hope not i am sure not answered gilead gravely you must balance the significance of your words nestle you should know me sufficiently by this time to trust in the fullness of my sympathy there is no reason in the world why this should longer be kept a secret and if you ever had any doubts as to my personal approval so far as it is in question rest convinced that i could imagine no union more ideally conceived you will not consider yourselves he said his voice quivering a little when wedded and because wedded the less wedded to our joint interests i am certain with tears springing to her eyes the young lady took an impulsive step forward mr balm she beganthis mistake he interrupted her gently but peremptorily was diffidence ever so perverse it is no mistake it must be none i have not failed to observe i say nor must herbert fail to understand the dishonour his shyness does you by implication well if it is a fact that he was on the point of going absolutely sir said the secretary then said gilead with a smile i will beg you nestle to entrust this rare possession to me for a few minutes i had come in fact in an emergency to consult miss halifax and hence my intrusioni will not call it mistimed there was no gainsaying his ruling he himself saw the secretary to the door and parted with him with a squeeze of the hand for her sake nestle he said your engagement must not go longer unacknowledged returning to the room he found the girl toying with some music at the piano her back turned to him he stood silent a moment and then he exclaimed with a scarce perceptible sigh i can say no more in honour now than god bless you both miss halifax a little to his surprise she faced round on him on the instant her cheeks like sunset roses her eyes were sparkling a psychologist might have read in their expression an impatience of his intolerable stupidityor chivalry but in the very act a consciousness of something unusual in his look startled and checked her and the shadow as it were of a desperate word on her lips faded and passed mr balm she saidher breath came quickwhat is it what is the matter he looked straight into her eyes i have seen a ghost he said she was the last from being feminine in the foolish sense she searched his face a moment then her own very white seated herself on the musicstool and looked up at him steadily whose she said ah he answeredi thought perhaps you could tell me i she exclaimed i had a reason for returning to the office tonight he said that was only a few minutes ago as i mounted the stairs it seemed to me that something went beside me and when i paused passed on and up i was in a deep abstraction at the time and the condition most favourable they say to ghostseeing yes i can understand itwhen the consciousness of externals falls away i felt oddvaguely indescribably expectant of something and when i opened the door it was therethe figure of a young woman her eyes never left his face but her lips though they moved uttered no sound it stood he said in the corner by the window leaning over your desk as i regarded it it turned looked at me and was gone he paused a moment before he went on i was calm on the whole i searched the room thoroughly there was no explanation some might say perhaps that the very nature of our business invites its visitations if you feel nervousthat spot henceforth and its associations she rose hurriedly interrupting him seeing her so white he instinctively advanced an arm to her support she caught and held to it more in her secret heart from emotion than weakness i would not surrender itthe place where i sitfor the world she said in a low full voicethe least if i thought that any troubled soul had sought it for help and counsel now before god said gilead that is to regard it in the gentle lightnot christian but christlike yes some troubled soul you shame me out of fear tell me she said looking in his facedid you see this apparition plainly for the moment he answered as plainly as i see you now can you describe it yes i can describe it it bore the appearance ofno it was a young woman very young and in a way attractive there was an expression on her facehow can i explain it can you imagine a spoilt child its tearful pettishness corrected for the first time in its life by a heavy blow the shock the amazement the rising flood of selfpitythey seemed all there in suspense i am putting it very badly i know but that is the impression it conveyed to me as to distinctive features there was a very definite vertical line between the eyebrows apparent even in repose and quite peculiar in so pretty a face that and the protruding very scarlet lower lipbut after all i am no more than generalizing and it was vividineffaceable does it suggest anything whatever to you i cannot be quite surethe general impressiontell me how was she dressed ah dressed i am not certain i can remember she was slight she wore a large black mushroomshaped hat with cherries in it i noticed that her neck was white because her frock was cut rather low about it and that her arms were bare from the elbow and i noticedyes i noticed that she had on a weddingring for her closed left hand was lifted to the light it was not a weddingring it was a little common turquoise thing the stones turned inwards to her palm to deceive miss halifax good god you know who it was yes i know she answered hardly above a whisperi am sure i know the hatyes and the description she was to have come to me again in her need poor wretched importunate child if all else failedand it has failed she was so patently agitated that he turned away during the minute in which she fought to recover herself now she said let us talk it over please you have described i havent a doubt poor cicely fleming she was one if not of the submerged tenth of those that buoy themselves on scraps of driftwood and float on for a littlea typist trained in an office and afterwards seeking to make herself an independence through a small private connection i need not dwell upon her story so many of them lacking the essential fibre go under passionate wrongheaded persistent only in her claim to more consideration than she deserved she fell an easy prey to flattery a little better luckfor herand she might have become a good mans vixen as it was a villain found and used her he came in the guise of a clientshe confessed it all to meand when sin called for its wages he left her alone to bear the penalty and disappeared you will understand mr balm will you not the girl was only one of the many whose misery is my province in her despair she advertised for a little loan of fifteen pounds to tide her over a trouble i understood of course and had her here that was a week ago perhaps she was ready with her poor storywas married of course in all but the name she would not give me his she still had hopes that his desertion was only temporaryeasy of explanation and she would not yield his name to scandal he had promised her before he went that he would let her know where to follow him and she had promised for her part to be loyal and silent only the weeks had gone on and he had made no sign and at length driven to desperation yes yesshe advertised she could not work her rent was in arrears i made heri hope you will justify me mr balm she so clung to me so opened her poor little bursting heart with all its load of passion and vanityi made her an advance provisionally with a promise of further help if she should need and apply to me again i justify you i bless you and congratulate myself the girl rose to her feet greatly overcome she is only one she said and there are so many why of all is it she to return and haunt us what has happened what does it presage hush said gilead you must not give way that is for me to discover tell medid she ever give you her address o yes it is in the york road not far from waterloo station i have it written down i will fetch it for you he glanced about him when he was left alone this room so warm and fragrant and quiet its intimacy was to count henceforth among the ghosts of lost and vanished things he had been haunted and doubly haunted this night but the spectre of a hopeless passionhe recognized it now had come to realize it in a momentwas the spirit potent above all others to possess and absorb a man in its shadow all lesser visitations sank into insignificance are you not frightened said the girl as returning she put the address into his hand no he said with a smile there is nothing necessarily terrifying in this psychists will tell you that intense desire may and often does manifest itself in bodily shape to its object what more likely than that miss fleming being seized with an ungovernable wish to consult you flew astrally to the one spot she associated with your presence o i hope so she answered earnestly i hope it is nothing worse than that you are not going there tonight yes tonight but it would be unadvisable cruel to delay i had better see her if possible at onceat least learn what i can of her movements she stopped him an instant to say you never rest or spare yourself where help may be givenand thereafter the look in her eyes alone haunted him he went like a soul exalted through some great renunciation his flesh knew no tremors nor his spirit weakness it was but a few minutes drive at top speed to his destination it seemed to him a sparrow flight from kerb to kerb big ben was booming out eleven as he mounted three or four steps to a dingy door in the york road the house to which it belonged was of the typical lowlondon pattern it was one of a rowone of a black sooty wall of houses so like its neighbours and its neighbours neighbours inside and out that if cogia hassan had come in the night and played general post with the numbers of them all the life of the terrace would probably have continued with as little sense of dislocation as if number tens letters were not being delivered at number fourteen or number twelves lodger had not come home at midnight to sup on number eights bread and cheese gilead looked down into the squalid area and up at the dirty fanlight over the door where a card warped and bleared with age bent curiously to canvas the unlikely likelihood of his applying for the apartments it advertised and he wondered if the mines the docks princetown itself were not preferable to existence in such a place so dreary so colourless so uneventful he had time to consider and was indeed beginning to judge his mission fruitless for that night when the door opened suddenly and a large man with a candle in his hand appeared standing in the opening o said gilead good evening to you are you the landlord at the acceptable word the individual backed heavily motioning him to enter gilead had been prepared for the typical lodginghouse shrew tart hungry aggressive instead he saw before him a substantial churchy gentleman like a sanctimonious verger with a moist lip and sidewhiskers his waistcoat and trousers were black his coat was off and his shirtsleeves were rolled up to the elbow i have come said gilead to enquire about a miss fleming does she live here a certain tentative smile oily and ineffable left the mans lips on the instant work said he its late to come on business its late as you say is she up shes up to too much of this sort of thing to suit my book said the landlord with a disagreeable change of manner i dont keep your kind of shop mister no shes not up and shes not in where is she i dont know i believe you do will you please to get out now or shall i call the police i will save you the trouble said gilead in fact he had observed the approach on the moment of a constable known to him gregory he said will you come here a minute this person is pleased to question my credentials i only ask you to convince him o ill convince him sharp enough mr balm sir said the officer i meant no offence said the landlord in an injured voice you have given none said gilead on the contrary i gather some reassurance from your manner only you jump too hastily to conclusions mr nolan said the constable now mr nolan said gilead i ask you in the presence of this officer does miss fleming live here the man looked from one to the other his face perspired she did he said until three days ago where has she gone how am i to know that is not for me to say but i intend to find out i dont want to prevent you said the manbefore god i dont she owed me money she was given money to pay you she didnt pay me thennot in full what are you driving at ill tell you the truthevery word of it so far as im concerned observe gregory said gilead shes lodged with me a year and more said the landlord i dont know who she was nor where she come from we cant afford to be particular here about references it was enough for me that she kept a typewriter and paid her rent off it people visited her on businessof course they did it was no call of mine to enquire into their charactersno not even when they left late there was amany of them men and women and i swear i havent even my suspicions she came to be in troubleit was plain enough to see and then her customers fell off she owed me money i say and i told her she must go humanitys a luxury for the rich and i couldnt afford it at the last she found me something on account and at the last of all she came to tell me that it was all right that he was going to do the handsome thing by her and that he had written to her to join him wild horses wouldnt drag from her where or what was the mans name she had promised him she said and once arrived she was going to write to me and settle my account i saw her off myself from waterloo i always liked the girl in spite of her temper and i carried down her bag for her and saw her start by the windsor train that was three days ago and an end of her so far as any message to me is concerned she went by the windsor train you say that is so sirthird class single and as she had only a fipun note left i lent her a half sovereign to pay for her ticket and she gave me eight shillings change its the truth what reason should i have to deceive you none whatever and no intention to the landlords astonishment the stranger shook him warmly by the hand you acted according to your lights said gilead and they shone on the whole you have no suspicion where shes gone not a ghost sir or of the mans name even less if possible im sorry to have disturbed you mr nolan goodnight gregory said gilead as leaving the petrified householder he walked away with the constable this is all greek to you of course isnt there some saying about a nod sufficing for a wise man and a rod for a fool i daresay there is mr balm i wonder which i am windsor is a terminus on the south western isnt it and she took the windsor train third class single her ticket cost two shillingstwentyfour miles at a penny a mile that ought to tell us what station she was bound for it ought sir i think youre very clever o dont anticipate the rod may be in pickle for me yet well its too late to put it to the proof for tonight goodnight gregory nevertheless he went to the station too restless to postpone conclusions altogether applying his test to the timetable he found that the twentyfour mile theory carried him to datchetnot a mile before or beyond there was a train that started at ten minutes after midnight should he dare everything and go by it a taxicab whirled him to his rooms waited while his whirled together a few necessaries whirled him back again at am he was hammering still highly strung at the door of the solitary inn in datchet reason and reaction only came with the morning his prescience and his calculations seemed all ridiculously out of gear he quite blushed over his coffee and kidney thinking of the shame of the castigation he had earned for his shoulders no doubt the two shillings had represented only part of the price of the ticket the remainder being supplied from miss flemings own pocket or perhaps she had taken but not used the whole of that sum retaining a few pence for tips either way hopelessly threw out his reckoning he felt so discomfited all of a sudden that he was almost on the point of taking the next train back to london however he forbore deciding for his restoration on a balmy day in the country and evading even in thought all tentative enquiries as to recent arrivals in the village he set out after breakfast for a walk it was a sweet and glowing morning of late september frank fresh and lifestirringthe last to associate itself with thoughts of death and apparitions the whole country seemed enjoying a restful convalescence from the low fever of august the blatant tripper had fled blazers of garish hue flowered no longer among the rushed the sweeping cry of the swallows cut the wide air in place of chaff and banjo walking round by the victoria bridge gilead stopped to lean over the parapet and drink in the quiet beauty of the scene to his right stretched the stately treehaunted swards of the home park the foliage just touched as with healthy sunburn a royal lodge with a pleasant garden watched the bridgeend below the water sparkled on in a neverending pageant of ripples to the left a long withybed bushed with paleleafed alders reached away towards the village in a green perspective here was favourite mooringground for houseboats since the royal demesne on one side and the osiers on the other kept the place private and unapproachable in august one might see a dozen of them anchored off the willowbankvessels of varying degrees of importance from the magnificent floating pleasurehouse to the cocky little bombketch with a cuddy for cooking and sleepingplace now however all were gone but twoa huge hulk of a thing patently deserted and dismantled which lay away towards datchet and a much smaller affair moored just clear of a patch of rushes but a long stonesthrow from the bridge on which he stood gilead wished to find that this boat was abandoned also there was not a soul to be seen or heard anywhere he liked to think that the place was utterly given over to autumn and its fragrant silences but in that he was to be disappointed as he leaned half hypnotised watching the running water and conscious of the pale green oblong of the little houseboat coming indistinctly into his field of vision of a sudden something moving there caught his attention and he raised his head a man in grey flannels and a lowbrimmed panama hat was stepping from its side into a rowing skiff and the next moment he had cast off and was pulling towards the bridge as the boat approached gilead saw that there was a woman seated in her stern he had not observed her enter and was quite startled for the moment but the next he reflected that his abstraction might easily account for the mistake and he smiled over his own befooling but the smile in the very instant of its birth withered from his lips the skiff came on fast urged by muscular one might have thought furious arms and as its occupants forged into clear range he saw bare arms and a bare neck and a black mushroomshaped hat with cherries in it his heart seemed to leap so that it left a physical pain he stood rigid preparing for the charge and the next moment the boat had swept under the bridge carrying with and in it the apparition of last night with its vanishing nerve returned to him he hurried across the road to see the boat shoot from the further side yet quick as he was the rowers energy was so great that it was already three times its own length beyond as he caught at the railing the man as if moved by some telepathic instinct lifted his face and saw him he stopped on the instant resting on his sculls a minute must have passed thus while they regarded one another each perfectly still in his place neither did the figure of the girl now with its back to gilead make the least movement the boat with the way on it continued to float upstream the face of the staring man grew smaller and less distinct but it was always to gilead a stiff blotch of yellow like the face of a rigid corpse he could not have said why it struck him thus but so it did it was a not uncomely face of the strong bluntfeatured type in itself the man had looked young though past his first youtha muscular compact fellow with curly dark hair and a hint of swagger and vulgarity the cock of his hat the brilliant scarf about his waist confessed the bounder yet what did a bounder on the river in lateseptember something redeeming the watcher hoped and prayed yet there had seemed little that was human in that face it had contrasted oddly with the pink and white of the girls just glimpsed in passing the apparitions was the reassuring one of the two suddenly as he looked the rower resumed his sculls but he paddled slowly his eyes on the figure on the bridge all the while not until the boat had vanished round a bend were they gilead felt withdrawn releasing him to his own thoughts those were strange enough in all consciencecompact of wonder and perplexity it was a certain comfort to him to find his theory vindicated that he had run his quarry actually to earthor water it was a comfort also to find that last nights case psychically was one of those as he had suggested of astral visitation and that his ghost had represented no disembodied spirit the girl had passed at this moment beneath his eyes alive and in the flesh which laid all haunting of a worser suspicion at the same time what intensity of longing had materialized her spirit in miss halifaxs place and how was he without laying himself open to a charge of insufferable interference to find out he crossed the bridge again and stared at the palegreen houseboat it lay very solitary well off the bank in a deep pool near the rushes as far as he could make out it appeared a luxurious wellfitted craft of moderate size with an over awning and plenty of bright brass about it while swinging at its stern was a smart racing punt well that told him nothing unless perhaps that its owner was independent and welltodo he might discover maybe more at datchet oddly preoccupied he continued his walk lunched at windsor and leisurely towards evening returned to the village and strolled down upon the hard the river looked pleasantly inviting and a thought occurred to him averse from exciting too much curiosity he decided upon hiring a boat and boatman and while being pulled upstream putting what cautious questions should occur to him a minute or two later he was afloat i was looking over the bridge this morning he said presently who owns that green houseboat near by the dragonfly sir name of dangerfield sir said the man hes said to be an acting gentleman he took it off of another party for the season he makes the season a late one it seems the man laughedsignificantly gilead fancied honeymooning perhaps he continued i saw him as i passed put off with a lady yes i seen her said the manwe all seen her and like her looks as little as he seems to its not his first they comes and goes and we asks no questions this one turned up from nowhere three days ago she was just there and maybe in a week or so shell be gone o hes a caution gilead bit his lip considering awhile why dont you like her looks he asked suddenly the man paused in his rowing to squeeze his mouth together why he said vacantly i shouldnt fancy her for a mate thats all mostly temper in a face makes a man hot to look at it but hers turns one cold its my opinion hes hooked a fish this time thats one too many for him he looks as if hed like to shake her off and cant and is mortal afeard of being pulled in himself theyre up and down the river these three daysup and down she might for all the love thats lost between em be in another boat and he bursting himself trying to pull away from her hoho its a queer startand here they come too gilead sat up they had reached the withybed and suddenly round the counter of the big dismantled houseboat shot the skiff with the man and woman in it it would have moved faster than before in any case going downstream but no normal pace appeared sufficient for the rower who sculled with a fury that seemed to make the planks of the frail craft stretch and gape from time to time since his companion sat without movement not steering he would turn his head to snatch a course and it was in one of these glances that when close upon it he saw the other boat as instantly as in the morning he stopped the skiff sped past and in a moment was twenty astern if he asked my advice i should say a liverpill said the boatman did you see his face sir gilead nodded how could he have failed toor that other the face of last night it had not looked at him its eyes he had seen were fixed unwinkingly on the livid mask before them but there had been the same expression of startled resentment the same suggestion of obstinate importunateness the same frowning vertical line between the brows the same full lower lip so full and so scarlet that it might have stood for a vampires gorged with blood hullo said the boatman hes turning by his looks to come after us he put his back into his work but sure enough sturdily as he pulled the skiff overhauled them more than half way up the withybed it passed hugging the shore so that the faces were sunk in shadow keep it up said gilead i want you to take me to the dragonfly he had made up his mind in that moment after all cicely fleming had sought the help of the agency and was entitled to its advice and if necessary its protection he could not altogether ignore that shadowy appeal it must have portended something and it would be base to turn away leaving it unquestioned the boatman bending to his task the skiff gained so little on them that at the last reach coming out into the open to avoid the rushes it was a bare fifty yards ahead as it made straight for the palegreen houseboat lying solitary on the water but it had kept and even increased its lead a little as it ran home and the man leapt on board and disappeared into the saloon gilead could not guess why he thus and so obviously fled to escape him he felt his own task to be a gentle and propitiatory one and he had no intention of imperilling its object by assuming any impertinently censorious attitude moreover how was his intention foreseenunless indeed the girl herself had recognised and explained him he saw her just an instant standing at the door and then she too vanished a score of strokes now and they were across the intervening space when at the moment the boatman unshipped his left scull to run under the dragonflys counter sudden and startling a shot slammed out from within the man gripping at the gunwale slipped his hand in the shock then caught on again and held god of mercy sir he exclaimed whats that he had hardly spoken when gilead with a white face was up and on board he ran round and was out of sight in an instant immediately a faint cry came to the ears of the waiting man he hallooed in answer but shakily and sat sweating in his place suddenly his fare reappeared but approaching agitated from the further end hes shot himself through the head said gilead hoarsely the revolvers in his hand you must fasten on and come up good godthe girl whats become of her ive been right through the boat the man heaved himself like a rheumatic creature to his feet his cheeks were patched with yellow he fancied the job the least in the world but he came and saw and was very sick by and by dead he whispered a man cant live without a head but whats become of her she must be hidingshe cant have got away or did heno there was only one shot they hunted high and low they ransacked every corner i saw her standing thereat the doorbut a moment ago said gilead gulping the boat lay moored in its placid pool everything around slept quiet and unruffled not a ripple not a swaying in the reeds was there to account for the instant disappearance the punt swung by its painter the skiff floated as it had been run in its nose wedged under the counter suddenly the man gripped gileads sleeve and pointed look sir he saidthem cushions where she sat image imagesimgjpg caption look sir he saidthem cushions where she sat they were soft silken wellrounded things and they showed no least impression of anybody having recently rested on them im off sir said the man he went scrambling for the boat white to the lips once secure in his seat he looked up i understand now he said what he was atrying to escape from theres more somewhere here than meets the eye come along sir in gods name no said gilead go you while i wait and fetch assistance supposing that we both went and somebody not knowing were to board here and look in merciful and considerate for others as always he set himself resolutely to endure his vigil there was a strange scene at the inquest which led to its postponement sine die the body was identified as many people will remember and the fact reaffirmed for all that it is worth that a firstrate actor may be a tenthrate man this man had led the double the quadruple lifea brutal worthless creature whose crowning grace had been his ending it voluntarily he was married and had children fortunately for them he had played and he died under a nomdethtre but the odd thing at the inquest was the conflict of evidence as to his latest victim even local witnesses when questioned as to her local existence faltered and contradicted themselves they fancied that they had seen some one with him on this day or the other but when confronted with the oath they would not swear it would have been comical if not so tragical it was the great london philanthropistby then made known and suitably reverencedwho caused the final sensation in the coroners court gilead had risen to account for his presence on the scene he had described how in the interests of his agency he had traced a very vilelyused young woman to the neighbourhood with the purpose of redeeming her if possible from the shame and saving her from the misery to which she appeared committed and there he had hesitated and stopped it had been unnecessary and quite useless to quote the supernatural raison dtre of his mission but how was he going to deal with the illusion if illusion it were which had lured him to a pursuit otherwise unjustified his companion on the occasion had already wavered like the others in his evidence there might have been someone he had ventured vacantlyhe was not surethe sun in his eyes and so forth and then even he gilead had found himself unaccountably wondering if the apparition might not have been after all but a bugbear of the suicides own haunted conscience hypnotically suggested to others he answered a remark from the coroner abstractedly looking down i believe that the young woman in question joined the deceased on the date specifiedmy information justifies the assumption and then he had glanced up given a very palpable start and continued mechanically like one repeating a lesson i believe that he met her by appointment that he took her to the boat and that during the next two days she was often seen with him in the flesh upon the water i believe that during the night of the third day he murdered her and sunk her body in the deep pool under the houseboat and that it lies there now that is my opinion siri cannot explain whyand i give it to you to act upon as you think fit exitus acta probat here was the sensation and with every incitement on the initiative of such a witness to prosecute it to the end that end makes a wellknown chapter in criminal history the inquest was adjourned the river dragged and the body of the unfortunate girl actually found as suggested she had been shot in the breast lashed firmly to a heavy iron bar and dropped overboard what provocation underlay the desperate horrible deed whether it had been premeditated or committed in a moment of uncontrollable frenzy will never be known nor was it known for long to any but himself and one other what had inspired gilead to that tragic statement the explanation shall be given in his own words as uttered in awe and solemnity to a young lady i had been trying to argue it out in my own mind i had fallen into a state of odd moral confusion when looking up i saw her she stood beside the coroner facing me as she had stood that night in the office and as her lips moved without sound i simply took from them and repeated the purport of their message the moment i had uttered it she was gone i spoke and walked for long afterwards as in a shattering a tremendous dream i hope and pray that such an experience can come to a man only once in his lifetime her spirit have you realized must have sprung to usto youfor help on the instant that his intention betrayed itself and afterwards whispered vera that nature of hers so persistent so vindictive o wicked as he was my whole soul shudders for him chapter xi the quest of the veiled woman to the benevolent and pitiful fifty pounds will save a wretched wife and mother from ruin and disgrace help implored by letter or personal interview address suppliant daily post no one instituting a philanthropic mission could have been less adequately equipped for it in one way than gilead himself beginning by presuming in all others an integrity as pure as his own he had from the first to put force upon his nature to cultivate that suspicion of motive that moral selfguardedness which are the first essentials of practical benevolence he had in short in recognizing the eternal human duplicities to learn to distinguish finely between cant and sincerity and he was not always successful practice and experience did much for him yet there were occasions still when guile found the opportunity to encounter him triumphantly on his emotional side such was the case in the affair which we have entitled as abovea quest which he could never recall without humiliation and the memory of which made him feel sore for years afterwards but it is true that he was hit in its connection on quite another than the humanitarian side and it was that wound no doubt which most rankled he himself saw and interviewed suppliant during the temporary and unfortunate absence of miss halifax who by his desire had undertaken the case he entrusted many such to her now especially where feminine appeals were concerned it seems slanderous to apply so shrewd a term to those soft and seductive orbs but indeed the amanuensis had a lynx eye for the shams and hypocrisies of her own sex without doubt her native perspicacity had saved her employer from the clutches of many a plausible impostor miscalled of the weaker vessel suppliantshe introduced herself hurriedly diffidently by the nameentered upon gilead in one of the unguarded moments he was impressed by her appearance at once it was all that it should have been under the circumstancesquiet and unaffected though with a suggestion of strong repressed emotion in the thicklyveiled face she seemed a young woman she was certainly a graceful and slender as her sober frock betrayed it was of black and just sufficiently faded to confess long usage there was a heavy trimming of beads at the skirt hem which weighed down its folds prettily about the tips of a couple of little shoes worn but shapely the long motor veil which embraced her hat and neck was of a heliotrope colour not so diaphanous as to reveal yet enough to suggest the entreaty of two large plaintive eyes but the attractive the moving thing about her was her voiceso soft so musical that before she had half uttered her prayer it was granted gilead as he placed a chair for the visitor apologized in his courteous way i am so sorry the lady miss halifax who has made your case her interest is unhappily engaged elsewhere for the moment if you would prefer to await her return the visitor made a little distressed movement i did not know she said hesitatingthere was that low huskiness in her voice which seems to caressi did not know since receiving your letteri heard i have been toldare you not mr balm yes i am mr balm o i dont know what to do she whispered it is so urgent and they say about you nothing unflattering i trust said gilead smiling seeing that she paused for an expression o no no answered the visitor but only that one appealing to youto you above allmay expect again she stopped reason i hope said gilead gently i try to practise it sympathy and help unless given in reason are likely to defeat their own objects are they not yes said the visitor forlornly and she seemed to droop a little does that discourage you asked the young man she raised her head is it in reason she said to expect one however merciful however pitiful to save another from the just consequences of his own misdeeds that depends said gilead whether or not mercy to the sinner entails a wrong to the sinned against she sighed and whispered i do not knowi do not know if you will only tell me you have been informed of us it seems said gilead you will have learnt in that case of the inviolately confidential nature of our mission and of the necessity it is under of demanding truth for its first desideratum you will answer my questions or not as you please but you must not be offended when i tell you that it is impossible for us to move in any matter unless in the clear light of understanding am i to ask then o if you will she murmured very well said gileadyour name it isnightingale mrs nightingale he bowed his head gravely i have your advertisement in mind i recall also your allusion to someones misdeeds was your choice of the male pronoun accidental or intentional it was intentional am i to know to whom it referred it referred to my husband he was very concerned for her she appeared to feel acutely the shame of her admission i am sorry he said sincerely sorry to have to cause you this pain but the surgical knife relentless as it seems is often the shortest cut to convalescence to his distress she uttered a little wincing cry as if the very edge of his metaphor had touched her o it was that she saidthe knife the necessity that was the cause of all he looked at her pitifully remorsefully i perceive he said that i have blundered somehow will you not say something that will put me right with myself how could you know she answered pressing an agitated hand to her bosom our gracieour one darling it was to save her sirthey had to operate at once and afterwardsthe nursing the change of air she broke off with a little gasp i understand said gilead she was your only child and her dear life was at stake you incurred expensesam i right she controlled herself with an effort sitting erect clasping and wreathing her hands before her overwhelming to people in our position she answered but he said yesit was to behe would find the means though to secure them he must sell his soul to destruction o i little guessed what fatal significance lay behind his words i trusted him i was in despair not until three days ago had i ever dared to questionto face the possible truth and then he himself struck me dumb with it to save the little life so dear to us he had robbed his employer she rose to her feet seemed to shiver and dropped back again gilead in the deepest commiseration had also risen command yourself he said tell me all you will not find me an unsympathetic confidant she appeared to cast a look at him of the most pathetic gratitude i will she saido i will we had been so happy and so contentedand then the blowthe horror his position was one of trust but indeed indeed the temptation was overwhelming he had intended the emergency once past to move heaven and earth to restore what he had borrowedonly that but fate was always against him and now at last she rose again in uncontrollable agitationtomorrow morning she said the accountants are to begin their annual examination of the books and if before then he has failed to make good the deficit we are disgraced and ruined for ever a brief silence succeeded her agonized cry during which gilead battled with his emotions it was not so much the anguish perhaps as the heartmoving tone of its utterance which stirred the very bowels so to speak of his official circumspection he made but a feeble attempt to assert his independence this story on the face of it seemed to him one of the most pitifully tragic to which he had ever listened that a man should be so cast down and trampled on in the name of fond humanity appeared to him monstrous there were some temptations which it was even irreligious to resist was not nature one with god mrs nightingale he said i need affect no hesitation in assuring you that you have my sincerest sympathy in your trouble and that your case comes directly within our province if you will kindly leave me your address something in her attitudesome suggestion of hope but half fulfilled of resignation setting itself to endure long hours of doubt and fear overcame him finally he turned to his desk sat down produced a chequebook and prepared to write no he said i will not condemn you to it the sum was fifty pounds you say i will trust you or never myself again he wrote rose and handed a draft to the visitor take it he saidi have made it payable at the counterand peace go with you he thought she was about to fall on her knees to him and he prevented her i am sure this confidence will be as sacred to you as it is to me he said there is no need to say more unless it is now to give me your address she murmured it sobbing and he took it down from her lips myrtle villa garden lane gospel oak and then with many passionate half coherent expressions of gratitude she left him he sat pondering for some little while after she was gone the glow of his impulsive action slowly cooling he would not regret it yet for some reason he felt a nervousness in confessing as would come to be necessary its nature to miss halifax he felt quite sure that she however moved would have kept the balance of her judgment at the discriminating poise during the afternoon he paid a visit to some famous auction rooms in wellington street a notable sale of japanese colour prints was advertised and the precious lots were on show gileads love for these things was either a weakness or a fine enthusiasm according to the point of view he was enraptured with the art and was a ruinous competitor where he coveted rare examples of it still as yet he was not so bitten but that he could resistoccasionallytemptation at what he considered absurdly inflated prices the final stage of the disease had not hopelessly overtaken him this day very possibly was to mark the turning point it was certainly a demoralizing display a st anthony of a virtuosic cast would have had a desperate struggle not to succumb to its seductions the walls of the big room were bedizened tapestried with a very profusion of covetable things all representing the better or best periods of the leading schools such a sale such a chance for the collector had not yet occurred in london it was to extend over five days and included examples of all the notable artists from kiyonobu to kuniyoshi gilead spent an absorbed hour or so in the room before leaving instructions as to which delectable nishikiye he wished to acquire if possible in this matter he desired to temper cupidity with reason and he put force upon himselfor imagined that he didin deciding the limits to which he would go it was no parsimony of course which moved him to this caution it was a reluctance merely to associate himself with that form of plutocracy which in its greediness to possess at any figure sets that standard of artificial values which is the despair of the poor but honest collector an admirable principle in itself though perhaps from the sellers point of view an admirably onesided nevertheless a humorist might have observed that the young gentleman was careful in the case of those prints which he particularly wanted for himself to leave bids morally calculated to beat any possible competitor out of the field it seemed the more perverse of him therefore to exhibit an obstinately inelastic spirit before perhaps the finest example of a haronobu in the room it was an exquisite thing harmonious in tone and composition perfect in registration as flawless a specimen of artistic and technical work as was ever produced by this incomparable artist it represented a young girl being carried on the shoulder of a man to a temple for the meyamairi or naming ceremony attendants following and in condition and treatment and the soft intricacies of its colour scheme it fairly baffled criticism there sir what do you think of that it was mr desmund who spoke art expert and valuer to a wellknown firm of print and book sellers he had accompanied gilead round the room booking his bidsan unwearying resourceful man with a drooping light moustache a bright complexion and pale blue eyes tired but interested he wore a loose blue serge suit with a bright tie his shoulders were bent a trifle beneath their load of specialised knowledge he was a busy soul but never too busy for enthusiasm in the right directions or to the right people what mr desmund did not know about japanese art was not in the vernacular worth the knowing there sir he said confident of the exclamation of delight that was to follow it came but in tempered form good said gilead it is a fine example he was more gratified with the print than he thought it politic to confess good said mr desmund theres not another to better or equal it in europe look at that background look at that gauffrage you should secure it mr balm you wont get such an opportunity again when does it occur for sale on the first day sir thats tomorrow yes tomorrow what will it fetchgive me an idea fifty poundsnot a penny less o thats absurd the expert tapped his notebook ive a commission myself sir for forty gilead hummed and had a little i think its preposterous its against all my principles butwell ill go to fortyfive youd better leave me a margintake my advice no a pound or two not a copper farthing youll lose it very well but i dont believe i shall not a shilling over fortyfive pounds then mr balm not a shilling he fancied the thing was a bluff and in that he wronged both the expert and himself he really coveted the print grievously but he hardly doubted that he was safe to secure it nevertheless as time went on fears began to assail him supposing after all that desmund were right in his surmise and that he should come to be outbidden it would be ridiculousan insane exaggeration of values but no one who has not lusted after a particular print book carving or any rare and costly work of art nor felt in himself the processes of that mania which beginning in a studiously qualified desire for the object mounts swiftly through growing apprehensions of rival desires to an unqualified and reckless passion to secure it can possibly enter into his feelings those grew acute with the hours and as the following morning wore on neighboured on hysteria still he fought for sanity held himself tight and when the time came obliged himself to face the dreary ordeal of lunch in the midst the haronobu suddenly rose before him stupendous irresistible and blocked all his field of moral vision he must have it he decided at any price he glanced at the clock rose snatched his hat and palpitating all through rushed for the auction room it was packed and he could barely gain the door as he did so he heard the voice of the auctioneer proclaiming lot but one step and that the wrong way removed from the object of his desire the immortal print was that moment sold whether for rapture or despair his fate was cast with that recognition of the inevitable reason if only temporary returned to him and he to his office he thought his brief dementia over and contented himself with despatching a telegram to the expert asking if he had been so fortunate as to acquire for him the print in question the answerit only arrived after an unconscionable intervalcompletely prostrated him regret sold at fifty the world was darkened heaven eclipsed for the moment life itself seemed hardly worth living the virtuoso will understand better than i can explain gilead in a state of profound depression sought out mr desmund the next morning you were right he said and i was a fool i think he emphasised it it comforted him only partially to find that every other one of his bids had been successful he received the parcel in a gloomy silence his collection minus the haronobu seemed little better than trash and vanity who got itdo you know he asked drearily mr desmund shook his head it was bought a broker sir i daresay i can find out no said gilead no after all it would only aggravate the sore the sore however healed or nearly in the process of time japanese prints were really only the recreation of a mind devoted to the interests of humanity one day weeks later gilead had occasion to motor with a friend to the city it was a dusty morning and the two wore goggles at the bank of england the car drew up by the kerb while the friend entered the building he was gone so long that gilead had ample time to study the endless types of humanity that drifted beside him they were all intent on business and moneymaking and he wondered if there was one in all the confused throng capable of properly appreciating his feelings over his lost haronobu while he gazed speculative philosophic and lazy a figure two figures standing by the end of bartholomewlane caught and fixed his attention they were so close by that he fancied they must have that moment emerged or he would have noticed them sooner one was of a woman slender graceful dressed in faded black and closely veiled the other of a little girl poorly but neatly clad and of a fairy prettiness he stirred oddly smitten with some memory and in the same instant the woman thrust out a white hand dumbly proffering to a passerby a little basketful of matches and he perceived with a certain consciousness of shock that she was begging presently he lay back again and watched the two they stood all the time he was there at the streetcorner and during that brief space he observed that they reaped quite a small harvest in silver and copper mostly people gave and demanded nothing in return now and then one would wisely insist on goods for his money men young glossy cits and sober fathers of families were moved obviously by the charm of the little face raised to themand also it seemed by something else gilead was not long in discovering what that something was the veiled woman in addition to the mystery encompassing her had whether pleading or returning thanks the softest the most musical voice it was possible to imagine he looked down at her feet the black skirt weighted with a heavy bead trimming dropped prettily about them only the veil was different yet he could not doubt for a moment that he saw before him mrs nightingale the pitiful suppliant of gospel oak had it then for all his timely help come to this and was she driven to beg upon the streets her little gracie the lure to public charity he was perplexed vaguely dissatisfied at a loss how to act when he suddenly perceived a friend of his coming round the corner from throgmorton street the young fellow paused a moment to slip a sixpence into the childs hand before he came on as he approached gilead accosted him and after greetings and a commonplace or two remarked pleasantly that was mistaken charity you know robson you should have insisted on your matchbox in exchange the other stared a moment gathered and laughed o that he said its ones instinctive homage i suppose to a lovely face and a soft voicethe two best things in nature i daresay and doesnt she know and trade on it too well if you put it that way to quite a respectable tune i should say the two are familiar figures at that cornerhave been for some time they catch the drift there you see from a dozen golden ways its a good pitch so i should think is anything known about them not that im aware its the mystery does the business you see theyre there as regular as clockwork from ten to four and then they go ive noticed them a dozen times and they always move off on the stroke gilead after parting with the young gentleman grew so restless over the nonreappearance of his other friend that in the end he left a message for him with the chauffeur and stopping a taxicab drove back to the office arrived there he instantly despatched in the same vehicle a member of his staff to gospel oak with directions to the man to make exhaustive enquiries he was already quite prepared for the result and expressed no surprise when informed that there was no such place in gospel oak as garden lane and consequently no myrtle villa and by inference no mrs nightingale her complaint it was evident dated from other and less righteous groves he prepared very stern and quietly wrathful to act upon that assumption fortunately for his purpose the weather though it did not yet rain was sufficiently threatening to justify a waterproof he selected one with a very high turnup collar in which he muffled the lower part of his face a cap pulled low down over his eyes completed a sort of disguise which he had no doubt would prove efficient a quarter to four that same afternoon saw him posted in threadneedle street at a point whence from amidst the hurrying throng he could easily watch the movements of the woman and child who were still stationary in their place at the street corner at the first stroke of the hour punctual to his information the woman took the childs hand in hers and moving away became on the instant one of the unconsidered crowd gilead followed instant but wary in pursuit she led him to the mansion house station where standing behind her he heard her take tickets for victoria whither he journeyed in a neighbouring carriage thence shadowing his quarry he ran her into an omnibus to the roof of which he himself mounted it took them by the queens road and cheyne walk to the albert bridge and across he had paid his fare for security for the entire route and was prepared therefore to descend at once when at the corner of park road the woman and child got out it was raining by then and his umbrella afforded him useful cover the child as if by established custom ran away towards the adjacent slums the woman herself walked southward down the albert road at a block of handsome flats bordering on battersea park she turned and passing without stopping through the swing doors mounted the stairs to the second floor following at her heels as close as he might venture he came upon her letting herself in at a certain door with a latchkey and even as he reached the place the door closed and he was alone he let some moments pass while he considered the situation wrathful suspicion still claimed him hotly yet he was conscious that at present it amounted to no more and that it was above all things necessary for him to behave with circumspection after a minute of deliberation he tapped resolutely with the brass knocker that hung upon the door the connoisseur in him observed as he did so that the knocker was good and an antique after some little delay the door was opened or half opened as if the person behind it questioned the character of the visitor and a woman looked out she was neat formal severe in aspect suggesting the housekeeper to a greater mansion she wore an apron but no cap her face was narrow the lips compressed her bosom flat and the hair drawn plainly down her temples yes she said in a thin harsh voice i wish to see mrs nightingale said gilead who mrs nightingale she doesnt live here said the woman and prepared to shut the door gilead quietly but effectively prevented her pardon me i saw her this moment go in he said you are mistaken sir i dont think so will you take your foot away sir or must i call for some one you may call said gilead i dont think it would be wise she may not be mrs nightingalenothing more likelyand yet fear exposure to his surprise the woman opened the door wide beckoned him in and closed it upon them what are you saying she whispered fiercely her eyes sparkled in their gloomy rings why do you speak like that on the public stair why do you force me to said gilead she stared at him a moment then come she said and led the way into a pretty room beyond its windows faced upon the park the polished floor was spread with eastern rugs chairs little tables whatnots a bookcase a dainty bureau a daintier cornercupboard all of rare old chippendale and loaded where they might be with bijoutry silver and exquisite scraps of china made up the furniture and on the walls all framed in slender white hung many beautiful specimens of japanese colour prints among them in a place of honour the very haronobu which gilead had coveted looking round and round in amazement his eyes suddenly fixed themselves on the prize and there they remained riveted while he endeavoured to take in the stupendous situation the truth dawned grew plain grew monstrous to him as he gazed she had played that trick upon him had invented that lying story with the sole purpose of acquiring its possession and out of his humanity hisyes his damned credulityhe had come to be defrauded and desolated he could not doubt it he pointed at the print speechless yes said the woman these things are a fancya crazeof my sistersi dont hold by them myselfand that is her latest she values it above everything he turned upon her goaded to frenzy your sister he criedshe is your sister and she values it does she will you i wonder when i tell you that she procured from me by fraud the money with which to pay for it i told you said the woman cold and passionless that personally i didnt hold by them this one i know was beyond our means do you know what story she invented to augment those means no sir i dont nor do i intend to ask i take it that you were her victim in some way she is a woman of the most resourceful imagination you look upon it in that light then i presume of course that you are her partner and abettor in the other fraud what fraud why this said gilead with a comprehensive disdainful gestureall the fruits i am to conclude of begging at street corners why is that a fraud said the woman not merit but natural qualifications are the key to all success it is the taking not the good person who gets on in the world if the public likes to pay toll to a lovely face a sweet voice why should we disappoint it and starve we have no other alternative believe me the child said gilead still sternlyis that hers no answered the woman she hires it we have neither of us been married and children as children are hateful to us i do not think any man could be got to marry my sister emile the face behind her veil is ravagedunsightly she owes no debt of gratitude to man or god we neither of us do they are our enemies is that a fraudthe mystery of her veil let him answer for it who wove its meshes she had been beautiful once only her voice lives and pleads in a dead land and with it and through it she obtains these means to the amelioration of her bitter lotthese little toys and graces which her soul loves and to surround herself with which she suffers and wearies through each livelong day call it a fraud if you will in this inhuman world our souls have ceased to count with us sick at heart gilead turned to the door are you going to expose her said the womanto tear her veil away no he answered i want fresh air thats all chapter xii the quest of the obese gentleman nothing short of the direct interposition of providence can be held to explain the premature chancing into gileads hands one morning of an exofficial copy of the daily post the thing might have happened on any other morning in the year and signified nothing it happened as it happened on the one and only morning on which it could signify a great deal he invariably read the times at breakfast and the other paper or nestles report on it on his arrival at the office providence desiring his independent notice of this particular issue found occasion therefore to slip under his nose a copy of it brought in and forgotten by some casual acquaintance who had sought him for a moment on a personal matter he might not have looked at it even then had he not chancedchanced mark youin rising to reach for the marmalade to tread on an iron tack now there was no reason other than a providential one why the tack should have been there no reason why it should have stood up awkwardly on its head none why its point should have penetrated the only thin place in the young gentlemans pump that all these things happened with the result that in the start and clutch he gave he knocked over the daily post and stooped to pick it up again can be ascribed to supernatural design and to that alone as he sat down shin over thigh to pluck the obtrusive nail from his sole his eye was caught by an advertisement prominent in the agony column of the paper he held in his left hand to psychisis old gentleman suffering from obesity desires disintegration and reconstitution on normal lines superfluous flesh given away to the needy no shylocks need apply gilead having extracted the nail read the advertisement again and chuckled it was of the order faceti of course wags not infrequently would thus parody the incredible absurdities of cults and cranks or even invent wilder ones in a mere frolic of animal spirits he had come across quite a number of such hoaxes in his long experience of the paper there had been for instance the two ladies who studying the endurance of physical pain desired the cooperation of another in arranging for a series of private experiments on human subjects there had been the duet of lone bachelors depressed by london sundays who invited suggestions as to how best to pass their time in any agreeable way not involving energy and those other two who being without the capacity to work invited some wealthy philanthropist to provide them with annuities and a cottage in the country meet to their leisured tastes there had been the despairing gentleman who coveted a society and a friendship unfranked by whiskies and sodas which disagreed with him and the practising barrister who had offered an equitable mortgage of his body heart excepted in return for an accommodation finally there had been the demand for a man willing to demonstrate his personal pliability on an old english rack star chamber pattern and who had been recommended by an admirable touch to be short to start with of such palpably was the obese gentleman with his superfluous flesh and gilead was on the point of laying him aside with a parting grin when his gaze was caught and riveted on an advertisement which appeared just under the one in question middleaged gentleman recommended to chop wood for obesity two hours daily seeks cheerful refined companion to work beside him away from home honorarium by arrangement address winsom wyllie daily post now we all must have observed how advertisements though of an exceptional and esoteric cast are gregarious in character that is to say if some strange want appears advertised on a particular day there will be sure to be others of its kind in company and that without any editorial provision and despite the fact that nothing of its sort maybe has occurred for weeks here one obese gentleman led to another and undesignedly one might feel sure it was simply that adiposity was in the air like a germ and affected not individuals but communities it made no difference that an obvious sincerity spoke from the second advertisementno difference to the principle i mean as to its effect upon one reader it was simply for the moment paralysing winsom wyllie those who have followed the career of our young philanthropist will not have forgotten the name of that detestable scoundrel the persecutor of the beautiful amanuensis it was peculiar one must admita name not likely to be borne by more than a single person in the world so thought gilead as with a deep sigh he struggled out of his stupefaction and reread the lines winsom wyllie so the brazen wretch had confessed himself and unblushingly at the last it was well if unlimited wealth if a soul of righteous indignation were of any avail against the forces of malignancy he should be hounded surely to his doom the means were here the way alone was the question it must not be supposed that during all these long months gilead had been content to relegate this matter to the shelf of discarded things quietly and unobtrusively he had kept it alive in his mind had prosecuted cautious enquiries had caused a persistent watch to be kept on the little house on knights hill and if all his efforts had proved in vain he had been at least able to find comfort in the conviction that the villain true to his name had scented danger and studied discretion by obliterating himself and now here he was come out into the light of day and boldly affirming his existence in the face of any whom it might concern the advertisement was nothing less than a challenge and a defiance well the gage he should find would be taken up but it was necessary of course to move with the extremest caution and circumspection nothing in the first place must be said about the matter to miss halifax lest the shock should bring on again one of those cataleptic seizures with which it was associated nor could he think himself justified in revealing unauthorized to her fianc the details of so delicate and painful a story no alone and singlehanded he must encounter the man on his own ground betraying nothing of his purpose until that purpose was accomplished the villain must be overthrown disposed of for good and all ere ever the girl should learn of the shadow that had finally been removed from her life he finished his breakfast in a very thoughtful mood and by the end of it had come to a definite resolve these two must get married with as little delay as possible there could be no better means for disposing once and for all of mr winsom wyllie and his unwelcome attentions he himself might discover and expose the scoundrel to provide vera with a legitimate protector was to render him innocuous for ever more yes it must be done and at once there was no reason in the world for delaying a consummation so sensible and so happy before starting for the office gilead took up the paper yet once more to study the advertisement and this time with a fine ironic laughter he recalled very well he believed certain descriptive epithets applied by the young lady to her persecutor he had been unusual and sinister he had been endowed with a demoniac energy he had been a dangerous man affecting piratic emblems and here he was after all grown fat confessed of middle age and recommended by his doctor to chop wood in order to reduce his bulk o to what base passes would not constitution bring us picturesqueness romance attractiveness even of the diabolic castwe were each one of us in such matters at the mercy of our stomachs no doubt this same spider indolently watchful in his web had waxed plump and round through too much feeding and too little exercise agreeable to his steadfast purpose gilead found both the secretary and amanuensis in his room when he reached the agency somewhat highstrung as he was and sensitive to impressions he seemed conscious of an atmosphere as it were of strain expectancy anxietyhe knew not what to call it but attributed it whatever it was to his own suppressed emotions however sitting down with the best air of detachment he could muster he called upon nestle for his report i have run down the column sir answered the secretary there is nothing whatever in it to detain or interest you did his own feelings mislead him or was there a hint of tremor in the young mans voice a flush of increased colour on his cheek which belied the easy assurance of his words he decided at once and definitely that the suspicion was born of nothing but his own excited fancy for the rest he was reassured to find that miss halifax herself had evidently passed by the advertisement unnoticing had her eyes encountered it all his chivalrous intent would have been balked at the outset o very well nestle he said there is as it happens a certain advertisementbut you could not have been expected to attach any importance to it from our point of view only as it chanced i saw a copy of the daily post this morning before i reached the office and he broke off lay back in his chair drew and emitted a long breath smiled and addressed himself resolutely to the two before him that is all nothing he said to the case which is just now most prominently in my mind it affects our mutual relations as it does my most earnest wishes i want you two to eschew diffidence to eschew formality to allow me to speak with the freedom engendered of our long and happy intercourse and to suggest your arranging a date for your marriage with as little delay as possible having got it out he rose to his feet miss halifax at the same moment rose hurriedly to hers her face was white her beautiful eyes seemed to have gathered in an instant dark shadows about them our marriage she whispered and then her breath caught gilead laughed half protestingly half melancholy is it such an appalling prospect he said you must not allow yourselves to doubt that for my poor practical part i will soften its acerbities to you by the best means in my power our intimacy my long debt to you both will rob that assurance of any suggestion of impertinence or ostentation i want to see you both settled and happy i am impatient for the end and if i have my reasons they can hardly be less trenchant ones than your own i ask you to marry and to marry soon if you consider any part of this obligation yours and desire to liquidate it there are the means most calculated to give me delight in the settlement now i am going to leave you alone to talk the matter over nor do i intend to refer to it again until invited by yourselveswith the assurance i shall trust that you have decided to conform to my wishes he took up his hat crossed the room patted the secretary kindly and cheerily on the shoulder bowed to miss halifax and went out for minutes after he had left the two stood silent and transfixed at length the secretary raised his face with a groan he saw itthe advertisement he said my god what a fatality she began to laugh in a mirthless unnatural way and stopped as suddenly yes he must have seen it she said what does it mean what will he do we oughtnt to doubt i suppose unless he is going to be untrue to himself for the first time in his life but he wont of course and thenwhat will come of it all she gasped and then laughed again hysterically and our marriage o it is too ridiculous herbert for pitys sake say something in reason reason or no reason spells nothing but our ruin he answered dejectedly his resolution is set and it must give us away i understand its purpose well enough he thinks our marrying will put thatthat other finally out of court but what other she said in heavens name what other he laughed even more hollowly than she had god knows he said the devil has hoist us with our own petard she passed her hand across her eyes in great grief and misery well she said with a quivering sigh we cant complain and i dont it is not often a woman is given such an education for the natural evil in her i think it teaches me to welcome the punishment i have striven so hard to avoid i shall be clean at last in my shame let me be the one to confess it to him that i may drink the cup to its dregs my suffering after all is worse than yours is it why cannot you guess because i have learned to love him herbert with all my heart and soul and because i must kill before his eyes the thing he has honoured kill you dont mean o dont look so scared that would be a hateful a selfish return for all his gentleness and nobilityto curse my love with a heritage of undeserved remorse but i must kill his trust for evero my dear i must i must in sudden uncontrollable anguish she threw herself into her chair and flinging her arms over the desk buried her face in them in the meantime gilead returning to his chambers set himself to concoct an epistle at once guarded and alluring to the obese one it was a delicate task and one or two trials were needed before he could satisfy himself as to the suitable form this finally was the answer he despatched mr george barnwell the name occurred to him somehow without suggesting any associations presents his compliments to mr winsom wyllie and having noticed that gentlemans advertisement in the daily post begs to offer himself as a candidate for the post in question mr g b thinks that he may lay claim to the qualifications desired he has been well educated he has seen something of life he has learnt from his montaigne that silence and modesty are qualities very serviceable in conversation finally he may boast he believes of being capable of his hands and he is quite willing to refer the question of the honorarium to the test of his capacities he gave his address posterestante at the nearest office and settled down to await in some trepidation the possible reply likely enough none would arrive a berth which though only temporary offered itself so easy and so uncompromising must attract hundreds of those poor outatelbows gentilities who were for ever prowling in search of such occupations as their respectable inexpertness could stomach it shamed gilead to think of his seeking to take the bread out of the mouth of any poverty so mean and forlorn only his sense of desperate necessity urged him into competition with it it were surely better that one pride should hunger than that a villain should go unmasked a problematic murderer be allowed to pursue his nefarious course with impunity still his application might probably would be unsuccessful and in that case what then there would be nothing for itan undesirable alternativebut to put the police on the track of the advertiser for that day and the next he lay close not going near the agency and on the third morning there was a telegram awaiting him at the postoffice he opened it somewhat nervously and read offer accepted provisionally be ten tomorrow morning at church army home unemployed yard coldbath lane brixton ww so after all he was chosen fervently he hoped that he would not be found wanting and that thought had its necessary corollary in another what was he going to do when he met mr winsom wyllie face to face why apparently a thing which he had never done in his life beforechop wood it seemed quite paralysing astounding he had never until this moment thought out his course of action and here was the problem actually squaring up to him he had to chop woodthat was the only fact immediately plain to his comprehension true the man had behaved vilely in intention to an unhappy young woman dependent on him true that same young woman had by her own confession accused him of coercing her father into making a testament in his favour and of afterwards tempting that parent opportunely to his doom but that was all conjecture and however morally irrefutable not a particle of legal evidence existed to substantiate the charge legally indeed the heirs position seemed unassailable he had been left the property conditionally and the conditions had resulted in his favour by the provisions of the will since the young lady had failed to marry him within the year he was become the sole and indisputable beneficiary and what else nothing else vague surmises shadowy chargeswhat was there in them all gilead was worldling enough to know that there was never yet a disappointed legatee who did not hint darkly of undue influences or mental irresponsibility that a testator did not do what was expected of him was no ground for action in the eye of the law did this chivalrous spirit therefore shrink at the last from its selfimposed quest not for a moment the law to gilead was nothing but a sifter of evidence it took no cognizance of obscure motives but decided on the facts before it with which facts any clever counsel could juggle as with balls or handkerchiefs mr winsom wyllie might legally be altogether unassailable the fact remained that he was enjoying a small fortune to the possession of which another was by every moral right entitled that was enough for the paladin or was he so enjoying it that same afternoon gilead paid another visit to somerset houseonly to find that the will so far as he could discover remained yet unproved he was puzzled but on the whole reassured surely this delay argued some remorse at least some hesitation on the part of the legatee or did it imply a reluctance in him to take that step which must put his coveted victim for ever beyond the reach of his arts and solicitations whichever way nothing but advantage could accrue from his ascertaining that wealth and the power which it bestows were engaged and sternly on the side of the young lady the warning for the best of its value should not be thrown away upon such a man so audacious and yet so wary ten oclock the following morning found gilead punctual to his appointment in coldbath lane brixton it was not a prepossessing neighbourhood nor was the day exhilarating under a cloudy sky brooded an atmosphere of sticky humidity the squalor of a deeplondon slum was represented by everything in the way of dreariness but its swarming life here were the dull dwellinghouses the tawdry shops the costers barrows the stench of fish frying in rancid grease only the human congestion was lessnothing in comparison a postman with a flaccid bag suggestive of a lean correspondence over his shoulder directed him to the yard for the unemployeddirected him dubiously too knowing that want often strutted in strange guises gilead knocked on the closed gates and waited an asthmatic sound of sawing which had been audible within ceased resumed itself like an arrested cough stopped again and after an interval a slow heavy footstep approached whos there asked a weary voice george barnwell answered gilead i have come punctual to your appointment sir a clock indeed at the moment sounded the hour it took the strokes deliberately yet not so deliberately as the unseen stranger took gileads statement he appeared to ponder it exhaustively gilead could hear him through the keyhole breathing like a man asleep and gently snoring well said the voice at last i suppose i had better let you in the alternative had occurred to gilead but he thought it politic to remain silent there was the sound of a bar clanking down of a laboured sigh and one side of the gate opened just a jealous aperture through which the applicant caught glimpse of a doleful yard with a woodshed at its further end a block or two for chopping on as many threelegged stools a sawyers trestle and everywhere in littered confusion chips billets and indiscriminate debris of timber come in cant you said the voice peevishly and gilead slipping through found himself face to face with mr winsom wyllie he was in an undress of grey flannel his braces were discarded his shirt open and collarless drooped in moist folds his trousers sagged down over his boots almost concealing them behind he bore a much greater resemblance to an exhausted elephant than to any sinister figure of melodrama nor was his obverse prepossessing a lugubrious ponderous man who took his fleshiness badly a man who might have figured for an overblown clown seeing how his grizzled hair stood up from his scalp and his whiskers out from his jaws a man with a ridiculous lachrymose mouth a man whose voice had suety tears in it a man who seemed to pity himself profoundlysuch was the general impression conveyed to gilead the creatures adiposity he was no less convinced was no local rising it was a general upheaval and nothing short of a change of constitution would suffice to reduce it the stranger gilead once entered closed the gate with a fretful slam and put up the bar then he turned to regard his visitorthe visitor thought morosely hm he said at last wearily mopping his brow i have committed myself and i must go through with it i suppose do you know young man what decided my choice of you out ofmy god i dont dare recall the numbermyriads gilead disclaimed any consciousness of exclusive merit it was the montaigne said the stranger i want cheering i want sympathy i want selfforgetfulness i do not want irresponsible chatter the possession in a refined mind of qualities suitable to my needs seemed to speak from your reply and from your reply alone can you chop wood i must not say i cannot said gilead modestly because i have never tried no matter said the stranger dispiritedly so long as your presence and example stimulate me to exertion my purpose is served i will be frank with you the weight upon my bones exactly symbolises another upon my conscience gileads lips tightened the two are so associated in fact that with every ounce of flesh i may lose my conscience will be correspondingly and automatically lightened a return to reasonable proportions would make me a happy man gilead regarded the speaker steadily what despicable villainy was this to be so cowed and humbled under the superstition that his personal bulk was directly attributable to his crimes so he read the implication and he could have laughed in another mood over the retributions exacted by selfindulgence but that winsom wyllie the sinister the demoniac the masterful should have resolved himself into this well all wickedness was vanity but he had not thought to encounter a vanity quite so abject the stranger turned heavily and motioning gilead to accompany him slouched towards the rearward shed yes he said my thoughts weigh me down they are too much for my single endurance that was why i wanted a companion to distract me from themto take me out of myself there were a couple of blocks and stools standing ready with billhooks and a plentiful supply of logs waiting to be split the stranger took his seat and gilead divesting himself of his coat followed his example the other observed him with a doleful curiosity this is new to you he said i daresay you are wondering how i come to have the run of the place it is closed as a matter of fact from lack of patronage by the unemployed who nevertheless themselves declare that they are as numerous and deserving as ever i hired it for a week stipulating that my personal labour should be set against the rent if you want to spare your fingers dont hold your billet like that watch me for several minutes he hewed and laboured in a perfect frenzy of energy and only desisted when he was streaming from every pore ha he said i lard the lean earth likelike whom falstaff i think said gilead the stranger looked at him with a slightly stimulated but still rueful curiosity you are a reader he said you answer to your own description in other respects why do you call yourself george barnwell why not said gilead stiffly a common thief and highwayman i never thought of that said gilead unguardedly didnt you said the stranger languidlya pseudonym as i thought and not a very wellchosen one now would you mind telling me assumed i confess said gilead the guess was mine said the stranger your clothes your bearingah well you conceal something my name anything else my object perhaps indeed is not this frankness now to be mutual it was partly said gilead that i wished to investigate a very curious affair i am a seeker after the truth aif i may so put it a practical psychologist my sole scruple was that in applying for the post i risked deposing a more deserving because a more needy candidate the money was no object to you then none whatever the other nodded with some melancholy gratification the indifference shall be reciprocal he said it shall be none to me indeed i could no longer think of insulting your psychology by any suggestion of payment very well said gilead i have no wish to tax your conscience in a fresh matter what its sensitiveness decrees is sure to be right he spoke with fathomless irony but at the word conscience the stranger seized his billhook and set to chopping again with a violence that was simply destructive o that this too too solid flesh would melt he gasped presently pausing in a state of semicollapse he groaned wrung his brow and squatting sunk upon himself like an unbaked cottage loaf heaved a dismal sigh and looked up since we are established on these very intimate and confidential terms he said tell me frankly how does my size strike you all of a heap said gilead shortly the other moaned but less of a heap than when you first enteredo yes be candid and admit it why surely began gilead with some indignation you are not expecting when one is excruciatingly conscious of his every ounce avoirdupois interrupted mr wyllie miserably he knows if it is no more than a button that has burst off his waistcoat something however insignificant has gone the question is how long will it take to run off the whole more than a week said gilead youll have to hire another yardseveral yards or else adopt other means it is strange said mr wyllie almost weeping that the canker of a corroding conscience should instead of devouring blow some men out its the case with the oakgall said gilead irony is absurd in commenting on the ways of nature the stranger glanced at him rather balefully and resumed his chopping but languidly i dont know after all that youll suit me he said never mind about that at present said gilead the business of the honorarium being waived this becomes a mere friendly accommodation but its just the friendliness i question answered the stranger aggrieved he laboured for a little in a sullen silence while gilead totally forgetful of his own inactivity watched him pursuing his thoughts the while brixton he said abstractedly is not norwood but it neighbours on it i perceive snapped the other that you are quite a traveller gilead hardly heard him he was speculating as to how he could most tellingly introduce the subject of his mission there are butterflies he said suddenly and firmly in the zermatt valley there are also i believe said mr wyllie owls in athens and coals at newcastle he paused in his labour and glooming round in a dismally sarcastic spirit encountered the eyes of the young man fixed keenly on him well sir he said what then if woodchopping failed to reduce your fat said gilead distinctly you might try butterfly hunting o might i and mountainclimbing indeed the pursuit of unprotected females is also doubtless conducive to an active state of body this may be pleasantry while a murderous assault or so on a few trusting old gentlemen might help to take something out of you mr wyllie uttered an exclamation half rose and sank down again with a flabby smile i would merely suggest st niklaus in the zermatt valley as a suitable headquarters to such operations said gilead do you know the place at all his companion shook his head this humour young gentleman he said is i presume of the new order i confess it is beyond my perhaps oldfashioned understanding his tone was extremely lofty and courteous but he appeared in spite of it to wax suddenly very wroth what did you mean sir he cried by your allusion to unprotected females i refer you to your own conscience sir answered gilead as loftily my conscience sir said the stranger acquits me of any but the most consistently chivalrous attitude the most respectful the most diffident even towards the sex then to what said gilead aghast before this enormous dissembling do you attribute its burden which corresponds by your own confession with that upon your bones now is this depravity or innocence cried the stranger apostrophising space that can discover no pretext for selfreproach in any courses but those of libertinism he faced about on his stool puffing and gasping i owe it to myself i owe it more to the spotless fame of another he said that this gross slander should not pass unrefuted you appear to be a reader sir tell me have you ever read nightlights no said gilead astonished the glowworm in the grass no the evanescence of evadne no the stranger with a supreme effort sat up a reader he exclaimed scornfullya reader and you will be telling me next i suppose that you have never even heard of cornelia cox i am bound to confess that i never have said gilead the stranger smacked his billhook into the block before him and with a mighty struggle got to his feet what he cried hoarsely cornelia the one the peerless the incomparable the first novelist of her ageand he does not even know her name o in what nethermost depths of darkness is not the philistine of our generation capable of enclosing himself not to have heard of cornelia cox sir said gilead rising nettled in his turn and moved to an instant resolution i am sorry that my ignorance offends you but though i am uninformed as to the ladys name and works i can claim some knowledge of another romancer which may both startle and disturb you i allude sir to mr winsom wyllie well said the stranger for the first time coollywhat of him i did not write the book nor i trust are you presuming to attribute its authorship to miss cox book authorship cried gilead staring certainly said the other you did not guess but your ignorance was excusable in that case yes sir i confess reciprocating your confidence that my name also was assumed i had particular reasonsas who would not havefor concealing my own in a public advertisement of such a character and i signed with the first that occurred to my memory it was taken from a popular feuilleton which i had observed in the hands of a young lady by whom i happened to sit months ago in the twopenny tube winsom wyllie ladykillerthat was if i remember rightly the title of the tale and i borrowed it haphazard in my emergency gilead like one in a dream put his hand to his brow would youwould you mind telling me he said what is your real name i have no reason to be ashamed of it sir said the stranger it is bundyemmanuel bundy chapter xiii the quest of the obese gentleman continued utterly dumfoundered as he was for the moment gilead very quickly rallied from his stupefaction and summoning all his native urbanity to his aid advanced a step and seized the strangers right hand in both of his own mr bundy he said i apologise to you with all my heart his tone was so unmistakably sincere that the obese gentleman descended figuratively from the stilts on which he was mounted and involuntarily returned the pressure of his fingers only gasping a little in a slow and codlike manner the sarcasm the innuendo said gilead of which i cannot pretend to hold myself guiltless must have appeared to you as pointless as they were impertinent my sole excuse is that i took you for someone else o indeed said mr bundy heavily perplexed yes said gileadi cannot i must not say for whom lest i further endanger a confidence which my rashness has already sufficiently imperilled but when i tell you sir in the sole attempt at selfjustification which exists to me and in response to the noble candour which has made me acquainted with your real name that mine is gilead balm what of lambs agency exclaimed the stranger i entreat you sir continued gilead to believe that i am actuated by no spirit of empty vaunting but on the contrary by one of humiliation that the business of my office should have been committed to so unintelligent a representative as myself i can plead sir nothing but the excuse of good intentions i believed you as i say to be someone else and acting upon that assumption i answered under a fictitious name your advertisement and was so happy or so unfortunate as to find myself engaged my explanation can go no farther nor be offered less lamely will you be generously content with it with my reiterated apologies and with the assurance that whatever confidences i may have surprised will remain absolutely sacred to me his candour his winning manner not to speak of his selfrevelation won him at once and as always complete absolution mr bundy with a supreme effort to throw off the lowness of spirit into which he had again sunk responded as heartily as possible in kind say no more sir he said say no more i congratulate myself i positively do on this accident we have been talking at crosspurposes said gilead we will do so no longer cried the other i should know sir of the lofty motives which actuate your agency and more of the personal reputation of its founder i should take it as an honour sir if you would permit me to make bare to mr balm the bosom which has already perchance unwittingly half revealed itself to a stranger i shall be delighted said gilead gravely you heap coals of fire on my head then sir said mr bundy with a gleam of real brightness do me the favourthe morning is well advancedto share with me my luncheon which lies ready for us yonder he led the way to the shed where lay a basket well packed with pt de foie gras sandwiches under a napkin some bath buns and cream cakes a syphon of sodawater a tumbler and a flask of whisky sit sir sit said the stranger and while we eat i will with your permission make known to you that part of my story which turns upon the fortuity which has made you my honoured confidant it is soon told he offered gilead a sandwich took a clump of three himself devoured two with a falling visage and waving the other in his hand began my name sir is as i told you emmanuel bundy my residence is situate in the leigham court road streatham my business is that of a hidemerchant in the pursuit of which i may say i have amassed a considerable fortune i am fiftyfour years of age that odious vanity which would falsify the accounts of nature has never been mine years as they accumulate gold accumulate wisdom why should we boast of the lesser gain and repudiate the greater amongst all the possessions which they have brought to me i account none more priceless than my acquaintance with cornelia cox he paused a moment to devour his sandwich and to help himself to three more ah mr balm he said you must forgive my astonishment over your confession of ignorance as to that transcendent that incomparable woman yet in truth my own acquaintance with her dates but from two years back he took half of the three sandwiches at a bite before he continuedi had always found a refuge in books from the monotony of my sordid and none too savoury occupation it was left to that moment to reveal to me the full inner heart and significance of literature such eloquence such fire such an intimate understanding of the deep workings of the human soul the melting passion of nightlights the exquisite je ne sais quoi of evadne the sensuous luminosity of the glowworm here was a woman i felt who had tasted the cup of life to its golden depths he sighed drew himself on a full tumbler of whisky and soda drained it sighed again profoundly and continued taking another handful of sandwiches i am a bachelor sir i had never until that gracious moment encountered a soul capable of understanding and responding to the deep sentiments within my own every profound expression of her feeling seemed to find an echo in my breast truths that i had conceived but had failed to find utterance for she could crystallize in a phrase the insensate world of criticism accused her of platitude jackasses whose pachydermatous hides were insensible to the fine point of satire were dull to the blows of anything less than a bludgeon but i recognized i understood one day i came across her portrait in an illustrated paper i will not dwell upon my emotions it was a facehaunting etherealwhich exactly embodied my conception of the writer looking into its eyes i could fathom at a glance the unmistakable source of nightlights the very evanescence of evadne spoke in that ductile form from that moment my existence became little more than a devouring hunger a prolonged swoon of passion he finished the sandwiches and started on a cream tart before he spoke again one day after a struggle with myself i did a desperate thingi wrote through her publishers to miss cornelia cox i wrote palpitating in a delicious tremor i pronounced myself the most faithful the most adoring of her disciples my pen travelled on the wings of intoxication to my rapture she answered me he stopped to take a second tumbler of whisky and soda she answered me he said gasping and i answered her answer she wrote again by degrees a regular correspondence was established between us i tasted her soul in periodic budgetsa delirious experience but those sacred those melodious groves must remain undesecrated of the outer throng you will understand and excuse me mr balm certainly said gilead o cried the obese gentleman why had i not in those exquisite first days the courage of my convictions i desired and always desired a still more intimate union of souls and i delayed until delay became fatal i was not then by many degrees what you see me now though constitutionally of a full habit of body it had remained for the sun of passion it appeared to develop in me this extreme fruitiness for two years now we have corresponded and i have been swelling all the time and during all the time mr balm we have never yet once met not said gilead well what then for all miss cox knows your present proportions may have been your first while he spoke mr bundy had finished the last of the buns and creamcakes he now struck his breast and gazed up to heaven with a very full look impossible he said forthe truth must be confessedwe have latterly exchanged photographs and the one of myself that i sent her was taken years ago when i was slim and comely he rose with difficulty and feeling in the pocket of his coat which hung near produced two photographs in a folding frame which he offered to gilead look sir he said hoarsely and consider the measure of retribution exacted for one moment of unthinking vanity yet surelythe views we had exchanged had been in themselves so fine so shapely had been uttered in so exalted a strain of poetrythe little imposition amounting to no more than a harmless anachronism might have been thought natural and excusable and in succumbing to the temptation i had no thought but to resume as quickly and as effectually as possible the contours of the photograph alas in compounding with ones conscience destiny always chooses the inconvenient moment for exposure judge of my feelings when i tell you that circumstances ruled all in one instant that the toolongdelayed meeting between us should be fixed at last and inevitably for the middle of next week he stood by quite sagging with dejection while gilead with a profound face examined the pictures that of the lady presented a halflength in bookmuslin a little pose the visage a little spare but sentimental and interesting turning to the other he found it hard to repress a smile it had certainly been taken by inference years ago mr bundy appeared in it as a comparatively slim gentleman of sedate but not mature age with queer clownish hair and a relatively distinguished mien gravely he returned the articles to their owner you have honoured me sir he said with your confidence my advice without presumption is at your service i ask it i entreat it cried mr bundy then sir said gilead believe me that vanity never yet cured vanity but that truth is the universal panacea you and presumably the lady genuinely desire this union a union on her part said the sufferer miserably with the subject of the photograph i believe i can answer for her so far as for myself should i take such steps otherwise to make it possible you comprehend now mr balm my position my desperate essay on my doctors advice to abateat a moments notice so to speakmy figure the torture of conscience which drove me to seek in the distraction of cheerful companionship some forgetfulness of the purpose with which i wrought and the deceit which had necessitated it you might with as much hope of success said gilead seek to reduce an egg by boiling he spoke with a certain sternness no mr bundy he said the proportions of the picture will not be yours within a week how can you expect it wheni must speak plainlyyou pamper your stomach with one hand while you reduce it with the other mr bundy with a selfconscious look glanced down at the luncheonbasket i am afraid he murmured that you have made a poor meal i have had one sandwich sir answered gilead and i could wish for your sake that i had had all but what can it matter to you the spiritual communion for which you crave is hardly concerned with things of the flesh it must suffer its lustre must sink diminished in the shadow of the moral falsehood cried mr bundy abashed and despairing then sir said gilead apply truth for a remedy it is the only one come be a man mr bundy and own up and ask absolution i dare not answered the obese gentleman almost weepingi dare not her sensitivenessthe shockmy tonguetied confusion she does not even know my vocation sooner or later she would have to and thenthe double disillusionment i would not wrong her said gilead but wealth with the best of us is a flattering recommendation the other looked at him meltingly ah he sighed if i could only find one cultured diplomatic who would consent to be my deputy for the truth gilead drew himself up you mean me he said i know you represent it faltered mr bundyand stopped casting down his eyes the young man considered a little very well sir he said suddenly i owe you a certain reparation i will undertake this delicate business on condition that you give me a note of introduction to the lady the obese gentleman laughed with glee come he saidcome home with me at once and i will write it the quest of the obese gentleman continued at three oclock that same afternoon gilead found himself on the doorstep of a bijou residence in maida vale he was very grave and for more than a present reason one having the power to examine into his mind would have discovered there a steadfast purpose of loyalty a determination to ignore the slanderous whisperings of certain dark spirits which were seeking to undermine in him a rooted faith to destroy a cherished ideal one would have found there also perhaps a little pathetic unaccountable sense of weariness a shadowy emotionthe first in his lifeof selfpity if he had he would have seen them dismissed as soon as realised the emotion was essentially feminine and gilead had surely despised himself for even succumbing to it he could not be such a woman as to pet a grievance before it was justified there was no grievance at all to justify itself with his eyes set to the truth he told himself so and he had the will to believe it suspicion was a germ that once admitted destroyed the reason only that strong will had power to keep it out a slattern servant admitted him into the bijou hall and there kept him standing while she delivered the note to her mistress she came back shortly and breathing heavily showed him into the bijou drawingroom and there left him glancing around gilead saw torn lace curtains a piano with candle brackets run with grease a dirty tablecloth and on it the debris of a meal of biscuits and sodawater scattered among many papers the whole house looked as if it habitually woke too late to tidy up the confusion of yesterday a step at the door brought him to attention and he bowed with a feeling between chivalry and wonder the incomparable one stood before him and he had to admit to himself that she was gaunt fade and presumably in the overprime of life certainly there was a resemblance to the portrait but as certainly it was the resemblance of an unflattering copy miss cox was in a neglige of soiled white serge or flannel there was an air of transcendental slipshoddiness about her her hair fell in unconsidered loops her thinness amounted to emaciation her complexion had once no doubt been ethereal but had materialized in the course of time mellowing to the tone of antique parchment but the expression was all there spiritual ineffableand languishing for the utmost of its passionate soul through a couple of large burning eyes mr balm she exclaimed introductorily in a deep agitated voice he bowed a second time and she entered closed the door and sank into a chair she was patently nervous and overcomea lady whose sensitive organization was not proof against unforeseen demands upon it in one lean long hand she held the accrediting letter in the other a handkerchief none too spotless with which she perpetually fanned herself i trust madam said gilead gently that in consenting to act as an intermediary in a matter of so delicate a nature i convey with me your correspondents intimation as to the reasons which induced him to the choice of his representative let me assure you that i undertake the confidence with the profoundest sympathy with and respect for its nature he describes me she raised an entreating hand interrupting him he describes you sir she said in faintly hollow tones as his deputy for the truth o believe me i understand fully i have long dreaded this moment madam exclaimed gilead startled she leaned forward agonised intense he has discovered it then she said and the romance of my life is blighted in its vernal prime the photograph i have had the privilege of seeing it said gilead at a loss observing that she stopped to his horror the lady on that admission sank back in her seat sobbing amphorically deliver your blow sir in swiftest mercy she said strike and spare not return to your principal and denounce the fond impostor who sought by an ardent subterfuge to draw out for yet a little the linked sweetness of a correspondence which had come to form the romance and solace of her loveless days your mission is the truth speak it unpityingly compare for his disenchantment the portrait with the original say that you found me spare unattractive if you will past my first youth assert what it is useless to deny that with the desperate purpose to retain his admiration to evoke even a warmer a more ecstatic communion of soul i did that succumbed to a temptation whose fruits could only realise themselves in dust and vanity yes sir i confess it the photograph represents the cornelia of many years ago and even if as some saymr balm what is it he was stretching up his arms standing on his toes in a sort of moral elevation as his photograph represents the emmanuel of many years ago he cried and came flat down on his soles she rose she uttered a little scream in a deep way what is that you say she cried madam he said nothing can be gained by evasion the mr bundy of the photograph was interesting and slim the mr bundy of today is interesting and fat it was to acquaint you of that factof a trifling misrepresentation common it appears to you boththat i accepted my commission miss cox rose she clasped her hands exquisitely and craned her lean neck fat she whispered i cannot qualify the term said gilead firmly as fat madam as butter what then napoleon was fat horace was fat johnson boswell gibbon luther handel were all fat mr bundy cannot be blamed for emulating the example of those great men and if fat repeated the lady closing her eyes and in a voice of thrilled ecstasy i doat simply doat on a fat man you do responded gilead with an air of delighted relief then madam a fat man doats on you and nothing remains to me but to congratulate you both on this most happy termination to a misunderstanding he bowed as if he felt his mission accomplished o stay sir cried miss cox she took a quick step forward she pressed her handkerchief to her bosom my bundy she murmuredmy own bundy and was it apprehension over his little roguish deceit that moved him to this step but i fear i shudder over my own will he forgive it will he credit that the waste the declineo we starve on despond hope is so filling tell him that his message has put new life into me tell him that repossessing him i am already twice the woman i was to meet him halfway i will absorb the sustenance naturally repugnant to megross meats and aliments in place of the fruits and spring water most sufficing to my needs tell him that given a little time she paused breathless it is what he himself most craves said gilead a certain perplexity overcame him i confess madam he said that what puzzles me is the sudden inevitability of this meeting so long delayed it was due to myself answered the lady and panting continued with an hysterical incoherence a recent snapshothorrible libellous revoltingappeared in a weekly paperi feared he would see iturged by desperationa travesty of the truthreality less disenchantingrecoil from worst to something comparatively reassuringresolved in despair to risk allforce conclusions for bliss or damnationinsisted on meeting and having written would have withdrawn but too late and now she broke off with a gasp and then continued o sir your appearancethe letteri believed that he had seen and that youhis agentthe messenger of my doom she stopped gazing at her hearer in liquid emotion you wrong me said gilead gravely in deeming me capable of so unchivalrous a deed no madam my missionit is unnecessary and would be unadvisable to explain how and where undertakenwas one of appeal on behalf of mr bundys conscious disabilities that mission being now accomplished i trust to the satisfaction of all parties i shall beg permission to take my leave only first charging myself with such answer as you shall deem it expedient to return to your richly endowed suitor the quest of the obese gentleman concluded gilead walked back to the agency with a firm step and that steadfast purpose of loyalty burning unquenched in his heart on the way he stopped at a famous jewellers in bond street to make a purchase having accomplished which he continued his journey to the office something unwonted in the aspect of his private room struck him the instant he entered it it was very orderly like a newlytrimmed grave and the amanuensis though it was not yet five oclock was absent he sat down at his desk a moment and buried his face in his hands then suddenly he rose and walked across to the table in the window the typewriter was closed the papers relating to all business past and to come were neatly docketed and arranged in accessible sheaves after a moments strange observation he turned away and stepping to the bell with a somewhat pale face summoned a favoured employ mr nestle he said when the man appeared is he in mr nestle and miss halifax sir was the answer were both unavoidably summoned away miss halifax left a message begging as a great favour that you would call at the flat sir if you desired for any reason to see her gilead nodded thank you clement he said i think i will go round he did not hesitate he did not pause a moment to question the immutability of his faith there and then he went forth and walked direct to his destination the little maid at the door admitted him smiling but abashed she remembered if he did not the contretemps with the liftporter a few nights earlier a consciousness of concern moreover as to the meaning of this visit repeated at an inopportune moment fluttered no doubt the heart under her spruce bib she introduced him into the drawingroom in a scarce audible voice and shut the door upon him hurriedly gilead parcel in hand walked across the room a stiff little smile on his lips both the secretary and the amanuensis were present before him as he had expected to find them the girl stood with her right arm resting on the pianotop as if for support her face was very white but she neither moved nor spoke the man stood back as if slunk into the shadow of the window curtains he was by far the more dumbfoundered of the two i was told i might find you both here said gilead quietly and i accept the occasion gladly for a little private talk i have been away these two or three days on a wildgoose chase miss halifax after whom do you suppose why an old friend of yours with an odd name perhaps it is rightstop me if you objectthat herbert should be made acquainted at last with the circumstances of that iniquitous persecution do you recall that late occasion in the office when i spoke of an advertisement which you had overlooked i had not overlooked it mr balm she spoke in a steady toneless voice not said gilead with a faint effort at surprise but his lips twitched no she said only i had not wished to call your attention to itnaturally that was wrong he answered however generously your reticence was designed to spare me still as it happens the quest was a fruitless one the advertiser was not the person i sought and so we remain as far as ever from a solution of that problem yet the coincidence of the name was so strange a one as to seem to justify me in the pursuit and after all it appears that he adopted it from a newspaper story which he once chanced to observe in the hands of a young lady sitting next him in the train of mine said miss halifax in the same unlifted voice so that is how it happened is it nestle in his shadows uttered a little stifled ejaculation which gilead heard but disregarded he had to make an effort but he made it courageously and unwrapping his parcel displayed a jewel case which being opened revealed a fine pearl necklace with a diamond clasp indeed he said with a show of unconcern then the name is not so remarkable a one as we supposed or is it possible that the romancer himself adopted it from the living fact well in any case my quest having resulted in barrenness need not be discussed further let us turn to a more profitable matter i am not intending to break my promise and i will not be the first to speak at the same time i am going to ask you miss halifax to accept provisionally this little token of my most grateful regard she came away quite steadily from her support and took the case gently from his hand her lips were brilliant the lids of her eyes were flushed she bore her shame like a fallen goddess they are lovely she said how generous how loyal how noble you are but you will take this away with you when you go and keep it for someone worthier of your faith vera cried nestle hoarsely she took no notice of him but placing the jewels softly on the table came and stood before her employer and then he knew that the shadow he had dreaded and resisted so long was about to fall and overwhelm him how can you still pretend to believe in us she said in a low even voice how can you bear to remain so staunch against your own inner conviction from the moment i knew that you had seen that advertisement and the name i knew that the end was come and it is come though still not in your unswerving chivalry at your instance the sentence shall be mine your great heart shall not suffer any longer this torture of a trust that dies so hard i will tear it out with my own handsi daresay because its pain hurts me too and not from any moral heroism mr balm there is no such person as winsom wyllie there never was such a person except in the silly story from which i borrowed the name for my own purposes never dreaming that the haphazard choice would recoil upon my head like this he and that scientific father and the butterflyhunting and the will and the persecution were all pure concoctions from beginning to end i have been in switzerland but only with my brother herbert here yes he is my brother and we are liars and impostors from first to last he stirred with a suggestion of unsteadiness and stiffening himself walked to the window and stood looking out of it his back turned to her she put a hand one moment to her eyes and following spoke on in her resolute selfabasement if you will listen it is right that you should be told all i plead and am going to plead nothing whatever in extenuation save that when i elaborated that wicked lie my education of the heart had not even been begun i have learnt much travelled far since then a whole continent seems to lie between my present and my past understandings and looking across it i see the track of bleeding feet multitudes of them wandering this way and i shiver and hide my face to think how of all the deceits and hypocrisies they include my own vile shadow far off over the waste figures for the first and worst she put a hand to her bosom panting a little her brother came creeping out of the darkness and standing near her spoke for the first time not hers alone sir i am as much to blame and more gilead made a movement as if impatient of the interruption and he shrank back my own shadow continued the girland i have no choice but to admit it if i dare to claim that it no longer represents me there are my footsteps among the others reaching to this very moment to give me the lie i am what i am not through any independent purpose of my own but because in common with the common impostors on that long journey i have found my soul in the heaven of chivalry which it revealed to me i ask you only in charity to believe the word of an adventuress that during all these months of my redemption my punishment has most lain in my own shameful consciousness of the lie i had doomed myself to live to have been honoured by you to have shared your confidence to have acquiesced in moral condemnations and to have known all the time that i was utterly unworthy of your trustmore guileful than the pretenders i helped to expose her voice faltered and ceased and for a while there ensued a profound silence but in a little she took up again with a scarce audible sigh the burden of her confession i ask you to believe that and i ask you to believe that i am even less wretched in my voluntary selfexposure than i have long been in my deceit i have learned to value the truth and i can speak it at last mr balm at the time when you engaged my brother giving him the chance of his life we had both long been orphans we lived together and i was wholly dependent on him he had been educated to the law and was a man of brilliant if undisciplined talents he was ambitious for us both and with both of us i think imagination was wont to run ahead of discretion unfortunately for him the morale of the firm by whom he was employed and to whom he acted as head conveyancing clerk was none of the best it confessed itself in speculative enterprises which ultimately led to the collapse and bankruptcy of broker borrodaile my brother though morally innocent suffered through the disrepute which the firm in its transactions had brought upon itself he found it difficult to obtain a new situation and before very long we were in a desperate state it was then that mr ploverwho had always believed in herbert and sympathised with our misfortunescame to our assistance and was the means of procuring my brother a post such as he had never dreamed of possessing i think that its magnitude its possibilities the apparent ease with which he had secured it turned both our heads we began to imagine all sorts of brilliant sequels to that beginningfairytales at first but by and by the prospect of actually realizing on them in some daring way began to haunt us the world of romance had always appealed to our minds and no doubt the atmosphere of adventure in which we had both long been living had served to vitiate our moral outlook what if we could so take advantage of golden circumstance as to assure ourselves a lasting share in the enormous interests with which herbert was connected what if my brothers employer could be inveigled intointo marrying my brothers sister she had been speaking rapidly latterly and now she stopped in an instant as if she had surmounted at a leap the worst of the task she had set herself and presently breathing like one after a race she began again it was what i had to say and i have said it and i am sureyes i am sure you will understand my purpose in saying it the plot shaped itself by degrees i think in its manufacture the mere romantic intricacies of it quite obsessed and fascinated us commonplace creatures as we were without position or recommendation we were never so presumptuous as to suppose that you could be brought to take an interest in your secretarys sister merely for your secretarys sake some story of innocence persecuted and in distress must be invented to draw your attention and captivate your imagination then lured into belief i was to take my own magnificent measures with you to bring you to my feet it was our double misfortune that my brother had an unqualified belief in my capacity for the task she paused another moment before she went on after all it was a desperate venture and might have miscarried at the outset i will not even say that i wish it had since humiliated though i am i would not for all the world exchange my new for my old self but the prize to be won seemed so inestimable the hazard so thrilling i do not believe the hateful ingratitude of the thing even struck us we were born storytellers and even as children were used to write endless romances together we have played at life since i think i think we have never really grown up among the many stories associated with my brothers office we thought that this might pass muster without detection but it was first necessary for us of course to separate under the pretext of a visit to the country i left our lodgings and repaired as privately arranged to norwood where in an assumed name i hired by the month the little house you will recall in the meantime as a precaution against possible enquiries my brother had changed his lodgings for others at a distance and then having prepared our ground we opened the game the bogus advertisement was inserted my brother craftily engaged your interest to it and when he saw that the bait had been taken despatched to me that telegram which you saw and which was to serve its two purposes the one to acquaint me of your soon arrival the other to furnish imaginary proof of the persecution under which i suffered i need not say more carried away by the dramatic character of my part i played it with a fervour which almost made me believe in it myself and which i sometimes found it difficult afterwards to maintain the miserable fraud succeeded even beyond our expectations in one way it procured me a generous means of livelihood and if it procured me also her voice thickened and stopped but she cleared her throat resolutely and continued mr balm you must take what measures you will for our exposure and punishment i beg you with all my soul not to spare us the meanness of the fraud the ingratitude the thoughtlessness as to its moral effect upon you to whom we owed everythingo nothing that i can say may palliate our guilt or express the sickness of remorse which came to us when we grew to see ourselves as we were in the light of your true nobility only in atonement can we ever again find relief from a misery and selfcontempt which have grown to be unbearable when i speak for myself i speak for my brother what we have experienced what we have learnt of youo the shame is killing but dont dont think that in one way we have taken the least the most shadowy advantage of your trust you will find everything in the most scrupulous order and ifif in committing us to the fate we deserve you can only find it in your heart to say once that you forgive us he stopped her on the instant facing about nestle he said in a commanding voice you will oblige me by going back to the office i wish to have a word alone with your sister the secretary started turned and without a word left the room for minutes after he was gone gilead stood steadfastly regarding the tragic young figure before him and at last he spoke supposing you had been successful in your purposewhat then were you to live the lie for everyou as my wife she stood the strain relaxed mute and drooping by the little table once and once only had she glanced up at his face and it had thrilled her with pride to see how the manliness the nobility in it had suffered no disillusionment to affect them if sorrow had entered there will had not surrendered i dont know she whispered scarce audibly we had noti thinkgot as far as considering that he gave a little odd laugh typical romancers he saidto end with the wedding bells she put her hand upon the table for support there a little sharp crack and an involuntary cry from her lips he hurried to her the glass of a miniature on which her hand had rested had broken and scratched the ball of her thumb blood he saidi must staunch it and he lifted the limb though she strove to resist and put the soft pink palm to his lips she gave a miserable cryand on the instant he had his arms about her atonement he said hoarselyyou speak of atonement it must be in giving yourself to the man you have so shamefully deceived nothing short of your devoting your life to him can atone no no she whispered and for the first time the tears came thick to her eyesnonono she seemed incapable of any but that one heartrent ejaculation he held her prisonerfiercely as though he dreaded that she would escape him do you know he said to what i was listening all the time the little miserable confession was being uttered why
