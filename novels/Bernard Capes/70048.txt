mystery prologue editorial mother careys chicken i forty five years ago one february evening the fog lay thick over clapham suburb generated in the fat sink of lambeth it had come sweltering up by way of the westminster bridge and kennington roads had poured like smoke from a range through the bars of the pike gate by the church had pressed on rolling up the last levels of twilight in front of it past the swan at stockwell and the bedford arms beyond before each of which popular hostelries it had deployed in order to post its pickets in a dozen of fuddled brains and thence shouldering its passage densely through the main channel of the high street had flowed out and camped itself sluggishly among the gorse bushes of the open common to the south incidentally amongst other obscene flushings by the way it had entered and packed to the throat a certain white square which already in that stronghold of evangelicalism was of sufficiently bad odour to need no reinforcement of supplementary brimstone to prove itself like the fishermans bottle this white square was entered by a narrow neck or gullet through which the genie of viciousness could compress itself into an inadequate house room or thence issue to expand into proportions which were a menace to its neighbourhood thieves harlots and low irish rapparees formed the bulk of its population costers and a drunken washerwoman or two were its lite how mother carey with at least her better traditions had drifted into its fastnesses let the recording angel note it was sacred from the police mother carey was certainly white squares most respectable unit a one eyed queen among the blind she rented an entire tenement in place of the fraction with which the most of her compeers must be content she enjoyed an independence paid quarterly through a lawyer for value received she had descended in a cloud from the hallowed mysteries of the tu tu and the dancing sandal she was a superannuated coryphe in fact and save for the redeeming grace of that allowance had long since sunk into squalider depths than her present the fog made her eyes smart on this february evening sootily exaggerating on their rims the work of the make up pencil which had not ceased to be a cherished equipment of her ignoble maturity it imparted moreover a sort of livid iridescence to the pearl powder smearing her haggard cheeks which suggested in their unwholesome fishiness the under parts of a dead and stale mackerel her front was false her sha the horrible sick old spectre of vanity but if a spectre she was by no means dead to her own worldly interests those possessed her in exact proportion as her watching and waiting at this moment were turned to the possession of the soul of another the latest and not the least difficult subject of her ancient lures reversing the accepted ghostly procedure she was intent on procuring instead of revealing a treasure her persistency in matters of mean acquisition and blackmailing was great for so frail a creature it had triumphed over decay infirmities disenchantment in the past yet after all she had withdrawn from public life at a late hour with a competence which to be properly in keeping with her long self exposure was only a bare one that she resented of course her days were all punctuated with petty resentments and malevolences the fruits of a small greedy vanity which had been pensioned to retire through a conspiracy of jealousies she would have told you wherefore she had since sought to augment her pittance by a vicious exploiting at second hand of the arts which had procured it for her the rumble of distant omnibuses vibrated in her ears and in the walls from which latter gloomed down dingy and faded old daguerreotypes of herself smirking and ogling in the tights and kid boots and wreaths of a vanished era rosy immoral young life of twenty years past of which this dry stark immortelle was the spectre as she sat waiting she leaned her elbows on the table and stared at the solitary candle alight before her like an old sharp eyed hen half hypnotised by the glow yet if she were asleep she talked in her sleep small and chuckling as anyone stooping his head might have detected mark mark dalston o mark o my dear ran the thin strain are you going to think well of it mark think well of it mark dalston have you started on your way to come and compound with mother carey mark my love youve answered yes to her message havent you but you arent always a gentleman of your word you know mark best to be it in this case o my dear my dear i could get my teeth into you here nicely now couldnt i suddenly she came alert pricking her ears to the sound of a quick soft footstep outside ii mr mark dalston a young man of particular ambitions and passions had also that hospitability of conscience which can welcome and reconcile the most antagonistic emotions he never suffered material self interests and moral scruples to fall at odds within himself but was the tactful and charming host to all that came to be entertained within his breast there one might see grossness and reason sensualism and intellectuality the virtuoso and the vandal all table couples at once and at perfectly harmonious discourse they met on the common ground of sociability and forbore all destructive criticism of one another so long as marks lights shone upon their differences he was extraordinarily popular with quite a number of divergent familiars a man without prejudices and always ready to entertain a new emotion mark was of that good nature in short that he could never say no to himself however much the interests of other people might be affected by the partiality his sympathies were wide but their application was close like the centre of a venous system he was all heart and gave nothing but what he was sure to receive back at compound interest fortune having condemned him for a brief period to an ushership at a suburban grammar school he had not repined over his lot but had sought quite naturally and amiably an amelioration of its prosy conditions in the pursuit of such supernumerary pleasures and self indulgences as its off hours could be made to yield it was always his principle to eschew consequences until they were upon him and insistent and then he would set his fine wits and intellect at work to neutralise them the young master was well destined and more than physically for the success of his qualities he was emphatically according to the feminine standard of fitness a ladies man his self assurance his ready tongue or tongues for he commanded many his easy subscription to the correct fashions in dress assumed in defiance of the proverbial slovenliness of scholars his whiskers his quick intelligence and his soft impertinences were all so many viss to the passport to womans favour of which his handsome face and person were the text he might have wasted this text upon quite inconsiderable issues if fortune jealous for his capacities had not invited him to contests more worthy of his mettle the post of travelling coach to a young gentleman of fortune timely offering itself he had seized the opportunity to cut some connections of which the one which turned upon the training of the young idea had come to figure as the least undesirable and at the present date clapham had not seen him for six months or more it is not the purpose of the moment to recount how once abroad mr dalston had lost his pupil and married money nor even much to dwell upon how returning home a man of substance and position he had been brought at once and sharply to realise that of our pleasant vices the gods make instruments to plague us but he was a man of swift comprehension resource and decision and his brows had hardly drawn to a pucker over a difficulty suddenly confronting him before a way out of it and a very daring one had occurred to him the message mother careys referring to this difficulty had reached him at the house his wifes in eaton square whither he it was understood had on business grounds preceded his ladys return from abroad by a few weeks that was actually a mystification a suppressio veri for mrs dalston was at the moment installed in comfortable but obscure rooms at kennington where she was scarcely arrived before she was delivered a little prematurely of a male child but so far was this fact from being allowed to interfere with the fiction of her absence that particular pains had been taken by mark to procure his wifes confinement in the house of a doctor a friend of his who could be feed into any silence or bought into any intrigue where irregular services were required to all practical and moral intents mr dalston was never so remote from his lately wedded bride as at the moment when he stepped from her bedside to do an infamous act upon her child but even then there was enough sentiment in his gaze to make the fortune of a mid victorian picture the young mothers reason had never fully returned to her since that poignant grapple four nights ago with the great and astonishing secret she was sound unhurt from the contest but her faculties slept in a sort of exhausted abeyance she was very white and still incurious not greatly troubled so far things were fortunate and here was the enwrapping fog for a final cloak or pall as mark stepped softly from the room closing the door a rather livid faced stale smelling young man in a black frock coat and black peg top trousers revealing frowzy white socks beneath accosted him whisperingly well sir all in train mark nodded smiling all in train blague its really a providence and your conscience may sleep sound to night as sound as shes sleeping in there dont wake her dont let her wake rather to a sense of her loss you comprehend till i return quite so the vis inerti the vegetation of a sensitive plant no more we will see to it the business shall not miscarry through us sir depend upon it thats right you shant lose by this little divagation in our plans rest sure of that he put his finger to his lips and tiptoed down to the hall where stood a pallid faced young woman in a shawl and poke bonnet gently rocking a bundle in her arms she looked at the husband gravely questioningly but she was silent the poor thing in fact was helpless under his dominion those dark eyes and ambrosial whiskers with the cleft chin between had in a few days brimmed the measure of her romance engaged for nurse to mrs dalston she was fallen a slave to the lamp of a brighter magician than duty the two entered a growler of the ancient dimensions and the fog lapped them up jogging its apathetic course through the smoke as it seemed of a vast glimmering conflagration the squalid vehicle gained at length the clapham road and drew near its destination then the pale little nurse spoke for the first time are we nearly there nearly there my child your child she raised the little bundle in her arms to her breast the pressure seemed to convey abroad from it a waft of that warm milky nidor inseparable from newly born infants mr dalstons white teeth glimmered through the fog for the dozenth time he said softly i must assure you little ellen that grave issues hang upon the preservation of the tiny life in your arms that life is threatened only so long as i fail to convince a certain person of its actuality you mustnt ask me how or why it embraces matters above your comprehension i cant help it im frightened was all she could find voice to whisper he put his arm confidently about her she shivered but let herself settle into it hush he said what is there to be frightened about i shall do nothing but take it in show it and return with it to you why do you want me at all she protested half whimpering you might have brought it by yourself what he said and had dr blague questioning my sanity do fathers generally take their new born babies for an airing in cabs you are to witness ellen if the necessity should ever arise which however there is not the least probability of its doing that i returned it to you sound as i had taken it why should it arise o mark dont mean me any evil he sighed shrugging his shoulders the crawling cab drew up with a jerk now he said quickly taking the girls burden from her stop here till i return with it i shall be back before you can count a hundred iii mother carey raised her bleary face with a start and looked round the owner of the name she had been apostrophising stood in the room beside her she twisted an involuntary little shriek into a titter well im sure she said to take me like that in a moment and anything possible was the door ajar still ajar said mark with a smile and the trap still baited as of old i suppose always the same quick gentleman she chuckled venomously what has my lovey got in his arms there something for your discounting old mother he said ill show you in a minute my discounting she echoed her lips tightened on the word she looked at him evilly searchingly what do you mean you got my message yes i got your message and youve come to answer it to answer it yes thats as well for you you know what i want do i and what i mean to have or show you up my gentleman well i can guess im to be bled i suppose ah she gave a snapping laugh you never spoke a truer word well he said as cool as she was malevolent im here to be bled but on hard and fast conditions understand that you old jezebel or understand nothing she made as if to claw him but mumbled away her rage better than many worthier she could see into his terrific places ill be fair to fair she said cowed and scowling youre married yes a fine match yes it would go hard with your honeymooning if i spoke out harder with you i think ah im salted my man youd need to be is she here isnt she where in her bed ill a touch of the fever shell get over it very well he said now attend look at this she followed the motion of his hand as very gently it lifted a corner of the wrappers on his arm a living baby it looks like one she discussed him sombrely a minute then spoke in a shrewd whisper youve got some dark game on here my gentleman he dropped the shawl again a secret and a proposal old mother he said how much or rather how little will you take for helping me to keep it do you want me to commit murder im an honest woman i know thats why i can depend on you she fawned with her hands tell me what it all means lovey dear im going to shut that door first she did as she was told the listening spirits of the fog were baffled when the door opened again mark was standing in the entry the burden still in his arms while mother carey pleaded urgently behind him a lump sum deary come no he said a pension a quarterly gag on your tongue or nothing you can take or leave i take she whispered shrilly i take be careful of that step deary he vanished into the fog at the mouth of the passage the cab was drawn up by the kerb watching for him like a squat red eyed dragon and gulping him the moment he appeared half way home the pale little nurse broke suddenly into hysterical panting and weeping why dont you give it me back why do you always keep it in your own arms im afraid of you ellen he said quietly you look somehow as if you werent to be trusted they were passing a lighted shop at the moment with a quick unsuspected action she snatched the veil from the babys face ah she screamed its dead youve had it killed for a single instant the naked soul of him looked out obscene murderous but he drove it back you little wild fool he said deeply wasnt i right your nerves are anyhow you arent to be trusted with your fancies she hardly seemed to hear him all of a sudden she was struggling with the door handle let me out im fainting i can bear no more i will be good i want to go home i sore encumbered as he was she proved too quick for him in an instant she had jerked open the door and flung herself into the fog some heavy vehicle was lumbering past at the moment a scream like the cry of a rusty axle broke from among its wheels the cab rolled on its driver unnoticing or diplomatic perhaps over an accident which he connected if at all with other than his fare paralysed for an instant the next mark had softly closed the swinging door theres no help for it he thought momentarily death white i must go on and play the game he played it for all that rebuff so convincingly that the issue left him full twenty years triumphant enjoyment of its fruits that same night his wife woke for the first time to her full reason and looked intently into his eyes am i to be allowed to see it she said he bowed his head distressfully by my full will if not the will of a greater he murmured it is dead he rose and went and brought and placing the little forlorn shape in her arms left her with it a while when he returned it was put aside gently but indifferently bury my poor past she said it reproaches me with an altered face yet i cant help myself i think i never could you wouldnt wish it you know and what you wish or dont wish comes to happen or to fail he looked at her mildly but with protesting eyes why are you so bitter he said has not fate after all been considerate with us you can face the world again now unsuspected a spotless wife no suspicion of our having loved not wisely but too well cannot you forgive me yet lucy and after all i have done to safeguard your honour yet if providence had not thus mercifully intervened i swear that i would have been a dutiful father to it have acknowledged my own and taken all the blame and burden of the sin i can say no more nor i she answered what does it matter now the money my money that youve played to get its all yours to use and fling away if you like treat me as you will im indifferent and she lay down resolutely and composed herself to sleep as chin in hand he stands pondering her a little curiously fondly cynically we see the fog droop and engulf him her the bed the room not for twenty years does it lift and roll itself up to the flies to reveal the maturing of a drama of which this chapter is the prologue chapter i autobiographical i suppose my days have been involved in as tragic circumstances as most it is fair that the truth of them should be set down en grande tenue by the one whom after all it most concerns not that for my own sake i desire for them more publicity god knows than they have received but there is the question of the moral heirloom the sensational skene claim before the lords of common pleas will be in the memory of a generation now passing it is for the benefit of the generation to come and the many thence ensuing that i clothe these legal bones in the nerves and flesh of living actualities there is such necessary omission and distortion in all trials of equity that the plainest of their stories is grown a russian scandal before the senior counsel who engineered it has gone to his long home on the bench and this was an intricate story which it is now my purpose for the sake of myself and my own to detail in full as to that story it will be recalled that a mr richard gaskett was legally its protagonist very well i am that person at the first and from the first i was something less than nobody my mother as i regarded her was of obscure origin but of manners naturally quiet and refined a habit of self guarding indeed which dated probably from her social promotion had come to make of her even a cold colourless impenetrable woman she was very pretty with a sort of passionless severity in her face and in her attitude a custom of what miss burney would have called repulsiveness meaning as we read it repelling no gleam of demonstrativeness on her part lights my memory of her from my first lispings i always by her desire called her lady skene as habitually my stepfather baron skene of evercreech called me gaskett i was officially an encumbrance to the two and not always spared the knowledge of the indifferent union which had produced me i neither was informed nor thought to ask anything curiosity was the last thing encouraged at evercreech that my stepfather had been a childless widower when he bestowed the lustre of his name on the obscure young widow with an encumbrance was the most of my information and even as such something less probably than the common one the rakish reactionary one time famous judge of the queens bench division and ennobled for his services during the salisbury administration of who after the death of his only child and heir young charlie skene in an alpine accident had contracted a reckless msalliance with the lady who now bore his name was a figure revealed only to my later understanding very early i think lady skene had found religion as one may speak of finding the unpleasantly obvious ignorance irreverence and vulgarity build on every highway there is a sort of evangelical butcher who deals with assurance in things of the flesh and on a simple knowledge of their parts preaches the constitution of their spiritual anatomy he is the purveyor of such theological joints as the vulgar understanding can recognise insight imagination erudition are strange beasts to the popular view i think perhaps that lady skenes early influences were to account for her natural inclinations in these respects when i say that her marriage had socially elevated her from the ground to the leaf without her quite shaking off the dust of her origin i may be understood to imply that her beauty and no exceptional quality in addition was her fine recommendation she had had little education i am sure but the education of a precise observation which is the most excellent tutor of mind and manners though unpossessed of the exact secret of what constitutes the comme il faut that may be said broadly to be the secret of making a grace of necessity in all things the secret of a frank unself consciousness self suspicion spells restraint in intercourse and leads to gusts of mutinous self assertion in some wrong directions lady skene at least made no affectation of adopting creeds which were caviare to her understanding she was and remained a raw evangelical through all the spiritual evolutions of fashion there was an unseemly old heathen visited us once upon a time who made himself very merry over lord skenes atonement as he called it this was sir maurice carnac ex governor of madras who had been an intimate friend of his lordship in the sixties and who now on his retirement after twenty years service came to renew the acquaintance from him i learned at discretion not a few facts hitherto unknown to me how for instance my stepfather in the matter of his second marriage had been cast into a net by his own feet in their very hope of going astray which was to imply that he had been caught to matrimony in the act of trying to evade it how lady skene had no sooner conquered him by her beauty than she had used it to the subjugation of the old adam she had entertained by holding it the prize to his strict reformation how in short she had made a tame and orderly spouse out of the most unpromising material possible sir maurice had no great delicacy it is to be feared though he could be mum on some points on which i sought enlightenment of lady skenes social status before her marriage he would not speak though i certainly gathered from him that it was inconsiderable take fortunes gifts my lad he said and hold your silly tongue its time to question her when she turns on you scruples i began scruples be damned said he what has a ranker need of scruples aint you promoted for your mothers son that was the truth of it and to confess myself the sorrow i was not a loved child conscious of rights or merits i was an encumbrance a dreamy rather morbid temperament oppressed me with the weight of my own burden on the situation not that i was ever treated unkindly but there is an endurance that is harder than neglect it might be thought that lady skene would have wished to exalt her own especially as she bore her husband no family she was indifferent to me however and so i could not but be to her we were not kindred spirits and were antipathetic to one another her soul inhabited a chapel mine the woods and mountains of a roaming fancy i never felt at home with her and i think she had writ me down early for one of the unelect predestination is a comfortable creed for those who would eschew parental responsibilities it is vain carving a brand that is destined for the burning i suppose lord skene was of the chosen his lady at least took infinite pains to preserve him to her pattern of respectability from my first conscious recollection of him he was the slave to her soft monotonous rule yet i came early to wonder how much or how little of his bondage was due to her physical fascination for he was not naturally i felt sure susceptible to moral influences or possessed of a bump of reverence that a threepenny bit could not have hidden in pose in feature in colouring her ladyship was near flawless an angel whose ichor was drawn from the peaches of paradise strange i thought that so ethereal a tabernacle should contain so unimaginative a pyx i was not the first to marvel over a common incongruity or to overlook the fact that a satin skin often means a thick one however that may be lord skene was devoted to his wife and i think not a little afraid of her she had lived to convince him that he had taken her encumbrance and all on something better than her merits at the period with which this record is mainly concerned she was rising forty and he perhaps sixty five years of age i had passed my school career and had alighted on no other those vanished terms of absence from home had been my dearest ones i have nothing to relate of them but what is pleasant in the retrospect one thing in especial my friendship with johnny dando which is infinitely comfortable at the end johnny went to a university and i returned to evercreech i was then nineteen and already the predestined protagonist in a drama the full intricacies of which fate was to need but a year or two to unfold my life during the interval from boy to manhood has no concern in this matter and therefore i shall say nothing of it but what is essential to the context childhood is a thing apart and sacred to come of age is to join posterity and the detectives chapter ii i come of age and to a determination lord skene was as things go a poor man poor for an ex judge and poor for a nobleman his estate was much embarrassed at the time when his lady started a resolution to nurse it it was reduced then to the mansion and demesne of evercreech a fair enough property in its way but largely neglected and in places fallen to waste i think that even her ladyships management could do little more than preserve it to the succession a vain economy it seemed but the seed of woman is hope much before her time the house in berkeley square had been let away on a lengthy lease and a family hotel must serve her and my lord on their periodic visits to town evercreech had to serve me summer and winter the year round and in those young untroubled days it was enough there was a plenitude of beauty and romance and antique quietude for my utmost needs i never realised what i was or what i signified to the couple most concerned in my existence i think it would have puzzled them as much to define me whether for son or servant or ward perhaps my position nearest approached that of a donzel in feudal times attached to the service of some high relation as his apprentice in arms and chivalry and broke to self reliance by a discipline of self help certainly i read of spoiling and mothers anxious love but i never knew them out of books which were from the first my joy and solace save during my schooldays i led a curiously solitary life i was neither invited nor expected to take a part with his lordship in the daily interests of his condition i did not dine at his table nor ride with him with the hounds nor shoot his sparse coverts nor whip his unprofitable streams he was very tolerant of me and made me even a generous allowance the most of which i hoarded indifferently having no use of it but for books i know that at this pregnant period of which i write i was the possessor of some hundreds of pounds a veritable little treasure chest of gold which had accumulated to me during the years of growth may all my savings return such an account of interest as did these i had my meals with the steward one comely a fellow as excellent as his name but comically guarded in his attitude towards me whether for respect or familiarity i had liberty to take my piece from the gun room and spend any whole day if i chose in blazing away amongst the small game of the unpreserves the stables the library the whole run in short of evercreech were free to me on the queer unspoken condition of sufferance i was always like a poor relation let to holiday in a great mansion during the absence of its owners nor was i ever invited to a more familiar conduct by lady skene herself somehow whatever the reason i was alien to her trust and affections i could have thought she looked upon me as an encumbrance indeed even from the date of the betterment of her fortunes as a veritable changeling who had no inherent right to her motherly consideration well perhaps i had not evercreech lay back from the highroad between footover and market grazing in north west hampshire a wild and haunted country sharing itself between dense woods and lonely downs there were enough of both contained within the estate to serve a young solitary spirit for its ample wilderness for day long wanderings and fantastic chancings by stream and thicket and pretty pastorals won out of high folds on hillsides and all the sting and honey of romance there one might walk or ride a squire of the grael and taste a countys venture in an acre from farm to ruined byre from box hedged garden to the infinite wild tangle of hedgerows from stately culture to nature in her poignant naked savagery one might pass and play ones fancy quite secure from the banter of the prosaic there were family legends too each one enough to make a transatlantic reputation the two that most occur to me illustrate the terror and the sweetness of such old time traditions the first had its locale in hags lane a lonely deep sunk furrow in the pastures but after all libelled in its name for hag or aggart in hampshire means nothing less fragrant than hawthorn but the figure associated with it was of odour to make spectral amends being that of a man astride a great dark horse which leapt the hedge in ghastly gloamings before the eyes of any chance pedestrian and went tearing up the road on soundless hoofs story connected this apparition with a past lord of skene who riding to wreak vengeance on a faithless spouse and her paramour had manuvred the guilty couple to their death over the edge of a chalk quarry and thereafter had taken the disillusioned sultan schahriar for his model though with the limited despotism that his more civilised age enjoined upon him since the moral ruin of his victims must content him without their throttling he was rather a rotten pippin on a tree of comfortable fruit for the skenes altogether had been an easy roguish race hot tongued but affectionate and when caught stumbling on a betrayal of virtue generally ready to make the amende honorable accordingly perhaps they had shown a tendency to msalliances which had procured them nevertheless such a succession of vigorous heirs as to extend their main line unbroken from times prehistoric yet it seemed at last that fate was to intervene for a diversion but of that in a moment if that first legend smacks of midnight and hellebore the second is to my mind a very dirge of rose petals it relates how a sensitive little fellow of the race once lost his mothers wedding ring and died of grief to witness her distress thereafter then his little ghost came haunting a particular bed in the garden a flower face caught fitfully among the leaves or dropping when one bent to pluck it in a shower of creamy petals like a white peonys so that the mother weeping and pitiful was moved at last to sow love in a mist in the bed as it were a net to catch that forlorn small ghost for its kissing and reassurance and for the speaking to it in flower language of how mother did not mind her loss a bit when lo upon a shoot of the plant that sprung the following april was found lifted from the soil wherein it had been lost the ring and the flower spectre haunted its pretty parterre no more the fantastic superstition accorded well i think with the traditions of a house which had been notable as much for its rich maternity as for its fruits of over kindness and the babys garden as the mossy little pleasance sacred to the long vanished phantom was called spoke and speaks to me always of qualities better than wisdom wise excepting in the one instance of my stepfather the judge the skenes were not but they never were lacking i aver in the essential poetry of humanity it neutralised in them even the vulgarity of quite commonplace exteriors time alone has the face which is an index to its nature the best of mens is but a mask round florid beaming my stepfathers was the face of a vintner he might have drawn his pedigree from a beer engine and advertised it foaming froth on a sign none might have guessed from its features its age long inheritance of gentle breeding he was a small man dapper and a trifle horsey in his dress but after an older fashion of collar and harness he wore typically a shepherds plaid tie and his hat at an imperceptible angle he always smelt fresh and somehow of a genial shrewdness and his manner towards me was a manner of kindly condescension it was not until my school time was well over and my days drifted into the purposelessness of an unattached loafer that i became first conscious of an alteration in his attitude towards me and the occasion which produced it was productive of a yet colder alienation from me on the part of lady skene which was as significant of her nature as was his increased consideration for me of his one morning his lordship called me into his study i stood before him as i had often done before vaguely on my guard between submission and independence and he smiled on me a little nervous and excited how old are you gaskett lets see he said i answered i have come of age sir any plans for your future none nothing thought of no direction what could give them a direction here sir he looked at me a little speculating perhaps weve let the question drift too long think it over and think it out we must find a way to independence for you thank you sir you could do me no greater kindness what dye mean he glanced at me curiously i know im here on sufferance sir i said i know my presence is an open sore to lady skene ive long been wanting to ask you something i think i could find myself sooner perhaps if i were given elbow room with all your liberality i feel constrained in evercreech let me have the lodge in the caddle to fit up for myself and live in for the present and until ive come to some decision he stared a bit and laughed and set to scraping his chin his pale blue eyes measuring me you shall have it certainly he said suddenly for your den or hermitage or what the devil you like but it wont do to cut the house connection my boy you must dine and bed at home what makes you think you are not welcome here not my stepfather sir i said he turned to his papers and dismissed me quickly but called me back as i reached the door after all he said perhaps youre better out of the way just now his expression was extraordinarily complex its coming to be the era of pap and flapdoodle ridiculous aint it at this date but is that so sir i congratulate you thankee my boy dont forget ive always liked you and if circumstances deuced aggravating things he broke off humming and kicking up his dapper feet looked at his boot tips ill put some fellows in he said hurriedly and have the place made fit for you youve always been kind to me sir i said gratefully i hope i shant trouble you much longer i was going but he stopped me again trouble be cursed he said you must understand that your happiness and welfare are my aim youre welcome to the lodge for ever or so long as youre convinced that they centre in that bogeyish hole only dont let your fancy run on bitterness evercreech is your home i was conscious of an expression in his face between joy and mystification as i left him it was easy i thought to interpret it here after all this interval was an heir to evercreech expected and his ladys long remissness atoned the thoroughbred was stretching his neck for home the encumbrance must clear himself from the course sufferance having made the pace for welcome must withdraw in proper pride of his humble share in the event and be content to eat his oats in abstraction double distilled nonsense of course but a mothers slight is poison and that venom was in my blood not all the investigations of anatomists can connect the heart with the reason chapter iii the lodge in the caddle once when i was a boy of twelve or so there had come to stay at evercreech a little lady whom i hated with all my heart this was miss ira christmas but very remote from the charity and goodwill which her name suggested she had always appeared to me she was a ward in chancery as i understood and as such committed to the custody of her nearest kinsman my stepfather her mothers hand as i came to learn had once been coveted by him for his son charlie but the lady had decided to bestow her fortune elsewhere and by the very irony of fate the residue of her perversity so to speak was all that reverted to him from that abortive scheme both she and her husband died young in short and the orphan christmas heiress to an intestate estate was consigned to his charge for her education and upbringing she was with us for only a few months before her transportation to france and elsewhere for her finishing education but the little interlude of her presence at evercreech awoke in me such a sense of shame and mutiny as i had never suffered before i knew nothing of her parents but what might be gathered negatively from their reflection in this detestable child i call her so with every sense of my responsibility to the present she had all the instincts of an infantile parvenue and all the hypocrisy of an embryo pharisee her precocious sharpness was early in discovering the disfavour with which lady skene regarded me and in affecting a sympathy with the reasons for that dislike i was bad sullen one of the unelect on her little tripping red tongue i had no gratitude for the gifts of providence in so raising me from the mire to a position which was none of my deserts and which had come to be mine purely through the instrumentality of an evangelical mother i should be thankful on the contrary for every crumb of condescension vouchsafed me a feast if i could only come to realise in it a sense of my own insignificance she was always poking that in my teeth viciously and by innuendo i wondered even that lady skene could stand it since it reflected upon herself but she had truly no snobbism and valued her creed above all earthly aggrandisements the abominable child played up to this weakness or strength in her and so secured her own position as prime favourite with the real head of the establishment as to lord skene i think in his equitable old heart he disliked his ward as much as i loathed her but there were other considerations to influence him she was at least the daughter of her mother and might have been so different had his plans not miscarried his dead boy his shattered hope for ever figured in the perspective of his past life that also perhaps might have been so different might have come to record no lapse upon ancient rogueries had his hope duly taken shape and maturity but the son had disappeared and the father was left derelict how it had all happened was a topic quite taboo in these days a portrait of the boy hung in his room a fresh saucy young face bright with a wholesome determination to live enjoyably but wilful and a little imperious i used to love to look at it when i dared to steal in unobserved it conveyed a sort of challenge and help to me in one and he had been dead how long years piled on years now and no one knew where his bones lay he had been climbing in the italian alps with his tutor a travelling comrade and it was supposed had fallen into a crevasse or down a precipice while exploring the heights alone and thereafter had never been seen mr delane the tutor had given evidence of his parting with him on such and such a day and there was an end of the matter charlie skene had been wiped out and with him all the elaborately compiled record of his fathers schemes and ambitions for him he was near twenty one said miss christmas i know and lord skene wanted him to marry my mother and where would you have been then you little low boy where would you have been i retorted here of course she said and the daughter of a lord and my lord wouldnt have wanted to marry again then and im sure i shouldnt have wanted you you wouldnt have got me if you had i said i hate you o she cried affectedly aghast and ran off to lady skene to complain of the dreadful language i had used she wore her hair in a bag net and i have always detested the fashion she might have been called pretty i suppose by those who find a charm in pertness franked by large eyes and a wicked dimple in a smooth cheek but childhood can see no beauty in what it dislikes instinctive sympathy with itself with its moods and difficulties is its criterion of loveliness this girl and a certain pugsley were my morbid aversions of those days the reverend mr pugsley had been translated through the instrumentality of lord skene and the influence of his lady from a suburban cure to the living of st lukes market grazing he had belonged i believe to the clapham sect or what in his time constituted the remnants of that dour and depressing body its spirit indeed still so dwelt in him morally and physically in his narrow convictions as in his dismal dyspeptic face sloping shoulders and general joyless aspect that a question as to his well being might at any time have been answered by him in the words of the notorious dr jekyll i am very low utterson very low very low a churchman he was in fact so low that he crawled symbolically in the dust and called himself a worm i never disputed that half so much as his calling me one but his professional terminology gathered no inspiration with the years and its eternal limitations were it seemed satisfying to lady skene who was his main prop and patroness it began with wrath and the blood of lambs and foundered in mud among worms and serpents the principle of pre election is very comforting to ones sense of moral responsibility it narrows it to the consideration of that small body which after all it need not consider since it is booked for paradise it seems a cruelty of supererogation to taunt the unelect with their doom but mr pugsley gave me little hope i was a worm a brand baptised in fire that i might inherit ever lasting fire i suppose that very early i showed a scorn of his nonsense and that put his spiritual back up moreover i parodied him and no man though a priest likes to be laughed at for his convictions sir maurice carnac before mentioned happened to alight on the stuff without my knowledge and he made a huge spluttering joke of it here it is founded on a pugsleyite hymn when with the heavenly hosts i sit down sure of my dinner and decked with my crown o what a blessing and o what a grace to think that my faith has reserved me this place though enough is as good as a feast having conquered the gluttonous beast as elect i may stuff on more than enough and not be disturbed in the least when i am safe on the infinite shore free to do naught if i like but adore o what a blessing and o what a good to think i may temper the praise to the mood for enough is as good as a feast in this limited transit at least and i feel more and more that the thing thats a bore in the west might be so in the east to sleep or to venture to feast or to fast no excess possible boredom nor caste o what a blessing and o what a bliss if faith at discretion should bring me to this no enough thats as good as a feast nor nausea rising like yeast but free as the air to praise or to pair quit of the doctor and priest i am remotest from wishing to excuse the doggerel or to defend its profanity but if not inspired it was wrung from an intolerable sense of injury and its effect was at least to make me feel that i had won my spiritual attainder at last little miss christmas came to hear of it and was very cross because it had been destroyed she wanted substantial proof of my wickedness and the verbal means to retort upon my abuse of her dear mr pugsley whom she adored the odious little humbug but as for me i gloried in my unregeneracy and wrote more verses which i came to be wise enough to burn the little wretch as i say came and went but mr pugsley went on for ever i grew apart from him however and at this day it is a wonder to me that his memory affects me with anything but a sense of humour he spoke what he believed after all and i only mention him as an indifferent detail in the context of great events i come now to the time when i retired upon my hermitage in the caddle woods evercreech the house that is to say stands on pretty high ground which on all sides falls away into dense thickets it is a fine old tudor building gabled and with mullioned windows but the different or indifferent fancies of generations have loaded it with incongruous excrescences time however has assimilated these to a reposeful uniformity of stain and line and ivy has welded the mass it was a compact beautiful pile in my earliest knowledge of it fitting crown to its own verdant slopes nowhere are its surrounding thickets denser than to the north where the caddle or wildered woods press up against the high road to footover turning a steep naked shoulder of turf to the view of passers by here had once run the main drive to the house now in the time of which i write long abandoned in favour of a shorter approach southernward and primeval tangle had utterly reclaimed the spot to nature but the ancient iron gates moss eaten and corroded yet hung purposeless in the hedgerow and gave some direction to the trend of the green track which passed under the tree branches within a little wicket for private coming and going had been set thereby high on the bank above the road to which grassy steps descended and at a short stones throw from the wicket stood the old lodge it was so embedded in foliage as to be hardly discernible from the gate a little square stone building and stone tiled there had never been a time when i was not familiar with it its cold chimneys its abandoned little rooms the growth and development and flight and renewal of the myriad insect life with which it swarmed the dank brooding little place had always had a curious attraction for me and now it was my own my retreat whose stagnant solitudes i could use to whatever processes of thought and reflection they might inspire they surged formlessly in me the first time i stood to claim and regard my acquisition the place had been cleaned ordered furnished of course all my scant belongings lay heaped within disorderly but beyond necessary clearances i had insisted that its green surroundings should be respected no ruthless loppings had disgraced my advent the lodge remained the undesecrated shrine to this haunt of leaf loving spirits an old old moss grown temple to the eternal antiquity of nature the fantastic note which speaks in me here i felt throbbing in my veins soft but enchaining from my first possession of the place it was to speak strange things to me before it was done already it was a call but at first far and faint to a green resolution of independence at the outset i had no thought but to spend my days here as a good catholic goes into retreat and to return dutifully to the house at night like any other homing cattle but that purpose came early to dissolve the arrival of the little stranger which happened in the second week of my self exile banished all thought and consideration of me from the central mnage i came to my resolve instantly procured a camp bedstead food drink and cooking utensils from footover and settled permanently into my hermitage no one observed or protested my heart was justified of its utmost bitterness my will of its emancipation henceforth i would possess myself no profitable acquirement for one in my then condition of mind yet on the whole these days were the happiest i had known since i left school though what termination i proposed to them did not figure in my wild philosophy that i am afraid was not sound for it harped on grievance it was nourished on the sense of a hundred wrongs fruit of lovelessness i was moved for the first time to marshal these resolutely before my minds eye i did not believe in original sin some babies were saints and some demons at a month old i was conscious of no inherent baseness in myself nor of a necessity to apologise for my own existence yet the impression enforced upon me the atmosphere in which i had grown had always seemed weighted with the necessity of that self consciousness i had been tolerated and made to feel the fact and lack of servile acknowledgment on my part had been counted to a graceless disposition yet was i not my mothers son and what manner of mother was this who would not have her child share in her exaltation but was perpetually reminding him by implication of the baseness of that beginning which he owed to her and i could have been slave to her loveliness her patient catechumen even in the vulgar pietistic creed which sufficed her soul had she ever once spoken a word of affection played a mothers part to me but when i suffered her eye was as cold as cleopatras she neither read me nor could perhaps nor wanted to i thought myself the perpetual hateful reminder to her of something she would forget and i would not cringe nor be mean nor play the self obliterating part expected of me except in so far as my love of nature and solitude kept me aloof but as i grew up strong even wonderfully strong i think and tall and brown and passable in the face with no hypocritical sense of shortcomings but a feeling that at least i might be held to do a parent no discredit i believed i should come to hate where i was hated and if so i would shrink from using no part of the strength mental and physical with which nature had endowed me i wonder lady skene never saw the danger of her system but her perceptives were narrow to a degree now i did not know who she had been nor how married before made a widow nor what had been my fathers character or business but all at once these things began to exercise my mind when in the first days of my complete separation from the house i seemed to realise myself as something cut away from the main stem a runner pinned down and then severed and responsible for its own future development in fact i began to think on my own account as was my engagement with lord skene only at the outset i am afraid with little concern for a possible vocation choice of that i considered whether for brain or hand might follow on a certain knowledge of my origin and whoever my father had been i had no intention to insult his memory by a pretence to better dues than his on the contrary i rather hoped in my savage misanthropy to discover how my origin justified me in digging for my living but in truth for all my mood i spent my time as much in dreaming as in brooding i was at the romantic age the soft shadows of life on one side its infinite heights on the other the repinings of misunderstood youth appeal i think much more sentimentally to the kind observer than they deserve a thousand compensations of wonder and expectation are always at the service of the most oppressed young manhood i found plenty for myself in that strange solitary life the knowledge of woods at dawn the intimacy of venturesome birds the cosy lamp lit room my own and shelves of glistening books i owed most of the last to the good natured kindness of lord skene who had sent me down a small library of volumes at the latter end of my furnishing these were generally tied into bundles of a dozen or so and had been bought years before as he told me when i went to thank him for his gift at a sale following the decease of a young neighbour of his they had never for the most part been opened since and it was my pleasure to untie the dusty strings which restored their treasures to the light they have their part in the development of the strange story whose opening chapter was now to date itself from the date of my entrance into the lodge in the caddle i shall never forget the weird experience of my first night there the intense humid darkness the awful emphasis the dead silence received from the fitful creeping and falling sounds incidental to a wooded solitude i hardly slept at all the echo of a rare footfall in the highroad beyond was always first a solace and then a terror i would listen for its coming mark its passing and when that owing to the muffling foliage was seemingly halted or delayed my heart thickened to a panic of expectation that the thread would be taken up close by stealthy shufflings about the walls a scratch on a window pane yet after all nothing visited me but ghosts and with those i was familiar they came out of dusky nooks and corners taunting me with my inefficiency my loneliness speaking unutterable things of my despicable position and the neglect which had devoted me to it faint glimmering vistas into the past they showed me glimpses of memory which flickered only to close had i indeed always been thus a burden an intruder i knew nothing of it all my mother in all my conscious memory of her had never been my mother but in name and was there nothing behind her no shadow even of a fathers brief devotion sometimes a strange old face evil and curious would seem to bend down over me but it always dissolved before it could be secured i did not like to think i owed my life to that and when i slept i fought and sobbed and struggled in bewildering mists and the cry was for ever in my heart who am i who was my father why does she hate me so on his account or my own well enough of these moods i am not built of the stuff which harps on self grievances to win sympathy soon and very soon i was to become the master of my fate the captain of my soul and from the first moment of my command i never voluntarily relinquished it the baby a poor peakish little male fellow was born i say and i was forgotten when at last i was remembered development of nerve and character had so fastened me to my position that there was no question of ousting me from it against my will nor was there much attempt lady skene ignored me her husband fatuous father now laughingly acquiesced in my wilfulness go your own way gaskett he said youll come to me when you want me no doubt no doubt at all but not in the way he foresaw in the meantime i led the life of a free forester and was more genially content than i had been for long and then one day came the first of the change it was october and the baby had been born in march i had seen him once or twice at a distance and that was all there was a path running through that slope of the thickets which led up towards the house and this path ended in the pleasant bosky sward known as the babys garden before mentioned it was a lovely quiet spot and thither the honourable master skene was often carried by his nurse for air and exercise i could easily at will command a view of them without being seen myself the life of the wild man had taught me many a trick of cunning concealment and i never scrupled to practise an espionage which was after all only a necessary habit of savage precaution there was an old dead ash bordering on the thin fringe of the woods into whose hollow i could slip from above and thence observe through a spy hole in the trunk it was so close and unregarded in that silent chamber of green that every word spoken from the latter was audible to me in my eyrie one morning i was watching thence for i had a morbid attraction to my successor when he and his nurse appeared before me she was singing to him as she walked in a sort of rhythmical march an odd pang of jealousy as always seized me in their nearness was i not his mothers son too i felt a thickness in my throat and swallowed it down fiercely presently the nurse carrying her charge went away at the farther end and i came out of my hiding and stood at the foot of the tree my eyes bent on the place of their going though indeed my eyes saw little a feeling of shame and melancholy dimmed them even obscured their vision so far that it was not for a moment or two i realised that the pair had come back and that i was discovered i started and bent my brow in a fury and then i saw to my wonder that it was not the nurse who carried the child but a young woman a young lady in fact a vision of frills and golden hair and heliotrope raiment she had evidently met the nurse on her way out and taken the baby from her and returned with it to the garden the other following now all of a sudden she saw me and came towards me at once holding out her burden her eyes were mirthful and conciliatory a smile quivered on her lips wont you kiss your brother she said my brother i had never yet realised the relationship my heart drummed thickly all of a sudden i caught her eyes fixed on mine yes i am ira she said educated and repentant and come back to be punished without a word i turned on my heel and went away through the woods chapter iv a young ladys chastening phase one that afternoon i was sitting glum and glowering in my lodge while the water for my tea was boiling on the fire when i heard a light step in the passage and the next moment she stood before me i had the will and the opportunity now to regard her here in secure possession of my own she not i was the intruder but my steady inquisition failed to abash her she was too confident of her own charms i suppose pray forgive me mr gaskett she said with a twinkling civility i wanted to see the hermit with my own eyes and not with lady skenes or mr pugsleys i asked she laughed you bear a grudge long i have so little else to bear out of the past i said her eyes became serious well i was a beast she said and now im a young lady excuse me the distinction may be without a difference and wasnt i right then she cried with a flush to question your gentle origin i daresay i said but i owe you no consideration for the question it was none of your business and i havent forgiven you for it and never shall she seemed to breathe a little quickly as if distressed then she sat down in a chair and crossed her legs and bent forward to scrutinise me richard she said what a brown strong man you have grown into and rather taking looking too i was an odious little pig there but girls grow up you know i dont remember my little past self with pleasure i can tell you wont you forgive me and be friends what have you come home for to be married o what a question the sooner the better for me she bit her underlip i could have thought it was a swollen red enough little affair already why for you she asked you cant expect me to welcome your reappearance i said cant i she answered well looks ought to count for something with you by now dont they i mature slowly miss christmas call me ira certainly i shant it would be presumption i dont know that it would my fathers father was a chemist i have found that out he kept a shop and invented a pill and made a fortune over it people would take it it became a sort of infection a royal princess caught it and then it was all over with him he bought a pedigree in wardour street and imposed it on the world it would swallow anything from him well my fathers father never invented anything that i know not even a family i date from yesterday and as to pills the pillmakers granddaughter was the bitterest i ever had to swallow she was not offended it seemed thats right she said i told you to punish me i have deserved it i know but tell me if im pretty i looked at her calmly it was certainly wonderful how the petite drlesse in her had developed amplified into something bewitching but it was the adolescence of a witch i thought her hair was umber gold with pale green lights in it and drawn back in loose wings from her forehead and tied into a club at the nape of a very white neck her cheeks were a little lean but pitted with the old dimples at pleasure and the whole contour of her face was frankly girlish soft and kind but for the eyes or at least i thought so there seemed a knowledge in their artless honesty born of depths below the blue blue i say i dont know to this day if they are blue or green it depends upon their point of view whether it be sky or verdure she was slender and smooth limbed a fragrant enough creature but for the odour of memory i answered her deliberately not to me i have had no finishing education i am still governed by childish prejudices i daresay you will be a success elsewhere she sighed a little and got to her feet it is a shame she said and very handsomely you have been neglected shamefully i know but ive no right to speak i wish you thought me pretty well so do i i said but what does it matter you are an heiress she stood regarding me seriously for a little then all of a sudden to my amazement her eyes blinked with tears i stared at her speechless yes i know she said its very silly but youve no idea how youve been on my mind it was at dinan first and then in london where i began to get things into their proper proportions my own insignificance among the number you were somehow always in the background of my thoughts wasnt that funny you know you were a very good looking child richard or perhaps you dont know i was horribly jealous of you anyhow well well i said and how about lady skene miss christmas are you still in favour with her and mr pugsley ce que femme veut dieu le veut she answered laughing with a little twinkle through her tears she is a very beautiful woman and therefore what she thinks must be right i wish you would show me your poem after mr pugsley what poem but all that stuff is over i have burnt everything i ever wrote what a misanthrope you have become but i dont wonder am i to go now you are keeping me from my tea wont you let me serve it for you i serve myself and i intend to for the future there is a story did you ever read it of a shepherd who plucked a flower in a field and brought it home and put it in water and every night the flower turned into a beautiful girl who swept and dusted his room for him and set his meal and was a flower again by the time he came down but one night he caught her and after that she had to remain a woman and serve him thank you but i dont see the point for i havent plucked you and i dont think you beautiful you had better go what would lady skene say i am my own mistress lady skene can say what she likes do let me wait on you a sudden mutiny of retaliation seized upon me what did it matter i felt quite hard and cold to the girl very well i said and sat down she busied herself at once poured the hot water made the tea stood behind me while i ate and drank i took pains to do both imperturbably and at length she never spoke the while at the end i got up and pushed the fragments together now i said you can have your tea on the scraps if you like i am going out i left her seated quietly at the table chapter v a young ladys chastening phase two she came to the lodge often after that and amused herself putting the place in order sometimes while i was present but more often during my absence i knew nothing of what was in her mind but i confess it came just at first to give me a sort of gloating satisfaction thus to accept without comment these ministrations of what was intended i suppose for imperious beautys atonement to the poor beast whom she had wounded herself by insulting she did not speak much going about her duties with a young elastic confidence but a consciousness of unuttered protest over my indifference of wistful glances and deprecations of my blindness began soon to grow irksome she wanted to put herself right with herself i supposed rather than with me i was ready enough to tell her so yet somehow could never find the words one day on entering my den i was surprised to encounter the figure of lord skene seated therein wheres ira he asked at once how should i know sir i answered she isnt here but she comes here at times he said thats her affair shes her own mistress and has told me so i cant command even the lodge it seems dont be bitter my boy he replied only if i were you i wouldnt encourage these visitations i dont thats right you see shes a great catch rather a unique young party with her looks and her fortune i quite understand i assure you sir i shall be only too glad if youll keep her away what a misogynist it is he looked up at me suddenly seemed to catch his breath and put his hand to his forehead what is it sir i exclaimed eh he said vaguely nothing o nothing he appeared to make an effort to recall himself and was presently smiling genially though his loose old underlip trembled what a great fellow you have grown to be sure he said a fine personable fellow and a credit to us too youre very good sir i wish i could think the same ah he said nervously i fancy i know what you mean its that that i came about gaskett you mustnt go on brooding by yourself for ever in this infernal swamp it reflects upon me my boy and upon lady skene besides youve got a a brother up there you know he uttered the word with an obvious effort and it wont do to have scandals started about the proverbial step relations you come up to the house if you want to keep the young lady from coming down here its the wise alternative let her feed her wilfulness in company eh what do you want me to do sir why take your seat at my table like a gentleman and a man of sense we shant poison you forgive my asking sir didnt she suggest this to you who my wife o no miss christmas why now i come to think of it she did mention it a well merited reproof perhaps im beholden to her of course you ought to count yourself beholden to me i think i dont know that ive ever given you cause gaskett to doubt my friendship no sir ill do what you wish of course thats right shoo the place smells like a well we must get you out of it so i donned a dress suit and played the dutiful respectable and took my place at my lords table an odd new experience for me i felt some natural awkwardness about it at first and bungled a little over taking wine with my stepfather for he held to the old fashioned customs but his cellar was good enough to be an education in itself and for the rest the ladies did not embarrass me with their notice or attentions indeed from the date of this my first step towards a social reformation miss christmas ignored me entirely and took pains to impress me with the fact i was duly impressed and amused i supposed quite correctly no doubt that his lordship had given her a hint as to the inadvisability of her visits to me backed by a pretty literal quotation of my own expressed wishes in the matter and that the insult by deputy had instantly effected what the insult direct had failed to do women i fancy have no objection to being bullied in an exclusive and complimentary sort of way but the passion of brutality loses all its charms with them when it takes an agent into its confidence miss christmas was deeply offended and let me know by implication the raptures i had forgone she literally sparkled o nights frolicking like a will o the wisp before my hopelessly unravished eyes her dress her jewels her manner her imperious caprices all expressed and were designed to express the spoilt and whimsical child of fortune leagues overhead a nameless pensioner on that same partial goddesss bounty she sang not so badly on the accidental strength of a pure little contralto voice which of all sorts finds it easiest to keep in tune she displayed in the childish abandonment of her caressings of dogs and cats the passion of thin white arms lures wickedly unattainable to my supposed swooning senses she talked sweetly serious with lady skene on the subject of the divine goodness in damning three fourths of the world for the sake of the other quarter and dropped texts from her lips as daintily as cherry stones if it was all designed as a sharp lesson to me it was all signally successful the girl is mother to the woman i thought she is a humbug here as she was a humbug in my lodge it is nothing but her puckish instinct to play a part to desire i never came to the house but of nights to dine conforming only in its strictly literal sense with lord skenes expressed wish and then i would dawdle out an impatient hour in the drawing room and the moment the clock struck ten be off to my woods again lady skene had accepted my reappearance with no comment but the briefest greeting but i thought her manner to me was more chilling than ever she seemed resolved upon disallowing my last claim to her consideration as a child it had always been as if coldly and softly she had disengaged my fingers one by one from her skirts to which they clung now we were utterly dissevered but i cried out still that i might not hate her she did not hate me i am sure she only looked upon me as a brand a thing foredoomed whom it were useless to shape for a destiny which could never be his perhaps in her deepest heart there may have lurked a terror of herself were she once to permit herself to think of me a fear that after all in some quick frenzy she might be moved to disown the pietist for the mother i will believe it such inhumanity as hers seems incomprehensible without as i held to my wild habits by day playing only in the evenings up to polite convention i was certain to encounter miss christmas about the grounds and as a matter of fact i did many times on such occasions she would always pass me with a warble and a stare or a cock to her kittenish nose as if i were an odorous stable boy which as regularly tickled me until one day i felt tired of it i had run upon her at the head of the thicket path which opened into the babys garden and i suddenly barred her way so that she could not get round me right or left were you going down there i asked signifying the lodge fury flew into her eyes how dare you how dare you suggest it she cried why it wouldnt be for the first time you know i said she looked in helpless anger about her a moment then faced me like a young harpy i thought perhaps in spite of all of all the misfortune at your birth you might be a gentleman at heart but i was mistaken and you are the very farthest from it and i see now that its impossible ever to hope to make a silk purse out of a sows ear thank you for my father my mother can answer for herself the pillmakers granddaughter is the best judge of course let me pass please not just for a minute what did you mean by the misfortune at my birth she was still white with fury dont you know dont you know that youve no right to a name at all you might have guessed i think how do you know i know well enough i once heard mr pugsley say so to lady skene when they were discussing what to do with you and didnt guess that i was hidden behind the curtains i have never forgotten it you may be sure i am quite sure you listened behind curtains like a born lady do you wonder that i have always instinctively detested you no i have shown you i dont the storm in her had subsided in a moment i wondered but was not in the least mollified you have shown me nothing i said but the way to right myself at last with my relations now you can go she did not move however but turned as pale as her frock richard o richard she implored dont hit me like that you are so strong and i am only a girl i had no right to say it it might have meant nothing and lady skene has always been so good to me what reason have you or has she for that matter to expect any consideration from me i will know the truth richard make some allowance you had insulted me too you know i had not you had you asked lord skene to stop me from going to you i didnt he came and asked me himself he told me to remember you were an heiress and i answered that you didnt visit me by my wish you it was detestable i didnt know do for pitys sake forgive and forget no i have forgotten too long i want to remember richard o o richard i hate pills im not a lady wont anything soften you and at that moment the nurse carrying the child came round a bend of the garden she stared and rocked singing something tuneless but miss christmas darting past me seized the infant from her arms and carried it to the path richard she whispered for his sake your little brothers my brother again never had anyone but this girl voluntarily assumed the natural relationship i wavered for the first time she saw it with her sexs quick intuition and held out the warm soft bundle have you never taken him in your arms she said hes so small and weak there hold him and let him plead for me miss christmas cried the nurse her tone all the immeasurable menial warning it conveyed stiffened me instantly i held out my arms and received the burden i could have laughed at its insignificance the apparent proportions of it had made me expect something staggering it lay on me like a doll before i knew myself i was smiling into the little red puffy face there followed a sharp exclamation and on the instant lady skene had snatched my brother from my hands she had come upon us unobserved her face was alight with an expression i had never seen there before the statue had blazed into momentary life she was a woman and a cruel woman confessed for the first time in my knowledge of her not yours she said deep and resentful he has no part or concern with you dont dare to touch him or contaminate him again i stood facing her without a word in that moment my utter hate and vindictiveness were born as she had dealt with me so would i deal with her the first card was in my hand i turned quietly and left them chapter vi my first enlightenment mr pugsley sat in the study of his vicarage at market grazing he was composing a sermon no doubt on the eternal lines of pre election and the divine partiality he never gathered how his principles made a comfortable sinecure of his living but a sinecure it was a sort of well furnished limbo his complete enjoyment of which was only marred by a chronic dyspepsia he looked up as i entered and greeted me with a frown gaskett he exclaimed i was somehow thinking of you and here you are i acknowledged the compliment promptly yes im the devil sir i said and for once in your life youve got to answer to me he started and turned a little yellower this is a strange beginning he wondered for what boy do you hold me answerable to you for concealment sir amongst other things mr pugsley will you please to tell me if i am my mothers son he shifted a paper or two on his desk i could see he was staggered and thrown for the moment off his balance i had no object in hurrying him after all if he had the elective licence he had not the instinct to tell a lie answer at your leisure sir i said my tone i quite felt it took command this narrow mind had no longer any terrors for me i had come in a day of a very stern and sorrowful intellectual age he turned to me presently almost propitiatory what a very curious question gaskett lady skene has surely always done her duty by you that wasnt what i asked i asked if i were her son how can you doubt it i cant sir to my grief to your grief o this is sad he fidgeted with the lamp it was evening and tried to meet my eyes again but avoided them it is very sad i said but why should you deplore it when from the first you have fostered and encouraged in her that spirit which is responsible for all the sadness i gaskett have you not have you not always sir accounted me a child of sin which you are in the fullest sense the admission seemed to slip out of him in his agitation unintentionally having made it he stooped and hurriedly took a nerve pill he always carried a box of them about with him it is what i understand i said quietly of whose sin in the first instance mr pugsley who was my father he was very much upset his hands on the paper shook like leaves what has happened he said why are you asking me these questions let it be enough sir that i am asking them well i dont know think again sir do you doubt my honour young man i tell you i dont know where did it happen you hail from clapham i believe was it there yes if you will ask where is clapham it is a suburb of london and she came under your administrations there officially i suppose he rallied a little struggling to assert himself do you bear in mind gaskett of whom you speak who it is whose errors whose long repented errors you are probing the repentance came too late for me sir and in any case if it is religion it is not reason to make me its scapegoat you were a child of wrath a pledge of sinfulness foregone i see a sort of whipping boy to grace but i have ceased to be a boy theres the devil of it mr pugsley if you dont know who my father was does lord skene know he shook his head with an odd little gasp i saw him making for the pill box again what cried i did he too accept me as a pledge something in his face enlightened me the man was too shallow to hide a guilty self consciousness did he i said sharply or was he never told perhaps that there was any question of sinfulness i could see him hesitate and it decided me was lord skene told i said and took a step towards him was he told i read the answer in his perturbed eyes is this how you reconcile your conscience with your interests i cried scornfully having yielded like a weak creature to resolution he took refuge like a woman in personal grievance he rose quivering all over how dare you come and bully me like this he cried what instigated you to it i say a desire for the truth sir i understood parsons made a speciality of it not at all he retorted angrily at least there are truths and truths to withhold some for a worthy purpose is not to lie yes i said i have read about that but i never knew till now it was a principle of evangelicism he looked at me balefully and in any case what was the worthy purpose here i asked you cannot be expected to appreciate it he said your mother was a vessel potential for holiness as you have the indelicacy to question of her past sorrows you shall be given the truth in full better that than the half measure which would only instigate your base spirit i fear to distortion and exaggeration she had been ensnared by a villain whom she had lent herself to reclaim it was the usual case of a promise given and forsworn i never asked or learned his name in the eyes of heaven she was a wife and any confession of the truth would with such a man as lord skene have been held merely to justify him in his attempts to claim her to ungodliness as a fact he was greatly infatuated accepted the assumption that you were born in wedlock engaged tacitly to ask no questions but to accept on its merits the blessing which had been vouchsafed him then at least in the eyes of heaven which you represent lady skene is a bigamist he seemed to my surprise to accept this casuistry with a certain relief put it that way if you like he said she was distinctly from the moral point of view a wife already though legally unbound then why from the moral point of view am i a child of sin he began to stammer hopelessly i will tell you i said it is because of the wrong she has done me and would visit like a woman upon the innocent head of her disgrace and you hate me because she does and because you have made her interests your own i think you have played your cards very well mr pugsley he bristled through all his yellow skin leave my house he said i will leave it i answered but i will ask you another question first what was my mothers position occupation when she married not another word he cried i have said too much already o he shook a wild finger at me why would she never accept my advice given long ago to place you out in some respectable family i always foresaw that the time would come when you would begin to quarrel with your bread and butter to bite the hand that fed you to to put myself right with my stepfather i said if you attempt it he cried if you dare the wrath of the almighty will fall upon your presumptuous head i laughed well i will think it over i said and turned and left him chapter vii morgiana near all that night i sat out in my den wakeful and deeply meditative was i glad or sorry to have wormed out thus much of the truth and of what potential profit to me was my new knowledge as to the former noblesse oblige better be an unchristened vagabond than the legitimate hope of mr snooks roturier nameless i could make a name of my own not be condemned all my days to the task of redeeming a vulgar one bequeathed me therein was signified i thought the true moral of all nomenclature why for instance should the son of mr rottengoose be handicapped from his birth with that imposed label and libel be forced to carry throughout his blameless life that unasked and unmerited stigma of an ancestors villainous sobriquet have to steel himself to the torture of the titter pursuing him over the edge of the dancing card on which he had just impressed his awful identity be obliged perhaps to advertise his ignominy on a brass plate to stultify his fondest ideals his most romantic passions over the sign manual of a decayed fowl a name bestowed probably in the first instance on a village idiot finally be called upon to cheapen the nobility of his last will and testament in the terms that i robert rottengoose being of sound mind and in full hope of the resurrection etc resurrection of whom forsooth why of robert rottengoose do hereby bequeath my curse i would add to a system which imposes honour or ridicule either undeserved on a new born child let a man be christened into his surname such as he shall make or choose it only when he comes of age amen well i was richard gaskett not so bad on the whole but why was i i wondered if lord skene would tell me i wondered if it were lady skenes maiden name yet hardly that for would not the admission have betrayed her to her noble suitor perhaps it was my fathers since from the moral point of view she was his wife yet somehow morality did not seem to me to be much in question in the matter and on the whole i was inclined to think that my name was as illegitimate as my birth the fact disturbed me only in so far as it afforded me probably no clue to my fathers identity for it was to that that my thoughts were now turning with a very resolute purpose i would discover it by hook or crook learn to whom i was indebted for my disgrace gain into my own hand the knowledge which could make this cruel puppet of a mother move to my will i possessed already the germ of the truth i was base and my stepfather did not know it proof clinching and double wrought would come with that further discovery could i alight on it i would hold it over her head bowing that under an eternal horror of exposure as she had been an unnatural mother to me so would i be an unnatural son to her and all of a sudden the tears were crowding into my eyes i could not tell why and i rose quickly and went to the door it was a lovely quiet night with a moon somewhere behind the trees and all the sky marbled with dove grey clouds and i held out my arms to them neither did i know why but like a child i wanted something or somebody to comfort me it is no good i muttered and dropped my chin heavily on my breast and returned to my brooding but this time over a pipe and a glass of toddy they helped me to brighter if no less defiant thoughts would mr pugsley whisper awfully to his patroness of my visit and put his head to hers in some design to bridle me i cared nothing i felt strong as atlas to bear the world my new emancipation had opened out to me my head rang with a hundred purposes of do and dare i was my own utter master by virtue of that discovery and free let those who had ridden me look to their own harness early on the following morning coming home from a brisk stroll in the november woodlands i found miss christmas in my room she had a brown fur boa round her neck and a little fur cap on her head like a zouaves busby in miniature with a pert plume under the boa was a glimpse of scarlet handkerchief which contrasted rather pleasantly with the gold of her hair and her cheeks were pink with walking she greeted me with a troubled look as she noticed how i paused and my face darkened seeing her there am i so horribly de trop she said when you have nothing but your own thoughts to live with thats the reason i answered grimly you dont make it easy for me she said and i had come to beg your pardon richard why should i help you out in anything unless it were the door she flushed she bit her lip it was as much as her temper would allow her i could see to stand and listen you are really horribly rude she said i daresay i am as a cultivated young lady of family you should have more prescriptive tact than to provoke the natural boor in me i dont believe it is natural i believe in your bitterness you are resolved to make yourself out much worse than you are that is very generous of you and you have come moreover to beg my pardon for what her mouth opened a little she seemed to deprecate my expression very entreatingly her eyebrows took a pained arch her eyes a speaking wistfulness richard she said dont be so angry so unforgiving with me why do you think me either i ask you again what have you come to beg my pardon for her lips quivered as she looked up at me she seemed unable to speak for a moment it was cruel she whispered at last so cruel and ungenerous that i could only wish at the moment that i wasnt bound to her by so many ties of affection but i am and i will be loyal are you apologising for lady skene no i am asking pardon for myself because i was the unwilling cause of it all wont you forgive me richard if i thought i said of calculating up all you have to answer to me for i dont feel very kind to you be unkind then she said only forgive me i struggled with myself a little i cant i said at last im afraid im very vindictive and must have my pound of flesh first take it of me she said at once in whatever way you like i laughed fine heroic words would you submit to the process im in the way to humble some folks richard she said remember who she is spare your mother im ready to take the blame and the punishment for both she was certainly a young slight thing prettyish in a fancy way easy to bend or break you speak rashly i said i remember your story about the shepherd your petals would be pretty well rubbed by the time id done with you very well she said ill take the risk i believe i know you better than you do yourself do you ive half a mind you little flower of fortune to put you to the test im waiting a stubborn devil was awake in me are you offering yourself my slave or what miss morgiana your slave if you like very well the floor wants scrubbing and theres a well outside get some water and scrub it i thought she would fling away at once but instead she took off her hat and jacket found somewhere a pail and brush and went outside very meekly i listened wickedly the windlass i knew would be a task for her chicken arms and indeed i heard her plainly enough panting and struggling with it but for all that she appeared presently staggering with her pail brimful and i made no offer to relieve her of it now i said i wont be witness to your awkwardness im going for a walk and to think over more important difficulties than yours but when i come back i shall expect to find the place cleaned and tidied and you gone and i did i gave her a couple of hours before i returned whistling the floor was white the table laid for lunch two eggs put in a cold saucepan by the grate the fire piled up to smoulder and a nosegay of red leaves and berries placed in a tumbler on the windowsill the place looked neater and homelier than i had ever succeeded in making it and morgiana was gone of the eternal instinct are eves daughters and this one it appeared had no difficulty in throwing back from silks to homespun that night came a very strange experience to me chapter viii the writing on the wall on entering the dining room at evercreech i found company assembled i had not been warned and i was not introduced i came in late and took my seat at the table quietly being placed between mr pugsley and a lady whom i did not know i learned however in due course that she was a mrs dalston who with her husband also present was a new comer in the neighbourhood the two had taken the lone farm a decent but rather decayed property situated on the outskirts of market grazing and foolishly reputed to be haunted but it was inexpensive perhaps because of its reputation and fully adequate to the needs of a childless couple the only other guest was to my pleasure sir maurice carnac who had earlier shown me friendship and who was down somewhere in hampshire for the shooting but he looked little capable of shouldering a gun and was altogether sadly altered from my memory of him having but lately as i learned recovered from a paralytic stroke whose passing had left him much debilitated he lay sunk in his chair like a heap of human ashes and with all the old fire of roguery smouldering low in him but he seemed to awaken suddenly on my entrance and looking across at me as i sat down treated me to a leer and wink hillo charlie my boy he chuckled what sport with the girls hey consternation sat on every face my lord looking much perturbed bent to the old rascal and enlightened him gaskett carnac gaskett he said you remember richard gaskett hey the old man sat up what link of memory had slipped in him obliterating a whole score of years richard hey he said immensely sly i know i know the lovely ones pledge earnest of widowed respectability but mum mum my boy i know what days hey the soup engaged and silenced him at least in everything but its absorption it was some moments before the talk could find itself an embarrassed vent but sir maurice brightened as he fed good fare was the natural aliment to that impoverished soil he had only wandered and lost himself when hungry in a little he had forgotten all about his balourdise and was paying senile compliments along the table to his hostess in the moment of its delivery however the strange lady next me had turned quickly and looked me in the face she appeared to me an utterly colourless person fade thin dowdy with hardly a sign of spirit or expression a condemned ghost of womanhood i wondered presently at the fond attentions with which her husband treated her at his efforts to win a smile from her unresponsive face and his patience when habitually baffled since he himself was a fine bold figure of a man white teethed black whiskered for all his forty five or so years and i wondered still when i came to learn how persistently she had disappointed his hopes of an heir the few children she had born to him having died one by one on the very threshold of their existence but perhaps all those fruitless pangs were accountable as much for his manly devotion as for her insensibility she might have held him responsible for that seed of death which had stultified all the rich woman in her in any case that he was more attached to her than she to him was obvious she spoke little nothing to me and i noticed ate little but crumbled her bread all dinner time i was not concerned inasmuch as it gave me the opportunity to observe elsewhere which i had the inclination and the provocation now moreover to do though the object of the old ex governors misbegotten attention and the immediate brief cynosure of all eyes i was the only one i think not momentarily confounded a curious self possession a sort of conceit of masterfulness had come to claim me of late a kind of cold and scrutinising philosophy had found me out of the old dependence having had long the will to counter my allotted destiny a very little of the means had encouraged me to something like effrontery i felt already a sense of power a truculence in the face of the least supposed imposition on me of superiority while therefore they were all looking at me i was coolly intent on lady skene one hurried glance my way she gave and then her eyes were lowered to the cloth as she drew off her gloves and addressed some commonplace remark to mr dalston who sat on her right her voice i have not yet observed was marked by a slight cockney intonation hardly to be gathered from its softness just a twang from cheapside like the faintest distant whine of bow bells but it was enough to imply her origin looking away from her my eyes travelled to mr pugsley beside me he was obviously flustered and annoyed shifted his shoulders pinched his nose defied self conscious my stare and failed utterly to stand up to it then he cleared his throat with violence and affected ostentatiously to prefer the menu card to my company i laughed to myself speculating on the idyllic guilt consciousness which must be flowing between these two the baronets malapropism had followed curiously pat on my recent enlightenment i recalled the stories of his ancient intimacy with lord skene of his reputed co partnership with that nobleman in a rollicking adventure or two were they my lady and her pious accomplice hearing in their hearts the first creaking of the wheels of retribution poor panic struck conspirators yet i was sorry that fate had imposed on lady skene so vulgar a confederate for i could not but think the man vulgar ordained priest as he was and quite sincere i believe in his evangelicism but apart from him and her subscription to his ugly phraseologic cant she was so lovelily one of those presences whom age cannot wither the rest of the quotation hardly applied to her so perpetual a provocation and aggravation to the worshipper of beauty so serene a thing so coldly tantalising so refinedly a figure for the sweet altitudes of romance ah that she would make me her knight indeed champion of a mothers fame dearer even than a wifes no need then to dread the consequences of an infamy atoned through love i would have struck for not against her but she had preferred the inhuman part so be it i ended my scrutiny with an inward sigh and turned it elsewhere i had plentiful opportunity no one addressed or appeared even to consider me right opposite miss christmas who sat between sir maurice and mr dalston was engaged in rallying her either neighbour charmingly she was quite at her ease with both confident of herself as the most attractive of social siderites a star of unquestionable magnitude and they responded of course men of the world and quick in persiflage they laughed at her butterfly sallies and humoured them because she was pretty and an heiress they were patently captivated ah i thought if you knew how this very morning she has been scrubbing my floor for me no one would have thought it possible she was gay as a fairy flower complexioned her hair like a misty aureole a string of pearls was round her throat and pearls were in her ears wicked little shells for recording scandal and answering to it with pearls of price too said sir maurice after she had retorted upon some society calumny of his o she cried to compare my poor ears to oysters natives said mr dalston there are no oysters and no ears in all the world like our english breed she asked him seriously how he knew if he had travelled much far and wide he said and in all countries except italy i believe i wondered why he made or had made the reservation a sentiment he said as if i had put the question to him i lost a dear friend there once actually i found his eyes fixed on mine they were a dark penetrating feature in his face set under strong brows and somehow quite at variance with the smiling good humour of his mouth his hair though almost white was full and wavy as a boys and contrasted strangely with his jet black mutton chop whiskers and those again with the strong white line of his teeth he was tall and excellently compact with broad shoulders and narrow hips and had altogether the appearance of a man entirely at his ease with himself and the world do you know it italy he asked of me i have never been from here but to school i answered ah he said what visions what a prospect that emancipation from tutelage and all the world to follow he was interrupted by a quick shrill exclamation from his wife look what has happened what is the matter with him she was on her feet we were all on our feet in an instant sir maurice carnac was fallen heaped back into his chair his shapeless old face all wryed as if in an exhaustion of horrible laughter incoherent sounds coming from his lips carnac cried lord skene for to morrow we die this is my business said mr pugsley in an agitated voice all honour to his creed so far for he was terribly unnerved the stricken man was carried upstairs by the servants followed by the minister and his lordship we all waited huddled into a silence unbroken but for the whimpering of the women only mrs dalston remained quite passionless and unmoved once i saw her husband quietly offer to take her hand in his and i saw her as quietly repulse him his according to the feminine persuasion was an irresistible personality all black and white and pink and inevitably suggestive of past triumphs she was the only one i dare swear who had ever been able to keep him at arms length and that perhaps was the secret of her hold over him presently lord skene came down his hand was shaking and his lips as he spilt out a glass of wine and swallowed it pugsley asked him if he was saved he stuttered and he answered that hed be damned if he wasnt there was no refuting that poor old maurice presently he recollected himself and begged his company to stand not upon the order of their going but to acquit him of any suspicion that such an awful calamity had been imminent it was mr dalston who reassured and commiserated him in terms of the readiest and most delicate sympathy sir maurice carnac died that night chapter ix i visit clapham on the second morning after its seizure the body of the old ex governor was carried away in a hearse to footover station thence to be conveyed to its london home i had avoided the house in the interval being jealous of the least suggestion of intrusion but i hung about the drive on the day of the removal and threw a little spray of thyme upon the hearse as it passed so much for a beggars remembrance he had always accepted me fairly old prosperous worldling as he was on equal terms then i put him resolutely out of my thoughts and went back to my hermitage there to mature a little scheme of adventure which i had had in my mind ever since that moment when mr pugsley had confessed to me the theatre presumptive of a certain event in which i was interested an american humourist relates somewhere of a prisoner who had been confined for thirty years in a loathsome dungeon when a bright idea struck him he opened the window and got out now some such inspiration had seized me all in an instant why in the name of perversity was i eating my heart out in an aggrieved solitude when simply at will i might be a traveller a tentative explorer at least and be learning to ride my own destinies instead of being ridden by them i had not yet sat like the mythological gentleman so long upon a rock that i had grown to it i had means and certainly at least a definite object in breaking into them i would wing my test flight for that clapham suburb which pugsley had mentioned and examine the ground there at least for subsequent exploiting a tingle of adventure was in this as well as a vengeful resolution it would be something after all to breathe a novel air into my stagnant lungs i had lived so long remote and self contained that the prospect of even a cockney suburb was a prospect potential of romance to me no one would note my absence and if anyone did how would it concern me i was free and my own master and so the very next morning valise in hand i strode away walking determinedly with no effort at concealment i went out by the wicket and took the road to footover and thence a train to waterloo i was young green gullible no doubt but a certain hardness of muscle and disposition was always at my service and that of others few minor mishaps of the way have befallen me through life and i was early in expanding to the practical knowledge which overrides difficulties i mention this merely to explain the ease with which my inexperience resolved these first small problems of self dependence my introduction to the roaring traffics of existence to the wiles and hypocrisies of men i spent that night at an hotel in the waterloo bridge road and my initiation into its ways profited me early on the following day i walked through the seethe of the streets to the victoria station and so by the local service reached clapham road i will not say that i greeted this goal to my adventure shapeless as that was without a certain excitement and hurrying of the blood here somehow and somewhere had been enacted the prologue to my young unprofitable life this same busy street going up southward through a dull avenue of bricks and windows had housed perhaps the germ of that secret which dark and poignant a one as it appeared to me was nevertheless of the commonest breed of secrets all the world over and indeed its setting here seemed prosy enough monotonous respectable unlovely houses built for the most part in the sober chocolate hue of a century earlier staid rows of shops moderate traffic of omnibuses passing back and forth everything betokening a condition of decent prosperity but coming presently into a sort of little open place or circus where the single road split out into a fan of three i was refreshingly struck by some more definite suggestion there of an atmosphere which had already thinly appealed to me this atmosphere was faintly redolent of past coaching days it breathed from the tavern doors of the old plough inn about which were congregated a half dozen or so of the very legitimate descendants of tony veller but fallen alas upon degenerate times the omnibuses which they drove in these stood ranked yellow and green and red by the kerb when any one of the loiterers detaching himself rubicundly from his fellows would mount a box and gather the greasy ribbons into his gloved hands a whiff of henry alken of his coachmen and stable tubs and ostlers would seem irresistibly borne into ones senses so too the rows of white posts and rails skirting that side of the common which made for tooting tooting what suggestion in the very word of windy horns and galloping mails seemed to carry one into far perspectives of dead and past adventure it was this way though i did not know it then streamed the enormous traffic of the derby week a page snatched out of the regency eld and still keeping the gay characteristics of that reckless hard drinking era but now the road appeared peaceful enough a sunny road skirting a great sunny common where lazy gipsy men of the true romany chal type kept a paddock of donkeys for hire and little rookeries of crazy tenements marked at intervals the camping grounds of dead and gone squatters perhaps it was the result of my reading or of a purposeless sentiment or of fate let it be what you will but i was moved to take that road in an easy sauntering mood its freedom its inviting openness appealed to me i am no believer in the divinity which hedges kings or exacts its wages of sin but i am a believer in luck luck is the only power so it seems to me who can reconcile the discordant claims of the creeds some men most one may say pray to him in vain i have an idea that he was the nameless the unknown god of the greeks and no doubt of his nature it is fruitless to appeal to luck perversity is his rule of godhead his rules prove the exception he smiles not on his votaries nor frowns on his maligners incuriousness about him is the only way but by no means the inevitable one to attract his notice whereby i really think i became his casual protg in all these days my creed was never other than a creed of indifferent and independent fatalism if to fatalism can be applied such a term of belief in any case it was near enough to aggravate luck into seeking to win me to his worship instead he made a first tentative bid for my suffrage on the present occasion i had sauntered a half mile perhaps up this pleasant old coaching way the open common with its ponds and trees and gorse thickets to my right hand to my left a long rank of houses comfortable mellow prosperous having for the great part bushy gardens in front when my eye was caught by vision of a cosy tavern standing across the way in a copse of elm trees and bearing in its every appointment and circumstance the tokens of a vanished era the little paddock of turf in front planted with the sign of the windmill and having its own private posts and rails round which the drive swept the wooden horse trough the brown of the walls and the gold and grass green canvas hung up on them inviting irresistibly to somebodys entire here was the right regency travellers rest and be thankful it was mild bright weather and a water cart went by sprinkling up an aromatic scent of dust i thought of beer beer in a glass amber and sparkling with a kiss of foam at the lip and i crossed the road to the tavern and there over its door stuck up before my eyes was the legend richard gaskett licensed dealer in beer tobacco and spirits a sort of catalepsy seized me as i looked and gaped the coincidence of course might be just a coincidence yet gaskett was not what one might call an everyday name and then richard gaskett and to occur in this place of all places suddenly the thought rushed into me as if a plug had been taken out of my brain gaskett was it perhaps after all my mothers maiden name and my dishonoured grandfather a publican here indeed would be discovery though not the most flattering possible to myself i came out of my trance with a little gasp and giggle noblesse oblige i thought again very likely i am suited above all things to be a potman but in any case i must set this at rest i drove open the door of the private bar and entered there was no one there but behind the counter a plump short man of the conventional boniface type he was a bleary rather unctuous looking fellow with a mole near his mouth like a faded patch an obvious wig both suggesting anachronisms on an earlier date and a snow white apron bent about his portly form he also it appeared was in right succession from the regency though he might not have been more than sixty or so i looked at him with a fearful speculation as he lifted a pot or two to wipe the counter underneath was there a family likeness here who could say lady skene was a teetotaller richard gaskett i murmured hardly articulate thats me he said going on with his work thats me too i said snatching at resolution he glanced up a moment o he said then that makes three of us three my name your name and the other chaps said he i shouldnt a thought it in reason and all to happen here but it seems it is now sir the last was an invitation to me to order something he drew me my beer from an engine whose handle was worn from his oozy grip who is the other chap i asked him do you mind telling me why not he said and crossed his legs and leaned one elbow on the counter like a pottle bodied leicester square shakespeare leastways he continued i will and i wont and i can and i cant seeing as how he was christened if he were a matter of what why it must be twenty year ago who was christened i asked the other one he answered let me think now he crossed and tapped together ruminative the fat forefinger of each hand as if he were numbering up a score of notches in his memory i misremember the exact date he said suddenly but the old lady she stands as clear as a peppers ghost in my mind mother carey they called her and she lived in white square down there and every morning reglar as the postman shed come in here at eleven oclock for her gill of gin and peppermint like a very particler old duchess shed been on the stage in her time i understood and wasnt to be put off with anything lower than the genuine london old tom god bless me how she comes back he basked a little in a glow of memory before he continued luminously i recollect the very day she bought it of me just as plain i do as if it was print bought what i ventured my name sir he said she come in here as excited as punch and we got talking together mr gaskett she says i want a name well i answers theres plenty agoing for choice what do you want it for for a babby she says as hasnt got one of his own o ho i says thats the game is it well shall i sell you mine for a pint done she says and done it was shed a superstition she said about giving him one that wasnt his by right of birth or purchase and that settled the matter i dont know if he was christened that way if he was youre the third and that makes it funny not so odd nevertheless i thought by two thirds of its oddity if the tremendous suspicion sprung suddenly into my mind were justified but anyhow it was a certain relief to find that this beery amphitryon was not my grandfather and you you never saw your godson so to call him i asked not i said mr gaskett stoutly but whoever he was he might ha been worse called that i will say i never see the old lady again neither and that fixes it in me now you yourself sir i suppose you was called after your father i detected a sudden insolent curiosity in his eye to be sure what with my age and inquisitiveness there seemed a certain coincidence here but i kept my nerve and put his question aside with another where is this white square down yonder he said coolly off the high street but she wont be living there now wont she i answered as coolly for my part but i dont know that it matters to me whether she is or isnt nor to me said the landlord moving away with a sudden repudiation of me and all my concerns i had offended him and was not sorry to have done so he scowled at me balefully as i finished my beer and left the bar once outside i retraced my steps with a very sombre mind i had an overpowering suspicion that there was only one legitimate richard gaskett after all the other two had been resolved into one and he with nothing but a pint pot claim to the title well so far so good at least for romance luck had brought me something i strolled down again by way of the posts and the rails and the busy old air circus going for a short distance down the high street beyond i encountered a policeman and questioned him white square said he and wheeling stolidly signified the very passage by which he was standing i looked down the gully curiously it went on a basis of trampled filth into an open space a hundred yards beyond whence came a sound of quarrelling women and squalling children o i said do you happen to know if a mrs carey lives there he conned me a moment as if speculating on my possible purpose in asking then hailed authoritatively an ancient inhabitant who was at that moment shuffling up the lane you mullins anybody of the name of carey living in the square mr mullins leered up fondling his hands obsequiously the privileges of this alsatia it was evident ended at the passage mouth he was an obscene looking old rascal with a face like a half blind sheep and the gaunt framework of once powerful shoulders carey is it sir said he carey your honour i remimber a lady of the name mither carey wed be afther callin her but shes gone long sin when gone demanded the officer itll be a matther of twinty year maybe said the old man my mimirys bad thats it i put in hurriedly seeing the law about to protest its of her i want to know mr mullins considered me astutely from under his lids honour amongst thieves sure enough but wasnt there such a thing as a statute of limitations to the duties one owed besides a reward might be in the air i pride myself so far on my worldly precocity that i tipped him moderately on the spot the act refreshed his memory wonderfully i recall she came into money did the ould lady he said and tuk herself away there was a daughter shed be owning a fine handsome girl that had her throuble and married a lord despite he saw her on the stage twas said a young jule of a thing and lost his heart to her but there was a parson in them days up at the tin chapel yander pugsley was his name the heretic and he made her religious musha the scoundrel and brought her ould lord to terms and married them he stopped and covertly bit the coin i had given him to test it and what became of the mother i asked seeing that he proffered no more she tuk herself arrf your honour said he you dont know where no by the powers i dont and thats the thruth he said and indeed there could be no purpose in his lying then i had only one other question to ask and out it came do you remember who was her partner in that that little trouble you mentioned mr mullins leered horribly there was quare tales he said i recollect that same one would call him here and another there and a third would be whispering of a master in the grammar school beyant but that was just talking mother carey could be close when she wanted what was his name the masters its clane gone from me said mr mullins blankly one might trace it out at the school itself perhaps i turned to the policeman gone too he said it was all closed before my time theres shops there now so i was temporarily baffled but as having invented something plausible to the men to account to them for my curiosity i went on my way i was taking a fierce oath in my heart that not stone nor briar nor water nor fire should turn me now from a pursuit to which accident or luck if you like had already hallooed me so promisingly if this mother carey lived she was my quarry but where and how to find her chapter x editorial the mention of stone and quarry by mr richard gaskett fits significantly enough here into the context of sinister events they are to be found nowhere in more suggestive juxtaposition than in the island of portland where the great prison is one fair november morning the gates of this terrific stronghold were opened to discharge a time expired convict the man walked plump out of hades into elysium like many another expurgatus he bore the scars of his cleansing indelibly printed on him the governor of hades it must be remembered fathered the furies and the business of the furies is to lash lash irrespective of any consideration of moral deserts this prisoner had for full twenty years been persistently clamorous of his innocence at first in italian later in italian english finally in a dialect hybrid of english and despair he had forgotten his tongue his personality his meaning in the world only the sense of a gigantic wrong remained with him for some time prior to his discharge he had been permitted to resume himself to grow his hair and beard so that he might never protest that he had been restored to existence a marked man his hair and beard came white where they had been black his face was the drawn grey face of an old man he could resume nothing of his past whatever not even that deadly conviction of injury for that indeed had dwelt with him throughout save for it he walked out of the gates reborn to age not youth they had been glad enough to get rid of him even prison officialdom grows weary of kicking back into its kennel the caged and struggling wolf so helplessly barred from his natural diet and so naturally seeking an escape to it this antonio geoletti had made more than one such attempt and been ruinously flogged for it he had suffered darkness famine solitary confinement more than reason his own or others could comfortably consider yet what was to be done with a man who could not be induced to accept an error of the law if such indeed had been committed with an accommodating philosophy as a convict which was solely how officialdom was called upon to regard him he had been unspeakable a very bad egg indeed his good marks were nil his livery of disgrace when he was summoned to doff it was still of the most conspicuous colour the bright yellow which betokens the irreclaimable standard it had been to the official discomfiture no less than to his own that his conduct had obliged the law to exact of him his full term of punishment and in the end the only profit was his he crept out of hades an unticketed man free to pursue unwatched the solitary purpose that survived to him vengeance on the authors of his unheard of sufferings the question remained were those beings still in being antonio never even put that question to himself vengeance is timeless for all those twenty years of elsewise obliteration the lust for it was as red in him at this day as when he had heard himself convicted on false evidence of a heinous offence and had vainly striven a foreigner and incoherent to explain to the court the real purport of a villains traducing he could not believe for an instant that the god of his superstition had let the work of his legitimate hands be anticipated by another no the men remained to him somewhere only to find them i do not ask your sympathy for this antonio geoletti if he had been convicted unjustly he had been purposing a crime at the moment which merited a just conviction he may have got his deserts indirectly though to be sure there was no automatic standard for apportioning its exact term of punishment to either offence the measures of the law are not even comparative measures and many men all over the land are suffering under widely different sentences for a like crime only self consciousness of one evil doing does not reconcile one to punishment for an imaginary other that is human nature and for all the moral purposes of this record antonio felt himself the divinely commissioned though long wickedly withheld minister of retribution but at last his time was come it was the sense the indelible haunting of this obligation which upheld him through all the terrific experience of his first re emergence into the arena of living things the pale november sunlight smote upon his eyes like the blast from a sudden opened furnace the speech of free people struck him as almost a sacrilege being uttered unconcerned in this boundless temple of gods own liberty he blinked and staggered like a disentombed miner the prison frowned behind him the island with its quarries smiled before how often had he cursed those indurate blocks symbols of the system to which he appealed in vain thrown down his ringing tools upon them in a monstrous rage of helplessness and turned to find a warders gun barrel at his head now they lay in the mist as soft as fairy bales all their sinister weight drawn out of them objects potentially suggestive of the noble fabrics in which each was to have its place he heard a robin singing and his eyes came wet with tears sobbing god help him like a woman and always and never changing with that dream of blood in his heart he crept out into the world how beautiful a thing it was apart from its people he had forgotten how soft the sunlight lay on it how green the grass could grow how fathomless was the blue of heaven limit and close obstruction were all he had known for so long even the daily tramp to the quarries had entailed a guard on speech and sight now he was free to gaze to drunkenness to sing if he would yet it was a world no newer to him relatively than when he had last left it a double decade ago he had not awakened like rip van winkle to the repossession of his own it was england the strange island which in those far distant days he had scarcely crossed the channel to see and exploit before he had been caught into the toils of its inexplicable laws and put away to rage out his heart in an age long confinement for a crime which he had never committed once he recalled he had been an astute piedmontese rascal a guide and porter at an hotel in the high alps who had suddenly in bad times elected to travel with the purpose to sell to a certain person a certain secret of which fortune had made him the possessor that was all done with only the sense of the blood lust of the inherent vendetta existed to identify him with that old antonio geoletti for the rest he had seen so little of this england that a twenty years hiatus in its history made no difference to him whatever it was no stranger to him now than it had been then he had found useful compatriots in it he would find them or others like them again one or two he had encountered in the course of his long punishment he had their approximate addresses and the addresses of a score of english pals scoundrels whose sympathies had naturally gravitated towards one who had not only been imprisoned for breaking the law but who had broken over and over again the laws of imprisonment but he did not need these at present one and all he dismissed them from his mind to seek any out would be he knew to attract the attention of the police to himself and he desired only to steal away and be forgotten to pursue unobserved and unsuspected the single deadly purpose which haunted his soul white haggard unmanned in all else but this he might as he stole on his way have passed for the very personification of an inhuman nemesis in his hugging and caressing of his monomania it occurred to him presently that fate had at least vouchsafed to him one compensation for his sufferings they had disguised him effectively from recognition by his enemies who would think to identify this grizzled time worn beast with the vigorous rogue who had been haled from the dock to a living death he wondered sometimes that his enemies had never foreseen this crisis to their villainy late but inevitable in its arrival yet perhaps they had foreseen it and calculated contemptuously upon the thousand possible accidents of time or at least upon the taming influence of penal servitude if that were so that were well he would not for all the world have his purpose suspected or provided against craft a patient unsleeping unobtrusive craft must guide all his footsteps henceforth he had some money in his pocket hardly earned but still in human justice not withheld the last thing they wanted was to see him back at portland he would nurse every penny of it as if it were a jewel beyond this he had his railway ticket to london it was there he wanted to go he had said and thither they had sent him but not to soho no more of soho for him one wintry afternoon a certain doctor came striding back from his rounds to his house in doddington grove kennington it was a highly respectable street with substantial dwellings on either side and a double plantation of lime trees on the pavement in front to justify to the world its title the doctor was of a brisk impatient manner and he opened his door with a latch key as if the second the act lost him were a second made unprofitable once inside he turned up the gas in the hall it was foggy twilight without and hurriedly examined a slate for engagements made during his absence while he was reading hat on head his housemaid appeared theres a man waiting in the consulting room sir she said the doctor nodded pondered a case or two put the slate down and went to his visitor hey he barked whats your name the man who had risen on his entrance stood motionless before him his left hand pressed heavily upon his right which thickly bandaged it seemed he held against his chest the fingers of the exposed hand were scarred and stunted the face of the man was grey and rigid as a corpses showing a grin of teeth too only the eyes in the face were piercingly alive like a crouching cats he muttered something inaudible what snapped the doctor speak out i cant hear you again the stranger murmured hey said the doctor testily cant you speak louder what is it an accident something the matter with your hand he was of a quick nervous temperament and harassed with much business the figure before him was decent and respectable enough but quite uneloquent of any sumptuary promise and time with him meant money he was opening his lips to speak again and pretty summarily to finish when something in the strangers aspect or attitude arrested him in an instant he had leapt and after a brief vicious struggle had wrenched a knife from the mans right hand the apparent bandage on that had merely covered it seemed a deadly purpose geoletti disarmed stood quivering slightly but otherwise impassive i see said the doctor softly i see watchful of the other he glanced at the blade he had secured it was a waspish sting of a thing keen tempered folding into a handle which when needed became a hilt meant for me he inquired lifting his brows when bearded by a patient he became frost and whipcord no no not the words were spoken low but distinct enough at last for whom then the tip of geolettis tongue travelled between his lips he was evidently trying to master the reaction from a tremendous strain and at the same time to find speech to lay the suspicion of any for no one no that is the truth he whispered out at length the doctor tapped the blade in his hand peremptorily a lie have you ever seen me before no have you ever been to this house before he dismissed the coming denial with a flick of his hand his sharp merciless penetrativeness had its instant effect the italian responded to it automatic like a close echo to the tap of a drum have you yes when how long ago twenty year the doctor was always one of those lucky downright people who quite scornful of the laws of defamation when they find a man meriting their chastisement go through life speaking their minds with impunity that was when my predecessor lived here he said shortly he was a drunken blackguard and worse a disgrace to his calling it has taken me fifteen years to build up a practice on the ruins of his infamy his name was blague was it him you knew yes and meant to knife yes i daresay what had he done to you the strangers eyes seemed suddenly to roll in his head he clasped his hands convulsively to his breast words come from him in a broken stream it was in this ver room yes i arrive by appointiment to meet wonn ozer a zhentleman yes that i want to see ver much i want to see him i have a little word i wish to spik to him and he send me message to com here and he will follow to me he not arrive when i arrive no i told to wait for him in zis room and still it is a long time and he not come zen presently there enter a yong woman a paziente of blague and he shut us in togezer and all quite sudden she begin to scream and tear herself then blague he rush in and i am accuse and the coppar he com and drag me to the stazione and i am accuse and again before the judge i am accuse and i try to spik the truth of what i com to blagues house for and i am told it nozzing no bearing on the case whatever except it show me bad character and the yong woman she swear against me lies lies all and i sent to prison for twen ty year for twen ty year i sent zen i know zat blague and ze zhentleman make zis op togezer so to get rid of me and i swear vengeance on zem for twen ty year though i wait it sall com at last the doctor was shutting up the dagger knife very coolly as he listened not to one of them at least my friend he said blagues been dead of the horrors this ten years and a good riddance to him dead the word seemed to stun the man yes dead and ze ozer i know nothing of him and dont want to know his name i dont wish to hear it thatll do here take back your knife geoletti received the weapon in silence you no help me he said presently in a slow voice certainly not i become no party to this business besides what were you here for blackmail it smells like i daresay you got your deserts now be off with you he made a rapid step opened the door and imperiously beckoned the man out geoletti after a moments hesitation stole softly into the hall and disappeared thence into the fog hm thought the doctor returning victim or not theres been black work there i shouldnt grudge that knife i think in the ribs of one of blagues confederates like as not hell get it but ive neither business nor inclination to interfere so far as im concerned the matters ended there was a board to let up before a certain house in eaton square both the board and the house which it advertised appeared particularly decayed and out of repair there were even windows broken in the latter and what with its dingy walls and flaking stucco and the vision of a wrecked venetian blind or two dropping forlorn slats across the inner obscurity the house looked actually frowsy for such a neighbourhood thither one morning came geoletti and stealthily examined the legend painted on the board apply to foot liddel poultry he read with difficulty and straightway or as direct as persistent inquiry and answer could help him betook himself to the house agents offices in the city he was about to enter when his hand on the varnished door caught his attention after an instants thought he withdrew bought and donned a pair of cheap woollen gloves from a shop hard by and returned to the swing doors a clerk at the broad counter within accepted him with an encouraging courtesy it was the rule at foot liddels on the principle that dirt may hold much gold in solution unexpected affluence was often found in the most unpromising looking customers grubbiness in consequence was no bar to the firms affability the youngest employ could quote of his knowledge the instance of a would be client who had shed fleas on the order book all the time he was cheapening a marble mansion in park lane he had had a nose like a tapirs and might have been held for a first example of gold dust in deposit if he had exhibited any sign whatever of its ever having been washed out of him geoletti asked if he might have an order to view the house in eaton square and was answered certainly by the polite young gentleman whom he accosted here probably enough to the auctioneering view was one of those self made contadini who like the brothers gatti had turned in the profitable processes of time a little ice cream shop into a gilded and bemarbled saloon moreover the house in eaton square had for long and for some inexplicable reason remained a drug in the market it would be a good stroke of business to let it to an italian parvenu geoletti being asked for his name and address gave both glibly without a hint of premeditation he was antonio geoletti of portland a quarry master he said not the shadow of a chuckle in himself answered to this espiglerie as he received his ticket he looked across steadily at the young gentleman who own ze house who it belong to he asked there is no tenant there at present said the clerk a mr dalston is the landlord yes yes said the italian a trifle too eagerly can i see him ze landlord personally the clerk became a little cold we act for him sir you can approach him through us ah zen he live somwheres near i am not at liberty to give his address we are in a confidential position in these matters if you like to write we will forward your letter with pleasure again baffled geoletti considered gloomily then shook his head wait while i see ze house he said and walked off with his order it directed him for the key to a caretaker on the opposite side of the square the woman offered to come with him but he insisted on being alone it was with a queer fury of the blood that he mounted the unwashed steps and prepared to enter the deserted house the door stuck to its lintel from disuse snapped open with a dusty jar turning as he closed it geoletti saw an addressed letter lying among a litter of circulars and advertisements on the floor he took it up and read its superscription m dalston esq eaton square london was there a possible way here to the knowledge he desired pondering a few moments he suddenly woke to action left the house closing the door behind him and with the letter found his way to the nearest post office i find zis behind ze door zere said he pointing to the address on the envelope the clerk who received the letter from him glanced from it to him and back again suspiciously dont understand he said where did you find it zere said antonio i go wiz an order to view an empty ouse and zis have fall through the letter box the clerk whispered with another nodded understandingly and threw the letter on a shelf all right he said should have been readdressed and prepared to go on with his work that one might say was the post office servant all over antonio patient and unoffended essayed a hopeless question should be readdress he asked to where zen the clerk sniggered aloud to his next companion a young lady one of the newly emancipated sisterhood with a nose already above her station thats not your business said she well see to it and the two ignored him ostentatiously baffled again and yet again geoletti went back to the house this time he made a thorough examination of it it appeared just a repository for old dust and echoes the only living things that inhabited there were mice and spiders and what they thrived upon the lord knew the nozzles of the scullery taps were thick with brassy scum the edges of the broken window panes were yellow and blunted with the weather there was an acrid deserted smell about everything it was a large house a property suggestive of handsome returns to its landlord yet the atmosphere of it seemed costive with uninhabitableness there are many such places in london which having every apparent advantage of position and accommodation fail and fail to find a tenant certain ghosts perhaps are their bodiless caretakers and these may resent the intrusion of their possible ousters they do not want the scent of their hauntings crossed by lovelier and more desirable spirits antonio went wandering with a dull half aimlessness up and down presently in a small ground floor room to the rear his foot kicked against some paper he wrenched up the rusty bar of the shutters and let in a flood of squalid light the thing he had encountered was a torn catalogue he stooped and secured it it was a thickish quarto of flimsy paper a long dictionary of houses many illustrated with plates advertised for sale or lease by the firm of foot liddel a hope gripped him rapidly and hungrily moistening his right hand second finger he swept over the pages suddenly a mark arrested his eager review of them it was pencilled against an entry describing a property the lone farm situated in the neighbourhood of market grazing hampshire the place was described as desirable and cheap geoletti looked all round the room noted its time stained paper and ragged skirting and came back to the catalogue then very carefully and comprehensively he went through the whole book page by page and convinced himself that there was no other marked entry whatever very jealously then he extracted the page containing this solitary clue folded and put it into the pocket which contained his folded knife two secret things potential possibly of retribution there was at least the hope he went quietly about the house effacing every sign of his examination then passed out into the street crossed the square and returned the key to its custodian thenceforth he was seen no more in london chapter xi autobiographical the face at the window when i got back to my woodland hermitage which i regained as i had foreseen i should without my absence from the house having excited any comment i put up in a little frenzy of mockery an altar to the god of luck i drew a picture of a clergyman mr pugsley it was meant for christening a baby out of a pint pot and turning to demand of a villainous old pew opener my imaginary presentment of mother carey who stood beside the infants proposed title the question within a scroll issued from his lips and the answer richard gaskett godson of the publican of that name from hers i had bought in footover on my way back a bottle of gin and one of peppermint essence and these i clasped round with a single label bearing the motto in vino veritas and stood them on a little table underneath the drawing which i nailed to the wall no one but miss christmas barring my stepfather on a rare occasion had ever invaded or was like to invade my snuggery and if anyone did i was reckless about consequences then i sat down to consider over a pipe my present position and gains these amounted to something at least the discovery that my mother and my mothers mother i could hardly bring myself to acknowledge the old bibulous harpy for my grandmother had both been on the stage the discovery that their name was carey the discovery that the elder had come into money been pensioned off belike by lord skene and that the younger had found religion at the hands of mr pugsley of the tin tabernacle all these little enlightenments and confirmations made a certain definite grounding on which i might hope to embroider that web which should catch lady skenes feet tripping true the main object of my venture was not realised yet even there luck was shaping me out a promise an usher at the grammar school that villain who had taken base advantage of a poor ingnues warmth over his reformation it was as much in reason as anything else that a pedagogue could be something less than immaculate quote eugene aram not to speak of the stockwell schoolmaster who chopped up his wife and put her in a box but whether it were a pedagogue or his pupil a learned theban or a scented puppy i was confident that time served by cunning and caution would betray him to me soon or late i had learned much already and knowledge is always an investment which pays itself automatically at compound interest nor were my discoveries the only profit i had brought back from my journey a firmer confidence in myself a more obdurate determination a certain newly realised sense of humour these were to be included in the gains i felt a reinvigorated sense of mastery a larger grasp of the world i felt an insolent sense of security in lucks favouritism i felt somehow like a weasel that watches a rickyard from cover how i could make the rats squeal and run if once i elected to show myself in the open i was in a very detestable humour that is the truth on the morning after my return i took a long stroll round about the skirts of the estate beginning with the bare ruined choirs of the woodlands and coming round by hags lane where the hawthorns had been stripped stark by the wrecking winds winter with all its moan and mystery shivered upon the air the sheep on the pastures seemed to crop with haunted ears pricked to it there was a stiffness as of dread expectation over all the land to the many figures which danced and crowded into my mind throughout that lonely tramp the figure of the girl whom i had hated and scorned would sometimes my scorn despite add itself it even became all at once a persistent demon thrusting itself forward pleading for a monopoly of my attention an impudent outrageous claim what was the creature to me or i to her in this play of leading parts my concern was with the real actors and actresses not with the skipping figurante who came to fill the interludes of scene shifting this ira good lord of the hebraic name was she a watcher as her name implied perhaps she was perhaps all in an instant the thought struck me what if she were lady skenes spy the agent of a guilty conscience deputed to discover the reasons for my withdrawal from its control the thought was so sudden so ineffable that it made me gasp she had been down to my lodge during my absence that i knew the signs of her womans handiwork there were unmistakable i will even admit that my instant recognition of them had given me an odd little thrill compound of triumph and something like pity that she should have continued true to her principles of expiation though i was not there to witness had gone some little way towards forcing from me a grudging belief in her sincerity but now if there was all the time a method in her humility on the thought the memory of my altar came into my mind had i been already fool enough in my boasted emancipation to give my case away to a spy i hurried with all speed back to my den and there was the girl standing before the picture she had on a blue sprigged apron with a tucker a broom was in her hand and her furs and jacket were thrown upon a chair she turned round instantly upon hearing me and her face flew pink with some sudden emotion richard she said pointing to the caricature what on earth is the meaning of that go on with your work i answered savagely i shouldnt have come back if id known you were here she bit her underlip but obeyed at once i sat down watching her morosely from under my lids as she swept and dusted and laid the cloth for lunch all silently then i called her to me come here she left the table and stood before me kneel down she knelt at my feet looking up and panting a little i took her soft chin in my hand and she did not move and i kept her so glaring into her young eyes you are very loyal to lady skene are you not i said you told me so you know yes she whispered were you instructed by her to take this means to come and spy on me no how could you think it if you cry i shall turn you out at once you arent watching me then to find out what im up to no indeed why do you come here im so sorry for you is that all and so anxious to earn your pardon you neednt worry yourself about that i dont take the tricks of such midges as you into my philosophy but you havent forgiven me i dont consider you at all are you offering to cry again no im not im not really well what did you make of that picture nothing whatever its a picture of my christening the christening of richard gaskett i got my name out of a pint pot that old womans my grandmother shes fond of gin and peppermint thats why i put the bottles underneath you know ive been away yes well my journey was useful to me i found out things would you like to go and tell lady skene about the picture or do i come first in your loyalty you do her answer took me like a sting sweet and piercing i dont know what madness what revolt was in my blood but i bent down suddenly and kissed her lips and then having done it the instant revulsion came and i thrust her rudely from me she sank back sitting on her heels and hid her face in her hands there go i cried jumping to my feet i took that not for myself but damn it dont you know that lord skene disapproves of your coming here i told him you came by your own will not mine and if your will isnt his he can just look after his own but you take the risk of any consequences if you come i warn you im master here and i kiss or ill treat whom i choose do you understand youre a unique young party according to him and youve been kissed by the grandson of that old pottle pot yonder how do you like the thought youve bound yourself slave to something worse than you expected havent you but ill manumit you take your furs and go before you find out how dangerous i can be do you hear go while theres time i was half beside myself with rage and scorn for my act i had never in all my life kissed woman before and this first fierce contact smote me like a blasphemy against my clean youth nor had i had in my mind at the moment a thought of all that rage of justification for my deed which had afterwards suggested itself it had been just the leap of a mad impulse born of the girls soft and emotional submission and having torn that unresisting flower i was ashamed i went and leaned against the mantelshelf and turned my eyes from her she did not rise at once but presently i heard her go and take her things from the chair then somehow i hoped that she would dwell just the little minute necessary for putting them on i suppose the bullys instinct is always to keep by him the thing he has just injured perhaps in the sneaking hope that it will justify in some way his brutality to himself he hates the frightened thing for trying to escape from him silently and tremblingly after the deed but miss christmas did not linger that minute she swept up her jacket and furs as i knew by the sound and ran with them out into the cold a wild impulse to stride and stop her surged up in me i even followed her footsteps into the passage but there i checked myself and flung to the open door with a resounding slam that must have caught her heart for a moment then i went back to my room biting a savage curse between my teeth i was furious with myself furious with the girl furious with the means i had seized to misrepresent my feelings towards her why had she put herself in my way just to awaken the beast in me she had no proper pride of womanhood and if for that only was beneath my notice and yet i had kissed her why because i despised her and all the time the fragrance of that contact hung on my lips like a sweet poison i could eat no lunch i was so angry and disturbed and all the afternoon i sat idly with a book affecting to read but seeing nothing on the page dusk came on and with it sharp squalls of wind and sleet that brought the dead leaves whirling about my windows my fire had gone out and i sat and shivered not finding the energy to relight it it grew uncanny sitting there in the white gloom not a living soul within a half mile of me the deep and sodden woodland all around the storm with its loaded flakes rushed upon the glass in swoops and charges and when it fell back i always seemed to hear a small and urgent whisper rallying it sometimes i felt tinglingly it would burst in and then what would come with it and at that very instant glancing up i saw a face pressed against the glass it had risen swiftly and silently like death in the night a horrible sinister face i thought it in the first shock of discovery the eyes were searchingly alive the upper lip was lifted showing the teeth the mist of its breath shrank and dilated on the pane as the wind took it i held my own staring in a sort of awful trance the eyes in the motionless head whipped to and fro as if hurrying to penetrate and devour the substance of the rooms every shadow fortunately the one in which i sat was too dense for their resolving i congratulated myself on my dead hearth though for whatever reason i was shivering all through but over and over again the eyes passed me by and i knew that i was not yet discovered and then suddenly they were gone and i heard stealthy steps coming round by the door and i rose quietly with a shamefaced oath for my cowardice and waited to see what would happen reassurance as to the human nature of the apparition had broken all the spell and now i feared nothing but to be balked of recognition in my turn the man tried the door gently but unavailingly for i had bolted it and then in a moment i heard him going away through the woodland at that i stole upstairs and peering warily from my bedroom window made out his figure pressing up the path towards the babys garden and even in that first glance i recognised him it was the man dalston who had been of the company on the night of old carnacs seizure i stuck there a little smitten with astonishment what on earth was the fellow doing here prying and using the place as if it were his own then too i had not on that one occasion read into his face any such suggestion of evil naked and incontinent as it had seemed to convey to me through the window on the contrary it had appeared a fine and handsome face bold if bold at all with the natural self reliance of a favoured worldling but no doubt my overwrought fancy was to account for the present impression it could not account however for his presence here or could it an idea half whimsical half stunning seized me i had heard of plausible rogues imposing themselves on quiet neighbourhoods insinuating themselves into the leading society and then their plans having matured disappearing with the plate and family jewels of lord this or sir thingummy that was it possible that mr dalston was such an impostor his quiet arrival in the district his renting of that remote uncanny farm his strange silent wife or accomplice finally the vision of him here stealing up through the woods for what all these things smote me with a double edge of suspicion possibly he was even now on his way to examine the house with a view to its burglarious entry whatever the extravagant thought was worth it decided me in another instant i was down and on his heels the wind and the flying sleet no less than my long experience of the way served me well he had no suspicion i felt sure of the shadow creeping in his wake slipping from tree to tree taking advantage of every shriller whine of the squall to decrease the distance between itself and its quarry he went up unhesitating towards the babys garden though often having to battle his way with his head down and having reached there came to a halt leaning against a tree and in the same moment i had slipped undetected into my eyrie of espial in the withered ash he was then so close to me that i could hear him panting from his hard ascent but even with our arrival the squall had passed and the little close pleasance was full of nothing but cold dripping sounds that was my luck again it had muffled me in wind and rain while i needed privacy and withdrawn them only when i needed nothing but clear hearing and clear vision now i had leisure to wonder how if secret watching were his business this mr dalston made no nearer approach to the house which indeed stood nowhere within the range of this part of the garden but he showed no intention of moving farther and for all the wet crust of snow under his feet established himself serenely where he stood flicking his boot with his cane and breathing softly into the air a little sentimental ditty about moons and lagoons and then all of a sudden the figure of a woman had appeared on the opposite side of the garden and after a moments hesitation was coming hurrying towards him now at that i was not at the first so shocked as amused because it seemed i had been stalking for a burglary what appeared to be just a vulgar tryst but what was my astonishment upon discovering on its nearer approach that the figure was that of lady skene the man did not move at all until she was close upon him and then he only detached himself a step or two from his support and laughed gently as he gave his boot a harder switch well answered georgie he said in his soft voice she shrank back from him clutching her fingers into the shawl which she held over her face and bosom i could see that she was deathly white not that no she whispered as if half choking what right have you i should really be the last to insist on it he said you know my easy good nature i congratulate you on your position with all my heart and should never think of crossing your legitimate title to it unless unless what she said with difficulty seeing he prolonged the pause wickedly unless you oblige me to thats all he said now though she had been as i considered an inhuman mother to me to see her so obviously and so amazingly held at the mercy of this man filled me with a rage of fury not he nor anyone but myself i thought should have the right or the power to exact retribution of her if i hated her i already hated him with a tenfold violence what title had he to come between me and my vengeance why she cried with one little broken note of protest which she instantly subdued as if knowing its uselessness have you come into my life again i am really sorry he said it became necessary thats all i wouldnt otherwise for the world have disturbed this dream of evangelical and aristocratic peace in which your soul has so long found its security from troublesome memories but the plain truth is i had to look you up its a vulgar confession but i want money i thought i heard you married it my charmer i did but love though a perpetual investment in itself is far from guaranteeing the immaculateness of its brokers from one of mrs dalstons we suffered shattering losses nothing throughout our married life in fact has prospered with us the heir i longed for has been persistently denied me a momentary emotion seemed to shake his voice but he gripped and stilled it our house in london heavily mortgaged as it is refuses for some inexplicable reason to let we have come down down down why this should be so in the designs of a just but inscrutable providence i cannot pretend to explain our deserts have not been less than most mens our sins like others may be called the natural fruit of circumstance at this moment i am ashamed to say i have not positively the wherewithal to meet a bill which dishonoured within the week will ruin me i speak most of course of the moral wreck which will result to you knowing you as i do that will serve for my paramount appeal how much do you want he seemed to ignore her question for the moment intentionally it was his policy to specify at its fullest value his claim on her that must amount inevitably as i foresaw to his possession of the very secret which i had made as i thought my own he knew somehow that she had been no widow when she had married lord skene and indeed his next words proved the justice of my surmise compare our positions said he here am i as i have described here are you started from exactly similar premises the mistress of all or nearly all that your heart could desire a fortune a title an unsullied reputation the respect of a noble husband the love of a beautiful child born in wedlock too that holy institution and destined in the future to regard his mother as the pure fount of honour she gave a sudden little cry why wont you say what do you want of me but still he would drive the anguish home and to think he went on steadily that one little word from me could shatter at a blow all this elaborate fabric of respectability it must necessarily have a value that word a high value if the truth must be spoken i have nothing of my own you know it i know it my dear girl as surely as i know that you are wedded to a man who has always been as lavish a spouse as he promises to be an infatuated father he would not question i think for his own and his heirs sake the morality of your keeping his eyes sealed you will not speak it we are not as rich as you think well suggested georgie i really beg your pardon but we are quite remote here thats why i ventured to suggest the place for a rendezvous after your husband on the afternoon i called here had shown me over his estate a very pretty legend and a very pretty setting for it the babys garden and very aptly named for our interview she fell back a little holding her hand to her forehead terribly seeming to speak to herself after all it is only your word against mine well not quite he said not quite arent you forgetting mother carey she stared at him gulping once or twice i never lose sight he said of possible witnesses to my interests its not been to those to lay that dear old ghost of our past though you would seem to have thought it to yours a bad policy child do you even know if she is living or dead you should if you were wise but i can see you dont an undutiful daughter to be sure but shes living georgie i dont even mind telling you where shes living down in lambeth in old paradise street bless her appropriate quarters and always ready to testify at her reasonable price shes degenerated into something of a miser too i understand and hoards her ill gotten gains how do i know why through some lawyers my dear friends of mine who happen to pay her one of her little quarterly stipends of hush money you i believe compromised with her for a lump sum again a poor policy o you may take my word for it and do what you like with the information lady skene i think will hardly rush to establish her claim to that connection and even if she did ive means of controlling mother carey what if i say three hundred pounds you shall have it so i supposed then well say five hundred ruin me if you will hush my dear what an inference to esteem me capable of such a blind villainy youre still a very beautiful woman georgie will you leave me now it would be safer perhaps god bless you georgie he was going when she ran to him and touched him for the first time i could see her little shoes frail and delicate sopped by the frozen slush your wife she said hoarsely is she your accomplice he started and turned round and on the instant his face was like a devils leave her out of this he said low and fierce if you value your soul shes innocent as innocent as heaven i tell you if he broke off seemed to make a menacing gesture and again was going and again she stopped him not that way he was himself directly why not its private its the way i came the way she said choking do you know who lives down there he laughed i make it my business to know everything perhaps you dont know that hes away for the moment gone to take a trip on his own account boys will grow up rest satisfied i made sure of his not being there as i came by the lodge then she stepped back and i heard him going lightly down the path into the caddle and presently she turned and pulling her shawl about her face moved towards the house but suddenly stumbled and stood swaying my heart beat as if it would break mother mother i whispered in an agony why dont you ask for me trust me love me but in a moment she recovered herself cold self willed spirit as she was and went off quietly through the trees chapter xii an odd recognition i was so stunned so amazed by this sudden and utterly unexpected turn of events that for a time only a monstrous sense of indignation could make room for its consideration in my brain that another should be found to have a title equal with mine and a knowledge obviously greater to claim those preserves of retribution which i had considered my exclusive property was sufficiently disturbing that i should be brought to realise how to all the intents and purposes of this inquisition i was suddenly confessed the confederate the mean subordinate even of a common blackmailer was infinitely sickeningly worse for the first time i was awake to a healthy scorn of myself for ever having condescended to a habit of espionage that it should have reduced me to something the level of this fellow no outright hard fisted burglar as to his better credit i had assumed him to be but just an obscene jerry sneak it had been awful to me to see that cold exclusive beauty writhing in the grip of such a scoundrel i felt fouled humiliated ashamed there and then i swore an oath that i would let lady skene understand on the first reasonable opportunity the nature of my claim on her not to bleed her pocket but her heart and in the meanwhile how to engineer my discovery should i use it to my more crushing indictment of a guilty woman a bludgeon in my already loaded hand a gentle son a human merciful spirit to admit myself one in purpose with this vulgar conspirator never never to convince her rather of her insensibility to the means for reprisal for defence at least which lay ready to her hand what was her sin to me if only she would once expiate it in a word a look of remorse i asked for no more yet lacking it she must lack a faithful paladin i had thought i hated her and it had needed only this menace from another quarter to reawaken all my maddest cravings she was my mother and in direful peril the pity and the sorrow of it quite blinded me for the moment to all subordinate issues yet luck again had served me well for these i remembered when the passing of my moody grief left room for other thoughts how it had put into my hands the one and very clue i needed i knew at length where to find the old creature godmother grandmother what you will who alone it seemed to me could be induced or bought to make the revelation which i desired well even so that secret were safer in my keeping than solely in a villains though shared by another or others its possession by me could hardly weaken my position as a threatened mothers champion for all my wild pity i was inexorably resolved to take an early opportunity of putting that discovery to the test and so i fell upon harder reflections who was this plausible dog with his soft voice his sentimental gaze his compelling personality who was this astute villain yet none so clever nevertheless but that luck my luck had been able easily to hoodwink him his hold on lady skene must be a substantial one one so potential of profit it would appear that after all this lapse of years it was still worth his while to take a house a gambling office one might call it in the neighbourhood for the sole purpose of exploiting her how and where had he acquired an incriminating knowledge of her so damning alas had i not learned enough already of her maiden meditations to be sceptical of their singleness she had been an actress on the stage at least and presumably a true child of her traditions i could not forget sir maurice carnacs roguish innuendoes his allusions to my stepfathers feet netted to matrimony in their intended frolic over a wilder course his sly maudlin reference to me as a pledge of widowed respectability likely enough he too had known or guessed the truth likely enough lord skene himself had not been so blind to it as the pious throwers of dust in his eyes had once assumed nor did i feel convinced that the question of it would much have affected his lordship in those days of his relapse from virtue so long as its pretensions appeared to justify in the worldly view his marriage with the beautiful creature who had ravished his heart grant all that and it made no difference in the present situation offered lady skene no less a bait to vile persecution if her husband had not been blind she had been blind to his shrewd seeing if he knew she did not know he knew and her ignorance of that inference of his did it actually exist constituted her real accessibility by scoundrelism she never thought one must conclude but that she possessed a secret which if revealed would spell her social and domestic ruin and so long as she could be kept in that belief the bloodsuckers might have their way with her had she not the traditions of eighteen or so years of a spotless and dignified wifehood to vindicate it was for the very reason that she had justified her exaltation so nobly that she figured such a helpless victim to the beasts of prey she was a woman of position a fact of which her religious world took strict account and she had come to pledge herself to that world and to be quoted for its local light it was there i knew and she knew probably that her downfall would be criticised most ruinously her husband it was conceivable she might win over to her sins condonement that narrow world never there in any question of her victimising by a blackguard was confessed her main vulnerable point or it had been for indeed at the last there had come to expose itself one more infinitely sensitive she had borne a son heir to his mothers fame or infamy i declare that my heart bled for her as i reviewed her present position or such as i presumed it to be what was it to me that she had been a sinner even a reckless sinner circumstance makes evil as it makes virtue let the righteous plume themselves on circumstance if i were a child of sin i would be loyal to the maternity which suffered for me only i wanted time to think and plan i dreaded more than i can describe the ordeal of the dinner hour that night yet i was resolved to put in an appearance at the table as likely as not miss christmas had spoken of my return and what reflections would that induce in lady skene and if i kept away how would she regard my absence with what suspicion what fearful apprehensions for her secrets safety for had she not believed me far removed from the scene of her recent humiliation i must face the music at once and boldly i faced it and with what immediate result as i entered the dining room she was standing by her chair before taking her seat and as i passed her by going to my own withdrew her skirts from my contact it was the instinctive act of a moment and regretted i think as soon as done but it hurt me so cruelly that my devil for an instant returned uppermost very well i thought if you will have me your nemesis lord skene greeted me kindly but abstractedly he made no comment on my late absence except to ask me where i had been gone these three or four days to clapham sir i said perfectly self possessed it occurred to me to explore the field of mr pugsleys early ministrations i am thinking of writing his life he grinned first then looked a little startled glancing across uneasily at his wife she had suddenly put down her spoon i observed leaving her soup unfinished what said his lordship are you thinking of turning author no sir i answered only of studying truth and godliness at first hand well he said you might occupy yourself worse he was fairly puzzled i could see and to protect himself turned the talk in other directions leaving me to my own cogitations miss christmas sitting opposite me seized the opportunity to engage him to herself no great task for the old man was genuinely attached to her what do you think of my frock dear she said i want your opinion because you are a judge you know but he accepted her banter seriously he was in an oddly sober mood i think he said that like charity it covers a multitude of sins o she cried how terribly severe i am only a whited sepulchre after all in the midst of life we are in death ill make a note of that i said it sounds like one of mr pugsleys original reflections but of course we are dont you feel it my lady i dont know what demon was urging me lord skene suddenly exclaimed georgina is anything the matter she was leaning back in her chair looking white and faint but she rallied immediately nothing whatever she said what makes you think so go on with your dinner please do he obeyed uneasily i saw miss christmas steal her hand under the cloth and poor her hostesss with a little lovely look of sympathy it meant nothing of course but sex what could she know of the others real indisposition but a sudden unaccountable pang of jealousy shot through me witnessing the act i had put the girl utterly out of my mind she had become nothing and less than nothing in the tragic sequence of events now all in a moment i was moved to reconsider her wonderingly even i thought her face was pale white with a sort of pathetic sickness which follows after much crying and i was sorry for her sorry with a sudden strange turmoil of the heart which spoke most i think of sorrow for myself what was she to me nothing i had taken brutal pains indeed to convince her of the fact and she must surely feel convinced at last and hold herself acquitted of any further obligations to me yet is it not human nature to view with jealousy anothers fond appreciation of the thing we have held too cheap for our own use the value of it it may be has never struck us until we have lost it i dont mean to say that i had arrived already and at once at that extravagant pitch of regret but i was certainly awake and suddenly to points of attraction about the girl which had never appealed to me before her hair grew very prettily on her forehead dividing from it in wings of the softest fawn there was an unspoiled frankness in her face for all its temptation to chartered coquetry and her eyes had grown honest she had developed into a little being quite remote from my early conception of her her complexion was of an unsoiled purity just the natural maturing of pink skinned babydom when its cheeks have ripened to a contour and moulded themselves to a meaning her lips were always as red as if a cupid had just left kissing them and there was an attractive robin note in her voice whether it spoke or laughed now noting all this a quick sharp feeling as of loss as of an utter loneliness never until this moment fully realised smote into me what possible sympathy in all this turmoil of my hates and loves and grievances had i willingly foregone but it was of no use i had rejected it and i must take the consequences she was even at this moment ostentatiously ignoring me and i saw that my hold on her was gone what did i care why should i yet i confess to see these gentle feminine spirits leagued together in revolt against my brutality wounded me smartly i had thought myself their master and i was master of nothing but their fear bill sikes could better me there something gained from that consciousness call it what you will was promising to educate me finely not once during the dinner did either of the ladies speak to me i chose bitterly to put their neglect down to the presumption of a by blow in assuming a claim on their notice i was glad though with an impotent rage of jealousy when they rose and left me alone with my stepfather there was a gravity that night about lord skene which was new in him the sudden death of his old comrade taken with the glass of joy at his lips as it were would seem to have had a curiously sobering effect on him no doubt the mood was fleeting but it had all the force of a reformation while it lasted he questioned me more seriously than he had ever done yet as to my prospects and intentions dwelling even upon the necessity of prayer as a medium for exhorting from the deity the truth as to ones vocation once or twice as i noticed he put out his hand to the decanter and withdrew it empty and presently he fell into a fit of musing in which i did not venture to disturb him then suddenly he looked up i havent seen you since that night gaskett he said what a shocking experience and to risk damnation with a joke on his lips but that was maurice all over do you remember how he greeted you my boy it ought to have warned us perhaps and i was smiling at him as i leaned playing with a knife on the table he broke off quickly rose not altogether steadily to his feet and stood staring at me by the lord gaskett he said what was in your mothers mind when she pupped you i was so taken aback that i could not utter a word in reply and the next instant he had recovered himself and was forcing an embarrassed laugh i think since that night my brains full of ghosts he said come along now to the drawing room chapter xiii johnny dando as if fate were moved to introduce some comic relief into a drama grown almost intolerably serious there re entered astonishingly upon the stage of my affairs at this pass my old chum and schoolfellow johnny dando i call him johnny and johnny he was and so would remain to the end of things there are jocks and jacks and jackos innumerable in the world the johnnies not the inane breed form a race apart and are not to be confounded with any other they are artless beaming little men who never from cradle to grave qualify in world wisdom but who at sixty as at six use the terms of childhood in their dealings with mankind they are everywhere and at all times simple modest and impregnably loyal in their attachments my johnny as i recovered him wore mittens on his dumpy hands and on his head an odd fur bonnet with flaps to cover his rosy ears he was wadded all over and suggested to one a little fat esquimau as he swam like a full moon into my ken he might have taken but one step across the years from baxters to evercreech he had no more hair on his face than when i had last parted from him no less an appearance in it of a perpetual suppressed laughter what amused or appeared to amuse him so inextinguishably no one had ever been able to discover he had a manner as of some secret understanding with himself which was based on the eternal hilarity of things when he shook hands with you you had a feeling that it was only by gripping hard hold of that support that he could stop himself from exploding in your face and there he would stand seemingly fighting down his risibility until he could emit a how de do or how are you with the air of asking a social conundrum while he chuckled inwardly over your inability to answer it he appeared somehow to be always swelling with communicativeness on which strain as he would he could not get a start it was this consciousness of his conversational disability perhaps which made him wont to passing utterances of a fearful and cryptic nature utterances which had no known bearing on anything that had happened or was happening or was ever likely to happen thus it might be as he passed one fielding at cricket he would swoop into ones ear with how much for a chirp plummer hoots and pass on his darkling way leaving one prostrate or his head perhaps would come round a door utter the inquiry which way to the steamers and vanish although i was without doubt his closest friend i had never succeeded in fathoming the exact source of any of these recondite inspirations to question him as to them was to subdue his expression into one of patient tolerance over your inaccessibility to esoteric suggestion it was a chill morning a day or two after my last recorded experiences when he was returned upon my hands like the most surprising of boomerangs or india rubber balls i was sitting cowering and glowering over my fire when i heard his voice at the door and i started amazed and johnny i cried that must be johnny dando and johnny it was he came in smiling and seized my hand without a word his eyes dilated his cheeks like shining polished apples seemed to stretch to cracking johnny i cried take care his face split at the mouth easing the pressure hullo he said how much for grafto we pumped out our salutations hand in hand grinning and speechless like a couple of veritable britons where have you come from i cried at length how did you find me out a young lady brought me down from the house he said and could say no more hullo dick he added presently and immediately turned tiptoed to the door looked out and came back shes gone away he said such a beauty dick she told me youd taken to living in a hermitage and offered to show me the way o i said it was miss christmas i suppose shes a ward of lord skenes but dont bother about her come and tell me about yourself i got him to the fire filled him a pipe and put a light to it for him as he pulled letting it out every two minutes he kept chuckling like one immensely tickled over something o im nothing he said bursting suddenly into a laugh and snuggling his head into his shoulders and his hands between his knees im only grafto you know how much for the hair of the dog that bit you eh dick its just delightful to see you again and youre not a bit altered either only for that scrub of yellow on your lip rub a dub dub eh the joy in his face moderated an instant i cant grow one he said it all comes out in perspiration never mind johnny i said youve got other compensations havent you well he answered ive got money enough to corner all the moustaches in london if thats what you mean but whats the good when i cant grow one of my own he squeaked over the admission then relit his pipe joyously and what have you been doing with yourself all this time he said well come to that i answered i want to hear about you first about me he said surprised o theres nothing to tell daddy made it all right for me you know he was grafto you remember that what a man he was to be sure old daddy his grafto would put a hair spring into a watch they used to say he was a government analyst when he invented it and afterwards he became a person i never knew dick until he died that hed worn a wig himself for years he looked at me tragically wasnt that awful and i inherited grafto how did you like oxford i said o bully he answered but i wasnt there long there was the estate to take up you see and mamma wanted me shes the only woman who ever did o i cant believe that cant you i dont know what keeps me laughing so o the bells bells bells bells bells bells bells hullo dick i say aint you fond of poetry just so am i especially christmas carols theyre so comforting look here why did you never answer any of my letters what letters ive never had a line from you that i know not good lord i remember now we had a beastly swiss courier a rascal who tapped our correspondence and put us to no end of shifts it must have been he very likely so you called for me at the house yes and the young lady miss christmas did you say it was told me that you had taken to living down here like an anchorite and offered to show me the way whats happened to you dick you used to be such a free and open chap i looked into his honest glowing face the craving for comradeship the craving to pour out my heart of sorrow and difficulty to a friend tried sympathetic and attached as i knew this one to be rose suddenly in me with an irresistible force i had dwelt so long corroding perishing in my own fateful atmosphere in confessing to this dear fellow i knew that i should only be halving my own burden of secrecy not imperilling it i hardly gave a thought to its unfair imposition on shoulders so generous and so undeserving he would not have wished that i should in a quick impulse of passion i told him everything the whole story of my life with its shames and discoveries and humiliations all the barrenness and impotence of the thing since i had last parted with him and when he had listened to me silently wonderingly lovingly at the end he only thanked me for my beautiful confidence in himself he was all immediately that i could have wished and expected him to be all and more unfortunately a good deal more his head was not built for plots and counter plots a sense of his magnified importance in the world being chosen the trusted accessory of such a man and in such a secret puffed him out magnificently he was eager to be at once not only my confidant but my coadjutor to work for me spy for me be my humble auxiliary and comrade in this work of righting a wrong and forcing retribution on the guilty ill watch this pugsley he said to my astonishment ill bring him to his knees and make him confess what hes up to if i aint got much cleverness myself ive the means to buy up a whole scotland yard of it no no i cried hurriedly that would never do johnny im playing this off my own bat you understand the dodging of open scandal is to be our first consideration i seemed to realise in a moment the danger of the confidence to which i had committed myself the thought of johnny as amateur detective was impossible it would be necessary i foresaw to divert his enthusiasm into some harmless channel he was greatly gratified i could see by my pluralsing of the personal adjective of course he said well keep it all between ourselves dick yes indeed i said we must and on the word pricked up my ears hearing a footstep but it was only a man come down with a message from lord skene requesting the favour of mr dandos company to lunch johnny in his severe position of ally looked across at me doubtingly of course i said thank his lordship from mr dando williams and say he will have much pleasure for it ought to be as great a pleasure as its an honour to you you know johnny i said reproachfully when the man was gone seeing how its meant to imply the just claim of any friend of mine on his lordships hospitality johnny blushed i didnt mean that dick he said not to question his lordships condescension only you see johnny i pursued twinkling you mustnt begin by tarring them all with the same brush i owe lord skene very much if i owe his lady very little hes been a good second father to me if shes been an indifferent first mother all i want to find out is why she has been i want to know why johnny and i want to know who my first father was and how this man dalston knows what i dont know and why he is able to make such crushing use of his knowledge thats all it comes to at present and you mustnt be looking for reasons in their company but behave just like an ordinary polite little johnny as you are therell be time enough to discuss our campaign by and by he was obviously relieved and not in the least offended i can assure you my dear fellow he said that i shall be only too glad to put it all out of my mind for the moment it would be jolly unpleasant sitting there and acting the spy and with miss christmas in the room too by the by will she be there dick o yes i expect so i said with a snigger but i dont often turn up to lunch myself and am rather out in the young ladys customs you dont seem to like her much he said no i answered i dont know that i do at which he gave an unaccountable sigh as of a burden discharged lord skene accepted my friend genially as i had expected but not as i had expected was lady skenes reception of him if not actually warm it was gracious and attentive she made him sit at her right hand and she placed me opposite on her left there was no drawing away of her skirts this time she even asked me if i would mind sitting there calling me nervously and with a heightened spot of colour come to her cheeks by my name it was not so frequent on her lips but that the novelty could give me an actual little physical shock there was a shadow of pathetic propitiation in her manner towards me i could have thought no doubt what between pugsleys awed confidences and my own newly encountered and most significant spirit of mutiny she was beginning to realise the nemesis her neglect had cast away to flourish of itself i was like the little weed thrown carelessly into a river and lo when the thrower returned to pursue her course upon the water there was only a vast hideous tangle of growth where had been an easy stream i looked at her boldly and her eyes fell before me good god how beautiful she was she might have been no more than twenty seven or twenty eight girlhood at its full flood it hurt me in the very face of that remorseless thing i had set myself to do to see her so afraid of me what she must be suffering under that cold and lovely mask what horror of the black abyss torn suddenly across her path and for him she had borne to be adding his wild voice to the jangle of the chase helping to drive her over the brink into that night though she had deserved it though she had lied to procure her promotion to a noble position though she had sinned her sin and condemned the innocent pledge of it to bear the penance i could not think of her so haunted and so helpless and endure the thought the vision of that tiny life upstairs quite upset me if i wanted justification for my relenting where could i find a sweeter one or a more opportune for god and my brother be my banderoles motto one only proof more or at least the bid for one and i would speak and end this terror of her shadows that i swore she asked johnny some questions about his school days deprecating her own ignorance of his great friendship for richard but attributing it to richards silence on the subject she took the dear boy quite captive he answered of course what could i have had interesting to say about him and he set to expatiating on my virtues instead i didnt even attempt to stop him it was such an amusing novelty to me to hear my existence so much as admitted much less absurdly flattered i laughed out aloud once or twice but he would not be stopped until he had given me his whole salute of twenty one guns he was all during lunch completely under the spell of loveliness his hostess awed and subdued him like the rich glooms of a cathedral but to miss christmas he turned as if to the sunshine without its doors the girl was in a mischievous mood i could see that though she studiously ignored me throughout the meal she would angle with great eyes for my friend and when he caught the bait would look down with a start as if confused what did they call you at school mr dando she asked once all schoolboys have nicknames havent they dont tell her johnny i cried he blushed furiously yes i will he said they called me dandruff miss christmas hey dandruff what the deuce did that mean demanded his lordship my father invented grafto sir said johnny the the hair wash you know and he his name was dando you see lord skene stared bewildered but miss christmas clasped her hands tragically grafto she exclaimed are you really the son of grafto the grafto that has crowned more heads than warwick the kingmaker yes said johnny that was one of the advertisements there are lots of others as good or better ask her what she owes to advertisements johnny i said rudely but her mockery of him annoyed me he looked all agape everything mr dando said the girl sweetly my grandfather made all his money out of a pill what benefactors to the human race we both come of his lordship picked up a late clue pills pills said he and a hair wash tell me the man in the world who wouldnt rather have a crop of hair on his head than a crop of wisdom in it and hold a pill that settled his liver a better thing than salvation he stopped and looked across at his wife with a sudden comical tongue in his cheek that was a bit of the old adam slipped out but lady skene did not appear to have heard him i hold old jack christmas amongst the archangels said his lordship you hear miss christmas i said theres a pedigree for you she did not take the least notice of me as i walked down with johnny to the lodge by and by the little man seemed depressed or at least alternately depressed and elated with the balance running to the down mood i could see how it went with him he was in love it was veni vidi victus sum with a vengeance it had become hard for him and all in an unexpected moment to reconcile his attraction to the evercreech mnage with his loyal duty to me he could not guess of course how i rather welcomed the difficulty it tied him in a manner by the leg and narrowed the issues of his friendly ardour i knocked him up a bed somehow later on for i had insisted on his being my guest for the night and we sat and talked into the small hours i had to go a journey on the morrow that was inevitable but i refrained from even hinting its direction to him let sleeping johnnies lie i thought it was arranged that we should walk into footover together and there part for the time being i to go to london he to remain in the neighbourhood and keep an eye on my interests i trusted to that compromise for safety my interests i had a shrewd idea would be found to gravitate largely about the person of miss christmas and why should i grudge him that fiction the two would make a very good match he had sat silent for a long time when he suddenly looked up with a sigh o its hard dick its hard he said to be born to grafto and an unromantic figger for the first time in my knowledge of him i noticed that the perennial smile had withered from his face chapter xiv two interviews and a discovery it was with a feeling of intense suppressed excitement that i came down into the courts surrounding the inner tabernacle of that mystery which my heart was set and my nerves were strung upon resolving i had had no difficulty in finding the place luck the old spoiler was in the way to smooth every present obstacle from my path the ridiculous ease with which i had hit my goal left me no lack of self confidence in the question of successfully exploiting it but there it will be seen i reckoned without my host and in the meanwhile there were some surprises in store for me it was a most bitter morning a north east wind slashed at old paradise street like the sword of the archangel the flood moving beyond its outlet the river of the land of gold was as unlike pison as one might conceive thick and resistless it went by with a gloating sound a sewer rather than a stream the old palace on its embankment looked numb with cold there was more life in the fried fish shop round the corner than in all its historic stones i had inquired at this shop for mother careys number in the street a slipshod girl who was sweeping up the floor gave it me but with a reservation do you mean the old miser lady ai she was a dirty girl but insolent with life a reassurance in that deadly climate of paradise i dont know i said very likely i only know that her names carey and that she lives in this street she came to the door broom in hand and pointed me out the house it was not far beyond a dirty faced little tenement between a frowzy barbers and a frowzy cobblers but having a door and parlour windows of its own instead of a shop front therell be what you want said the girl number six but you wont get in why not nobody does she lives private and takes her beer on the chain her beer lady skenes mother the parent of that cold and stately apparition the stem from which that lovely rose had flowered here was a startling beginning but there was worse to come well i said stoutly therell be nothing lost by my trying anyhow the venture ran abroad somehow for all the uninviting weather and by the time i reached number six there were heads poking out of windows to canvas my repulse i knocked at the door and waited after a quite reasonable interval a shuffling footstep sounded within bolts were withdrawn and the door opened a few inches and grated on an iron tether whos there said a querulous thin voice i want to see mother carey i answered shes not in she sees no one she isnt fit to be seen go away said the voice and the door came to sharply but i had my foot ready shell see richard gaskett im sure i whispered through the crevice richard an old old snuffy beak shining eyes and a withered mouth agape showed in the crack and there they dwelt for a full minute what do you want of me she muttered at last i want to ask you some things i said it might pay you to answer them she lingered still a little then i heard the chain grate stealthily in its socket a lean talon shot out and the next moment i was clawed into the passage and the door slammed to behind me a faint shout of laughter pursued me into the fastness it was close twilight within filthy noxious indescribable the narrow hall was bare of everything but stench and decay the room into which the old horror motioned me was similarly furnished but with first causes more in evidence when very cautiously she had unbarred the window shutters and let in a grudging thread of light i was made conscious of the fact there were a table here and a tattered chair or two the stuffing of the latter rank from the contact of unclean generations there were also piles of refuse in the corners under the rusty grate dropping from a disembowelled cupboard burst with its own noisome surfeit the walls hung with old daguerreotypes old tinted lithographs old records of a faded past all in mouldering frames and all it appeared illustrative of the one time graces of a single simpering personality were the cleanest places to be seen bugs were the lite of number six old paradise street i felt utterly stupefied bowled over by the shock of my surroundings for the moment i could only gasp and suffer until a violent fit of sneezing came to my relief the old woman standing before me softly pawed at my waistcoat during the paroxysm peering up into my face water and she were long strangers a mildewed cap she wore tied under her chin seemed to have grown on her like a fungus on a tree stump her dress was of the complexion and savour of tobacco rag she was a mignonne small boned creature and might even once the lord forgive me have been pretty even now old thread of fustiness as she was there was an indescribable trick of jauntiness in her conduct of her creaking old body and the frisky shuffle of her feet in their mouldering slippers seemed sometimes suggestive of a sort of st vituss ballet dance she was taken with a rending fit of coughing while she held me it seemed to rattle in her like the plaster inside crumbling walls where the rats are busy so youre richard gaskett o the devil she said when she could gasp out a word at length and youve come to look up your old grandma eh i had not regarded it in that light and i was fain to tell her so i had come to visit mother carey she started on the word and a sudden terror flew to her eyes whos your mammy she cried shrilly stepping back tell me quick now lady skene is my mother i said ah her self confidence returned it had struck her all of a heap how she might have been beguiled into admitting some villain with a design on her hoardings she approached me again curiously eh she wondered so this is my georgies child is it the deuce and how does your mammy treat you my pretty lady skene has got another son now i said didnt you know it i hear nothing and i know nothing in these days dovey the devil she answered so long as im given my little provision as her mother georgies welcome to make out her own life as she pleases for me we usent to get on very well together not always her and me shed come to me in her troubles she would like her fathers own gal but most times we lived apart she came to you when she was in trouble about me i suppose i said she conned me a little unanswering the wintry pupils of her eyes seemed to sharpen like a cats not she a married woman she protested cunningly she was not married before she married lord skene i said i was born to her out of wedlock and he was not allowed to know it again she was silent panting a little and suddenly she was seized with a second paroxysm of coughing o dear o dear she gasped when she could speak o the deuce and all o my lungs are like emery paper and the joints of my bones gone scroopy o get me a chair ducky get me a chair im all wore out with pain i am and i shant trouble anyone much longer there i shall be better in a minute i can feel it passing o the deuce and the devil i helped her to seat herself and stood over her while she recovered when she did at length she went on ejaculating o the deuce and the devil in spasmodic whispers until her speech found breath for further irrelevancies welcome to live as she likes for me o the deuce and all in her fine castle my pretty so long as im left undisturbed in my little ouse in my little o the devil ducky i waited for the stream to run out and then spoke again lord skene was not allowed to know it i say she answered me without looking up i was no party to that my dovey the deuce i swear i wasnt o the devil it was all pugsleys doing the deuce and the devil take him was it he too i said who christened me out of a pint pot you see ive found out something old mother she rocked to and fro in a sort of obscene secret laughter i could have fancied it was as much as i could do to keep my wits steadily to the point at issue in all the sure success of my pursuit i had never foreseen any end to it like this or even approaching it just like him she muttered he always called me that a deuced providence who called you i demanded sternly who are you talking about she wiped or rather smeared her eyes with her sleeve the old life in her i believed was foundering between craft and senility but the ancient habit still predominated once more she spoke and again away from the point a proud creatur was my gal georgie was always proud above her station she held herself aloof from the common sort she did not that such beauties oughtnt to command the best but she made her mistake there ill own to it it was all from her turning religious and trying to reform people the deuce take her and shed have been left to suffer the consequences to this day if it hadnt a been for me a good mother though i say it the devil and the deuce old mother i said quietly seeing that for some reason she hailed the term who was it helped her to that mistake tell me his name and ill give you money she paused suddenly in her sibilations her old face leered up at me with infinite acrimony how much she snapped but there i dursent its no bid something some chord of ancient memory in me tightened and quivered my god i cried i remember now it was you that had the care of me when i was a baby ah she piped it was me was it richard and to think you should have growed to this and all the understanding in you wasnt it you i say you may say it with truth dovey she answered she wanted me to adopt you altogether did my daughter but i just struck when i found i wasnt to be included in her ladyships promotion but i made her pay for it i did more than if id kept you and then she and pugsley had to put their deuced heads together and account for you to his lordship in their own way yes i said i know that you know it she lowered her frowzy noddle mumbling to herself then looked up fulsomely tell old mother carey my pretty she coaxed just exactly how much you do know that you were on the stage i began ah she leered across at the photographs on the wall her horrible old feet drummed on the floor the stage to be sure my daughter could never come anigh me as a dancer no nor in looks for that matter theres nothing criminal in being on the stage ducky dear and georgie herself was born in wedlock that lady skene was taken from the boards by her husband i went on but she interrupted me there youre wrong it was pugsley rescued her as he called it when shed returned to them after your little affair and who trimmed her up and made her meat for his lordship that you bought me my name of a publican his name for a pint of beer i continued she admitted that frankly with a giggle you had to have one you know deary and to give you your mothers might have let out things and hasnt this fine lordship now ever shown any curiosity about who was your father no i said the curiosity is all mine who was he i dont know she proclaimed blankly and at once you do i said sternly no i dont she answered suddenly truculent why should i now the gal came to her mother in her trouble that was all it mattered to me she wouldnt confess to the author of her shame not she she was always one of the silent sort ask the old deuce of a doctor now old patterson drat him if he could ever get a word out of her i believe you are lying ill pay you i say she skipped to her feet with a little blasphemous screech the deuce and the devil o you sanguine spark i dont want your money i believe youre after mine o ill rouse the neighbourhood if you dont get out of this a pretty gentleman on my sinful word to think to come and bleed his poor old grandmother to pay for his pop lollies and opera boxes o burst my lungs if i dont have the police on you o the deuce get out she was whipping herself to a frenzy real or diplomatic my efforts to quiet her were only so much oil on her old smouldering fire she began to scream pipingly and to drive me outward with vicious feeble blows in the end baffled and disappointed i had to make an ignominious exit the door slammed and the chain grated behind me the street was awaiting my reappearance with interest it greeted my expulsion with a howl of laughter and pursued my retreat with a dropping fire of chaff as i went on my way i had leisure to reflect that i had extracted from mother carey everything that was of the least importance either to herself or me just so much and no more i had established the fact of her unsavoury existence and that was the bare fruit of my enterprise but i had still one forlorn hope to follow one last nearly blank little card to play and as luck would have it that card was to prove the fateful one what a trumpery pip to be sure looks an ace a one shotted gun yet the fortress capitulates to it the knaves shiver before it whole rows of arrogant royalties go down to its bang something that mother carey had let out inadvertently even fatuously i could not but think stuck in my mind impelled by a faint hope of promise in it i made my way by the albert embankment and the south lambeth road to stockwell whence from the swan tavern i took a tram for clapham my purpose was to inquire about a certain problematic dr patterson and it was my good fortune pace luck to learn not only that that respected practitioner was an existent actuality but that he was still after all these years active in promoting the birth rate of his native suburb i was even lucky enough to find him at home in a very comfortable semi detached house of an old time complexion which faced the common on its south side he had moved into this many years before from a much smaller dwelling in park road down by the plough his practice having risen high in the interval on a modest foundation so my informant one of those garrulous terrors who will volunteer more than they are asked to answer confided to me i found the doctor a very complacent brisk little man having spectacles black side whiskers supported by an ample collar and a head as shiny and almost as bald as a gas globe now sir what can i do for you he said having hurried into the room and made his bow i apologised with some embarrassment for my venturing to claim even a fraction of his precious time to a matter which to put it brusquely was unconnected with professional emoluments naturally enough perhaps he requested me thereupon to state my business with a reasonable brevity it touches sir i said upon the birth of a child some twenty or more years ago at which birth i believe you assisted wait he said a police case is it not i answered venturing something if that can be avoided well he said of whose child do you speak the mother was a young woman of the name of carey she lived in white square he lifted and readjusted his spectacles then canvassing me over them knitted his fingers lightly before him and twiddled his thumbs my memory sir is i may say retentive the case recurs to me what about it it is desired to find the father of that child he shook his head smiling my dear sir i am no clairvoyant what is my position in these matters i come i see i deliver the mother is my sole concern you dont know who he was not from adam my face fell obviously enough i suppose by the way he remarked casually you know of course that the child died very shortly after it was born what was he saying in that matter of fact voice what unimpassioned thunderbolt launching from the blue of his little spectacled eyes a quick sharp vertigo seemed to seize my brain i stared stupidly at him died i muttered o you must be mistaken wait he said i keep and have always kept a minute record of my cases i can verify it in an instant he went to a shelf selected from it one of several thin manuscript volumes and rapidly skipped over its leaves here it is he said february th carey georgina white square obstetric child male died two days later certified cause atelectasis pulmonum he shut the book with a snap returned it to its shelf and faced round on me his hands under his coat tails anything more i can do for you but i stammered if if the child died it must have been buried doubtless he answered but scarcely by me still it was buried i suppose you dont know o my dear sir think for a moment white square and its reputation but perhaps you are ignorant there there are ways and places for disposing economically of these superfluous defunct i dont assert anything but i daresay you have read of them the child died that is all i can certainly state i came to myself and held out my hand gratefully i am infinitely obliged to you sir i said you have enlightened me on a very important point and and i am infinitely obliged to you not at all he said would you mind leaving your name and address i hesitated a moment and gave them hm dear me he said theres a person of that very name a patient of mine well good morning to you out in the street i moved on like one in a dream dead i thought dead i stopped suddenly looking stupidly about me where am i who am i dead chapter xv the letter in the book i wanted above all things to be alone to re order my disordered thoughts to marshal into some sort of coherence the fantastic figures which ran riot in my brain i felt like some stunned animal turning to creep away and bury itself in shadow and solitude the clack of the train in my head was like the worry of a screw shaft to a sea sick passenger i had to adapt all my reflections to its mechanic monotony i could not detach my thoughts from those regular beats they even assumed to my mind presently a definite measurement a thought was exactly three inches long and the wheels tapped it out tapped it out to one endlessly repeated pattern i was horribly ungraciously apprehensive of running across johnny dando in footover the vision of his round beneficent face would rise like an obtrusive moon over the troubled waters of my soul to gain time for self communion before he learned of my return was my most feverish desire i was even truth to tell wishing the poor dear boy out of my way altogether there was no longer room in my philosophy for even this gentle farceur but he did not cross my path and i succeeded in reaching my cold hermitage unobserved there was no fire in it this doleful evening no sign of any feminine grace or thought for me i had to make out my own comforts lay my grate provide my own meal well that was nothing new nor was it any new discovery that a passing indulgence often makes a spoilt content but i confess i was peevish at having only myself to help myself again however i persisted and after feeding ravenously on meats i had brought with me for i was fairly famished i took a book haphazard and for forms sake from the shelf lit my pipe and sat down before the glow to excogitate the moral and practical effect i was called upon to give to an amazing revelation as to that it was patent at once that it had thrown all the machinery of my life out of gear the questions of love duty resentment retribution must all be unpieced and readjusted to suit a new point of view i had no longer it appeared true relations with the old my position was become one of independence my attitude one of hard triumphant aloofness only the mystery of my being was deepened not resolved if my mothers baby had died i could not be my mothers son that paradoxically was the postulate then if not hers whose son was i and for what inexplicable reason had she undertaken the risk and responsibility of acknowledging me for her own that there had been foul play somewhere trickery fraud monstrous imposition was very plain i thought my mission if it had proved abortive in one direction had been deadly prolific in another how to wrench truth from the maze of lies the wildest theories flashed into my mind only to be flouted was it possible that lady skene could have done this donna quixotic thing for a friend have imposed on her husband as her own in some fit of evangelical samaritanism the fruit of a poor sisters frailty out of the question she was utterly truthful by temperament and religion if on a single occasion she had let a misunderstanding pass by default she had had not only the sanction but the encouragement of her church to justify her then pugsley at least believed i was her son and as certainly in all things she believed what pugsley believed granting which one must grant her innocence of any partnership in a fraud which had apparently imposed upon her the principal as it had imposed upon him the unwitting agent yet had it imposed or was she after all a practised queen of guile a lamia with the serpent in her blood i thought of her villainous antecedents i thought of the old obscene harpy down in lambeth and my heart would take cold at the thought insisting that she knew the truth that she must know it and that therein was confessed the real secret of her antipathy to me then so much admitted or assumed was it not a consequent assumption that his secret knowledge of the fact that i was not lady skenes child constituted dalstons hold over her that would be to infer that he at least was cognisant of my true parentage but would it be that she was or even more inexplicably that he was practising upon her ignorance of the truth but how could she be ignorant how could she the hypothesis appeared incredible monstrous one only clear fact seemed to detach itself from the inextricable tangle of things that i was not my supposed mothers son now so perverse is human nature i was no sooner self assured of my moral quittance from the bonds which had held me so long and so wistfully to an imaginary grievance than my soul rose in mutiny against my own emancipation was she not actually then my mother after all this cold beautiful spirit whose countenance i had so longed to gain whose aversion so little concealed had been the cruel pain of my life it would appear so indeed it would appear that i had been wasting my heart on the shadow of a love the blasphemy of a worship which god himself had suddenly exposed for a sham i was stripped in a moment even of the cold comfort of that false religion i had no longer the right of natural appeal from an inhuman sentence and i had only myself to thank for my awakening wilfully with my eyes open i had gone about this business of my own damnation there was such an intolerable sting in the thought that in its last full realisation i jumped to my feet restless to pace away the agitation it caused me as i did so the book which i had taken from the shelf dropped roughly from my knees to the floor and a folded paper fell from it i stooped mechanically to pick up the latter as mechanically opened it out and two thirds preoccupied ran my eyes down the sheet instantly with a little shock of amazement they were caught and riveted to a name written thereon a sigh as of one just awakened came from me what was to follow i thought i could tell already there was a signature at the foot of the paper and i believed i knew whose it would be the signature of charlie skene his lordships dead son and so it proved it gave me an odd thrill to look at it the boyish scrawl in its faded ink and attesting what you shall hear walking on tiptoe as if in some instinctive emotion towards secrecy i carried my find to the lamp and examined it it was the half the second half of a sheet of foreign notepaper and had been used evidently by some reader probably the correspondent to whom it had been addressed for a marker in the volume i had dropped heedless trifling with a thing so pregnant with destiny yet luck no doubt had arranged it so it ran as follows starting on a broken sentence right under the fall and as secret as you could wish you can see through like as if you were behind a window and the rain coming down in sheets outside and theres no more sound to be heard than with that its just shut away from there the noise i mean and all you can hear is a drone like a hive and all you can see is the trees and the hills pulled crooked like we saw ourselves in that looking glass in the confectioniers at swanage dont you remember how we laughed george there is a fellow here antonio geoletti that acts as our guide and cetera and that would give his ears i expect to know of it for the sake of tips but ive a fancy to keep it to myself such fun and not tell anyone of it unless perhaps you know who and perhaps if hes good my tutor mister cecil mansel delane oh lawk but wait a minute geolettis a great rascal but i like him always a little attracted to rogues you know george and he shall hear of it too before we go but now ive got something to tell you only dont blab to the governor george my boy ive found out that delane isnt my tutors name at all but dalston is mark dalston there was a young fellow bruno travers passed through here and recognised him for a master hed been under at some grammar school or other clapham i think it was and he called him to his face and delane had to own up there was only us three together and my tutor admitted that his name was dalston right enough and that hed only taken up the other for its seeming more marketable to a man with his ambitions sounded good familyish and all that and he asked us not to give him away and we promised but travers didnt believe a word of his reason and told me so in private he said hed go nap that it was to escape the consequences of an intrigue with some girl in clapham this mark dalston being a pretty rapid lot and known for it to some of the young gentlemen that he coached i dont know but ive had my suspicions especially in his making those eyes at you know who for her looks and the rest but mums the word i shall want all my nerve when the time comes for an explanation and it cant be long now oh lawky lawky your affectionate friend charles skene my hand with the letter in it dropped to my side luck was this still luck or a fierce and merciless fatality it had answered clear on my cry for light long uttered an echo returned from a vast distance to escape the consequences of an intrigue with some girl oh an excellent shot mr travers an intrigue with lady skene ne carey that was to say it was dalston himself all the while and i had been looking over his head for the principal there could be no doubt about it here was the explanation of the beasts hold on that wretched lady a grip doubly dastard since it would seem he had repudiated his responsibility for her shame only so long as he saw the opposite to any profit in admitting it could there be in hell a hound more abject and to what but a day earlier had my inquiries been tending to proof of what relationship with this infamous creature that fable thank god was discounted before even realised by me and yet for what alternative there was none that i could see if he was not trading upon her belief that i was his child their child what subtler knowledge helped him to her bleeding could it be one that turned upon the question of my apparent resurrection from the grave was i perhaps a changeling it seemed incredible to whose possible interest could it have been to substitute a living child for a dead one not to his assuredly a piece of good fortune it would have appeared to him in those days that fruit of his villainy perished and removed to his victims then to her mothers there was more plausibility there yet i could not conceive lady skene a party to any such fraud and yet again his discovery of the imposition had it been committed would not have weakened his hold on her rather substantiated it had she done this thing or her mother for her in order to levy false tax on the father of her dead child it was a horrible thought all night i sat out by the fire hating it and dismissing and returning to it the coincidence of this dalstons double connection with the family hardly occurred to me and yet it was a coincidence as strange as any that the annals of villainy can record but then coincidence is the father of luck this strange strange letter this old young voice from the clouds dropping upon me all in an unexpected moment like a ghostly message from thibet it must have its meaning in the sequences of fate must have been meant to have that the fellow should have been young skenes tutor his monitor great god a vulgar intrigant with a past hardly past indeed and caught in despite of it making eyes at you know who you know who how odd and plaintive sounded the arch allusion down all that flight of years like a strange voice laughing very faint in distant attics poor little you know who what had been thy pretty name and station and to whose confidence was this cryptic reference to thee entrusted i bent on the thought and picked up the fallen book from the floor it was one of those with which lord skene had furnished me from the library of his deceased young neighbour a volume of armadale by wilkie collins i remember it well a story containing a mystery something analogous with that which was vexing my life turning to the title page i found inscribed on it a name george thesiger the george without doubt of the letter and he too was dead no hope of enlightenment there had closed the book perhaps for the last time on a mystery more real and tragic than any contained in its pages they must have been close friends those two i put the book gently away and fell into frowning thought again not all i could learn or discover had brought me one step nearer the truth of my own identity i might trace out others myself i could not trace my name like peter schlemihls body threw no shadow i suppose in the end i must have fallen asleep where i sat for i was suddenly conscious of the sound of voices outside the lodge i rubbed my eyes it was broad daylight in the room and shiveringly cold i staggered to my feet a stale spectre of nightmare and walked unsteadily to the window there was a thin fleece of snow fallen on the grass and sharply defined on it stood the figures of johnny and miss christmas now i dont know what influence was at work in me but quite suddenly and strangely seeing the girl my eyes flushed hot and wet i set my teeth and gave myself a good curse for my folly but there it was and i could not but be conscious of a fierce pleasure in it i suppose i had been a bit overwrought spectre ridden and this vision touched me like balm i felt like one who wakes from a dream of damnation to hear the birds singing she was so young and happy and fresh so detached from the sordid realism of my story so remote from me at last i had never thought her worth my consideration until she was risen above it and now i was feeling like a child who having wandered in the track of some absorbing interest wakes to the sudden realisation that he is lost it was just the primal need bubbling in me my mother was taken from me true but perhaps the more for that did i wail for a skirt to cling to the two seemed to be in intimate talk and johnnys strained squeak of a laugh reached me irresistibly a misty sun jewelled the snow and there were flowers sparkling and fountains showering and the rich throats of birds choiring among the trees but all only in seeming for love full hearted has but to look down and there is a garden sprung about her feet suddenly it struck me had this little diffidence been so wrought through with passion as to have dared on short acquaintance the most audacious throw a man can stake his all on if it were so it would seem that fortune had favoured the bold for the couple appeared to be already on terms as happy as familiar and why not johnny was no nameless penniless bastard but a lord of acres with a stake in the land and a right to sue to honour he was my friend moreover and not to be grudged by me any such triumph i trusted i saw no reason to doubt that they would prove an excellent match and in the midst of that very christian reflection was planning how to get rid of the little man with all possible despatch why il y a quelque chose qui couve says a french idiom now all in a moment i realised that i was in a measure spying a trick grown obnoxious to me i turned from the window and went resolutely out into the open they saw me at once and johnny hurried up with his greeting and a rather shameful face i thought i was coming to see you and met miss christmas in the grounds he said we supposed you were still away old fellow as there was no sign of your moving in there why should there be at this hour this hour dont you know its near midday no by the lord is it what a sleep ive had i turned to miss christmas did you want me for anything i asked no she said in one hard little icicle of a word she turned to johnny and the sunlight broke on her face i must go back now she said but i daresay we shall meet again i went to her as she turned and spoke low in her ear two words im sorry she appeared to start but she gathered her skirts up and went off through the woods without an acknowledgment of any sort i took johnnys arm persuasively as we walked back to the lodge together am i to congratulate you old man he flushed to fire dont bait me dick i i dont think i can bear it if a years devotion would win me just the permission to kiss her little hand no more than that no more what right have i to dream of such a thing he was so obviously moved that i had not the heart to banter him if i had the inclination i dont know about that i felt of a sudden some sympathy with his diffidence and all on my own account what right had he certainly material fortune was not to stand for everything in this world i was in no mind to let it in my misanthropy in no mood with my new sense of independence to allow myself to be relegated to the ranks of the of no accounts i could still be a dog in the manger it seemed and yet my heart was soft with a superior affection for this old chum of mine johnny i said as i laid and lit the fire are you still in the mind to help me am i not he answered only tell me how i turned round inspired with the match in my hand watch old pugsley he gave a chirp the parson yes pugsley he beamed on me delighted of course he said why didnt i ever think of that if i could only catch those two talking together now i might get at something valuable which two i asked it appeared that he meant dalston and pugsley somehow he had got it into his head that they were in league to keep me out of the skene succession by pretending that i was not the lawful son of my mother so much for my power of trenchant summarising it did not really matter a bit so long as i could put him harmlessly out of the way my shot for the parson was quite a happy one pugsley would never apprehend that he was being watched and if he did suspect it his conceit would put it down to the fascination of his apostolic person very well i said pugsleys your quarry dont wander much from those preserves besides you know it will employ you about the neighbourhood and youd like that of course i should but there mustnt be any suspicion of our colluding you must keep away from me and only communicate by letter he jumped to his feet in excitement ive got it well have a code ill telegraph to you dick all right hit out your code i left him presently busy over it full of a shrewd importance there was a purpose i had in my mind some information i was hot to obtain and my eagerness emboldened me to seek it at headquarters lord skene received me very genially in his study he was dressed in a suit of new tweeds and looked as fresh and dapper as a boy on his honeymoon well gaskett he said what is it i held out to him title page open the book in which i had found the letter the night before yes he said with a sort of curious dryness george thesiger hes dead sir yes hes dead may i ask sir pray forgive me was he a great friend of i glanced up at the portrait the bright young face hanging on the wall opposite him of charlies he said but with a certain restraint o yes charlie and he were immense friends i was silent a moment struggling with my difficulty he appeared to watch me even with a painful interest whats on your mind richard he said at last the kind tone the unwonted familiarity loosened my speech after all was i not striking for the honour the happiness of this good soul to whom i owed all that of genial tolerance which had accepted and endured me can you tell me sir i burst out with in broken sentences will you tell me i know i have no right to ask the the circumstances of i really have my reasons sir i would not venture otherwise the the pain and the impertinence he put his hand across his eyes and answered me quietly without looking up what is it you wish to know only this sir i said the man his tutor delane yes did you ever see him no i was on circuit at the time he was engaged by my sister lady thorold in answer to an advertisement and lady thorold is dead too yes seeing i did not answer he added voluntarily after a moment delane was the last to to see and speak with my boy they had parted on the hillside and charlie went on alone a reckless fellow always a reckless fellow the man himself i never saw or spoke to his depositions were sent me by lady thorold who represented me out there i was too ill to go myself when i did delane had disappeared beyond tracing not that i could have any object in wishing to see him beyond a morbid sickness to dwell upon things best accepted and forgotten they had been on the best of terms as i understood and lady thorold was struck with his genuine grief over the catastrophe what makes you curious about him gaskett what indeed this man in sympathy with grief and stricken hearts this abject cur a disinterested mourner what made me curious how could i answer it had been hardly in expectation of learning anything to delanes discredit scoundrels to the simplest understanding do not prevail by making a boast of their characteristic qualities yet i had been curious and how to explain myself without self committal was the difficulty i sorrowed for this unsuspecting faith i sorrowed for the wretched woman whose sin long past and long repented was threatening to engulf in ruin all that it had sinned to gain and yet for some incalculable reason i felt myself destined to be the minister of that nemesis whether to launch or withhold to baffle or direct i could not tell but a sense of unrealised indefinite power drove me on i dwelt a little on my answer before i spoke i am curious sir i will tell you the truth i found a letter or part of a letter in this book last night it was written by your son apparently to mr thesiger himself and there were some references in it to mr delane they set me speculating thats all i will beg you sir not to ask me to show you the letter not just at present anyhow i dont fancy from what i can gather that the man was altogether what you supposed him to be but i would rather pursue my inquiries independently i would rather bring down my quarry before boasting of my skill he was obviously startled and perturbed he shifted some papers on his table and his lips were not quite steady as he looked up at me quarry and skill said he this sounds all very formidable gaskett i will not ask to see the letter since you wish it but i believe sir i said impulsively that the man was a villain he buried his face in his hands a minute what do you want me to do he said suddenly when do you propose enlightening me when i have my case sir he smiled faintly i ask you in the meantime to accept me for your counsel and to believe that it is your interests alone which i have at heart a longish silence ensued then he sighed it is all very mysterious but have it as you will you you wont i trust keep me longer than necessary in this state of suspense though he essayed to dismiss the matter lightly i knew that i had greatly disturbed him the dogs of doubt of suspicion of some formless apprehension were awake in him it grieved me to the soul so to leave him but i felt that for the moment i had no choice i must at least face his unhappy wife offer her the chance of defence explanation before i decided upon my course i found johnny triumphant in the completion of his code it was numerically simplicity itself but the ingenuity of its parts was devastating thus for example dalston was dalston junction was points was a pointer was a dog therefore dog represented dalston pugsley was a pug was a pug nose was tip tilted therefore tip represented pugsley miss christmas of course was noel was no hell which naturally was heaven and heaven was miss christmas lord skene was a skein was woolly was a sheep was a baa therefore baa stood for lord skene his lady by the same reasoning was an ewe and you being not i was knotty which the point at issue was therefore point represented lady skene i myself was gaskett was what i hadnt known but johnny was a learned and travelled little person a piece of canvas used in furling sails was a fastening was a button and there i stop i hadnt the faintest conception of the use to which he proposed converting all these symbols but he was very convinced of their necessity and so i let the question go by default and accepted a key he left me during the afternoon to return provisionally to his inn in footover and i regret to say that i was never relieved over anything so much as over his departure it was agreed that until further notice from me we were to hold no communication with one another unless in the code and on that understanding we shook hands affectionately at the gate and parted strangers beyond it dear fervent little man i wish i could have repaid your devotion as it deserved chapter xvi a strange encounter as i turned to go in by the gate a figure coming hastily up the road from market grazing made a gesture as if to detain me i paused in surprise and in another minute the woman for a woman it was had hurried to where i stood and stopped she was panting heavily and she put a hand on her breast as if forcibly to control its spasms she was very thin and dowdy in appearance and had on a thick grey veil pulled down over her face but for all the close secrecy of that screen i knew her at once it was mrs dalston i suppose i ought to have felt some discomposure in her presence seeing the nature of my thoughts about her husband i was conscious of nothing however but an increased sense of the aversion with which she had at the first inspired me there was something antipathetic to my nature in this barren reticence in this material and intellectual threadbareness one might call it especially as contrasted with the showy qualities of her partner i could not dissociate in the two the essential squalor whether of soul or person which goes with crime it was part of the eternal tragedy of her colourlessness it was a heart rending consequence of her malleability that she was thus moulded to repel where she most sought for sympathy but how could i know that now to be conscious of these feelings in myself and of the certainty that her hidden eyes holding me at a disadvantage were probing and interpreting them filled me with a sort of helpless anger i might even have been sharp plain with her under the irritation had she not suddenly taken the initiative with a swift movement she put a hand upon my arm looking the while quick and nervous about her and then she entreated me in a hoarse small voice leave him alone dont watch him what are you thinking of hell not let his plans miscarry for such as you i warn you youd better take my warning i was so shocked so dumfoundered that for a moment i could answer her not a word here it seemed was the moral of all my self pluming astuteness but the lesson gripped me on the instant you speak of mr dalston i said yes she answered hes gone to london or i shouldnt have dared to venture this even so it seemed the terrific spectre of him stalked her fancy for the motion of her head never ceased to suggest a fearful watchfulness he knows that you are observing him plotting against him perhaps there is never anything hidden from him long youll be a fool if you dont desist why should he fear observation i muttered some commonplace about conscience why she said how can i tell i know hes here to carry out some scheme of force or fraud i know hes got some claim on lady skene its all nothing to me where he goes i go and what he wills that thing comes to happen do you wish to die yet horribly secretly and no one guess how or where i neither wish nor intend to intend that sounds brave youll need some bravery is he capable of it going to those lengths why do you tell me all this for yourself not for him how have i earned your consideration she seemed to look at me intently her hands sought my arms but i backed instinctively from their touch she stopped at once and i was sorry but not even this new aspect of her could conquer my repugnance i have borne children she broke out strangely and they died one after another they died because i willed they should i could be stronger than him in some things and he begged and prayed me but i would not i willed them dead and they died each as it came they were the atonement for that life its spirit seems to rise and beckon to me from the past o my god and you ask me how youve earned my favour who was your mother who were your parents her voice rose wildly she held out her arms to me with a passionate gesture and now i understood the poor driven creature was insane struck mad perhaps in some sudden consciousness of the true nature of her bondage to a devil i must humour not abuse her you say you tell me all this for myself i said standing quiet and unresponsive what if for myself i neither fear nor apprehend can boast a will as strong perhaps as his am resolved to go forward and expose him for the thing he is i take the privilege of your confidence i do not flatter she appeared to listen again intently when she answered there seemed a note as of some under triumph thrilling through her voice you will go on you will not be dissuaded i will not no she caught her hands together her breath came quick she took an eager step towards me and spoke in broken sentences i thought i hoped even it might be so listen then ill help you to your end so like my god it seems a providence dead yes but how he was going to tell me when mark came in hush madam hush who was dead my baby my darling he might have been like you now your age his fathers son it was twenty years ago i had a nurse ellen trimmer was her name she was killed in a street accident but before she died she made a confession to the man she had been going to marry and he came on with it to me i had heard just so much and then mark spoke he had been hidden behind the curtains of my bed all the time and he spoke quite softly to the man and the man declared that he had asserted nothing and believed nothing and had only been a fool for attaching any value to the ravings of a delirious girl and he promised for all his life was worth to say and think no more about it and mark saw to it that he would keep his promise what had he been going to say what i never had the heart or will to ask but you you can still find out if you like and if he is still living was she herself raving sometimes as i listened to that disjointed outpouring i was convinced of it sometimes i seemed to gather from its incoherence the shadow of a truth a purpose the cry of a long fettered despair struggling for articulation hush she said suddenly he may be back at any time here now watching us and laughing in his sleeve he is so terrible so swift and secret the souls he desires for his own must go to him look here is the mans address i have never parted with it find him if you can and prove the stronger will if i could repay him after all these years remember and repay him she thrust a paper into my hand and was gone i stood stupidly staring at her retreating figure repay him repay whom and for what surely if there were a purpose in her ravings it must turn on something ghastly and incredible it was her husband i could not doubt whom she thus held her awful debtor but for what deed what crime that could so move her at this last to take a stranger for her factor there was something very fearful in the vision of this apostate from the faith of matrimony was it possible that there were others in the world who through twenty years of seeming apathy could so be nursing horrible things in their bosoms vipers fattening for an opportunity i glanced down at the paper it contained a name and an address somewhere in kennington nothing more the rest was for me to do a baby and dead dalston and mother carey and a dead baby there was a coincidence here at least what an unconsecrated plot in a graveyard was my mind become and how the deadly branches twined and shut it in well i would go and see this man if he existed somewhere and somehow light must be let into the tangle chapter xvii nurse ellens young man after twenty years and he was still in his old place of business that was characteristic of the man i found mr churton in his workshop planing a board which seemed destined for a coffin he had a paper cap on his head his indeterminate eyes were pale blue his whiskers were of the colour of the sawdust which powdered the bench at which he wrought from time to time as i talked to him his wife a great strenuous woman of an imposing person and virulence put in her head at the door sniffed each time in crescendo and departed there was an air of dogged helplessness about the man himself the question i said is of ellen trimmer you walked out with her once you know he took up a lath of wood squinted along its edge and put it down did i sir he said dear me how one forgets you havent forgotten of course i can quite understand you mrs churton wouldnt favour such reminiscences well no she wouldnt he said why should she now she might you know i answered if your peace of mind were in question it never is he said say your safety then that obviously agitated him a little you see i went on to keep to yourself a secret which touches on the question of a crime is to make yourself an accessory after the fact that was a shot in the dark but i saw his hand shake on the plane and knew that it had struck theres such a thing isnt there sir he said feebly as a statute of limitations not in criminal cases he went rather shakily to fetch a tool from a rack on the wall he was quite a long time coming back with it i dont know sir he said slowly and with difficulty that i wouldnt rather face the risk of hanging than he paused than the risk of offending mr dalston i put in he started violently and the tool dropped from his hand you see i said quietly now put this to yourself what if mr dalston himself were to be hanged not through me he cried aghast i dursent risk the chance he would get at and do for me somehow even if it was from the condemned cell i rose to my feet you have said too much or too little mr churton there is nothing for me now but to consult the police he made a sort of lost motion towards me with his hands at that moment his wife burst in and stood with arms akimbo get out of this she cried in an awful masculine voice what are you worritting him for with your questions who are you what do you want its very simple i said i want to know what ellen trimmer confessed to him before she died then youll just pack and go wanting it she vociferated whats ellen trimmer to him or him to her or you to any of us get out do you hear youre blocking my way my dear said mr churton if its a question of conscience conscience she bellowed a pretty conscience on my word who was it set you up in life and give you the chance to marry and something respectabler than your ellen trimmers a baggage that could go dropping you for him the slut and no wonder to look at you i fancied that i for my part could answer who but mr churton only hung his head on its long neck like a feeble tulip beaten down under a storm very well i said if youll allow me to pass ill go o ill allow you my man said the virago with an enormous mimicry which bore not the faintest resemblance to my voice and as i passed out flounced at me with her apron as if i were a strayed chicken but i hadnt walked a hundred yards down the street when i heard the sound of running footsteps behind me and turning round there was mr churton labouring on my tracks his breath was pumping in him his weak eyes watered the shavings in his whiskers shook like ringlets i must say it sir he gasped i had to break from her and follow you he smacked one ineffective fist into the palm of the other shell have to find out whos master some time and as well to begin now as later he looked up piteously into my face i were always a feckless creatur i know what i ought to ha done about that man arter i see him but i couldnt do it sir i couldnt its been on my conscience these years dear god my little ellen that was so happy with me and that he seduced from her plighted word he rubbed his bare wrist across his eyes was he the cause of her death i asked gravely the cause sir he said and not the cause she told it me all in the hospital where she lay shed sent for me while she could speak i was the only one left to her and she owed it to me she thought she was frightened of him sir and why why was she frightened of him well because hed just taken her mistresss baby away to a woman called carey and had it killed there it was out i was in possession of the secret which mark had dared this invertebrate witness to reveal the poor fellow entreated me not to turn his confession to his ruin he didnt kill her you know he said in desperate extenuation she just jumped out of the cab when she found it was dead and was run over there was a fog at the time the fog i thought was lifting mr churton i said so luck favour us you shall never see or hear from me again chapter xviii telegrams now henceforth i was to move on with a set and deadly purpose murder was in the air and i was stalking it a hooded falcon on my wrist though i knew only what the reader knows i had the feeling that were i once to loose the jess some strange and unexpected quarry would be brought down from the skies mark is a significant name to the beasts of chase in the meantime awaiting the psychologic moment i had reason to reflect that there is generally somewhere that flaw in the boldest criminal calculations which sooner or later will give the crime away the wicked astute man thinks astuteness impossible to virtue one of those mistakes of generalising which lead to accidents he estimates all goodness at credulity all vice at subtlety yet both solomon and sancho panza were good men now if for twenty years mr churtons mouth had remained sealed from terror why should that terror become suddenly inoperative in the twenty first year it is just the contempt for providing against such unforeseen contingencies which constitutes the flaws but it would have been quite possible to close mr churtons mouth at once and for ever at the beginning of things casual concessions to humanity are the weaknesses of all but napoleonic criminals mr dalston then it would appear was not a napoleonic criminal he attached too much value perhaps to the mere terror of his personality i found when i reached home a very batch of telegrams awaiting me they had arrived it seemed in pretty quick succession and had been brought down from the house the sight of them first astounded then frightened me i opened one with a shrinking not to say a slinking feeling about my backbone and instantly collapsed into a chair my sickest apprehensions were realised it was from johnny and fatefully potential of entanglements with a beating pulse i examined the rest of the batch and gave a groan of despair the wretched boy had got it seemed on the track of some preposterous chimera and was off after his quarry with a whoop it had been enough for him to gather quite mistakenly that pugsley was an enemy to my non existent pretensions henceforth every act of that dyspeptic cleric was open to suspicion for what had i not in one reckless moment made myself responsible suddenly in the midst of my desperation the picture of my friend round and jocund tiptoeing tomahawk in hand in the unconscious tracks of a poor evangelical missionary rose before me and sent me off into a fit of helpless laughter well i thought when i had gasped myself sober the thing has started and ive no means now of stopping it i can only pray not to be included in its retributions its retributions indeed not on that day alone but through many days to follow did those unconscionable telegrams come swooping upon me in flights and swarms a plague of devouring locusts desecrating my green solitude keeping me in a perpetual flurry between shame and hysterics i thought i should never hear the end of them of the tap of their arrival of the story they unfolded of the sort of inebriated phraseology in which they were couched and when at last the visitation stopped suddenly i could hardly credit my release but it did come at length and then when i could breathe once more in self confidence i set to classifying the whole mad array and to endeavouring to make a consistent tale out of it whether or not i have succeeded in my object let the reader decide from the

wormwood scrubbs declared saved since reading revelations considered giant tortoise somewhat softened compromised finally with gift of hundred pounds to society for promoting abstemiousness among total abstainers coming back to morrow not if i could prevent it there and then i sat down to indite him twenty reasons for his staying for the present where he was they might convince or only wound him i could not help it it was out of the question having him actively interesting himself any more in my affairs and at this crisis of them his answer in fact when it came showed him a little hurt poor johnny there was a consciousness a reproach in it of exile from more than my company well i couldnt help that either chapter xix lady skene kneels to me his that is just written passes as an entracte the fooling of a clown before the curtain the merry jigging of the fiddles it ends and the lights are down once more the dark curtains heave and lift waste glooms and sorrows repossess the stage and only now always in their deep midmost travels a little bloody star the soul of a murdered child winter has gripped the land in earnest and screaming upon the heavy dawns come winds and ashy flights of snow they are like tempests of defiance hissing down and heaping at my feet to dispute my way but i shout them back their blasphemies and spurn them and drive on i have a deadly purpose at my heart and i am not to be deterred by bluster the right shall be vindicated and the guilty soul stripped naked whatever befall of frost or storm on and on to the relentless end down in my damp holt that winter the cold became intense not crisp and dry as in the open but mortal chill penetrating to ones bones like the sodden embrace of a vampire the ice underfoot there had always a spongy crackle and the snow in the leafy hollows a cankered scar about its centre i had hard ado to keep my resolution thawed at blazing fires but i heaped the coal on lavishly recklessly drawing from a plentiful store which had been packed into a shed close by and presently my lodge was like a charcoal burners covert in a forest coming down to it at night i could feel the radiations of its warmth a rod away i sometimes wonder now it never leapt into roaring flame before my eyes this balmy southern climate had not known such a visitation in all my memory of it nor in all my memory of it had i so rejoiced to cross its moods if as it appeared it had rallied itself greatly to the cause of villainy throttling delaying stultifying so much greater relatively was the force of doggedness it evoked in me a point gained was a gain triumphant if won through buffeting winds and drifts of snow and the most sinister gain of all was to be won from its deepest drift i had delayed going up to the house until the receipt of johnnys final telegram set my mind and conscience at rest then having written to the dear boy i turned at once to face the ordeal which awaited me the atmosphere of the dining room that night seemed one of curious quiet and reserve lord skene appeared to ruminate rather than discuss the good fare with his usual honest relish his lady only trifled with her food miss christmas was not present we talked desultorily of things obviously the remotest from our mind hauntings i put it all down to the glamour of the fatality which was obsessing my own brain it seemed right somehow that i should exhale a spirit of omen and unrest but there was a reason for it beyond my knowledge minister of retribution as i considered myself i could hardly have had the heart to pursue my purpose at the moment had i guessed the child was ill and the shadow of his trouble lay upon the household all other shadows were become as nothing in it why did they not tell me had he my little brother as they thought him no claim upon my sympathy was no right mine to share the burden of their disquiet as they denied me so was i justified in my purpose doubly trebly justified and yet i might have taken him into my arms and wept to hold him so and kissed and kissed some measure of my own exuberant strength into his little flower of a soul but they held me held me always as a thing apart and on their heads lie the issue i had been apprehensive that lord skene anxious to probe me further in the matter we had last discussed would welcome our being left alone together but rather to my surprise he made no effort to detain me when her ladyship withdrew and appeared to sink at once absorbed in his own reflections it gave me the opportunity i desired that was enough for me and i availed myself of it instantly she was standing at the foot of the stairs preparing to ascend when i accosted her lady skene may i have a word with you she turned with such a sudden terrified look as i could hope never to awaken on her face again with me not now o richard she whispered the name the significance and agony of its utterance pierced me to the heart but i had put my hand to the plough and must go forward yes now i said there is nothing can be gained by temporising she seemed to totter a moment her white jewelled hand caught at the banisters but almost with the act she had recovered herself you cannot guess how cruel you are she said but come if you will she led the way up the first flight and into her boudoir i had never entered this room in all my life before had never more than assayed in chance glimpses the wealth and costliness of its appointments now as she shut us in together among the rich hangings the velvet lined cabinets and tables glistening with china and old silver and infinite bijouterie i felt as if fate had imposed on me a sacrilege which no pretext of duty could condone there were lighted girandoles on the walls a carpet soft as turf beneath my feet a great fire leaping on the hearth she drew a low chair to it and sank down resting her chin on her hand and frowning into the glow i went and stood before her lady skene i said this is a beautiful room it seems to embody in itself all that of comfort and rich possession and happy security for which so many of us are ready to barter away our souls she never moved or raised her eyes happy she muttered why are you not i said hardly worth while then to risk so much to gain so little neither happy nor secure perhaps she looked up suddenly what have you found out have you been spying yes i have been spying she rose to her feet her hands clinched against her skirts i had never seen her look so wretched or so lovely you can own it why not so vile an admission who has there ever been to teach me it was vile i have lived alone lady skene untaught unacknowledged conforming to the pattern of my surroundings if that moulded me to secrecy who was to blame if to be watchful and observant in the midst of enemies is a crime i plead guilty to it with all my heart there was always this much this one unhappy riddle to exercise my mind why i who longed for love so much was denied my most natural claim to it why my mother of all the mothers in the world could never bring herself to be a mother to the child who worshipped her well my watching has borne fruit i have discovered why at last her head had drooped lower lower it was terrible so to stand before that love which had been my dream and betray to it the fulness of my renunciation yet i had no choice lady skene i said i was in the babys garden that night you had your interview with mr dalston she was down now crushed at my feet her pride her beauty her queenly jewels all in ruin before me was i not satisfied at last the fire tinkled the wind came like a hand on the casement i could see by the motion of her fair shoulders how heavily she breathed lady skene i began again and suddenly she caught at me like one going under in deep waters not that richard say it once once let me hear it on your lips it is too late she moaned and moaned then seemed to listen too late my arms were held down in anguish to entreat this dimming phantom as it fell from me o if you had but said it a year a month a week ago useless now why have you hated me so not hated no what then was it love forbade that word to pass my lips or shame it is not like a woman to make her child the scapegoat of her sin or perhaps it was only that you hated to be reminded through that spoken word of a falsehood to which its utterance would have seemed a perpetual rebuke i was the pledge to you of nothing but the lie on which you had bartered yes i use the term to you on which you had bartered away your soul she shivered and sighed most miserably kill me with your scorn she muttered i have deserved it did you not hate me i cried in great emotion do you not hate me now i feared you she said low i always feared you from the first i think you have shown me why you seemed strange a thing i had no part in i never felt like a mother to you god knows i could not help it it seemed hard i should be denied redemption for one so strange to me i listened with a stricken heart had she been so much to blame after all since some subtle instinct in her unconscious of itself had fore read the truth god knew indeed she could not help it and now she went on dully have you not revenge enough look at me think of me my position my example my my motherhood and all at his mercy you have me at your feet at last richard you have watched to some purpose as you say yes to some purpose i answered if only i can save you from the consequences of that deceit she seemed to listen in wonder then shook her head working her hands together feverishly i dont know what you mean these are the wages of sin death is the only thing that can cure my shame and my disgrace o where is the atonement in long years of lip service if while we speak the penitence we live the lie i told you once your touch contaminated your little brother i told you that it was a wicked spite and god has punished me for it but you havent forgiven me i stooped and seized her hands fiercely into mine she made no resistance only hiding her face from me if i have watched you through these long years i said what was it for but to study how to win your love did it never strike you how the little cold soul was shivering outside the window crying for that warmth and comfort within mother never to have spoken it not once never to have the right to speak it now yes it was a wicked cruel word i thought i should never forgive you for it once i thought it and now her tears ran hot over my hands i felt a savage exultation in their flowing was she not melting to me at last i clutched her still the fiercer now i said you are wretched and alone and what you have refused to give to me i will give to you love and pity and forgiveness most of all you cannot claim them of me now and now i will give them to you freely because you are in need i will come to you because in name you have had that right to my reverence and protection i will honour that ghostly trust i cannot put you from my heart so easily your shame is still my shame your cause my cause be comforted if being bred to tenderness and recognition i had not learned to watch to spy you would be without an arm well nerved to help you now all things i suppose work to their appointed end this man at least i say it shall not have his damned way with you confide in me for once has he attempted to bleed you a second time she made a very slight negative motion with her head he will do it i said he will come again and again do you recognise that yes how will you answer him she did not speak but i felt a little tremor run through the hands i held why i said do you not make a clean breast of it to your husband if i know him he would not judge that imposition hardly no she whispered it is not him i fear who then not me let him know me for what i am for all i care richard why i believe hed think the better of us both for it be as cruel to me as you will insult you you mean but i know what is in your heart confess to him how would that avert the greater catastrophe the scarlet letter the ignominy of the moral exposure and your persecutor knows it no doubt and builds his plans upon the ruin of your reputation not as a wife but saint o my god i must pause a little in the mad tumult of my emotions to have her thus at my feet broken despairing looking to me the neglected and despised for help and reassurance the madness beat like fire in my brain now listen i said at last this man this reptile he mines and mines like the blind beast he is he never thinks of his being undermined by another his black burrow seems secure to him i felt her hands plucking at mine but i held them tight he sets his snare and never sees the noose awaiting his own neck o if i have spied do you hear me i have spied to more effect than you might dare to hope or he perhaps to fear mother there i will speak it for the first and last time i have that in my hand to save you and send him to the gallows she tore her hands away at last and rose tottering to her feet not that she cried insanely not that you must not it cannot be do you not know have you never guessed must i be the one to tell you what he is your father richard with the word there came a swift step at the door and miss christmas hurried into the room pale and disturbed her eyes met mine in one startled glance and turned to lady skene aunt georgie she said in an agitated voice im sorry i thought you were alone but but i think youd better come at once how could i have known or guessed i could not even then only i recognised the urgency of some tragic call and stepped aside to let her pass for one instant her wild haunted eyes were turned on mine o god forgive me she whispered but i think it was i who ought to have uttered that broken prayer chapter xx antonio geoletti so she believed me to be her son and his the deadlier mystery was none of her sharing for that at least i could breathe one heartfelt prayer of thanksgiving she was innocent of any but that one deceit and that one even in the relief of my soul i could have found trivial to insignificance the memory of our interview held me sleepless and agitated through most of the bitter night i had denounced bravely and promised bravely and now through what new development of the situation was i purposing to redeem my promise my course i felt would have been an easier if a darker one had she betrayed her guilty partnership in that secret her ignorance there was but a new rock in my path all doors seemed to open but to shut in my face all jack o lantern lights to lead me on but to plunge me in confusion what impulse interest frenzy had so driven that mad woman to betray her husband to me none perhaps but some inexplicable craft calculating to mislead me yet had i not proved the genuineness of her strange confidence no it was impossible not to believe that for some hidden reason he had earned her revengeful hatred but for what reason and how was it to be associated with the paramount mystery i had promised much and i meant much desperately if cunning would not serve yet i doubt my performance might have fallen far short of my intention had not circumstance at this crisis given into my hands the very witness i could most need that mocking altar still stood to attest my confidence in my tutelary god yet not of luck i think was this fortuity but rather of the relentless processes of fate there was even hardly a coincidence in it when one came to examine i fell asleep at last and woke to that sense of wan chill light on the ceiling which is the reflected ghastliness of snow i rose shivering and looked out of my window the wood was all a whirling rush of flakes ground to powder between the teeth of a ravenous wind it tore and spat them so that the trees on their north sides were all glued with white foam a foot deep and here and there ominous drifts were already forming it was a strange enough sight to a southerner inured to winter fogs and dripping skies and the uncommonness of it the shriek and sting and the mad dance awoke a responsive frenzy in my blood this was the right challenge to my mood something that i could close and wrestle with and battle through to an end i rejoiced as if my formless visions of retribution had actually at last assumed a definite shape and substance it was spartan work nevertheless dressing and washing in a pool of slushy ice and fetching wood and coal and preparing the house generally against the siege of frost which threatened it an advance picket of the enemy already occupied the lower rooms and had to be driven out under a hot fire from the grate i must keep an eye to my provisioning too in case i should come to be cut off from my base snowed up and prevented from reaching the house in short of ordinary fare i had always made a point of storing a plentiful supply in order to avoid the worry of a daily commissariat and of this supply i found to my relief there was ample remainder biscuits jolly great potatoes for roasting in their winter jackets and good to be eaten crumbling hot with salt and pepper and perhaps a little yellow flake of butter in their middles rashers from a half side of bacon which hung like an old rusty coat in the chimney corner of my tiny kitchen eggs when i could get them and at whose endless manipulations in a chafing dish i had become expert dates figs a canvas bag of chestnuts and for drink coffee and hot whisky grog with sugar and lemon peel these made the staple of my diet and with tobacco were sufficient to the needs of any proper woodland hermit but there were perishable goods in addition not to be despised bread milk and butter to wit and for my daily supply of these i was accustomed to look to the good offices of my old friend comely the steward who had never yet failed me in his service of them well i must if needs must come to drink my coffee black and lard my toasted biscuits with pigs fat it would be no such terrible deprivation after all i spent the morning putting my fortress in order for the wildness of the weather precluded any thought of outdoor exercise but after lunch the fury of the storm having abated somewhat i began to cast about for some means to discipline the restless spirit of adventure which was awake in me the prospect in my then state of excitement of a long afternoon of enforced apathy and inaction in my lonely quarters was intolerable i decided that i would take the road to market grazing and pay a visit to the steward himself with whom i would still occasionally foregather of an evening in his little band box of a villa in the high street for comely had married of late years and had a house of his own and incidentally a smiling baggy little wife who had sat for so long under mr pugsley that she had come to have no particular shape or opinions of her own yes comely genial and deferential and unsuspicious would prove an excellent febrifuge in the fever of mind which consumed me but i was destined never to reach him never to get beyond the fall of the bank where the little wicket gave upon the road for there the wind had heaped the snow in a mighty drift and in endeavouring to negotiate it i slipped and plunged up to my neck that was little in itself had not my feet in sinking encountered some body soft and of a texture indescribably different from what they had expected it was elastic and potentially human fighting for my balance i groped down and found a buried man he was dead to all appearance a dark small foreign looking fellow with closed eyes and a face like wax his crop of hair and short beard were grey and stark like rime he was cheaply dressed but newly in a suit of coarse tweed and woollen gloves were on his hands i discovered this all when i had prized and tugged him out of his deadly burrow and laid him on his back and brushed the snow from his clothes and features my great strength had served me well but i thought to no profitable end i was not to guess for a moment what wonderful fatality had guided my steps to this drifted cache and set my foot on the key to all the mysteries and at the fruitful moment too another hour half hour perhaps and it had been too late and in the meantime i thought him gone beyond recovery listening and feeling i could detect no pulse in him nor any sign of life his teeth white and regular still for all his grey hairs showed in a set grin his lips were pale violet i believed him dead still there was no telling and here at least was material for my superfluous vigour something external and challenging to my hunger for distraction in action with a huge effort i lifted the body in my arms and made with it for the lodge the wind cut at me the snow still flying viciously beat and stung my face i joyed in the battle and won triumphant through it into shelter and laid my burden down by the fire then i fetched brandy and forced a spoonful of it through the biting teeth and stroked the hairy throat to irritate it to action and waited and persisted and persisted and waited sometimes as the day sank i thought i could detect a shadowy movement on the face but it was only the illusion of dancing firelight sometimes a sound as of a tiny voice calling from a vast depth would startle me until i identified it for the thin whine of wind in the keyhole the stiff body never moved never responded by one thrill to the persistence of my efforts and presently i gave it up and withdrew into the scullery to wash my hands and ponder my unenviable position as the keeper of a mortuary with no immediate or definite prospect of release it was while i was there scrubbing preoccupied and depressed that the growth of a sound unnoticed at first or attributed to familiar causes began to impress itself on my hearing it was like a low continuous babbling at the outset but even while i listened it rose all in a moment into a series of strained and gasping screams petrified for an instant the next i had rushed back into the sitting room the pseudo dead man was writhing and rolling on the hearthrug and it was by him that those cries of suffering were emitted his congested veins were recovering their circulation and his torment was unspeakable i flung myself on my knees beside him and caught and chafed his agonised limbs and poured more brandy down his throat and by and by the devil fled and his cries sank into moans and his moans to spasmodic gasps and when those ceased i got him by degrees into a chair where he sat tottery and dribbling and conning me speechlessly from bloodshot eyes dim with wonder and the spent tragedy of pain rest quiet now i said and dont attempt to speak or move you neednt worry your brain either about what brought you here its quite simple i stumbled on you by chance sleeping to your death in a snowdrift and i fished you out of it and carried you to my house here which happened to be close by dont answer but if you think you could stand more brandy move your head and i will get you a glass stiff and hot he nodded feebly once or twice i disposed him to his safety fetched a kettle water and the condiments and in a little had brewed him a good stinging jorum now i said i am going to pull the sofa there to the fire put you on it and leave you to sleep he smiled weakly as i lifted him in my arms and whispered for the first time very faintly good good ver strong and good grazia signore the medicine i will admit he took down lamblike in three dutiful gulps it had its effect on him almost instantly he closed his eyes and sank back in a blissful stupor then i covered him warm with a rug lit the candles shut all in snug and dry and set about making my preparations for a comfortable hot meal against the time when he should awake a strange glow was in my blood i must have felt something i think of a mothers feelings when her conscious self first realises in the new life beside her the earnest of pains past and present reward when she wakes from storm to see the rainbow glowing in her sky does that sound extravagant i daresay but remember the sort of social crusoe i had been this was my man friday the living salvage of my hands i was jealous already of my proprietorship in him he owed his life to me and i felt a fierce joy in that debt as in one that elevated me for the first time to the ranks of lifes creditors all conventional disabilities vanished in that uplifting what did a name matter to one who had saved a life i had qualified for the great human brotherhood he slept very long and heavily hardly stirring or seeming to breathe when i had finished my preparations i took a chair near him and sat pondering his face it was of a curious green white like the complexion of a plant starved in a cellar the lines of emotion on it looked almost grotesquely exaggerated as if he had been an actor who had been made up to portray some tragic part and who had forgotten to wash himself afterwards the contrast between that anmic skin and the grey furrows which channelled it was startling who was he and what could have brought him a stranger and a foreigner to wander to his destruction on these remote and wintry roads i was greedy for his awakening to learn it came in the end quite suddenly i had just made up the fire and was returning to my post of observation when i saw his eyes wide open and staring at me bully old fellow i said come sta isnt it how do you find yourself he threw off the rug with a quick movement and scrambling to his feet precipitated himself on his knees before me and caught and kissed my hands o come thatll do i said its all right you know he poured out a torrent of gratitude part english part italian wholly incoherent now i said if you dont stop i shall put you out in the snow again he was crying and gesticulating and embracing me all in one ah the snow he cried and the pain merciful god the pain and then the immenseness in the sleep and you have save me yes signore you like a strong lion you com and lift me in your mouse and i am yours for ever and more i am yours according he rose to his feet and stood away fingering his breast dramatically very well i said but what am i to do with the gift i foresaw on the instant embarrassments but as to that i did him less than justice he lifted his head with dignity call me and i will com he said spik to me and i will obey zat is for my lov and duty to you for the eternity of all times now i sank you and go i go again on my way wiz a great heart rich in the thought of the help which vouchsafe itself to a poor dog wizout one doubt or inquiration i laughed thats all nonsense i said you arent in a state to take the road again and anyhow im not going to commit you to the risk here you stop you know till its safe for you to move on he came to me at once and lifting my hand and kissing it again but this time with a formal gravity stood away and looked at me with glistening eyes there was wonse a good man signore he said who find a fellow lying senseless by ze way and he pour in wine and oil to his wounds and he ask nozzing nozzing what the fellow be or how he deserve what he get so he may just take the chance to help him but i say i will not com to you signore so noble and clementeenious on the lie which is not to spik i say you shall know zis fellow where he leave and what he deserve lest your goodness presently shall curse the folly of itself i am from prison since twent y year signore i have live in prison and zis is the first long travel i take from it when you save me he stopped and bowing his head and clasping his hands stood meekly to receive my denunciation and i do not deny that i was startled dumfoundered even for a moment but the candour and honesty of the confession overcame me thats all one i said there are many men we have to accept and hobnob with who have a better title than you i daresay to the laws attentions well you are a ticket of leave man i suppose he shook his head no i serve my term i regarded him curiously circumstance was bringing me acquainted which some queer house mates a long one i said you must have deserved well of the law do you mind telling me your name ah my name signore he said yes smit that it is yes smit is my name now you see i answered you make a show of speaking the truth to me and then you go and tell me that i dont believe it of course what were you in for i suppose youll say for shop lifting or turnip pulling or sleeping out of doors or something equally convincing i was in for nozzing at all it was a false charge it was made by a devil of course thats even less than i imagined and you are on your way now to bring that devil to book for it i suppose yes i am on my way when the snow take me into its cold pillows and i die in zat bed but for you the quietness of his manner impressed me in spite of myself why did you call yourself smith come now i said i tell you a lie he answered at once it was just zat he might miss to hear of me not guess the truce of the vengeance which arrives to him at last he who i asked apprehensively this matter was assuming a more sinister complexion than i quite liked i say my friend i hope your looks are belying you you havent got a knife in your pocket have you signore he said earnestly almost piteously i beg zat you not force of me your servant to answer for myself i will confess the truce that i lie my name is antonio geoletti what chord of memory was suddenly touched in my brain for a moment i could not identify it and then all in a flash it had leapt upon me out of the dark geoletti the name of the italian guide mentioned in charlie skenes letter i looked at the man stupidly some dim association of ideas was already quickening very little and deep in my brain it was the seed of a certain deductive reasoning the stirring of a green shoot which like the indian jugglers mango tree would push through the soil in a little and break into sudden leaf and take my soul with knowledge geoletti i exclaimed at last in a voice sharp with astonishment and then in one leap light came in and the tree burst into flower it was mark dalston whom this avenger was tracking to his doom he bowed sombrely after a little pause i went nearer to him here was as i have said no coincidence but the stupendousness of the destiny quite awed and humbled me what was i worth without this directing hand of fate to guide me geoletti i said looking at him intensely but speaking very quietly i think perhaps it may be i can tell you something about yourself si signore he answered as quietly almost indifferently for he can have had no apprehension of what was to come you were a guide once upon a time in the italian alps were you not si signore his eyelids flicked up swiftly and were lowered again his lips gasped a little you knew a mr cecil delane there he offended you somehow it is to be revenged on him under his proper name of mark dalston that you are now come into this part of the country is not this all so i thought he would have fallen he caught himself steady by the sofa end and stood staring and gulping at me now wait i said you wonder how i can know this the puzzle of destiny makes a very simple map when it is put together geoletti some time ago i happened to come across part of a letter in a book you were mentioned in it mr dalston was mentioned in it and one or two others but leave them out it was just the association of the two names yours and his then and now that has made me jump to a conclusion wait while i show you i went and fetched the letter and held it out under his eyes can you read si yes yes read then eagerly gluttonously triumphantly his eyes travelled down the sheet and rested on the name at its foot he thrust out a rigid finger and pointed to it carlo si buono dio challie skene yes what about charles skene dalston murder him signore chapter xxi snow and fire it was a monstrous tale that he unfolded to me scarce credible for the guile the inhuman persecution the infernal callousness which it revealed and yet i could not but accept it as consistent and convincing there are men born one knows without the moral bias brutes thrown back on the primordial instincts for lust and blood but that learning and culture could be acquired merely to the exploiting of such primitive passions was a stupendous enlightening there is a horrible tale of hawthornes which depicts the agony of a clean and sensitive soul upon discovering accidentally that all the brother and sister souls of his familiar intercourse are on secret midnight terms with the powers of darkness i think i experienced something of that ghastly disillusionment now where was the good of refining and refining on our natures if at the end such bestiality remained possible to them better the snake and the lion hunting their prey on the plain issues of hunger my blood became water as i listened the knees of my soul grew sick under me what had this man not suffered of unspeakable persecution if his story were to be believed and i saw no reason to doubt it the perspective it appeared to open out to me of revelations affecting my own interests was obscured for the moment in the contemplation of his wilder wrongs and yet i could not but admit he had deserved badly of fate if his spirit of vengeance was justified the spirit which had involved him in it was vile yet assuredly sinner as he was he had atoned a hundredfold his back he showed it me was scored with ineffaceable marks of that discipline his soul and he showed me that too was still deeper scored he was delivered had delivered himself a fearful brand of retribution into my hand i talked with him till late that night and far into the following morning i had made him up a bed on the sofa and there had become no question but that he was to remain with me until this riddle of our common destiny was resolved i found in him or believed i had found a minister a witness a testifier to things potential but unspeakable they will be touched upon in due time in the meanwhile he dwelt suspended between a mortal hatred on the one side and a blind devotion on the other what i said once to him if i were to tell you geoletti that this man dalston is my friend he rose to his feet and begged me in great emotion to unsay my question to reassure him not to drive him mad very well i said but you must consider that revenge is nothing if it involves the avenger in the ruin of his victim we have enough evidence and over to put the noose about this fellows neck but the law doesnt hang on moral testimony and until we have the material sifted and compact it behoves us to move with caution he isnt one i gather to overlook a false step made by an enemy and theres to be no knifing mind he assured me earnestly that he would be secret circumspect always entirely at my disposal and commands and with that i had to rest content after lunch on that second day restless beyond endurance i left him to an hours siesta while i went for a walk in the bitter weather i wanted to think my thoughts alone to decide upon a plan of campaign to clear my mind for battle it was snowing again and the wind was wilder than ever a furious stimulant to action i went down first of all into the road and saw it swept as clean as a curling rink though the drifts on the wood side were piled six feet deep against the bank but bethinking myself that dalston or even his uncanny lady might chance to come that way i altered my mind and turning again into the caddle went off northward towards hags lane it was stiff enough work while the trees protected me but once out in the open lungs muscle and resolution had to make a common cause of it there was no thinking of anything here but just how to set one foot before the other and hold on the wind was like a chaff cutter whirling off ends of snow that stung ones skin like straw points the fields went up and down in tossed billows of white with the ground frozen deep green in the troughs of them leaden sky and spinning flakes and the dim tracery of trees were all wrought together in ones view as if life had got into that inextricable tangle which must mean the end of things a wild enough day for a constitutional one might have thought and yet it seemed i was not the only nor the weakest vessel which had been driven to venture abroad in it for beating at length into the comparative harbourage of hags lane i saw come there before me in pursuit of shelter the figure of a solitary young lady she stood under a white streaked hawthorn which protruding from the bank afforded her a certain cover in her hand was a broken umbrella which dangled like a shot rook with its pinions flopping her face looked very white and her eyes preternaturally large i went up to her miss christmas i said are you out of your senses i could have thought that some soft sound even like a suppressed sob came from her lips if i was not mistaken she hastened to convince me at least that the fact of my arrival had nothing to do with it her answer was as cold as the falling snow i dont think so i am quite capable of taking care of myself thank you you are not if you can venture out alone on such a day as this i must take you home at once she curled her lip magnificently im afraid i dont quite understand you i wish you would go to another tree there is plenty of room in this lane for both of us if i go i shall go altogether she turned her shoulder on me i dont want to be rude she said now whatever the meaning of her presence here her escapade was the maddest thing conceivable i was quite at a loss how to account for it or persuade her from it when suddenly the devil put a suspicion half tormenting half mocking into my head and i spoke recklessly on the spur of it mr dando has gone away i said if it was any hope of running across him that brought you here she started turned swiftly and i saw that look on her face which i had seen once before ira i cried dont say it she threw away the dislocated umbrella burst into tears and ran out into the snow but she had not gone ten paces when she stumbled and sank to her knees in an instant i was beside her i did not know what had happened to me is this sort of thing after all a stroke or perhaps a sudden possession something like a fiery pulse was hammering in my brain i felt furious savage half suffocated reckless with a lust of pain to inflict it and invite it we were pan and syrinx in the blasting weather i was crazy to make a reed of her sweet red mouth and breathe my soul of passion into it this frenzy may have been long germinating in me its delivery came in a roar of flame why at this moment more than at another i cannot say perhaps it was the sudden sense of my isolation alone with her in that cold soft world her helplessness the appeal of her young troubled face my own much troubled soul i had no claim on her nor hope nor right of claim that could be held to exonerate me who was i to cull such a flower to my bastardy and yet i could not control this sudden insane feeling nor deny myself the mad indulgence of it come what would i would take for my own so much of her as my lips would carry i lifted her in my arms while she struggled weakly to repulse me no use i said fiercely i am strong and a brute perhaps and i am going to use my strength to rob your lips they have insulted me often enough to deserve that toll scream if you like it can hurt no one but yourself why did you think i made that remark about johnny dando i myself hardly knew at the moment but now i know i was jealous wickedly horribly jealous i had no right to be i own no right to think at all of you but i do ira i cant help it no more can you i think of you i am thinking of you now in a way that would make you blush if you knew be quiet it is useless your struggling i want just that much of you your mouth and i intend to have it then i will let you go and you can punish me as you like only this one thing you will never be able to say again that your lips are virgin lips to the man who shall come to court and win you you had better say nothing about it to him that will be always the secret between you and me ira and i will promise for my part to hold it inviolate something in the word perhaps drove me beyond myself i bent my face down towards hers she had lain all this time like a wounded fawn in my arms her eyes closed her lips a little parted the breath fluttering in her tender side now suddenly to my wonderment she looked up at me with a wistful smile richard she said you do not want me to die do you i thought i was going to and then you came and i could have cried with delight i was so cold and i had lost myself and my heart seemed to fly out to your warmth and strength and i thought he is going to help me though i have been so foolish and suddenly i felt quite safe and happy the madness died down in me like a flame on which fragrant spices have been thrown i seemed to myself to gasp for breath she had seen me coming to her in her peril and had felt safe no ira i said in a low choking voice i do not want you to die then why do you threaten me with this killing shame i must have some of you i never knew my own mad need until this moment are you in love with me richard yes now you mention it i suppose thats it and do you want to shame the thing you love no ira if you would only love me too a little will you she gave a thread of a smile how can i help it if it is to save myself i gathered her furiously to my breast and rose to my feet holding her so my arms were crushed about her i set my teeth snarling to the demons of the storm let death and hate try to come to conclusions with me for this my possession not a breath should enter to despoil her if i knew her really for my own i looked with wonder once more into her face the very veins in it were things to love like flowers the snowflakes crisped upon her hair her eyes were closed again and happily it seemed to me my god i said it cant be true it cant answer me ira are you not offended i dont think so richard oh my love you said your heart flew out to me you mustnt be too exacting she whispered why dont you open your eyes ira i am mad to read them yes thats it i held her closer still ira i shall never kiss you now until you give me leave with your own lips she did not answer suddenly i saw a smile flicker on her mouth and her long lids opened just a crevice richard she panted they never gave you leave yes they did they did o the world has gone by us ira and we are left alone together in the old first heaven of things we sat together presently very unwisely in the snow under the old hawthorn at least i sat on the snow and ira on me but we were both content my poor umbrella she said it was blown to pieces in my hand what made you do such an insane thing come out at all are you sorry i did sorry supposing i had not taken a walk supposing the cold had killed you would you have minded very much richard this fond stichomythia these amorous anglings for assurance and reassurance of loves blisses they are not for the wise to understand i had not understood them myself an hour ago let me hide their memory away in that old old tabernacle of nature where only the foolish and the selfsame smitten shall steal in to contemplate and adore ira accounted to me for her rashness the sight of lady skenes restless anguish for the child though better from that dread attack of two nights ago was still in a parlous state had in the end proved too much for her and she had hurried out to forget herself in exercise and fresh air then wandering on blindly in the snow she had suddenly awakened to the knowledge that she was lost and very cold and that the wind and rushing flakes seemed all at once to have become things of animate wickedness shutting her round and in and barring every exit with spears of ice you must have been thinking very deeply ira to have come so far without noticing i wonder what about yes richard when when we think a good deal of something i suppose something is a good deal in our thoughts isnt it how aggravating of you i was already pluming myself on a nice compliment well you have been in my thoughts enough i can tell you have i that is why i have felt cold for such a time i suppose it shant be my fault if you feel cold ever again do you know what fools we are to sit here im in a fine glow myself but how about you o your arms are about me you ought to feel them like stove pipes if they come anywhere near expressing their own ardour please be a little less violent in your language richard do you know you are rather a savage creature altogether you shall tame me i have had my excuses ira i really have i know my dear lord how shouldnt i know indeed she put up a penitent mouth her sweetness and submission quite overcame me richard she whispered with her face very close to mine do you know that when you when you cried out to stop me just now it was the first time in all your life you had called me ira was it i dont know why i called you so then it came out involuntarily yes so i supposed and it was that that made me burst out crying and run away i dont understand why no you wouldnt you must be a woman first like you you chit i suppose you mean but something occurs to me that i want to ask you do you remember that kiss i gave you long ago perhaps i do if i flog my memory very hard ira did you hate me for it n o o i think not what then you can imagine nothing but extremes isnt there something i only put it to you you know between hate and love no nothing whatever o then i suppose i didnt hate you for it you dear what would you have thought of johnny dando if he had dared such a thing mr dando i should have been furious outrageously furious and then spoilt all the effect by laughing myself into hysterics i expect but its too absurd to think of for a moment hes much too good mannered for one thing o ira does that hurt you richard you have insulted me often enough to deserve that toll dear dont you remember your own words but there its very helpful sometimes to be taken by storm i have been very cruel to you you lovely soft thing her young arms stole sweetly about my neck how nice to hear your flattery richard you might beat me ten times a day if you would always end by saying such things to me and you have the air of believing them am i pretty to you i mean as if you didnt know it that is to say you think me spoilt well young lady a cherrys only the sweeter for having a little bruise in it but youve come on finely in these years to think what a detestable little prig you used to be now you want to make me cry cry away there arent many women to whom tears are becoming but i expect you are one of the few what a sultan you are but not very wise to flatter me there think what it would mean to have a crying wife a wife the words struck a sudden chill into me my arms strained passionately about the child relaxed a little ira i groaned i swear that until this moment i have never realised my madness she did not answer but her eyes canvassed me with a sudden piteous wonder that i should dream of such a monstrous thing dream that any claim of mine to you would be listened to for a moment she gave a heart won happy sigh and her face was summer again have i not listened to you richard with all my ears and heart yes but your guardian the world what are they to us i shall soon be my own mistress yes but o ira i wish i could say i shall soon be my own master you are master of me and i am you richard o dear are you going to break my heart after all youve said i caught her to me once more in a rapture you dear passionate baby do you realise to what to whom you are binding yourself yes to my richard if you please and if you abuse him any more i shall cry in good earnest how could i answer but in the terms of that lovers text book which has endured since eden a silence fell between us and then suddenly i felt myself shivering we are a couple of fools young woman i said love making out here in the snow that is not the way to provide against troubles that will need all our strength to meet them she bestirred herself in quick alarm o dear what a selfish wretch you have been keeping me warm all this time at your own cost o come away richard come away at once before it is too late she pulled frantically at me i laughed i expect you will have to carry me now ira i feel as stiff as a gun barrel richard there miss christmas nothing but my chaff but on my word we ought to be moving will you come and sit with me a little in my own lodge o you mustnt ask me richard but supposing i do and insist then i shall obey of course and be very unhappy of course and a sweet dutiful devoted child i am learning by degrees ira but i must take you that way though not to stop because with all my ardour the prospect of that climb back by the fields doesnt appeal to me and the road is swept clean by the wind so that we can walk on it easily and get back by the main entrance come along child i had to carry her through the lane nevertheless and so on mostly until we reached the woods where i could trust her to her own pretty feet and there we walked in security like authorised lovers now i said i have been forgetting everything but just our two selves is lady skene so very unapproachable ira she stopped me suddenly clinging to me with a pained line come between her eyes what does it all mean richard there is something more than the child i am sure of it and it fills me with fear and anxiety i held her silent a little turning my face away in a gloom of irresolution yes ira there is something more i said presently and very softly something terribly serious and terribly upsetting i was certain of it she whispered and you know what it is i can never forget her face that evening i found you together am i not to know richard it is not for my curiosity indeed i am sure of it dear i said it is your love for her but i have a greater claim on your love now ira and i must ask you for the sake of that claim to forbear questioning me at present the secret is not my own at least not all my own though it affects my interests very closely sometimes even i dare to hope of it a better claim to you than i possess now but you mustnt ask me dear there are ordeals and interviews and all sorts of unhappy explanations to be gone through with before i can trust myself to reveal it to you but you mustnt suppose in the meantime that i am lady skenes enemy indeed if that is true which i expect to be true my interference will benefit her in one way at least i am trying to circumvent a scoundrel ira and chance has put some very wonderful evidence in my hands i must not tell you more than that you are not in any danger you yourself richard she asked fearfully no you love i said not more that most people who set themselves to battle against the forces of villainy and now i am double armoured in your love it will be such a joy to me ira to put it all out of mind when i am alone and let your little image in to talk with me and laugh with me and sleep with me too for you cant help it she gazed into my face a little longer in great doubt and trouble until the tears coming into her eyes made her blink and she turned away i wish she said woefully i could be thought strong enough to bear the burden with you to help you richard help me i cried never so much as by holding yourself and your dear love apart from all this debasing atmosphere of gloom and secrecy i want to think of you out in the sunshine ira something sweet and unspoiled for my heart to rest on now be a sensible dear i shall come up to the house to see you to morrow you will she whispered brightening through her grief come early richard why not i cried cheeringly small profits and quick returns ira as johnny would say i shant let the grass grow under my feet lest you change your mind she gave me a lovely tremulous smile in reassurance for that and we went on together again the wind had dropped almost suddenly and the cold white woods were full of a wonderful stillness as we passed by the darkling lodge i thought of the figure hidden away within its shadows and a glow of mighty triumph went through my veins picturing that confederacy of love and death out of which was to be wrought for me a new manhood and a name chapter xxii a visit from mr dalston after paradise the deluge but i held my head high and laughed at the lowering heavens i had enough faith in me to float an ark with my heart for dove in it waiting confidently in expectation of the green promise such deep and full content in myself i had never dreamed were possible i was become another being in the prospect of my close relations with that pure and beautiful child when i awoke on the morrow of my joy it was surely to the same earth i had gone to sleep on but whither translated to what halcyon climate i could have believed it had caught in the train of some passing comet during the night and been swept into a starrier balmier region the frost had gone the birds were singing a sweet and melting tenderness had usurped the places of terror no doubt at the same time some clinging villainies had been brought away with it but their necessary clearance figured no longer as the paramount interest they were of first moment only in their menace to my loves innocent feet they must be cut and weeded away only that the garden of my loves soul be made perfect to her that was how i felt at last and let all old dry misogamists and scornful benedicks jeer their fill at me i was of you once myself o sapless brotherhood until that thing came to happen which made it impossible for me ever to be of you again now i say i would rather hear a lover rant of love than a wise man discourse on wisdom would rather for all the world is worth be the sinning penitent than the sinless priest who grudges him absolution how is solomon most remembered why by the love rhapsody which is called his song no better it was strange how all the passion and the melancholy of my revengeful past were dimmed suddenly in the radiance of this new feeling day had risen behind the sullen flaming rick and absorbed it still if inclination to my task of retribution was much lessened duty yet impelled me on to that task such tragic and momentous issues hung upon my conduct of it though a mothers pined for recognition no longer drove me forward there was the question no less of an unhappy womans persecution to make my blood run fury besides i could not shut my eyes to the fact that all this accumulation of evidence put me so long as i remained its sole depository in the position of an accessory wherefore everything considered i was resolved to go this very day with my witness to lord skene and make clean my breast to him poor man of all its perilous stuff it was a resolve indeed not to be regarded lightly for with what thunderbolts did it not threaten that old unconscious head into the peaceful chamber of his meditations i was to flounce with fire and brimstone murder blackmail and worst of all to some minds sick dishonour for as to that last my determination to speak the truth was one with all the rest lady skene had laid no embargo on me but had rather implied i thought an acquiescence in my possible advocacy of her cause and indeed it was out of all my heavy duty the task i feared the least since i believed it would prove the one the least disturbing to his lordship and that for reasons given long ago the lesson of that deceit i suspected would lack all but a roguish moral in his eyes but for his boy his murdered heir how would he take that ghastly revelation and how decide to deal with it yet there was no other course none that i could see and i confess for myself that the prospect of shifting the whole burden of my responsibilities to the shoulders of that shrewd legal understanding was not in my then state of exaltation an unwelcome one i wanted freedom in myself for the range of lovelier thoughts why should i retain for ever the sole thankless wardenship of that secret i was quite ready to forego my part of principal there and decline upon the humbler rank of scout or agent to his lordship yet when it came to the prick of decision i lingered and lingered out the moments the old man had been good to me he was happy and secure in his ignorance would he hold the profits of this dbcle to compensate its losses and thank me for an interference which could bring no gains to him but disillusionment the substantial gains indeed were more for me than him and so for ira i owed them after all to her though i hated my iconoclastic part it was that tender debt must hold me inexorably to it i had informed geoletti of my purpose and he had answered it is well signore that which you decide is good is good then he bestirred himself to do my household work and when all else was finished retired into the little kitchen to scrub pots and pans lulled by the sound of his soft movements behind the near closed door my thoughts took dreamy wing and floated out incontinently into the open were my iras speeding to join issue with them above that lovely hawthorn valley mistermed hags lane what flowers should come to blossom there in spring i believed i could write a poem on the subject and tinglingly i got out paper and pencil and sharpened the latter to a point of tenderest wit and in a little was absorbed in my task shame that lovers rapture should be held up over a rhyme what was inspiration to these cold laws of prosody but at last i appropriated one tiara the lord forgive me and then it was easy comparatively to fit my crown of blossoms to it nevertheless it struck eleven from the little clock on the mantelpiece while i was still fitting it and at that same instant i became aware of a presence in the room a thousand apologies my dear fellow said an unfamiliar voice i wouldnt have interrupted you for the world in such a romantic task if i had known i sat for a minute quite rigid and motionless it never occurred to me that here perhaps was the best testimony i could have wished to the effectiveness of my own secret dealings it seemed only an impossible piece of insolence that could have brought this man to seek my company and at such a moment but i did not reveal myself a long habit of self repression came to my aid mr dalston i said at last he nodded brightly we have met before i hope we shall meet again and on terms of a better understanding i rose to my feet at least perfectly cool in seeming meaning what i asked nothing cryptic of course said he he glanced about the room his manner was very alert and vivacious his teeth and glittering eyes seemed when he turned his face again to take possession of me the tragedy of that first meeting he said put any pleasant understanding between us two at the time out of the question didnt it you use an odd word mr dalston i said and take an odd way you will excuse me for a stranger why as to that he answered smiling i found the door open and took what i supposed to be the proper woodland way with hermits men of your principles love secrecy dont they and quiet comings and goings and visits unawares i only borrowed a leaf out of your book you see now though he was so gay and debonair i recognised on the instant some sinister meaning behind his words and knew that he was aware in some measure at least of the watchful part i had been playing and knew moreover that he wanted me to know that he knew i could not guess his purpose beyond the fact that it appeared to imply some menace and a warning but i could be as cool as he and his equal as i thought in cunning you referred to an understanding between us i said rather drawlingly well i can only repeat that it seems to me an odd word to use does it he answered does it really well say it may be held to imply in general terms a motto vive et vivas or to put it specifically if you dont interfere with me i wont interfere with you ah now you puzzle me entirely as much i confess as the strangeness of your being down here alone at eleven oclock in the morning puzzles me why that is easily explained he said i have just been walking with lady skene in that delightful bower a little cold just now called the babys garden and i took this path upon leaving her as being the shortest and the most private o why as the most private may i ask he leaned upon his stick hat in hand conning me with a smiling archness dont you know dont you know indeed my dear boy but of course you do or why should i be here that is for you to say you have inherited frankness i see i have always been a model of frankness myself i am glad to hear you pay that debt to your inheritance richard i was gathering at last something of his drift he was feeling his way to my sense of filial duty i could have struck my fist into his accursed dandy face no doubt he had heard from lady skene the facts of that interview between us in her boudoir and had assumed as she had assumed that the knowledge of my parentage was a revelation to me let him rejoice then and scheme on that premise and set the trap to his own damnation it was for me now with all that frenzy of hatred tingling at my finger ends to nurse his delusion for him and play the double hypocritical part i was surprised even at the resources of machiavellianism i discovered in myself mr dalston i said as you flatter me for candour i will be as candid as you could wish i am aware as you imply that you have been drawing upon lady skene for money and i know the reason thats capital he said thats very capital and engaging well now consider richard love children are not generally regarded in the light of very eligible partis are they especially when franked by no financial recommendations lord skene would hardly look upon such a one as a suitable match for a ward at law and a particularly charming and well endowed ward at law i will say i only put it to you that the revelation of such a suitors legal status would hardly appeal favourably to a guardian now would it better at least for him i think to make no boast of his moral disability it is nothing but a question of terms after all but upon such alas are our ridiculous conventions founded how could i listen to him and not spring at his murderous lying throat his very nameless reference to the subject of my most sacred hopes was a blasphemy scarce tolerable but i kept my sense of the enormous issues that hung upon my self command and i dealt him back his double dealing to the hilt i am to understand then i conclude i said and with a manner i do believe of helpless conviction that if i give you away i may expect to be given away myself he laughed you put it with a boyish crudeness but the method has its fascinations why not rather call it a little family understanding richard we are all in the same boat we all have our crying needs of the moment yes call it that and our family motto vive et vivas well you must give me a little time i said this comes as rather a shock on one you see time he cried time if you wish it to indite fifty immortal sonnets to your mistresss eyebrow i am never in a hurry my dear fellow let the thought germinate and take root at its leisure what a charming retreat to be sure and you live here all alone yes all alone not even an abigail to minister the needs but of course not in our present transcendent altitudes i wonder if i might pry a bit should i let him i thought how during all this interview the door giving into the kitchen had stood ajar i recalled how even before the fact of his presence in the room had been borne in upon me all sound of geolettis movements hard by had suddenly ceased i pictured a deadly figure crouching behind the door saw a mincing step pass on and in heard a sudden wild beast snarl and rush and then a scream my god freezing ones blood and for one instant i was half minded to bid him on his way and end thus swiftly at a blow the story of his villainies it was a ghastly temptation almost paralysing in its suddenness i had even stirred involuntarily to make way for him when the thought that not vengeance but retribution was to be the first exaction came to save me i put my hand across my forehead and felt it wet for a moment i could not command my voice if my agitation was obvious however he could find his own reasons to account for it no doubt he was pluming himself the blind fool on his unnerving conquest of a boy id rather if you dont mind i said at length be left to myself just now youve a bit upset me as you may guess and im not quite in the mood to play cicerone why of course he rejoined at once and cheerily it was inconsiderate of me bye bye then till we meet again my dear boy no dont trouble i can find my own way out and he went smiling and waving his hand back to me and humming a pleasant tune the moment he was well gone i stepped swiftly to the kitchen door and stood to obstruct its passage but the precaution was unnecessary no sound or movement came from within i stood for a little triumphing in my own triumphant duplicity the dog had thought to force my hand and had only succeeded in betraying the pretentious emptiness of his own he had discovered nothing of importance for all his midnight craft had no suspicion even of that most momentous betrayal of him by his own and nearest or surely he would have intimated his knowledge of it to me i ground my hands into one another grinding my teeth to what had i not been forced to listen and in appearance to subscribe a family understanding no doubt granting the hypothesis of my success on the score of it my blackmailing was to follow as a necessary consequence it was defilement merely to have encountered him aye and countered him too with his own weapons i felt as if i could never be entirely self respecting again until i had come to terms about him with the hangman with the thought i turned and with a guarded caution tiptoed into the kitchen my eyes were expectant of the vision of other eyes yellow and catlike crouched near the boards of a gathered catlike shape of a claw of steel protruding from catlike folds but there was nothing of the sort awaiting them geoletti was nowhere to be seen but suddenly even as i stood in indecision the oddest sound greeted my ears it was like the little sibilant yap of a dog in distressed dreaming and it appeared to come from under the dresser geoletti i whispered amazed he came crawling out on all fours actually like an abject dog and when he reached me rose up on his knees fawning with both hands and his eyes bright with madness signore he urged hoarsely you not go in wiz him my god i say you not go listen to wat i tell you when two enter togezer only won return his smile on the face zat hide what his hand in his pocket zat hold what for you so you follow him zere shall be no smile never again no face at all to smile wiz merciful god signore sink of her what wait you the beautiful signora and how on you depend her happiness she sall die if evil come to you ecco i know her state is not zat to endure it go back signore my god go back he struggled with me his voice full of an entreating frenzy geoletti i cried gripping him with force what is it what is the matter with you you heard and saw him was it not the man he only writhed the harder signore i see somsing i hear somsing but his eyes my god zey see everysing his soul go into the deep places zey look round the door when his voice spik though he not move his body quite suddenly he swayed and fell over i dont know whether or not he was seized with a sort of fit he lay rigid and staring and foam appeared on his lips but in a minute it was over he came to himself sane once more but dazed and for the moment quite helpless and exhausted what devilish cantrip had so overthrown his reason but from whatever cause the moral of his seizure was plain to me henceforth on my shoulders alone must rest the main burden of the nemesis hours passed before the man was sufficiently himself again to justify my use of him for witness and in the meanwhile how was my love accounting for my tardiness chapter xxiii geoletti tells his story she came to me dear love the moment i had entered the house her sweet eyes wet and wild were full of sorrow and unmeant reproach they gave one startled glance at the italian where he stood behind me deferential in the shadows and then came back in mute appealing to my face sit down here geoletti i said until i send for you he obeyed and i drew the girl into a room hard by and shut the door and held out impassioned arms i could not help it ira indeed i could not things beyond my controlling have detained me in a moment she had run to me had abandoned herself to me and was sobbing in my arms as if her heart would break richard i have wanted you so such a dreadful thing ira my darling what is this i dont know what it is you must go to him you must go to him at once he has been asking for you he who lord skene o she has gone away left us he has been questioning me uncle charlie has and i could tell him nothing how could i but you richard hush my dearest darling try and compose yourself who has gone away tell me in one word now aunt georgie has she has gone away run away do you mean she left a letter he will show it you there must not be any scandal richard some plausible explanation must be given she went away before lunch on foot and by herself when i went to look for her she was gone and only the letter was left and i took it to uncle and he read it and almost broke down before the servants but you know what he is in another moment no one would have thought anything was the matter not until i had him alone o richard what is it everything seems dark and miserable and you know and you wont tell me i will tell you if you ask me to but you will not ask me dear not yet i see another stroke of scoundrelism in this perhaps why didnt i send him to his death i believe i should have if id known the smiling cursed devil richard who you are terrifying me out of my senses my love you must not look little girl little dear dear girl i am holding you i am richard your lover your lover who puts his strong arms about you and tells you it shall all come right will you not trust me yes i will i will richard only your violence makes me sick for you it makes me sick for myself to think i cannot control it before my bird with her beating heart be quiet little soft frightened heart now kiss me ira as i hold you so and then i will go to him without a moments more delay yet for all my resolution my own heart was beating violently as i went to seek the old man in his study where he sat alone he was at his desk his head leaned upon his hand the lights were lit but not enough to flood the room which lay in partial shadow it gave me a pitiful shock as he turned his face to see how haggard it was how unkempt his hair so sprucely groomed in general how all in a base moment his age had betrayed him he started upon recognising me and gave a heavy sigh and rose as if to move but feeling his weakness sank down again with a forced laugh egad said he and ive drunk nothing you must come to the mountain mahomet as it cant come to you i took a chair by the desk and leaning forward looked at him earnestly lord skene i said low miss christmas has told me you meant her to i suppose he hesitated an instant then pushed an open letter towards me but in the act withdrew it one moment my boy he said there are things that the essentials are all youll need oblige me by reading only what i underline he was busy a little with a shaking hand then thrust the letter towards me once more there he said youre her son anyhow youll spare me any comments gaskett but such as bear strictly upon the question of her flight and its reasons i think it likely youll know more about those than i do there seems a coincidence damn it boy wasnt there some damned conscious raven croaking in you the other day when there read what ive underlined he turned his face away impatiently as i took his letter and read what he had marked i could have faced the horror of that exposure once could have braved it even as your wife charles you will forgive me i know your loving generosity so well but as the mother of your child i cannot face it my falsehood lies like a blight upon his little gentle life his sweet truth finds a stranger in his mother perhaps when i am gone by gods mercy he will recover and live to forget me when just now we were alone together and i whispered to him that i was going i am sure he stirred and gave a little sigh as if he were already conscious of something lifted some load passing from him oh charles how cruel though i have deserved it i think if you knew all my tears and penitence in the life i am about to seek that sin against the lamb do not distress yourself about me i shall be secure in the fold someday after my final abjuration of the world i will let you know make what terms you can and will with my betrayer for your own sake for the sake of our darling dear not for mine this cannot continue its way is madness there is no possible foreseeing a limit to his exactions or to my robbing you now knowing me fled he will be anxious perhaps to come to terms richard will tell you my shame is his but not the right to avenge it keep him with all the force of your persuasion from that horrible thought oh charles forgive me his eyes had sought me again restlessly as i read and now seeing me come to an end he rose quickly and tremulously and set to pacing up and down what the devil does it all mean gaskett we must stop her get her back somehow before its too late and the scandals out have you any idea where she can have gone give me time to think sir it is all very sad time time he protested irritably its just that we want to foreclose on while it passes she good god you dont think shell do herself any hurt do you i dont think so sir you have her word shes seeking some asylum from which she proposes writing to you by and by and you know the reason yes i think i may say im sure of it he stared at me where i had risen by the desk his usual scrupulous jauntiness was all slack and unstrung i noticed with concern that the bow of his shepherds plaid tie was twisted an inch out of its place he looked as if he had been out for many nights on end its all deuced odd he said at last what devils abroad in the house of late first you and your conundrums and now this perhaps youll be telling me theres some connection between the two yes i shall tell you that ah there is a very close connection sir as regards one person what person mr dalston the name obviously conveyed no meaning to him he only pondered me dumfoundered fingering his lips the man is an infernal scoundrel sir i said with emphasis i intimated as much to you once before what i did not could not touch upon at the time was the strange coincidence of his double connection with your family he was not only your sons travelling tutor sir but he is also by his own assertion and in lady skenes belief my father for a moment his mind grasping desperately at the significance of my words slipped and went under dalston he muttered amazed delane was charlies tutor delane or dalston sir it is all the same the man had his reasons for assuming a name not his own it was to cover over the tracks of a very discreditable liaison he had had with a young woman whom he had known when he was an usher at a school at clapham at clapham the word seemed to take him in the face go on he said presently with a sudden clinching intonation is it necessary sir you will comprehend me i think she deceived me about you yes anything more this man who calls himself my father has come to trade upon his knowledge of that deceit the old legal terrier was beginning to awake in him to prick its ears and show its teeth to trade i understand hush money eh he has had one large sum from her already i believe on my honour sir it was his demanding a second this morning that drove her to this step very likely very probable indeed he resumed his pacing again plunged into frowning thought i rejoiced to see this grasp this stiffening this recovery in him of an ancient forceful shrewdness presently he stopped do you guess where she is gone richard yes i guess sir where to mr pugsleys o now why for one thing he is her spiritual adviser for another he was aware of her deceit from the first and could even reconcile his condonation of it with his evangelical conscience in the view of that sir i understand the fraud was not only harmless but praiseworthy in consideration of its object in reclaiming a brand from the burning meaning me for the first time a faint smile twitched his lips you seem to have interested yourself successfully in your family history gaskett yes i have sir and to more purpose than this even wait a bit if your surmise is correct it would be useless to attempt to persuade her back until this man has been dealt with i think you would be most unwise to attempt it i quite agree with you we must buy him out first buy him out sir a cur like that stone him out dont you mean he was smilingly tolerant of me his manner had become almost in a moment quite confident and reassured i had guessed already that the deception per se would count for little with him but i was not prepared for his cool reception of its consequences tut tut my boy he said if you had had my experience you would know that compromise is nine parts of the law and a rope the tenth sir is it not well you may play your nine parts for me only i for what remains am going to hang mr dalston the colour left his face his new sprightliness was all gone in a moment he returned to the desk and seated himself somewhat in his old tired attitude well richard he said what else emotion rose in me i lingered on the blow i had to deal but it must out at last i made a point sir if you observed of referring to him as calling himself my father i noticed he is not your father then only the vile deputy of another no more my father sir i do believe than lady skene is my mother i was born of quite other parentage he held his eyes shaded with one hand the shaking fingers of the other affected to toy with a pen go on he muttered why do you stop without pause or hesitation then i gave him the full history of my inquisition from the utterance of the first word which had launched me on it to my final interview with his wife and at the end lord skene i said judge all this as you will there is still the worst to come the corner stone to such a monument of villainy as i never dreamed of unveiling when i started i beg sir with all the passion of entreaty i can command that you will brace yourself to hear a very dreadful truth i told you on that former occasion that i had come by accident upon part of a letter written by your son to mr thesiger here it is i laid the faded sheet before him he read it through once twice three times and looked up at me with a lost expression well he whispered hoarsely it is your sons sir yes it is from charlie the reference in it sir the you know who yes well is to mrs dalston i cannot doubt he was married to her first who charlie yes and because of it o sir for all it means to you compose yourself to meet the blow because of it was done to death by the man who is now mrs dalstons husband and your own wifes damned betrayer his head sank low i thought for all my warning i had risked too much but in a moment he lifted it again and the expression on it stern white self repressed was such i imagined as might have marked its character when in past days he would rise black capped to sentence a prisoner to the last awful penalty on what authority he began in a quick loud voice which sank even upon its utterance on what authority and the words died out in a whisper on the authority sir i said of a man who was in hiding near by at the time the crime was committed and who sought afterwards on the strength of his secret to bleed the murderers pocket as the murderer has since on another count sought to bleed your wifes but he proved himself no match against a desperate villains resourcefulness and was caught in the net of his own spreading and put away for years on a trumped up charge you will find his name there geoletti lord skene looked up at me and laughed a painful twisted unnatural cachinnation i had observed it already richard i sentenced the man myself good god he buried his face in his hands as if overwhelmed and indeed the coincidence was staggering is that so sir i said in a strained dry voice well it only remains to say that he has served his sentence to the hilt and has emerged from it with one only purpose remaining to his ruined life revenge on the author of his sufferings i felt the question coming from him and forestalled it how i know this the man had tracked his quarry home and i came upon him quite by chance foundered by the way but when he told me his name great god sir i remembered the letter your sons letter and then only a little questioning was needed to extract the whole accursed truth where is he he is waiting outside at this moment fetch him in i was moving to obey when he stopped me put down that light first i must hear and see and not be seen there would he know me i believe it is quite out of the question go then i stepped softly into the hall and beckoning to the italian motioned him into the room and shut the door geoletti i said i want you now clearly and briefly to relate the whole history of your connection with mr dalston from the first committal of the crime with which you charge him to the moment when through his wicked agency you were sentenced on a false charge to a long term of penal servitude you can trust me that the statement will help us all if you omit nothing and extenuate nothing he bowed his head gravely thereupon and crushing his hat nervously in his hands before him and moistening his dry lips entered upon his narrative as follows antonio geolettis story my name is antonio geoletti and i am a piedmontese twenty years ago i was by profession a guide of the val daosta there was none equal to me in knowledge of that district from the glacier di lys to the chain of mon iseran i knew it all every acre the valleys of pellina du butier dentreves veni de la tuile grisanche savera di cogne camporcier they were hackneyed to me one and all i could trace to its source every mountain torrent which poured from the high alps into the upper waters of the dora baltea the cravats of mon cervin doren de ferret were no less my familiars than were the passes de la seigne and of the great and little st bernards through which i would often conduct visitors bound adventurously for savoy my knowledge of the mountains was unique wonderful informed with secrets moreover hidden from all others it was the possession of one such secret alas which betrayed me to my ruin in the val dentreves are the village and baths of cormayeur there is also the hospice of st marguerite to which invalids resort thither in the spring of came two ladies miss lucie love a young english hritire and orphan and her only living relative madame gondran who was old and sick with eyes like the dying hawk and of a self will and passion quite ungovernable the young lady was the most beautiful in person and complexion for which reason it would appear and because of the many gifts of health and wealth which fortune had lavished upon its favourite her aunt could never expend enough upon her her heart of venom and detestation i think she would have liked to debar her for ever from all the profits of her estate of youth but such a flower so sweet and well bequeathed was not long to escape the marauding bee there arrived to aosta in these days two gentlemen making the tour a young english milord and his gouverneur of whom the names were respectively mr charles skene and mr delane these two then exploring among the mountains came very shortly across miss lucie and straightway the die was cast milord would hear of nothing but that they transfer at once their quarters to cormayeur and so there they went and remained for six months and more in this interval what now has come to pass you shall hear as i heard partly of gossip partly of acquaintances employed in the hospice partly of my own ears for the gentlemen engaged me constantly to convey them into the places of interest about the neighbourhood this then had happened milord and miss lucie were become inseparable lovers and desirous of the plighted troth but madame gondran she would not hear of it she was all engaged herself to the seductiveness of the gouverneur and for the chief reason that the young lady feared and disliked him in the exact opposite proportion was determined to sanction him for her nominee to the covetable hand of miss he this mr delane was of a surety very pleasing and attentive with her and the young man his pupil not at all but like a boy arrogant and inconsiderate milord no doubt lacked the experience to know that the diplomacy of wooing is to propitiate the guardian before the ward it is well also to warm a womans vanity if you would see her melt to you so things went on until presently a soft gossip began to make itself heard with turnings of the head and nudgings and a pointing of the finger there were whispers of a fondness betrayed and of love beginning to reveal in itself the penalty of rashness one was wondering how the truth could still hide itself from the eyes of the terrible invalid when suddenly a startling calamity befell milord disappeared and was never heard of again now i quote what follows from the testimony of the hospice walls which were alway as full of ears and eyes as a honeycomb it deals with the period before investigation had established the pretty moral certitude that milord had met with some fatal accident on the mountains and when he was still supposed in the popular view to have slipped away merely from the consequences of an intrigue the young madame it appeared quite incredulous at the outset was driven presently by her aunt and the gouverneur into the conviction that she had been ruined and deserted by a scoundrel in the first of her desperation indeed eager to vindicate both herself and her lover she declared that they were husband and wife that in short on a certain remembered day when they had all joined in an expedition to aosta he and she had eluded the others for a time and by prearrangement had been married before some civil functionary who had afterwards certified to the fact in a document preserved she believed by mr skene well if this confession was so unpalatable to the listeners as to add a hundredfold to madame gondrans jealousy and hatred it afforded at the same time a text for ample revenge the match was no match they declared in english law miss lucie was none the less for it betrayed and abandoned her seducer of course had only caught her into a very ancient snare and having tangled her in its meshes had gone off laughing indeed it would appear he had hinted as much to mr delane before running away and by that shameless boast had caused a rupture between himself and his tutor he was gone anyhow and finally never to return and utter ruin and disgrace were all that remained to the poor lady out of that short rhapsody of passion unless unless what why grieved and shame stricken though he was over this downfall of a cherished idol the gouverneur still great and magnanimous in his love would consent to save her reputation at the cost of his own shattered ideals by marrying her himself at a moments notice and afterwards removing her to a place where gossip could find no data for detraction they may have lied or spoken the truth i know not but this i know she was wax in their powerful hands a poor dazed heartbroken will less creature they took her to turin we heard and there the man married her and there on the very morrow of the wedding the old witch gondran was found dead in her bed struck down in the moment of triumph by the ecstasy of her spite she lies in the cimitero on the chivasso road i have seen the blasted flowers on her grave but now all this time i was thinking what to do and all the time i was still thinking and thinking when the suspicion first arose that milord instead of having taken himself off as supposed had really in some adventurous wandering come by his death in the mountains since indeed he had never been seen to emerge from among them at any part and suddenly there came over from england a lady his relative to inquire into his disappearance and mr delane was questioned and told all he knew confessing he had thought milord had bolted to evade the consequences of a scrape best not referred to then one day i went to learn more of what was doing and found the inquestation over and mr delane gone home to england with his wife and again that set me to thinking more and again more for now i will tell you i wanted money for a purpose and i thought i had seen the way to procure it i was always one that lived strong and wastefully burning the candle of toil or pleasure at both ends with a selfsame zest the silent white tents of the mountains or the roaring booths of the fair they could possess for me an equal madness of attraction for all my activity i had seldom anything but empty pockets and so once it came in upon me how easeful a new sensation it would be to marry and take perhaps an auberge and rest and ripen on the rich vintage of my experience only where to find the capital yes that was it that might always have been the difficulty had i not once become possessed of a secret which it was surely within a certain persons interest to pay me not to reveal that secret then was my potential what was it what was this tremendous secret it is uttered in a breath i knew i had known from the first that milord had never run away but that he had been murdered and his body hidden in a subterranean chamber by the man who professed to be his friend and admonitor i will explain high above cormayeur among the waste and desolation of the hills there pours itself down a torrent which is called lapluietonnante the rain of thunder once and more this torrent entering through rocky ravines plunges like a mad and foaming horse until at length too blind with terror to note where it is going it leaps from a precipice and crashes in a ruin of watery splinters on the rocks a score of yards below now at the very point where the water springs from the gorge there is a certain fissure in the wall of rock not easily observable amongst others but which having once discovered and entered one will find leads down by a fantastic passage into a chamber or grotto situated right behind the fall and opening on to it here was a secret of knowledge i thought my own exclusive property until milord came to disabuse my mind he did not confess his discovery to me but i gathered from what he let fall that his daring spirit had penetrated to the arcanum which heretofore had been my solitary possession i could show you geoletti said he once a cavern in the water that would be worth a little fortune to you in tips if you knew it but im going to keep it to myself till i go and then perhaps ill let out i smiled to him confessing nothing but from that moment i was always on the watch to see if my suspicion were correct there was a second fissure immediately above the other but shallow and with a projection of rock within it apt for cover and there when i knew milord to be abroad in the neighbourhood i would often hide myself and spy to see him come and once at last he came and the gouverneur with him they stopped beside the rock and talked before they entered it was then the time when scandal came to whisper of a young maids condition that subject was on their lips its done and theres an end of it said milord in a heat i tell you ive married her mr mark dalston why do you call me by that name asked the gouverneur he was very quiet and smiling and he showed his white teeth always because its your real one isnt it said milord and because i want to convince you that mine isnt the only secret here that might lead to disturbances if revealed i stand to take the consequences of my deeds mr dalston whatever you may do have you then said the gouverneur written to confess to your father no but im going to answered milord it cant be delayed much longer only ill do it in my own time and way and stand no dictating from anybody then he seemed to soften a little hang it delane he said im sorry if you are sweet on the girl yourself but one could never tell from your manner youre such a deep chap am i said the gouverneur and he laughed but you have beaten us all in depth skene well as you remark the things done and theres no more to be said about it for the moment now show me the way into this wonderful cave youve discovered they passed in one after the other milord going first and he never came out again only presently there jumped from the opening on to the grass a man very white but smiling still who flicked the dust from his clothes and sat down on a rock looking into the curve of the fall as if his eyes were needles to pierce it and suddenly he came to his feet my god lucie he said to the water how i love you my god how i love you and with that he turned and went away and presently i too went down into the cave he had shot him with a pistol from the back he lay on his face and his head was like a trampled bush near the body flung from it in its fall was a little tin case such as they make for sandwiches and in it i found when i could force the nerve to look the certificate of milords marriage with miss lucie i put it back i touched nothing more like a murderer myself i stole away and left everything as i had found it from that day to this the cave shall have held its secret undiscovered there still the body must be lying as when it fell never to stir again you know the rest i knew it from his own lips how a few months after the married couple had returned to england an italian courier discharged in aosta for drunkenness had persuaded geoletti to profit by his knowledge of london and go there with him how from soho the potential blackmailer had taken his bearings and by the aid of compatriots run his quarry to earth and forced an interview upon him and revealed his knowledge and his purpose how mr dalston temporising a moment had referred him for final settlement to the house of a certain doctor in kennington to which he had gone by secret appointment and with what fatal results to himself the listener needed only these links in the chain of evidence to complete the story for him and when they had been supplied a deep and tragic silence fell upon the room presently not raising his head he motioned to the narrator a gesture of dismissal go i whispered to geoletti and return to the lodge i stood when we were alone a moment in indecision then crossed the room softly if the hurt has come from my hand sir i said you will know why i ask you to forgive me for it will you not he was muttering to himself he hardly seemed to notice me my god poor charlie my god poor charlie over and over again suddenly he got stiffly to his feet hush didnt i hear the boy crying he said listening in a startled way hes left to me yet he shant be disinherited his mother must come back to me and end all this there was never a woman so beautiful or so foolish in all the world he seemed to recollect himself and me and my question and now he answered that obliquely not looking at me but fingering some papers on his desk you know your course gaskett its obvious enough i should think the formal address the reluctance of his manner woke a strange chill in me i think so sir i said withdrawing a little it is to visit lady skenes mother again and face her with a new and sufficient reason for confessing the truth he drew in his breath softly as if to a wince of pain then turned to canvass me fully for the first time well he said you have hit me pretty hard in my old age gaskett and youll not be surprised that i find your hand a bit stunning you must grant me to night to think it all over and to morrow ill give you my answer come up at midday the mans safe with you i suppose thats all that its essential to ensure for the moment i shall not come in to dinner good night the blows to which he had been subjected had tried him no doubt to the very limit of endurance yet somehow this was not the sequel to them that i had expected my heart was like a stone in me i turned and went out of the room without another word and then sweet balm in gilead she was waiting for me flitting like a ghost moth about the dark old panels of the room from which she had dismissed me a little while ago she put her finger to her lips and hushed me in and shut the door she had dressed for dinner during the interval of my absence and was a lovelier more fairy like apparition by twenty degrees i felt like taking a dream into my arms the sweet soft fragrance of her hair and lifted face and young white innocent bosom a thread of diamonds dewed her neck she melted to me like a very dew of girlhood and loved and clung to me and whispered impassioned that i was hers she could not spare me to another and i might claim her when i would and she would come to me her love her rapture her absorbing sympathy were inexpressibly touching to me in my moody distress let all the world go by so long as this dear flower of it sweetened on my heart ira i whispered fondling her in an ecstasy i believe i know where your aunt has gone o richard she answered that is heavenly am i to know no more wait a little you lovely thing i may want you all before long i am very much alone perhaps ira will you meet me to morrow under the old hawthorn yes richard anywhere and at any time you tell me say at three oclock shall i make a note of it richard ill do it for you look on the inside of your elbow now bend your arm and keep it hidden from everybody chapter xxiv i accept the burden of proof henceforth the chase runs on swift and relentless and i give myself with a fierce joy to lead it over rocks and wounding briars since it will drive me where by justice i should follow hounded and harassed of all the world save in the instance of its two dear loyalest hearts i turn at bay at length and fight the bitter quarrel to an end then though i lose my persecutors shall bear for ever the marks of that affray while i while i am healing of my wounds in avalon when all is done mine i think shall be the sweeter solace all that morning following the interview i waited in a conflict of emotions for the hour of my appointment with lord skene i would not doubt its upshot and yet i doubted it seemed incredible that i could have come so far to win so little was he so obsessed so infatuated a spouse that all other interests were subordinated in his mind to the one passion of uxoriousness i believe indeed that that was the case so he only might recover his beautiful partner all less importunate pleas for restitution were as the silence of the dead to him he would subscribe to any conditions would do or leave undone whatever appeared to speed him to that amorous conclusion and what about the dead alas a yearning for their reincarnation is always i fear the most artificial of sentiments a re embodied spirit would be the last to find a welcome in his old place his effect upon the laws of property would be so destructive would it not his claims on our maturer sympathies such an anachronism and a bore jerusalem i think must have been deeply relieved when its wandering dead lay down again now i was in the very act of starting for the house when i saw the figure of his lordship himself coming briskly over the snow towards me and from the direction of the road i paused in some astonishment to await him already i think a premonition of the truth was foreclosing on me there was an indescribable air of elation in his face pink with exercise and in his sprightly step and the almost imperceptible cock of his hat could this be the collapsed and stricken soul from whom i had parted not so many hours ago a sort of desperate effrontery seized me you have come from market grazing sir i said as he reached me well that was against my advice the roses in his cheeks deepened i could have thought to damask but he was full of good humour and would not be put out of it pooh he said with a little embarrassed laugh and taking my arm walked me slowly up the path through the woods you have established a claim to some licence gaskett but you must remember that advice is not prescription i am glad at least you admit the claim sir it would appear a more gracious admission perhaps if you were to address me less formally he turned to look at me with an odd expression of challenge or it might be propitiation well as to that he said i have something to say in the meantime i am to congratulate you and myself on the correctness of your surmise she was there at pugsleys yes well sir i have full hopes the matter may be accommodated hushed up it comes to be merely a question of the figure good god sir we stopped simultaneously falling apart for a moment a silence fell between us the colour had left his face a little but his mouth was set in a line of resolution defiance even do you mean to tell me sir i said in a low voice that what you are implying is a money compromise with mr dalston yes that is exactly it he answered shortly i drew and expelled a deep breath it was to be battle then my rights against a sentiment lord skene i said clearly do you understand what this decision means to me have you drawn any real inference from the facts i have put before you hush my boy hush he said pacifically i have reached a point certainly as you have beyond which all is speculation and surmise as yet yes why test it further it is an incredible enough tale as it stands i have listened to many less improbable in my time and found them one and all to crumble under the weight of evidence what chief witness remains to this why one who has never spoken the truth in her life but whose reputation on the other hand would involve in its exposure the very soul of truth i must ask you to bear in mind richard that this wretched woman is still my wifes mother i bear it in mind sir as i do also bear in mind and most firmly believe that she helped mr dalston who had made me fatherless to make me motherless also he remained silent a little seeming to struggle for expression well he said at last it may be conceded as a plausible theory at least but what if after all so dark and fantastic a tale failed of itself before the test of daylight you would hardly have bettered your position in that case richard but let it stand at the point where it has arrived and i for my part am willing to accept it on its merits in which case sir in which case i should admit the moral of your more intimate claim on my regard both sentimental and practical you would not do you not mean acknowledge me as a grandson but you would undertake that i received the provision of one yes distinctly that is what i mean you are no niggard sir i see in your bids for silence had not i and mr dalston better make a common purse of it and set up trade together as murderers and blackmailers he drew back instantly you have your choice of refusing he said coldly and i refuse i answered with a most bitter scorn i am no esau sir though fate has made me a hunter throw dust in your own eyes if you will for me i do not stop nor rest until i have probed this matter to an end have no fear for lady skene believing what i believe the humiliation of your family is the thing farthest from my thoughts it will not suffer i think from the vindication of the truth he listened to my outburst with an expression which lightened from gloom to a certain wonder well he said well if you are prepared to take the consequences of failure from you i cried i moved a step nearer to him lord skene i said will you please to look at me is there a likeness or is there not have not you yourself been strangely conscious of it more than once did not sir maurice carnac call me by his name he bit his lip o i daresay charlie was no joseph he said o i answered much enlightened i beg your pardon very blind of me to be sure i may be a bastard none the less you mean well it is in the reckoning but for all your assumption sir you seem to dread the test more than i do well frankly i think i do he said truth you see is often a confoundedly unwelcome sort of visitor like a poor relation very upsetting to the conveniences i notice by the way her names pretty familiar on your tongue do you hold it compatible with your very strict worship of her to suborn a young lady under the nose of her guardian if i had startled him he had retorted effectually he sniggered a little though with an aggravated sound witnessing my astonishment but i at least was in no mood for compromises miss christmas has engaged herself to me i said shortly he gave a soft whistle raising his eyebrows indeed he said drily then he looked at me searchingly she is not of age it is in my power of course you know to refuse my consent there was a significance in his tone that i could not misunderstand not even for that bribe sir i said if needs must be ill win to both name and wife without your help his cheek went like fire he turned without a word and strode off a few paces but suddenly wheeled and came back that was infernally insulting he exclaimed what did you mean to imply by it i am very untutored sir i answered in a tone of mock humility and i beg your pardon i thought you were offering me a wife to keep me quiet but of course the prospect of honouring her through a successful vindication of the truth is my chief stimulus to action you could have no objection to the match in the event of my triumphing i am sure he turned again resolutely go your damned way he said only favour me by being quick about it youll understand of course that so long as you are pursuing it pig headed my hands are tied from that weak and evil compromise he meant trust me sir i said not to linger out the agony and trust me once again to hold the honour of your family sacred through everything a cock and bull story he muttered fuming and without another look at me took the path to the house i stood a little watching his retreat what form of possession was this which could so cloud yes and pollute the very spring of justice had his jurisdiction always been at the mercy of his senses it was not the least of the anomaly perhaps that he should have been of that order of judge which visits a certain sort of offence with the full weight of the law betraying possibly in its sentences on others the measure of its own self condemnation there he might perhaps have said in dooming geoletti but for the mercy of god goes charles skene but maybe i myself was judging him hardly he had a wider experience than i of the criminal geniuss infinite capacity for deception no doubt the italians story had really left him incredulous but whatever the premises the conclusion was manifest i must be satisfied henceforth to play my part independent of him he would not interfere i gathered but he would not help so be it the burden of the proof should be appropriated to my sole shoulders from that moment the end found me curiously exalted i felt as if i were breathing a fuller more intoxicating air it was to be ira and i at last each for the other against all the world that seemed to simplify the issues to make my task a less complicated one ira and i foot to foot side to side to run the race together and win if we might or if we lost to sink no less breathless to our reward in the grass by the roadside i pictured it thus i could believe in my dear love still thank god the mood had not left me when i came down over the snow to the old hawthorn in hags lane and found her there awaiting me i took her worshipfully into my arms as befitted a fragile figure of such price ira i said would you like to have me tell you everything at last o richard will you wait a minute let me feel your bones these ribs are like a rabbits i doubt if they could stand such a hammering try them richard have you never read maud dont you remember the shell that a finger nail could break but that the cataract shock of the seas could not only an unloving word from you could break me richard you ineffable dear i like to hear you quote like that i like to see you capable of thinking of anything again but ghosts and shadows let us get the last of them out of the way shall we and prepare for the time when there shall never be a secret left between us o yes yes if you please my lord my lord you pythoness do you know what a prophetic word you have used how can i know anything when you have told me nothing it is so difficult to begin ira and there are things such essential things which i am wondering how i can put without offence to my innocent love i dont know how i shall do it unless unless you can imagine yourself to be my wife in actual earnest do you think you can perhaps richard if i shut my eyes very tight yes shut them that is the way and a seal on each now they cant open till i break the seal you are quite blind ira and you must trust yourself to me i am going to lead you through gloom and wicked places dreadful ghastly places but you mustnt mind nothing shall hurt you now are you holding me tight yes richard cant you feel me what do you think ira may i open my eyes yes but wait a minute there shall i be the honourable mrs skene richard so you have jumped to that conclusion i did not know if you would see it what wits women have dont cry so my pretty bird how can i help it such a horrible horrible story and the poor body lying there still hardly your own age richard this man it makes me ill to think i have spoken to him touched him in passing perhaps what are you going to do what does that matter to you cry baby i thought we were married richard make me shut my eyes again no keep them open you put me in such an ecstasy what ought i to do i dont think you ought to do anything it is uncle charlies business well he just wants to pay the man to go away and hold his tongue and because i dont see it in that light has rather quarrelled with me it is infamous why should you be expected to incur any risk or danger richard dont dare this dreadful man on your own account o dont richard i will be very careful shall i tell you what i had thought of doing what going straight to johnny dando and getting him to help me mr dando richard how could that funny little creature help you funny dont you know that he is enormously rich what difference does that make his gilding only seems to show up his roundness like one of grandpapas pills dont talk of pills miss to a scion of the skene family i am very sorry you have the curative principle in you you little duck of a quack perhaps you have inherited it i was very bad till i took you would you like a testimonial dear but seriously there is no calculating what this business may cost me and my savings dont amount to much richard now i know what youre going to say i will steal your heart ira i will rob your lips like a greedy boy in an orchard i will thieve every bit of you else but your money i wont take think if i touched it in what a light it would seem to show me no johnny put his wealth at my disposal once and then i refused but things have altered since what was a speculation then seems now a fairly promising investment theres only one objection what is it dear why it would mean his helping me to you why is that an objection cant you guess no indeed i cant he loves you too ira nonsense richard he does really and truly then if he does hell want to make me happy o the poignant lovely inhumanity of women will he i said well to do him justice i believe he would but supposing it were the other way about and i was the rich one and you and he were engaged and he wanted my help then it would be very unwise of him to ask it for i should fall in love with you of course and now i suppose if he helps me youll fall in love with him o richard how absurd you are cant you see dear and they call women illogical never mind about that ira youre a very much abused sex by all who dont know you well you think im justified in going to johnny yes indeed i think now perhaps it might be the very best thing you could do im sure hed take care of you for my sake only only what ira she put her young arms about my neck tearfully entreatingly must you take this man with you richard geoletti do you mean how is he so much better than the other to know of that dreadful thing and keep it secret just for his own profit he was educated to another code of morals than ours ira its no good thinking of the gulf between us but you must see that his company is indispensable to me i suppose i must will you be gone for long i cant say but i will write to you every day and twice a day if you like will you will you really i shall be miserable until you are safe home again richard she held me closer there is one thing yet which i havent dared to speak about mrs dalston with a womans sensitive intuition she had found and touched in sympathy the real most poignant nerve of this complex tragedy the point had not even occurred to lord skene i understand what you mean dearest i said softly if all surmise is justified i am hounding to his doom the husband of my mother and she would wish it so you believe i am bound to believe it o richard is it not the most tragic thing of all that you should have wasted all your poor heart of love in pleading to a mother that was no mother to you and when the real one came that you should have turned from her like a stranger it is the most tragic thing ira and the worst that i cannot bring myself even now to look upon her as anything but mrs dalston she sighed it is all a dreadful tangle i wish it were unravelled and done with i am going to unravel it for better or worse and if for worse ira she kissed me of her own sweet will in a passion of tears i dont care about a name richard i dont want to be lady skene you could never be more to me than you are if you will only come back to me the same as you are now my heart will have room for not one other joy chapter xxv johnny at home away with wooers gallivanting and all the soft and sugary stuff of dreams a sterner wind than zephyr speeds me on my way and lands me hard of purpose in the midst of london and blows me with a crack up against johnnys door he is established for the time being with his mother in a luxurious flat in victoria street and the round red glass stove in his hall is not more glowing with a warmth of welcome than is the face with which he greets me i say dick he says presently who spoke of fairies not i johnny didnt you i say hows miss christmas dick she is very well johnny she and i are engaged to be married i would not appeal to his generosity of that i had been determined through any shadow of misunderstanding he bore the blow like a briton a little huskily with a little affectation in the first of the shock of bending down to tie his shoe o he said rising apoplectic and with a quivering lip im sure i give you joy old boy i could never quite believe you know in your indifference who could with such a prize before him its all in the right order of things you know like like the honi soit and quis separabit and the rest of them i hope lord skene approves not he then hes no gentleman hes no fool perhaps johnny ive come primed with an enormous budget of news to explode on you explode away then whether it was the sobering effect of my first astounding stroke or the absence of emotional distractions i dont know but he received my story from beginning to end this time with a grasp and understanding that were positively pathetic ill tell you he said when i had reached a finish you must come with me to morrow and see shapter hes our family solicitor and as sharp as flints this things got beyond the private and personal note dont you agree with me im afraid i must johnny now look here dicky youre giving me my first chance at what i have always pined for and never had the luck nor the figure to get a personal part in a real picturesque mystery and murder romance im not going to be excused out of it nor forbidden to engineer it as lavish as i please its the great opportunity of my life and i shall take it unkind if you refuse me a free hand to work it youre not to have a share at all in the financing of the venture you understand that if i allowed you one it would rub all the gilt off my own make believe i understood him and his fine delicacy this was his way of assuring me the practical help which i could not but need put it as you like johnny i said youre a dear good fellow every way very well he answered thats understood shapter will stage manage the thing and all weve got to do is to dress up and play our parts like professionals my eye i hope theres a coronet among the properties you see its got to the point when in my opinion a reputable independent witness is not only wanted but indispensable you cant run this any longer on your own responsibility you might get into no end of scrapes and as to me why i havent shown any particlar gift for doing the detective have i you betray a tendency perhaps johnny to jump too hastily to conclusions ah you may go into fits if you like i had my turn of em with drysalter my word he was a pepper castor i say dick yes johnny youre quite sure you and miss christmas are engaged perfectly certain johnny you aint by chance thinking of anybody else similar sort of name are you no theres no mistake about it ah he pondered a little sombrely did she know you were coming here to see me he asked presently yes i told her perhaps you would like to know what she remarked upon it shouldnt i she said im sure for my sake richard hell take care of you did she say that dick did she her very words old fellow by george tell her ill never let you out of my sight until its to give you back to her he got up in some emotion and walked to the window if in all that hurrying panorama beneath his eyes that endless procession of shapes and shadows all set on overtaking and outstripping one another in the race for wealth there was moving onward one only other soul as disinterestedly intent as he on a brothers welfare the old dark city i am sure might yet boast of the seed of promise in its veins i dined at the flat that evening i was not introduced to johnnys mamma until having entered the banqueting hall my attention was called to an extraordinary old lady seated already at the head of the table in a wheel chair in the nature of a portable throne she was enormously squat and fat like a loaf and her head i fear bore no more testimony to the efficacy of grafto than had the late lamented analysts the pile on it nominally golden but of a hue that never was on sea or land was so glaringly even so loosely adjusted that if she had turned a great birds nest upside down on her head the deception could not have been more flagrant its size and precariousness so engrossed my attention that once when a blundering footman knocked it crooked with a plate and she said placidly you nearly upset my hair richard i felt as if the rebuke were personal to myself and blushed over the involuntary movement i had made to catch it before it fell into the soup the man put it straight like a dish cover without his mistress or himself or anybody else exhibiting the least disturbance and then i comprehended upon what purely undissembling terms the article stood and felt that one could no more quarrel with it on the score of mendacity than with a bonnet i have never seen a mass of woman so complacent and imperturbable she sat basking in speechless comfort and only emitted at intervals and at large rich oracular remarks about the food these might be understood to owe their provocation either to the nice constitution of some particular dish or dishes or to ones unappreciative attitude towards such in their passing thus the dictum the leg of a pheasant and the wing of a grouse pronounced significantly during the game course may have been interpretable into a general proposition of fitness or a personal admonition there was no telling from the expression of the speaker because she was absolutely without any nor from the direction of her eyes which she could only move by moving her whole body with them a process much too laborious for the occasion i could never get rid however of an uncomfortable feeling that there was something in these utterances aimed aggressively at myself and my gastronomic perversity as when as if in correction of some spirit of contradictoriness observed in me she suddenly decreed fry bread crumbs in butter but sippets in dripping or appeared when i was in the very act of helping myself from a particular dish to throw an unfounded aspersion upon my age by asserting with finality crack no nuts at all if you cant crack em with your teeth her last remark but one occurred at dessert when she suddenly asseverated without looking at anything the late prince consort always ate his orange with a spoon a statement which caused me blushingly to lay down my knife and fork and finally having eaten a stupendous dinner with the large unimpassioned confidence of one who had never yet been mistaken in her digestion with the observation on her lips that the late duke of wellington used to remark that when its time to turn over its time to turn out she was wheeled from the room by the man called richard and disappeared from my ken for ever but johnny who by the way wore a white waistcoat with real turquoise buttons put my inward sniggering all to shame by his perfectly natural acceptance of this remarkable parent he was dutiful and attentive and always respectful in his attitude towards her unconscious of any reason indeed why she should figure as something slightly abnormal to alien eyes it had occurred to me irresistibly but abominably how ira would have regarded such a mother in law now hearing the good fellow expatiating on his mammas generosity and loving kindness i was ashamed of myself and joined warmly in the eulogium these two lived in the lap of wealth the whole flat was alive with gorgeous soft stepping flunkeys whose plush breeches took the doorways with beauty mrs dando herself for all her bulk had been caked with diamonds yet i believe the enormous residuum of that wealth when the price of its ostentation was deducted was devoted almost exclusively to good works which of us humbler endowed could make the same boast relatively certainly i had no reason to criticise a display whose moral as it affected me alone was all of a delicate helpfulness and generosity johnny and i sat up pretty late together discussing my affairs and when i left my friend to return to the modest quarters where i had left geoletti awaiting me it was only to breach by a little interval of sleep the business on whose full tide his wealth and help and devotion were to launch me at eleven oclock on the following morning i went to my appointment accompanied by the italian mr shapters offices were in lincolns inn fields and it gave me my first real inkling perhaps of the worldly consequence of my little half condescended to old schoolfellow when i observed with what deference and with what disregard of the prior claims of lesser waiting clients he was ushered into the great mans presence i am not going to detail the processes of the interview which followed it would be merely to retread well trodden ground my story and geolettis were heard and balanced and compared and the right inferences drawn from them with an insight and acumen which gave me a high opinion of the qualities upon which great legal reputations are based the conclusion is the essential thing and that is related in a line it was to be mother carey first and after her aosta and lapluietonnante chapter xxvi i revisit mother carey the last of the snow was gurgling itself away into the black drain traps and the face of the town was smeared like a sweeps under a dreary drizzle when mr shapter and i and a certain hard faced gentleman with a habit of rubbing his jaw grittily under reflection came down to the grimy little tenement in old paradise street at the door the hard faced gentleman motioning us to one side and bending to the keyhole gave a call like an itinerant potmans the commendable ruse proving successful brought after the briefest interview an old remembered step shuffling along the passage the key turned and the chain ran gratingly and following the unbaring a filthy claw grasping a jug was protruded through the aperture revealed quick and soft as the swoop of an owl the hard faced mans fingers closed on the boney wrist and the jug dropped to the pavement with a crash and straightway like a hooked fishs the nose and flexuous mouth of old mother carey came wobbling and gasping to the light of day the screech of fear and fury which she struggled on the instant to omit sticking in her throat the detective took quick advantage of that momentary paralysis come along now he said im the law do you understand and youre wanted on a charge of murder youd best let me in and hear what ive got to say as with the jug on one side of the door so on the other down went mother carey she tumbled in a heap rending away from the clutch on her wrist and appeared to lie in the hall moaning very swiftly and neatly then using a tool he had taken from his pocket the detective nearly closing the door first ran the chain along its socket within and made himself master of the filthy stronghold once entered he beckoned to us and stooping to the collapsed figure a moment rose to his height again all right gentlemen he said shes all right shut that door please now my good people this to the inevitable congregation gathering outside this aint an inquest you know come clear away clear away he stepped across the whispering bundle on the boards drew us in and closed the door on the little breathless group of faces now he said if youll please to go and make a light somewheres will you sir so as we can see ourselves speak better take the back for privacy we went as directed and found a reasty little kitchen black with grease and soot its walls flaking its floor vermin riddled its long cold grate one refuse bin of garbage there was a tattered curtain pinned across the window and this we unfastened to let in the daylight it seemed to awaken immemorial odours in its entrance the squalor of the place took on a festering sickness hardly had we pulled the rag from its string when the detective came bearing in his capture professionalwise he did not actually carry the old woman but he lifted her before him at a sort of helpless run i was glad to see at least that she had recovered her nerves of motion as i had feared that her downfall might have signified a stroke of some sort he flopped her unceremoniously into a chair where she sat rocking and weeping and mumbling and swaying her head and hands up and down like a japanese tortoise but for all her apparent collapse i had a shrewd idea that her eyes were not failing to take stock of me and that her mind was busy over that association of ideas which my return in company with the law could not have failed to suggest she kept up her mechanical moaning i thought simply to gain time now maam said the detective suavely when youre quite recovered her moans rose the windier at that but presently with scraps of articulation threading them o good sir the deuce o my heart and lungs the shock of it good sir wouldnt hurt a fly the devil take it o what a libel and slander on poor old mother carey the deuce jannaway said mr shapter we cant undertake to breathe this atmosphere indefinitely youd better call a cab and remove this woman very well sir the suggestion wrought its desired effect mother carey became all in a moment distinct to tearfulness o good gentlemen what is it you want of me o that i should have lived to hear my deuced self accused of the devil and all is it anything about this young gentleman o ill tell you the truth i will thatll do then said the detective it wont serve you the worse perhaps in the long run youre pretty deep involved you know old lady but mayhap theres another deeper yet dont be saying now you was never in collusion with mr dalston because i know better were coming to him in good time but just for the present the question stands with you do you understand what i mean a linking of you and him together of course you do a woman of your cleverness well look at this young gentleman have you seen him afore she whispered something huddled into herself what more than once perhaps said mr jannaway right you are i do believe it was him wasnt it now you played the dutiful grandmother to once upon a time and ended by palming off on your daughter as her own very particlar offspring that was a cute move upon my word and it paid you didnt it paid you nigh as well as mr dalston did for putting that other out of the way she uttered a thin screech and sank upon her quaking ignoble old knees i didnt do it good gentlemen she cried before god and the deuce of my poor lungs i didnt o ive always been expecting something of this sort to be charged to me ever since him there came prying in with his rakings up and smellings out of old deuces i never put anything out of the way i didnt my georgies baby was dead already when dalston brought the other ask the devil of a doctor if you dont believe me ah the detective shot a significant glance at mr shapter dead was it the fruits of the little mistake as your daughter had made with mr dalston eh it was that drove me to send a message to him cried the miserable old woman i told him he neednt expect on that account to escape the consequences of his deuced deed but that id prove it against him and ruin him with his fine new lady none the less if he didnt come to terms exactly and he answered he answered o the devil by turning up with a live baby as his fine lady had borne to another and by proposing to exchange it for the dead one shed never know he said and georgie would never know neither as they was both the two of them lying light headed from their confinements it was true of my daughter anyhow and when she came to herself at last she never thought but to accept the other ones baby for her own though to be sure as things turned out she never could abide it he told me for his part that hed no mind as the child of another should come to inherit his ladys money and so we agreed to make the exchange and he paid me to keep the secret and that is the devil and all of the truth so god burst my lungs if it isnt and bad enough old lady it couldnt be much worse to my mind short of murder i never killed nothing she moaned i wouldnt put my hand to such a wickedness youll have to put it to a document attesting all this though said the detective if you want to save your bacon ill do it sir she said ill do it on the deuce of my honour if youll only promise not to let him get at me mr shapter standing with me in the background caught and pressed my hand congratulatory and then stepped forward come jannaway he said paper and ink well clinch this matter while we are about it it was what i had half expected half foreseen but the assurance of its actuality found me stunned from speech i could only look on and listen in a sort of stupor while the lawyer wrote and finished and read out what he had written the evidence circumstantial if you like to my parentage they had to support the old woman between them while she put her trembling signature to the statement and when they released her she sank moaning once more to the floor dont tell him i done it good deuced gentlemen dont set him on to me now look here old lady said the detective if what were aiming at doing comes to pass he wont be in a position to be set on to anything but a galley bench all youve got to do is to lie quiet and hold your mouth until you hear from us again and then possibly i say possibly it may come to happen that you dont hear from us at all she looked up with a sudden relief of craft in her watery eyes and my little settlement as i draw from his lawyers the deuce bless you dears it wont be interfered with now say it wont dovies come jannaway said mr shapter sharply she gathered herself together hurriedly and got to her feet with a scrambling skip and followed us protesting and entreating all down the passage finally perceiving her prayers to be entirely disregarded she slammed the door upon us with a screaming oath outside the detective pondered me grating his chin well sir he said that settles it theres no rope for his neck here well have to be satisfied with what italy can give us in its place whatever that may be it must fall far short of his deserts said mr shapter a very pretty scoundrel on my honour well mr gaskett as i must still call you i suppose he took my arm and we all set off on our way back to his office so far i think we may say so excellently good whether italy will confirm our claim or fail of its evidence remains to be seen it would be a pity apart from our more personal interest if it did fail because any such conclusion must mean the escape of a scoundrel of a very choice pattern but we will hope for the best will it be necessary do you think to draw further upon lady skenes parent i hope not i think not family feelings must be respected at the same time it must depend very largely upon the attitude which lord skene shall elect to adopt well sir when is it to be italy and for which of us there must be a delay i think of a few days while scotland yard communicates with turin mr dando insists upon accompanying us so there will be for the venture he you i jannaway and your witness quite a little regiment i trust not a forlorn hope but it all turns upon the question of that marriage its proof and legitimacy a lot may come to perish in twenty years that may stand for a text out of the criminals vade mecum i daresay mr dalston nowadays is not troubled much with nightmare chapter xxvii correspondence i pause in the chase to jot down a note or two it is when the quarry lies close and the hounds are drawing cover and a little breathing space is mine for rest and sentiment a moment and we shall be on again on the day of our visit to mother carey i wrote to lord skene giving him the full particulars of that interview of the circumstances which had led to and of the conclusions to be drawn from it how he might choose to regard those conclusions whether in his former sceptical spirit or in one more accommodating could only now i said affect the temper of my resolution not its inexorableness he might make my purpose a dutiful or a rebellious one he could not turn me from it the inference to be drawn from that confession i insisted was too plain to be mistaken by any not wilfully blind and the friends who had taken up my cause for me were at least sufficiently convinced of its justice to be determined to spare no trouble nor expense in the effort to secure me its last essential confirmation i put the whole case to him in a frank unimpassioned and perfectly respectful manner but i expressed through all an insistence on my right to act independently in my own behalf should he still see fit to refuse me his countenance in the venture and with that i ended his answer when it came was courteous unconvinced entt he was obliged to me he said for my information regarding a certain unscrupulous transaction inasmuch as it furnished him with an effective retort upon the insolence of a scoundrel should that scoundrel ever have the effrontery to attempt a new move in what was virtually a lost game to him for the rest he had not changed in his opinion that it would be the best wisdom to let sleeping dogs lie and for me to reconsider his suggestion of a compromise lest aiming at all i lost all in the meantime he had to inform me that mr dalston aware somehow no doubt of a threatening turn in events had disappeared from the neighbourhood leaving his lady in sole possession of the lone farm and consequently that lady skene induced by circumstances and fortified by my revelation had been persuaded into reconsidering her resolve to renounce the world and was now in actual fact returned to her duties as wife and mother at evercreech which was after all the end of all ends so far as he was concerned i said to myself with a bitter laugh as i put the letter into the fire that i could quite believe it it was the end of all ends to him had always been and would always be and then i broke the seal of another letter which represented the end of all ends to me perhaps i was inconsistent in blaming him was i less infatuated myself i would have disputed fifty successions that seemed to bar me from that one peaceful possession she wanted me my love how she wanted me it was the first letter i had ever received from her a little sweet pleasance of her soul crossed with shadow and sunshine had i ever guessed she asked how love could fly by so much the greater speed than an express train that though she had herself seen me off from footover station she had been waiting on the platform at waterloo for two hours scheduled time when i had reached it and i had never even noticed her waiting and holding out her arms among the throng but had jumped into a hansom there she was wrong it was an omnibus and had sped away into the shadows leaving love forlorn should she ever find me again lord skene she told me had come to the sudden resolution to take his whole family up to town they were going to start in a day or two herself included and that had given her at first a wild thrill of joy but then she had remembered that london was farther than evercreech from the continent and her spirits had fallen again still it would be sweet to tread the stones or thereabouts which my feet had lately trodden she spoke of death how dreadful it was that love like all lesser things must die that four hands clinging at once had no greater hold on life than two but there i corrected her very confidently when i came to answer is not love the seed love the flower and love the flower love the seed what is death but the snake casting its skin the old autumn cloak falls off and there is spring underneath not a new spring ira but the same spring as always you and i as we are at this moment you and i as we shall be for ever our love shall ride on waves of day and night summer and winter joy and sorrow till it reach the shores which are timeless the shores which are unfruitful because all the ripe fruit of love is gathered there never to reproduce itself again but to enjoy henceforth all the raptures of itself without the penalties those were loves metaphysics they might not satisfy philosophers but they satisfied ira which was infinitely more to the point philosophy may endure the thought of death it is a sweeter wisdom i think to delight in it so sounds the view halloo and i am off again fresh from that little breathing space but one thought now troubles me troubles us all what has occurred if anything has occurred to send our quarry into hiding chapter xxviii on the scent clank and fury and scream by day and by night squibbing like a fallen unspent comet the length of france and leaving a shining trail as we go by flat grey pastures hardly billowing and little churches with unfamiliar belfries and rows of plumelike poplars that pass and come again and flicker and dazzle like tall palings endlessly repeated swooping at a perilous poise round the wine shop ends of hamlets seemingly strayed and stranded in the fields or grazing slow crawling carts of a strange build driven by stranger waggoners as if the railway track were but a track after all which we are wont to lose and take up and lose again rushing shrieking upon little blue smocked men or as often women who stand waving absurd flags at level crossings and only missing them it appears by the breadth of a wind shaving on again with a yell of baffled fury ripping periodically if we may judge by the sound a passage through match wood stations which fly into splinters about us and disregarding all warning signals of long white arms flung up so through a land infinitely strange and wonderful to me we go roaring southwards to our destiny a wild new experience to a woodland hermit marvellous by day weird beyond expression in the rushing dark what islander self contained in his little sphere might have guessed the wizard potency of that slender streak of water called the channel one takes it at a gulp and lo there is a world about one continents removed it seems from the life of ones knowledge a seventy times seven leagued boot is the little steamer into which one puts ones foot to reach at a step from dover to calais it is a longer stride by all the world than from dan to beersheba the red trousers of the soldiers on the pier strike the first colour note of dissonance they have walked with napoleon in egypt the blood mystery of the sphinx is in their hue and when night at last veils the scene from ones aching eyes and the shrieks the eternal shrieks are uttered in darkness urging one on to what potential awakening in livid dawns then is the time for dreams such as one has never dreamt before when the throb of the engine claims ones pulses to its beat and its breath paints one with a sooty rime and one feels oneself being slowly absorbed into the system of that crashing hurtling monster a small integral part of its mechanism what hope seems left at last of any detachment from the chimera to which one has committed ones destinies such spaces may be covered in those long night hours i had never realised the like before had never been sped so far by hundreds of miles against my own will of volition my helplessness affected me like a personal humiliation we would catch up tempests and tunnel a mad course through them and leave them battling and booming in our rear in ragged spaces of the clouds the moon would shine out tossing like a lightship on tumultuous waters and disappear and be another beacon on another shoal when seen again the shadow of a world rushed by our windows phantom fabrics caught in starry glimpses and always seeming stranger as we fled but i slept at last and was whirled a passionless straw upon the tide very strange in truth was all this long journey to me yet it was taken in fullest possession of the antidote to its worst penalties johnny symbolised that touch of nature which makes the whole world kin i had already suspected the fact now i was convinced of it the subtle aroma of his godhead had flown abroad and our way thenceforth was to be clouded with the incense of mammon worship it was not enough that his purse had secured us every luxury meet to the amelioration of our hard lot obsequious officials in a democratic land clamoured for the privilege of making our primrose path primrosier and the down of our cushions downier they were so downy themselves that if they had plucked their breasts like swans for our nesting we should have been suffocated long before they were denuded however the attention brought its advantages to all but poor johnny himself whose way was made rocks and briars to him on and on unceasing tears the mad comet until striking after ons of flight it seems a mountain rampart with a mighty crash and scatteration of sparks it goes to earth and is quenched and buried from the eyes of the world in the mont cenis tunnel they advise you to keep the windows shut as you go cork screwing up that infernal staircase you might find it worse if you did not it is bad enough when you do drifts of asphyxiating smoke fitfully lambent stream by the glass and writh about and nozzle where they fancy they have detected an opening it may not be large enough for them to enter by but whiffs of their poisonous breath leak in and give you a taste of what you might expect were they to find you napping the train itself in that choking atmosphere seems to go weak at the wheels and to drag itself wearily upward as if every revolution must be its last committing you in prospect to the alternatives of entombment in the heart of a mountain or a back descent at rocket speed into france a throb as of thunderous subterranean waters fills your ears the wind of your passage clacks like a monstrous tongue on the stony roof above you it seems impossible that any work of man can withstand the hugeness of that deafening uproar and vibration but it is all of course acoustically exaggerated to you in your confined pen you are going up a spiral chimney with a sufficient ventilation at the top the clamour of your rising emerges there with the smoke and steam and like a piston rod you expel them before you as you advance and so at last when you have almost given up hope a flash and elysium i think the world can give one no first experience at once so sombre and so dazzlingly impressive as that of the passage of the col de frjus with its entry from low france and emergence into high italy thirty minutes are but half an hour out in the daylight in the mont cenis tunnel they amount to a good long spell of purgatory there the wails of the damned go past in drifts of lurid smoke most agitating in their bearing on the fragile pane which alone separates the eternal from the temporal classes one finds oneself hoping that the ministers of justice have fully understood their instructions about one and that one will be permitted to reach redemption without the window being broken curiously too the system of bought indulgence strikes one for the first time as having something in it the cost would be very small to shorten this tunnel by a spiritual mile or two and yet when it is ended one would not have had it shorter by a metre because every foot taken from it would mean just so much ecstasy filched from ones awakening from a nightmare for behold from travelling in a steaming suffocating drain pipe one is spat out suddenly into paradise in winter after that it seems bathos to compare the prospect with a transformation scene at a pantomime yet i think perhaps the latter analogy is the apter the instant glide from terrific night into fairyland the stupendous brown gullies dripping icicles from a sabres length to a maypoles snow in fields on slopes in ravines all of a blinding lustre and stained in its shadows of a celestial blue a world of high lifted iridescence streaked with gold leaf spangled with glass dust discharging ice crusted torrents under archways of glittering rock climbing peak over peak to the heaven painted cloth of light living and violet which makes its background that is how the vision of italy first broke upon me emerging from the portal of the underworld but as to geoletti the man was translated like bottom the weaver if to me the world had suddenly sprung into a vision of cloud capped towers and glittering pinnacles chiming unearthly music from diamond bells to him it was as the thronging of old familiar spirits gathered to greet his return he gazed and gazed and danced on his seat and uttered uncouth ejaculations he hugged himself in spasms and bit his nails and glared with burning eyes that the rising waters of his soul could hardly quench have you ever seen the wild spirit of the sea wake in a captive gull when the wind came on to blow so wrought the spirit of his mountains on geoletti i think there was not one of us whose soul did not respond in some measure to the tragic pathos of that revelation for what trifling messes of pottage cannot the fool in us be induced to part with his inheritance but enough of all this my theme is cain not esau murder not mountains the comet slackening now in its descent bears us down by beautiful winding valleys to the plains of piedmont and spent and slow at length discharges us upon turin and signor valombroso that was his magnificent name no less he was not only the first of piedmontese detectives but an accomplished linguist to boot and had been engaged from london regardless of expense to the service of milord johnny di dando he took us all under his wing at once inspector jannaway even condescendingly and shepherded the flock of us with a masterful volubility he was a tiny slim waisted man but his chest was stupendous he might have packed all the rest of himself into it and still have found room for a superior conceit or two it stood for valombroso in valombrosos own opinion the frill or comb which strutted from it through the unbuttoned upper half of its owners neat frock coat proclaimed him cock of the walk in his own exclusive department in further emphasis of valombrosos supremacy valombrosos silk hat was put at an angle on his head like an acute accent on valombroso and valombrosos moustachios waxed into stinglike points were accents also acute and grave on valombrosos speech which was copious and confident in the course indeed of our acquaintance valombroso was to convince us in flourishing rhetoric that in foresight in acumen in penetration as also in the conquering simplicity of his system there was no detective save one perhaps in all the world who could approach valombroso the possible exception was the english amateur mr holmes no less valombroso had the greatest admiration for this certainly unique man he knows very well he said that it is not the criminal who want to mystify but the public who want to be mystified so he keep the clue which is the obvious one in his own hand and send all the newspapers astray on many false scents then the time come when they are lost every jacks son of them and he bring them back very gradual and gentle to the path which shall end to the view of mr holmes holding his prisoner in the handcuffs but there he was from the first though they knew it not he did not want them to know for where then would have shown his cleverness we all scorn the obvious do we not it is so unexciting there is no reputation to be gained by seizing on it not in england mr holmes adapt himself to a demand he is very clever but your police they make the demand by their stupidity look they say there is a man stealing a handkerchief from a ladys pocket let us watch him and watch him to make sure that he does not want only to blow his nose and return it but presently he steals another handkerchief and then another and so they say three handkerchiefs are more than the allowance to one nose he must be a thief let us arrest him and by that time there are three ladies who are without the means to blow their noses so again if a murder is committed and the murderer suspect do they arrest him and put him by the heels while they bring the charge home not at all they watch that he commit himself and they tell the newspapers in the meantime all of what they are thinking and doing so cleverly as if that murderer was the only one out of all the country that not read the newspapers but the public applaud and that is enough it is not my way i do not walk twenty kilometres to get across the street i say show me my man and i go for him frankness frankness always that is my method plain dealing is the last thing the criminal expect it is against his nature he feels for ever in his expectation the sudden pinioning from the back he has no fear that i shall walk up to his face and take him by the hand now i say show me this body in its cave and i ask no more i go straight to england to procure mr dalstons extradition it is enough for what it is until i get him here locked safe then i will proceed to formulate my case it is well to bring down your bird before you put the pot on to boil we were all very much impressed all of us that is to say but jannaway he maintained his insular reserve and insular prejudice in favour of insular methods handkerchers indeed said he with a withering intonation id back any one of our london pickpockets to take and blow his nose in his handkercher and put it all back into his pocket without his knowing hed never guess but that it was the echo of himself a blowing of his own trumpet this lack of the right appreciation rather disillusioned us i think about jannaway assurance is always so much more convincing than reserve we sneer at conceit but we allow it the privileges of its self estimation valombroso must know himself so much better than we could possibly know him and so as his method was frankness what reason had we to doubt his being the greatest detective in the world it was simply jannaways jealousy from turin we went north to aosta an old walled and turreted town situated in a beautiful fertile valley under the mountains and rich in roman remains i have no time nor will to enlarge on the thousand wondering sensations which all this novel experience awoke in me they were poignant enough but they do not come into the story more germane to that is it to describe something of the feelings with which i approached this mecca of my pilgrimage and thought with an agitation hardly to be repressed how it was here that my father and mother had come stealing away from their party to put a bond upon their love how old and far away and strange it all seemed a pretty antique pastoral smelling of pot pourri until ah one could not long forget the end of it sordid and horrible behind those tumbling waters yet now being here a very strange and sweet realisation of my relationship to the dead came to me for the first time i think as a full conviction not even seeing his young eyes laugh down from that portrait on the wall at evercreech had i ever felt him so near to me and so understanding as when in this place i looked up to the hills and thought of what was lying hidden from me in their quiet folds charlie skene the lover and young husband of those days the boy still less than my own present age as he lay up there at this moment and yet my father was it not all ghastly pitiful and to think how that dastard blow had fallen upon three lives in one o mr mark dalston if they would only hang in italy and so one morning we went up to cormayeur and found the hospice of st marguerite hardly altered by geolettis showing from the hospice of twenty years ago there was even the same directrice presiding over its establishment a vivid brown eyed old dame with cavernous cheeks and a vulturine neck she remembered geoletti and the gossip about his utter evanishment she remembered the young english milord and his no less startling if more explainable disappearance she remembered very well better than all the rest the little demoiselle white and pink and the old aunt grim and de mauvaise humeur whose cruelty had betrayed to scandal what should have adorned a pretty tale of love and matrimony and were the cold ashes of that scandal to be raked over for the benefit of a new generation she protested alas if the dead were to be consulted for their countenances better bury all men in the abbey la sagra di s michele where the soil would convert them in a little into natural mummies a significant suggestion to be sure i have given a french tone to these observations but as a matter of fact they talked a hybrid patois nearer savoyard than italian up in these remote tributary valleys of the aosta valombroso had to be our interpreter to its meaning but he was always equal to any exigencies of talk he loved the sound of his own tongue impartially in all the dialects of babel he could give us a reason too for the strange anachronisms of dress which still prevailed in part among these mountaineers cocked hats to wit and bright coloured long skirted coats and breeches and stockings and shoe buckles they were the scum of an old upheaval of the ancient order risen to the top and not yet entirely skimmed away by the spirit of democracy as to the coquettish bibbed caps of the women they were designed after the fashion of other whited sepulchres to conceal the disfigurement of the gotre but now all this becomes likened in my memory to the crackling of thorns under a pot while i turn to face the real tragic purpose of our mission chapter xxix the body in the cave emerging from the pine woods at last we saw before us a vast barren slope scattered with an infinite dbris of rocks and stones the hill went up shouldering itself hugely against a cold white sky there might have been from our point of view no higher altitudes beyond yet but a short climb was needed to reveal this waste as but a low down step to the majesty of the peaks they rose into view before us as we advanced remote and ethereal springing loftier with our every step a whipped froth of pinnacles white as cream presently bearing to the right we saw a cleft open in the ridge of the hill and geoletti pointing to it stopped us with a quivering cry ecco lapluietonnante thenceforth we moved on in a burdened silence even valombroso seemed subdued under the weight of the responsibility approaching him we neared the cleft and the murmur of descending waters grew upon our ears then in a moment a crease seemed to open in the slope and we recognised that we were coming to the brow of a falling gully or ravine which divided the hill into two the murmur increased as we advanced to a roar tumultuous astounding and suddenly ascending among rocks we came out upon a little mossy sward with the curved edge of a cataract whirling beyond it like a section of a huge half buried fly wheel it poured over a ledge a couple of yards above us and as one could see by peering cautiously plunged in one unbroken fall of fifty feet or more into the sharp corner of a wooded gorge it came sweeping in the beginning through a great yat or gate in the rocks above a sluice regulating the overflow of some vast cistern of the mountains and after rebounding from that first mad descent went crashing stair by stair down into the green basements of the world where it sped itself away in a flurry of foam huge rocks toppled to the lip of the fall and piled themselves landward in a fantastic jumble they were cracked and split and creviced in a thousand directions but among all the fissures there was none that to an ordinary soul seemed potential of revelations mr shapter looking about him with a very white face put our common thought into words it must have needed an ingenious as well as an adventurous spirit to discover the clue to this secret signore said geoletti proudly milord was not the first the man exalted to these rocky attics which were his home was become another being from the hang dog creature of my knowledge his eyes had brightened his step become elastic he walked like one entitled to the command of the expedition behold he said the door in an instant he had sprung upon a ledge we saw him stoop and he was gone but his voice rallied us from a resonant hollow it is here com i think we all hung fire for an instant a natural enough qualm it was not the adventure in itself but merciful god what after all these years were we expecting to find ones imagination drifted to the very threshold at last sickened as in the emanations from a charnel vault twenty years and lying in what abnormal atmosphere subject to what unspeakable transformation it could have wrought of him surely nothing rich and strange like drowned alonso it i felt valombroso pushing by me and i held him back instantly and took the leap and almost struck against an upright slab of stone then i saw that behind this veiling slab there was a low down aperture in the rock face narrow and uninviting enough to one of my bulk but geolettis hand came through and with difficulty guided me in and instantly the thunder of the waters fell to a murmur stand up signore he said whisperingly there is plenty room in here i straightened myself nervously but there was indeed no necessity for precaution the narrow rent or gully in which we stood was just a disparted fracture in the mass of rock extending from crown to base and from verge to verge a man though a titan in height might have walked its length unhurt animo whispered my guide you follow me down sir and we reach it ver soon i felt him as i thought sinking from me and caught at him like a frightened child si si he said you shall see the light com at once it appeared even with his words an odd globing radiance that throbbed and flickered on the walls of rock like the glimmer of a distant torch to one lost in the labyrinths of a catacomb but with our every downward step it dilated broadened drew nearer and steadier and lo at one stride its source was revealed a square of green casement lit as it were by a rising dawn i halted stupefied as geoletti halted it was minutes before i could realise that we had reached were actually standing in the sleeping room of death but gradually understanding came to me and i saw it was the oddest chamber a sort of cave or embrasure it might have been sixteen feet in width by a dozen in depth opening upon the under sweep of the cataract some two yards beneath its leap and lit by the strangest window it appeared of green agitated spun glass that ran for ever as it seemed off an invisible reel and shook and fluctuated in its descent i could hear the swish of its going like the tear of rain it droned like a hive my god and all you can see is the trees and the hills pulled crooked like we saw ourselves in that looking glass i saw them warped eccentric demons of things reaching and clawing and shrinking as my father had seen them and described them to his friend twenty years ago i saw them and a cry from geoletti caught me to my senses zitto zitto ah dio di compassione look signore it is there it has never stirred the shroud of the waters has enwrapped it where it lay i followed the direction of his hand the cave was humid with a fine floating spray something shapeless grotesque lay on the floor of it near to its farther end a thing which in a first hurried glance i had taken for a mere natural excrescence of the rock what i gasped geoletti great god we approached it holding to one another over the slippery floor and looked down a horrible thing blurred out of mortal recognition fungussed with lime preserved in it decay arrested and perpetuated a horrible thing it resembled nothing so much as one of those pitiful casts taken from the ashy moulds in dead pompeii grey as pumice stone my father a smaller excrescence lay near it quite a little one geoletti stooped and pulled and it came away in his hand signore the box he whispered ah i cried go while i watch and fetch the others they must come they must see this valombroso will know what to do go do you hear i am not afraid any longer do you not understand what he was to me chapter xxx hard pressed it was on a dreary wet morning laden with the very spirit of depression that i led my little party of three across the fields to the lone farm we had talked or slept out the night at the black dog in market grazing and now in grim fulfilment of the purpose which had brought us so far were advancing to the assault of the inner abode of that mystery whose final ramification had ended for us under the waterfall in far away piedmont we numbered besides myself mr shapter and the two detectives johnny and geoletti had stopped by the way in london to provide us with the necessary correspondents in that prescriptive centre to all such operations we had hardly rested in our flight back from the continent since the finding of the inquest held upon those pitiful remains had supplied us with the argumentum ad rem for procuring the extradition of mr mark dalston but quick as we had travelled the news of our presumptive mission had preceded us for many reasons we should have preferred for the present to have throttled all journalistic gossip but where was the lethal spot to be found in that myriad necked hydra the story or a travesty of it leaked out and ran faster than we could and was threatening us already on our arrival in london with a most undesired fame the absurdest surmises were rife the most ingenious inventions drawn upon to provide them i have no time nor patience to stop and retail a fraction of the nonsense talked by the newspapers the serious thing to us in it all was that it brought into a full glare of notoriety a case which in its first processes it was of the utmost importance should be kept secret signor valombroso was of course as cutting as a whip upon the paradox involved why do you not also publish portrait cards of your london detectives with their character parts included he asked it would give the poor criminal yet one other chance he would have proposed a newspaper censorship as the remedy but it was certainly aggravating if it was true that mr dalston having got wind somehow perhaps through mother carey of the trend of my inquiries and being baffled in his designs on his victim had already slipped into hiding it was hardly probable that this public exposure and esclandre would bring him out of it the puzzling thing was that he should have left so vexatious a witness behind him at the lone farm but as to that it had to be borne in mind that he was presumably unaware of her treachery to himself in any case hither had been our obvious direction from the moment of our landing i had written to ira while still in italy a full account of the discovery with all its tragic incidents and consequences afterwards arriving in london i filled in the sheet with a brief account of our subsequent doings and present intentions and posted it to her where she was staying with the family at claridges hotel it was misery to be so near and apart but the peremptoriness of my mission admitted of no delay while the nature of our relations precluded any present thought of a meeting under the skene gis but how desolate seemed the country void of the consciousness of that young darling presence in it i could almost welcome the dripping skies the sodden fields the deathly soak and stillness as things attuned to a mood abandoned of love and shivering under a sort of creeping paralysis of terror for how could i forget for a moment the relations in which i stood towards the unhappy woman of whom it was the very purpose of our visit to make a traitor and informer she had borne children to him i was not the only fruit of her motherhood i could not but feel my part somehow an execrable one and most in its self consciousness of a still existing repugnance towards the object of our schemes which was surely unnatural but which i could not for all my striving overcome was not this indeed one of the bitterest features of a bitter tragedy at the present moment even my thoughts for all the filial warmth and graciousness they could command turned instinctively to lady skene the foreboding solemnity of my mood seemed to impart itself to my companions we plashed and plodded along the field paths with hardly a word to exchange amongst us inspector jannaway it is true had his own reasons for reserve holding the very tangible fact of a warrant for mr dalstons arrest in his pocket he seemed bent on leaving it to his italian colleague to justify its production let him have his head gentlemen he knows all about it hes agoing to prove the superiority of his system over ours very well im not the man to interfere not just yet awhile anyway he did not speak these words but his attitude unmistakably expressed them he was a great english detective on the high horse aggrieved by insolent comparisons let valombroso have our confidence let all fools have their paradise we should find ourselves on the wrong side of ours in due time when we wanted him and we should want him he was here at our service in the meantime he kept his thoughts and his theories if he had any to himself and acquiesced passively and pleasantly in all that was suggested but he offered no suggestions of his own a dive through a dripping copse a final flounder along a little muddy lane brought us into view of the house it was certainly entitled to its name a lonely haunted tenement flung away into the fields to rot and perish of its own reputation the fabric of it dated from the tudors but it had been patched and shored with a number of unseemly anachronisms until it looked like a crippled house on crutches old barns old byres an old dove cot toppled hard by to their fall the only modern feature about it was the filth which discharged in one place its moister particles into a little green duck pond with no ducks in it the house itself was half buried in trees through which one caught a glimpse of a considerable garden to the rear full of vegetables but neglected tradition pointed to the farm as a refuge during the marian persecutions of a number of non juring ministers who had nevertheless come to be routed out and despatched to the flames for their obduracy it was certainly quarried with vaults and priests holes and other such sanctuaries of the desperate hm muttered mr shapter with his hand on the bell a very warren this i shouldnt be surprised what do you think jannaway i think as you think sir answered the detective serenely shapter turned away impatiently the clang of the bell answering from those bowels of silence made us all start and almost with the cessation of its deep voice she stood in the opening of the door before us the same mean sapless figure the same unmoving face worn and unwholesome and scored with its grey lines of suffering or endurance only the eyes in it lived the eyes of the petite demoiselle so white and pink i could not picture it i could not age has no past for youth no memory of joys like its own i shrank before the fire of those eyes but their vision had no direction not even for me they looked beyond us all valombroso swept off his hat and returned it to his head being careful of the tilt good morning madama he said is your husband at home we desire the honour of a word with him you have come to arrest him the voice was as lifeless as the face madama is too precipitate answered the detective a word is not necessarily a warrant i have always been waiting for it to come she went on in the same cold low tone and with the same hot vision always challenging something beyond us that we could not see i have always expected and lived for this moment now is it not in the eternal curse of things that it has come too late too precipitate o yes too precipitate she gave a frozen little laugh horrible because the muscles of her mouth the breath of her bosom did not seem to stir to it he killed my husband my dear first love did he not she asked not one of us could find words to answer her o i know it she said i have always known it voices and visions used to come to me they were for ever coming one was of a little child i bore but it went and i knew then that it was not of the dead only the dead speak to me the others are like murmurs behind a wall i hear them as the dead hear the steps and laughter overhead he killed him out of love of me he struck him through my heart and killed my heart the rest was his to take he could not gain back what he had killed his will was strong but that was beyond it and he made a passionate wooer too but it wanted more than his warmth to melt that dead stone of my heart the children of his passion they were born with the chill of it on them and they too died one by one not once did her voice rise above that lifeless current of sound she stood like one speaking in an hypnotic trance compelled to say the things she said now in a pause valombroso spoke again will madama explain what she means by its being too late her eyes came down to him with the strangest challenge did you know him and think to take him so easily look where you will you will not find him here we shall avail ourselves very fully of your permission madam said mr shapter civilly it obviates for us the unpleasant necessity to fall back upon our search warrant mr dalston is gone then you say will you perhaps acquaint us where he is gone abroad a long journey i have a letter from him you can see it if you like she turned and led the way into the house and we all followed her into a low dark inky panelled sitting room melancholy green light flowed in here through a wide lozenge paned window at the back a round headed bush was stooped to the glass outside as if listening with its ear to it it was an unchancy creepy place and shudderingly cold we exchanged some significant glances while the unhappy woman was searching a bureau for the letter crazed that was their common implication and perhaps by reason of her madness spared much it was very pitiful presently she found what she sought and brought it to us our heads crowded together to read it it was indisputably his couched in affectionate terms and dated from some port in spain a week back it related the writers sudden inducement to seize a business chance which had offered talked of a short absence and gave some directions for his wifes abandonment of the farm and withdrawal to a certain address in london which was mentioned valombroso finishing with it shrugged his shoulders and handed the sheet on to jannaway who put it in his pocket it is very well then and now with your permission madama we will get to work said the italian she answered not a word but stood leaning on the desk and looking strangely after us as we trooped out of the room mr shapter leading us across the passage halted in a little dull study which had presumably been the masters and faced the detectives with a question well valombroso shrugged his shoulders again inspector jannaway did and said nothing come said the lawyer impatiently to the former is the letter in your opinion genuine in con test abilmente signore then it is no good our searching here very like but we must search nevertheless he may have gone and come back i say only this show me once my man and i go for him jannaway uttered a curious sound if his face had not been so immovable i should have taken it for a laugh mr shapter glanced at him sharply you seem amused inspector jannaway he said do i sir answered the detective i have to seem a lot of things in the course of my duty shapter flounced his shoulders slightly and turned away the sooner we get to business the sooner we shall satisfy ourselves he said come we left the room together but outside by the lawyers advice separated and took each his independent direction as one the living rooms one the offices and cellars and a third the attics inspector jannaway decided on his own initiative for the grounds and ruined outbuildings our search as might have been expected yielded us no human quarry not so much as a scullery maid mrs dalston it appeared existed for whatever reason the sole tenant of this remote and dismal homestead but if the place was void of any sign or shadow of what we sought the voices of a hundred unseen demons seemed to people it they rang in peals of laughter up the stairs they answered mockingly to ones tap on hollow panels they rose in reverberant boomings from the cellars and echoed away down dark passages to a scampering of tiny feet when by and by we reassembled in the hall valombrosos instant utterance spoke i think the common feeling god of mercy signore there is only one way to penetrate the secrets of this house and that is to pull it down he wiped his white face with a ball of handkerchief inspector jannaways appeared the only composed countenance amongst us but even his answered with a momentary pallor to the shock of a sudden screech of laughter uttered hard by it came or seemed to come from the room where we had left mrs dalston mr shapter after a seconds paralysis turned the handle of the door resolutely and we all looked in she was standing still where we had left her a handkerchief was in her hand her bosom was rising and falling in hard pants great god madam said the lawyer was it you made that noise she gave no answer she seemed fighting for breath but presently she spoke you have not found him then not yet but we shall come again we have not finished it is open to you now and always she said still with difficulty i am at your service we are all here at your service we i shivered in the thought of those viewless colleagues of hers a vision of the cheery inn where we had quartered ourselves suddenly rose before me before us all i think irresistibly attractive it would be possible only in some such healthy commonplace to resolve upon reason and a course of action without another word we turned and left the house we must have walked half a mile i believe before any one of us spoke and then it was inspector jannaway answering a mute appeal of the lawyers eyes mad sir he said as mad as a hatter chapter xxxi a notable interlude it was evident that things had come to a deadlock between the two detectives they could not work together and they would not work apart mr shapter was summoned at length to arbitrate between them he found valombroso bristling and jannaway conscience calm the italian opened on him signore if i am to have an english colleague it shall be other than this serene man yes i will call him that for politeness what is the matter with him detective the matter nothing is the matter he enjoy the most perfect constitution in my experience nothing shall move or trouble him i say to him suppose i think this dalston somewheres in the neighbourhood well think it he say again if i remark i believe of this letter that it is genuine you are quite welcome to your belief he answer once more suppose i decide it the good policy i say to go and watch at the address which our man give for his wife in london what is his reply why go along and watch yourself silly if you like just that but he will not come too and so i shall refuse to go without him he desire anything to put me wrong so he may presently take to himself the credit when it arrive we are baffled here at present yes we shall continue the same while this sort of thing shall last but it shall not last i say now at once that unless you give me the colleague i desire i throw up the case i cannot work at it any longer with a mule and who is this suggested colleague valombroso is it mr holmes who else signore am i not valombroso mr shapter shrugged his shoulders but he had carte blanche from johnny to employ whom he pleased and expense was no consideration well have you any objection jannaway he asked resignedly none whatever sir answered the inspector it wont be the first time me and mr holmes have met over a case hes got the makings of a respectable detective in him or used to have and if he should come to fail here like mr valombroso why theres still me to fall back upon for a forlorn hope what did he mean had he or had he not something up his sleeve which he was retaining merely for the greater discomfiture of his rival should that gentleman once come to admit his own defeat nothing could be plausibly guessed but that he felt himself aggrieved over our moral assumption of the others supremacy and was regarding with a mischievous enjoyment some faux pas into which our mistaken faith was leading us it seemed incredible that a man of his reputation could have no ideas in the matter we could so little believe it in fact that through all this puzzling perversity of his mood it never occurred to us for a moment i think to dispense with his services negative as those were at the very least he might become as he himself suggested our ark of refuge valombroso snorted fearfully over the assumption of his failure you to think you shall see to the end of my resource inspec tar r r r jannaway he said and ended with a furious ironic laugh jannaway stood impassive very well then said mr shapter hastily i will telegraph to mr holmes i cannot of course answer for his being disengaged at the moment but fortunately a favourable answer was received mr holmes himself would follow by the midday train i confess i was extremely curious to see this extraordinary man with whose eagle countenance penetrating eyes and slender aristocratic figure report had made me familiar nor when i had my opportunity was it marked by that disillusionment which is often the penalty of over expectation it is true that there was a trifle more grey in the hair a trifle more vagueness or shall i say less brilliancy in the eye than i had looked for but it must be remembered that at this period mr holmes was at least approaching that state of premature superannuation which his adventures countless and diversified beyond the common human experience or endurance had necessarily imposed upon him nevertheless he was still a striking looking man very pale in the face and with a curious bump on his head any mute and stealthy observation of which he was wont characteristically to detect and to regard it seemed with suspicion or annoyance he drove from footover in a station fly and of course his friend dr watson accompanied him the two it was well known were inseparable mr shapter and i were waiting for him as he alighted but he took not the least notice of us for a moment turning to his companion with the remark i believe you are perfectly right in what you are thinking my dear watson the breach between the ds is eternal they will never come together again the doctor long accustomed it appeared to the others method of deductive reasoning showed no astonishment but merely replied yes you have answered the thought in my mind exactly no doubt it will interest these gentlemen to hear the processes by which you reached that conclusion why my dear watson said mr holmes promptly do you not remember that little oath you uttered under your breath when our flyman jogged us over an offensively large stone the ejaculation inevitably suggested a big letter to you the bigness of the letter a certain popular operetta the operetta a pinafore a pinafore overcoats in general at that moment you glanced up the coat our coachman was wearing had obviously been made for a smaller man and the seam had parted at the back never to rejoin i saw you observe it the association of ideas was complete the ds and the breach between them rushed into your mind at the very instant that we came to the door of this capital hostelry and into the presence if i mistake not he turned with a charming bow and smile of our respected telegraphic correspondents the formal greeting over we conveyed our visitors into our private sitting room where the two detectives were awaiting us mr holmes greeted the inspector with a ha jannaway and we promptly got to business the great amateur was severely interested in the tale unfolded to him though his companion i could not but think appeared somewhat bored by it he yawned a good deal and kept looking at his watch i was not mentally as familiar with his figure as with the others and beyond the fact of his face being a mutton chop whiskered one had no more than an idea of his general appearance still i had not seemed to associate quite so much bulk with it doctor watson i fear had grown rather fat and inert and in suggestion not unlike a prosperous impresario the story related and the letter examined mr holmes sat in profound silence for a while i take it then he said presently that the point of contention is the present whereabouts of mr dalston i was a little surprised as that was the point and no other in fact had been raised i believe said mr holmes after further reflection that mr dalston went abroad and that he wrote that letter from abroad that is not necessarily to conclude however that he is abroad at this moment the farm by your showing offers itself a very potential retreat to one desirous shall we say of evading his social obligations at the same time it does not appear to be rich in the material necessities of existence it is at least conceivable that this man rendered desperate by an enforced abstinence may be caught sneaking from his well chosen burrow there at night in order to satisfy those insatiable appetites which his position renders him unable to indulge by day your criminal is notoriously a sensuous animal and one the least capable of resisting the calls of his nature have you may i ask ever thought of putting a watch upon the place at night no it appeared we had not our interlocutor smiled shaking a long finger at jannaway inspector inspector he murmured the old fundamental insufficiency valombroso skipped with delight signore he began only show me my man and mr holmes interrupted him rising i will do my best he said but this is very sad he went out and we did not see him again until dinner time when he turned up rather late to dr watsons obvious annoyance and luminous so to speak with preoccupation he smoked a heavy pipe filled with tobacco of a peculiarly pungent brand throughout the meal but ate very little an abstinence which was fully compensated by his friend who not to misjudge him appeared to think a good deal of his food and eyed every dish interestedly as it was put on the table the fare proving exhilarating moved the doctor even to some ill timed levity for when mr holmes at dessert slipped apparently in a fit of abstraction the nutcrackers into his pocket he asked him banteringly if he hadnt better send the dishful of nuts after them mr holmes was very angry and demanded to know how after all these years of their acquaintance he had learned no better than to question him openly as to the meaning of any action of his however seemingly uncalled for for what do you exist my dear watson he said with an infinite but perfectly gentlemanly irony but as a screen of vulgar commonplace between me and the public you are not here to expose my methods but to cover them the doctor was completely and rightly set down though it is only fair to him to admit that mr holmes afterwards confessed to us in private that the act had been an involuntary one on his part due no doubt to some association of ideas between the implements and his recognition of the fact that he had here a particularly hard nut to crack he left us again after dinner and seeing him well out of the room the doctor presumably in a spit of resentment took the occasion to tap his own head significantly he has never been he murmured quite the man he was since that fall if this admission or insinuation served to give us pause our spirits were to be reassured in a few hours by the return of mr holmes in a great state of suppressed excitement give me a foot rule he said i believe my theory was correct and that i am on his tracks his enthusiasm communicated itself to us all great heavens sir said mr shapter do you mean to say you believe him to be really in hiding at the farm i lend myself to no positive assertion my dear sir answered the other with a smile i state only that i have come upon a number of footmarks about the house that were not there this afternoon they may be his they may not be a great deal depends upon the postulate but nothing can be lost at least by following them up and that is my sole present intention i shall be absent probably during the greater part of the night and even it may be well into to morrow morning see that the door is left on the latch you may be sure that none of us save only dr watson whose snores shook the partitions slept much that night we were all awake with daylight and eager for news it came presently with the astounding information that mr holmes returning to the house in the early hours of the morning had ordered incontinently a fly for the station and had left in it before any of us were down we stared at one another in mute consternation but dr watson when he appeared took the thunderbolt unruffled this sudden disappearance was only in his opinion part of the plot likely enough the tracks had led his friend to footover in the meantime he laid himself out to enjoy his respite in the consumption of much excellent fare and tobacco to which latter indulgence he never resorted without first fitting on his head an embroidered black velvet smoking cap with a large gold tassel pendent from its crown his engagements he said left him free till easter when he was to take his usual little holiday at clacton on sea no doubt there would be developments in a day or two but there were no developments not that day nor the next and we were beginning to foresee a difficulty in ridding ourselves of this self complacent incubus when there arrived a letter to him from mr holmes which settled the business he read it and in a fit i cannot but think of temporary aberration threw it across to mr shapter it ran as follows my dear watson i find this must be counted among my unsuccessful cases i am under the necessity of admitting that the footmarks i have been following were my own i traced them all the way to the black dog and so up the stairs to my bedroom where the boots themselves lay under a chair en passant why did you never remind me my dear watson that they were a pair of yours which i had borrowed and put off for some of my own when i went out for the second time it was that misled me make my apologies to our friends i enclose the half of your third class return ticket and am off to siberia by the night mail an important political prisoner has escaped from kara baigarama i believe him to be hidden under an ice floe in the arctic ocean tell this to nobody mr shapter looked across at dr watson who had sunk back in his chair with a piece of bloater sticking out of his mouth he gasped and swallowed it i believe he said that that fall into the river gave him water on the brain chapter xxxii run to earth i have to tell you jannaway said mr shapter that your colleague has deserted you indeed sir he has driven away this morning to catch the early express disillusioned for ever he told me as to our police methods disappointed in his one cherished ideal he has gone to london to deliver his report and state his case before the court of final appeal as represented by our employer mr dando very well sir then praps its time as we got to business i dont understand you jannaway maybe not mr shapter maybe its a side of my business to be misunderstood and a side of yours to know it well i should have thought i knew you pretty well by this time should you sir with respect and judging by results i must take leave to doubt it well jannaway well the detective warmed a little his grievance coming to an irresistible head look you here mr shapter he said if were all to be judged by what we go a boasting of ourselves we might as well petition the almighty to open paradise again and give us that valombroso for our head gardener but hes not to be took in like some folks by the clanging of an empty brass pot and mayhap hed ask for a little more proof of what was at the inside of all the noise that pretended to such a bellyful of wisdom its time for a cock to crow when its out of the egg but really inspector maynt silence sometimes be a little empty too thats for you to judge sir i am your very humble servant jannaway then sir if youll come along with me ill show you where the body of this man dalston is lying at this moment dead the bolt loosed serenely from that official blue caught us fairly in the wind and sent us staggering the whispered cry came from us together the inspector nodded his head with his lips set very grim dead gentlemen look in a well they say for truth its worth bearing in mind in a well in a well sir mrs dalston done him ive got her under arrest at this moment murder the detective with a swift movement gripped my arm hold on sir he said itll pass in a bit im all right i whispered huskily did she murder him i didnt say she did now did i he protested she drove him to kill himself if you want the truth we got him up at daybreak and hes lying in the parlour now his tickets cancelled for good and all i want you over there at once mr shapter but the young gentleman neednt come unless he likes im ready i retorted fiercely what do you suppose have i run him so far to shirk the end come hurry what are you waiting for well said the detective hes not a pretty sight thats all theres few as is what shoots themselves in the head i stared at him i would ask no more in a minute we were on our way since when have you known this jannaway asked mr shapter pale and breathless as we hurried on only since early this morning for certain sir answered the man but id been awake and busy half the night before while the italian gentleman i suppose was a fuming and a packing of his bag hed better have waited a little longer i couldnt have kept the truth from him another day how long have you been keeping it from him from us all as it is i mentioned since this morning didnt i sir i dont say as that covers the whole process of my reasoning up to it but as to that youll hardly blame me i suppose for sitting close anyway its the inferior english method mr shapter and being an inferior english detective myself im stupidly prejudiced in favour of it it was wounded dignitys last shot we hardly spoke another word as we sped across the fields for myself i was so overcome with agitation as to find the mere effort of speech a labour yet once i found voice to ask jannaway a question appalled what will be done with her he shook his head grating his chin what indeed sir it might be proved incitement to suicide more like shell be found incapable to plead im detaining her as a matter of form but the county asylums more in her line than the police station dont you be afraid for her sir afraid merciful heavens if this might be found the solution my mother never as yet so realised never until made a widow for the second time and by her own revengeful act it seemed yet dreadful as that might prove itself it restored her somehow in my mind to her right place in the triple tragedy of my life we found a knot of gaping whispering rustics gathered about the farm when we reached it the news had already got abroad and a potent shadow was henceforth to add itself to the traditional spectres of the place a stolid hot faced member of the local police opened the door to us a fellow constable was in charge of the prisoner in the study thither we went she rose with a smile upon seeing us there was a bright unearthly light in her eyes and glided across to me hush she said they have found him charlie darling but it does not matter he can never hurt you again how big and strong you have grown while you slept and he has fallen to nothing he would be no match for you now and yet in spite of all i used to think him a fine man he would woo so confidently and all the time he never guessed what was in my heart and in the end i did it so cleverly he just went down there into hiding into the place which he had discovered and told me of i let him down myself and afterwards it was so simple i had only to wind up the bucket again and leave him he had never foreseen that for all his cleverness and i kept my secret too well he used to call up to me the names that had once seemed to give me to him and i listened and never answered and then he implored and implored and i never answered but i looked over the rim and laughed at him until he knew i saw his face hang white above the water whiter and whiter every day and then once when evening had fallen came the sound o my god and i knew that at last he had shot himself in his despair she flung her hands to her throat with a gasping cry it was like him to take that way he knew that the sound would go on for ever and ever in that pit and betray me in the end dont you hear it now coming from the garden but you neednt be afraid to touch me my lord my hands are clean gentlemen of the jury i did not kill him please let me pass he has a headache and it is my duty to attend to him he is a very handsome man when he is himself i should like to tell him that it is so little and i have never said as much to him before i think it might help to cure him and stop the sound gentlemen please at a sign from jannaway the two constables advanced and put firm but not ungentle hands upon the poor creature she struggled uttering shriek upon shriek best leave her to us sir panted one of the men shell go quiet in a little mr shapter led me inexpressibly agitated from the room and out into the open at the back here the detective took the lead and conducting us by way of weed grown paths and tangled vegetation through a wicket into an old walled fruit garden turned towards an angle of the enclosure where on a little elevation the yoke of a great well sprouted from the ground my heart shuddered in me as we approached the thing it was a pretty massive structure built for endurance and calculated to the strain of a heavy load of water the bucket the loop of a strong chain connecting it with the windlass barrel stood empty on the grass by the well rim a great sheet iron pail capable of holding eight or perhaps half a score gallons but the machinery by which it was manipulated was the most curious being a nest of powerful cog wheels and blocks so adjusted under the butt of the windlass that by turning a handle a child or little stronger could wheel up the full bucket with perfect ease and as many pauses by the way as he chose what was as striking as anything perhaps was the state of preservation of the whole structure but no doubt the entire water supply of the farm depending on it had made that a perennial necessity will you look down now gentlemen said the detective and see if anything strikes you hold steady sir i balanced myself by the upright post of the windlass and peered into the well its heavy wooden lid pierced by a trap in the middle through which the bucket could be raised and lowered without disturbing the rest had been bodily removed and stood on its rim against the wall hard by the diameter of the shaft was considerable a full six feet i should say and the depth of the boring it might be two hundred but i am not certain i know only that the eye of water at the bottom looked no larger than a full moon and that a surprising interval elapsed between the dropping of a stone from above and its answering plop from below well gentlemen said jannaway after we had been gazing down some moments nothing strikes you out of the common nothing whatever ah he exclaimed satisfied they was pretty cute in those days now ill tell you there is something peculiar and not moren thirty or forty feet down but youd never guess it from here would you if you doubt me go and satisfy yourselves i dont ask you to mind you i say only as ive been the journey myself this morning and more than once and if thats enough for you you can take my word on it i came away instantly from the post im going down i said no exclaimed mr shapter violently yes i insisted hell do all right sir said the detective after a moments survey of me i should be glad as a matter of fact of the corroborative testimony and theres no more danger in it than in a fire escape if he keeps his hold and his nerve i am going down i repeated what shall i do jannaway nothing more sir than sit on the bucket edge with your legs inside and hold on to the chain when you come to it shout and ill stop i did as he bid me he went to the windlass handle and without a moments hesitation began to turn instantly the bucket containing me swung free and after a little sluggish oscillation descended slow and smooth dropping into the bowels of the earth it was a curious rather awful sensation going down so into that smooth walled shaft with its deep sunk eye watching for the breaking of the thread which was to precipitate me to an unthinkable death i could not find the nerve after one glance to look down again but on the other hand the brightness of my descent both surprised and comforted me i had peered from above into a pit of gloom rather appalling and fathomless to the eye now descending into it under its open circular skylight all was as clear as day so that i could see the shadows under the projecting bricks and the little hartstongues in the crevices of mortar a vivid green i must have dropped already some thirty or more feet when i saw a curious hooded bulge so slight as to be imperceptible from above swell from the curve of the wall and immediately afterwards the wall itself appeared to gape beneath it like a yawning mouth i shouted in another moment and the bucket stopped right opposite me gouged out of the wellside was a deep niche like an oriel forming a sort of grotto or retreat it was quite roomy and lined and floored with brick and a stone ledge in it formed a seat at the entrance an iron stanchion was let into the wall so that one setting the bucket gently swinging might easily grasp that hold and land himself in the cave a man might lie hid there indefinitely with the aid of a confederate above and not a soul guess the secret of his disappearance it was as cunning a cover i am convinced as persecution had ever inspired now as i gazed fascinated a certain token of some late human occupation there entered into my vision and set the brain of it reeling i screeched out and clung frantically to the chain in an instant i was going upward and in a little more the wholesome daylight came about me swing cried the detective bending at the crank and he slipped in a block that held up the machinery i obeyed as well as my shaken nerves would let me and in a little they had caught the rim of the bucket and held it to the side while i stepped out why the devil didnt you tell me of the blood i gasped wiping my wet forehead as i stood away the inspector looked at me queerly truth is sir he said i never thought wed had to get him out you see and a nice job it was what was left of it didnt seem to matter mr shapter with his eyes like grey agates was holding my left hand in his left his right placed sympathetically on my shoulder what was it my boy he said a cave sir i answered a scoop in the wall where hed hidden water and a cave like that other and the shot in his head my god who fired it my god sir an awful retribution he said but come come you are overwrought and no wonder let us go back to the house or into the open fields if you prefer it and jannaway shall give us the story of his discovery in good matter of fact reviving prose the detective took from his pocket the letter which he had obtained from mrs dalston and held it up to the light for our inspection do you observe the water mark gentlemen nolans the big north hampshire paper mills it was that first put me on the scent here was local made foreign note paper asserted to have been received from spain he might of course have took some with him but it wasnt likely was it seeing as how the letter itself refers to the journey as unpremeditated and him away from home or wished it to be supposed so at the time inference that hed wrote it here for a blind and give it to be produced by mrs d in case of inquiry while he himself dropped into hiding he was clever and he knew a good deal not the least of his knowledge that the game was threatening to be up with him but the best of his sort make their slips hed made his and it left me pretty convinced that hed be found lying close somewheres about the neighbourhood while the hunt ran abroad i didnt much cotton to the house myself for a solution it was reasonable to suppose of course that during his tenancy of the place he hadnt overlooked its best facilities for concealment but then where he could find a way others could too and the reputation of the farm promised a pretty searching inquiry into its holes and corners no i thought if our gentlemans to be unearthed at all it will be from somewheres characteristic of his genius and the least likely to be considered by the ordinary probability pointed to the house for that therefore i made it my business to look outside now i dont know if you may recall gentlemen a rather queer thing and that was the odd laugh the lady give in answer to our italian friends remark that shed been too precipitate she had she admitted it indirectly shed always been looking the inference was for this solution to the long grudge shed bore against him and when at last it come it come too late why by god gentlemen the answer took me in a flash it was because she herself had already anticipated the law by killing him once in my mind i couldnt get it out yet if it was true it only made the puzzle deeper for where could she have hid him none the less and why had she chosen this particular time more than another for the deed the plain answer to that second seemed because he must have put himself suddenly at her mercy in a way hed never done before and the temptation had proved too strong for her it was then for the first time that the well occurred to me could she have pushed him in unexpected when he was gone to draw water i had observed the thing of course often enough before its size and depth and the machinery about it was only too conspicuous to draw my serious notice but now i went to a closer examination and by the lord gentlemen what do you think i found caught among the cogs why a finger stall that was something at least for on the day we first saw her mrs d was wearing such a thing that decided me i tested the machinery and found the bucket drop like oil a child could have worked it i determined to go down into that well and find out if i could what a little fishing at its bottom might bring to light you see the discovery of the grotto was an accident id been looking for murder not suicide and the truth met me like you sir half way only god or a jury can give it a name that was no earlier than this morning when i got over a couple of the locals and had the cover off and was let down hed never wanted the cover off the man must have been built of stone and steel to sit there those days and nights famished and deserted waiting for his release that never came the most of us i think would have dropped into the water and ended it long before he did but he always had his revolver thats true he could afford to stake up to the last chance i dont know how long he himself had known about the grotto but he only let his wife into the secret of it a fortnight ago hed seen or heard from the woman carey as far as i can gather and thought as we should be down upon him at once he bolted for his hiding at the first in a panic arranging with mrs d that she was to come and wind him up at evenfall if nothing happened and that was the last the world saw of him it come on the woman in a moment as how shed got him in a trap and her chance was given her at last i had it all out of her while she kept the reason to speak it and that wasnt long when she saw him being brought in she broke out like a screech owl and a mercy for her if she could be turned into one in actual fact poor creatur jannaway said mr shapter i owe you an apology ill cancel the debt sir answered the inspector after all your saying you couldnt understand me was a compliment chapter xxxiii a rest by the way my story draws to a close i linger only yet a little by the way a balmy breathing space a last restful interlude between the acts before i rally to the final struggle before the inquest could be held my unhappy mothers complaint had so increased upon her that it became an imperative necessity to remove her to the asylum from which her poor broken spirit was only to be released by death the whole painful business with the material difficulties it entailed upon me at a crucial pass was undertaken for me by mr shapter acting on my good johnnys private instructions with the most feeling tact and helpfulness these are matters to be touched upon with no less delicacy than was shown in their accommodation never has man been blessed with a finer and more generous hearted friend than i yet conscious of a hundred unmerited graces a blight as of abandonment by all the world seemed to fall upon me as i left the room where the inquest had been held the inquiry was over the last flicker of its excitement was dead for me the madhouse and the unhallowed acre had closed upon the scene the jury equal to inspector jannaways faith in them had brought in a verdict of justifiable felo de se and with the snap of that final spark the curtain had fallen committing me to a profound gloom that in its essence no doubt was fruit of the inevitable reaction from long nervous tension in the exhaustion following any such prolonged struggle one is always apt to make a selfish grievance of ones state to resent the self imposition of ones burden as a duty enforced upon one by the callous egotism of ones fellows the disease of ungraciousness soured my vision and painted the world to me a bilious yellow true my friend had very handsomely provided the material means to my success but why in the justice of things should fate have imposed upon me the necessity of securing that success at all a dozen issues were involved in the question and i knew it but my reason was clouded under the sense of personal desertion at the crisis by those who appeared to think that their moral sympathy with me at a distance was all sufficing in fact and to end the matter i had not heard from the two dearest to me for a week and more and the shadow of that silence was obscuring my mind and peopling it with a hundred spectres of apprehension and so returning to the black dog i found a telegram awaiting me if possible be at lodge in caddle three thirty this afternoon particular business gas and gaiters j d it was like finding a bottle of champagne in a glooming wilderness at the first gulp the clouds lifted a crevice opened in them and sunshine poured into my heart cryptic as ever there was no telling johnnys meaning but johnny being johnny and all things equal helpfulness shone in some sort potential i looked at the clock with barely time to keep the appointment i started with a bounding heart on my way reaching near to the wicket at last i was aware of a station fly loitering along the road ahead as if in waiting for a discharged fare i hesitated an instant then passing through the gate plunged into the wintry coppices and went resolutely for the lodge i had not once entered this old hermitage of mine since my return i had felt it indeed morally barred to me while the great question was at issue but now i could not resist the sudden recall since as i told myself i was visiting it an invited guest how familiar and yet strange it looked as i drew near viewed in the light of my wider experiences a dark and lonely little tenement but haunted by what wistful ghost at last a spirit more potent than all its old time spectres of melancholy and decay whatever might come to be it was hallowed for evermore in the memory of that possession my heart was very full as i approached it and entered by the open door and stepped softly into what had been my sanctuary ira i whispered half choking if only it could be ira o richard it is me sweet imperfection of sweet lips and slips what has love to do with grammar with a sob i had her in my arms i could not help it this dream this rapture and i was overwrought the gentle lovely child how she understood and quieted my quivering face with her soft hand and spoke to me in murmurs of heavenly pity as if i were her child her baby the first born of her heart and i bent to her in an ecstasy of submission until i felt the manhood in me rise and strike for conquest and it is all over richard all over ira and he is dead and she is mad for ever i fear is it not better so o my dear if she should live to realise what she had done i hope she will die it is best to hope it everything shall be best now now that i have you again i have been afraid ira afraid of what richard i had not heard from you for so long i was troubled troubled i imagined things my mind has been in such a state what things bad boy poor poor little fellow there he shall be told the worst at once and get it over miss christmas sir has been offered a husband by her guardian what husband o not you sir dont think it it is lord sycamore he is very tall and very silly but only fairly well off and he has no roof to his mouth or to his head i forget which but anyhow if it was the dome of st pauls i shouldnt want him i should hope not and lord skene thinks to impose this ass on you richard dont shout so yes and he is enormously angry over my refusal i owe a debt to my grandfather for it he seems determined to add to my obligations to him and lady skene ira she answered very softly the dew of love in her eyes she is not angry richard i think if one knew she is your friend now she is very quiet and unself assertive always now since she came back to us once i saw her looking so strangely at me and i hurried to her and knelt and took her hands in mine without a word be a good wife to him she whispered suddenly he has suffered such wrong from us all and she was crying richard as she got up and left me and afterwards as i passed the nursery door she was sitting huddled on the floor by babys cot and i could not see her face because her hands were held quite still to it and the firelight was dancing in her beautiful hair she has grown so humble it makes me cry and richard i think uncle charlie feels the change in her and it has made him more masterful more peremptory once mr pugsley came and he would not let him see her but got rid of him without ceremony and she did not say anything when she heard it is as if she knows that she has forfeited her right to a voice in the conduct of her own affairs i have no quarrel with her ira and now less than ever she will always be my mother in my heart god forgive me and her but with lord skene it is another matter he knows how i stand with you and this persecution of his only shows his determination to resist all natural claims of mine on his consideration he scoffs at the whole story richard i think he looks upon it as the fabrication of a pretender he chooses to look upon it so dear a son an old mans benjamin stands in my way well if it were not for the vile insult implied to my father i think i could almost honour his infatuation and be content to waive my claim for for that i was going to say for a younger brother but things have altered just imagine it ira that little cradle creature is my uncle that set her off laughing and you are asked to make room for him dear doesnt it sound like that horrible vulgar song you should hear lord sycamore drone it out it is one of his most admired performances with the little brays to give it tone richard make room for your uncle haw theres a little de ar haw she buried her face against me and withdrew it for a moment flushed and half weeping between laughter and indignation i am ashamed to tell you such nonsense dear but it has really been very painful you see i am not of age yet and so and so i have got something to confess confess away your lips you know can always make their own bid for absolution you wicked priest but its nothing very dreadful at least i hope you dont think it so only that things became so unbearable in the end that i thought it best to go on a visit i wonder if you can guess where tell me why to the dandos i wrote to your friend was it very unmaidenly of me and the invitation came back directly o richard what a glorious little man he is loving you so and i think attached to me too but of course you told me that did i so you went and what did you think of mrs dando now richard i wont answer you as you want she is immense enormous i didnt mean that to hear the way they both spoke up for you did she too but i really had no reason to suppose she would may her shadow never grow less but johnny of course of course he is mad about the way you are being treated and insists on seeing you through to the end and establishing your claim before the world i am so blessed in my love and friendship darling that i live in a perpetual fools paradise about myself and my merits and so that is the explanation of this escapade i suppose yes he brought me who johnny i hope you dont mind hes waiting in the fly to take me back when weve done i shall go with you im finished here o richard will you will you clasp your hands to me baby you look as if you were all made of tinted sugar and ive a business not to eat you there in spite of everything my heart sings to choke me how can i ever let you go again yes ill telegraph to shapter when we get to town an hour ago i felt as if the world had done me now i feel like a giant for rounding on it what is your particular power you weak little thing give me your hand dont you remember how i made it carry that pailful of water beast that i was it would have served me right if you had dumped it on my toes ira supposing i never made good my claim what to me to you conceit no to the title i meant of course o i had forgotten but what does it matter richard so long as we have one another what did it matter indeed i ring down the curtain on that unanswerable query chapter xxxiv the great skene case you see the heading to this chapter your fathers used to see and greet it for many a long day in their newspapers especially in the evening issues when a little excitement was needed to beguile the tedious minutes of the journey homeward from the city to clapham or streatham or hampstead how the boys used to shrill it out decorated with its daily official furbelows and make their halfpenny profits on that cause clbre there may be comfortable newsvendors now who owe their position to the social furore it created i know that many lifelong friendships not to speak of heads were broken in the differences of opinion to which it led you may unearth the full report of it all if you will from the dusty files of i am not going to be so silly as to retail it to an indifferent generation even the great arthur great in bulk as in impudence has shrunk to day into little more than a buffer for legal precedents what modern can gauge the force of the contests which raged about the tichborne or skene standards or find himself more than politely interested in the story of the blood spilt and reputations overthrown on those doughty fields lost both by their claimants or pretenders yet i trust in one case an honourable defeat a few words as to which must now suffice lord skene persisting obstinately in disputing my claim and my cause being warmly espoused by my friends led to the institution of those legal proceedings which were to result in that action at law before the lords of the court of common pleas which came to be known as the great skene mystery and which in the end found me non suited and disinherited the case lasted many weeks and entailed the production of a little army of witnesses its expenses shake my memory to this day though thank heaven some subsequent successes were to enable me to come to some sort of a compromise for them with their guarantor my blessed and admirable johnny its chief weakness consisted in its failure to procure any reliable depositions from the witness who should have been its first my poor stricken mother a disastrous blow to it was the death of mother carey on the very evening following her receipt of an official citation to the court to give her evidence that resolving itself into a matter of second hand brought about my discomfiture whatever was the moral of the case and their appreciation of its true bent was conveyed to me spontaneously by a large number of independent persons legal and otherwise so reckless a dealing with our institutions as would be entailed in the upsetting of an hereditary title on circumstantial evidence was hardly to be thought of my claim was dismissed as in scottish parlance not proven and master baby was confirmed in his succession to the lordship of evercreech not so many weeks ago i strolled into the old court of common pleas at westminster and tried to regather from its mouldering echoes some whisper of the enormous babble which my solitary voice had once awakened there quiet sunshine came in through the windows there was an atmosphere in the place as of one of those little done with and locked away graveyards which one comes on unexpectedly in the green nooks of london it was difficult to reincarnate in fancy from that silent dust the roar and scuffle of a dead generation its figures and the emotions they had once evoked in me would not be stirred to more than a very shadowy demonstration they were not in fact so much the fallen precipitate of time as of a dead phase of my own existence between them and the present lay the verdict of the court only on the hither side of that verdict was life a vivid and strenuous reality to me hence though the case itself with its judges and droning counsels and motley witnesses and pomp and circumstance of legal warfare was become as the shadow of a fantasia every detail of its immediate issues was as clear to me as if it had happened yesterday the verdict had severed my past from my present self as a surgeons knife cuts away a diseased limb i could recall the very queer stunned feeling with which i had awakened from the operation amidst the rising buzz and shuffle of the court or theatre the solemn withdrawal of the judges figures like old ermine muffled dowagers making for their chariots the yawning and stretching barristers laughing as they gathered their papers the excited gossip of the audience the general movement and rush of draughts and gusty wind of cab hailing voices loud or indistinct as the doors opened and shut like an organ swell it all came back to me like a last weeks harlequinade to a child someone takes me by the arm and leads me out unresisting into the mild may evening a sense as of something rather comical bubbles in me like weak laughter there is a smell of water carts in the roads and the unconcerned sparrows are hopping in the intervals of the traffic never mind old fellow says the dear voice in my ear youre the one that comes out of it with credit i stop reeling a little as if stupidly drunk o credit johnny i answer with an inane giggle youll have to give me that with a vengeance come dicky he says peremptorily for him thats neither sense nor kindness old man nor it isnt fair to me you know i didnt lead you on to this for my own profit what i lose is what you lose and nothing more faith in mens justice thats all the rest counts for nothing and if youre the friend i believe youll see it as i do i may be morally intoxicated i am not ashamed to own nevertheless that there in the open street i take his good hand and kiss it now come along home he says flushing and hear what shes got to say about it all your defeat will pay you with her if i know her better than any victory would i only wish i was you by golly we reach the flat and he leaves me to mount the stairs alone there in the gorgeous drawing room ablaze with lights i find her a little soft radiant figure born to consume the soil and the bleeding hearts of its labourers i look round and about me with a renunciatory laugh and shrug of my shoulders and my eyes bitter and defiant come back to her yes miss christmas i say this is your proper setting i have lost my case the vile brute in me the vile brute she does not answer a word but with a quick sob she wrenches the diamond from her bosom the pearls from her hair and that falls and half veils her face and the next moment she is prostrate at my feet richard i will be poor o i will be poor hush who is this come suddenly upon us from the shadows where ira hearing my step had hidden her will you make my burden richard more than i can bear i turn in amazement it is lady skene i have dared much to come to you to her she says in a low agitated voice i knew from my husband that you could never win not there not in that court but here richard o it is great to be generous in triumph but greater in defeat generous what have i left to give in all the world yourself ira i cry as if waking from a dream what have i been saying what wicked nonsense have i been talking why what has all this to do with you and me money and titles i dont remember their ever having had anything to do with the understanding between us or had they i am stupid and i cant remember richard i am on my knees to her what tomfoolery of course i cant imagine what i was thinking of to quarrel with my own heart because it wouldnt stop beating i look round lady skene has gone ira i cry once more and heaven flows upon me under the tangle of her hair envoi i have only a note or two to add inessential but explanatory to the curious lord skene never forgave me for that stand made in my own rights but persisted to the end in regarding me as an impostor who had got even something better than his deserts his ward coming of age soon after the trial and persisting no less obstinately in her attachment to a rascal he washed his hands of her and committed us both to the devil the death of his mother in law i am satisfied to think caused him some retributive pangs for out of pocket as he was by the action he could not afford to ignore her substantial leavings or fail to suffer the social penalties entailed thereby through his obligation to admit his wifes relationship with the horrible old miser after mother careys demise bonds scrip and securities to a handsome tune were discovered hidden about her premises besides a considerable amount of property in hard but dirty cash i hope his lordship enjoyed handling it but i bear him no grudge old kindly memories of him predominate in my mind from facts subsequently unearthed by mr shapter it was believed that mr mark dalston had originally purposed the infanticide through the co operation of his friend dr blague of the teller of this narrative and that it was nothing more that the accidental interposition of mother carey which had suggested to him the compromise which though after a long interval was to bring about his undoing if he had been imbued with only a little less confidence in his own managing villainy he might have been a respected citizen at this day and my story had never been written the trial had at least one sequel satisfying to justice it led largely through johnnys instrumentality to an inquiry into the circumstances of geolettis conviction an inquiry only less notable than the one to which it was supernumerary with the result that the victim was granted a free pardon together with some pecuniary compensation nicely adapted to his deserts at the time of his arrest it was sufficient however to his expectations and returning with the sum to his native land he was enabled to realise the desire of his heart in the purchase of an auberge in the aosta valley where in after days i called upon him in company with my wife and found him a quiet prosperous man not speaking much but possessed with an insatiable craving to make up for past abstinences from tobacco and wine and finally of ourselves under the seal of loves confessional lies locked all that is worth knowing there but we were married if the term is essential to the propriety of an ending i am not fond of it myself i confess it is the conventional expression for a conventionally vulgar festivity but one has to endure it and get away from it as quickly as possible and commit to ones fancy a picture of the thing as one would have liked it to be something out in the woods perhaps with maids dancing and garlanded heifers and a gentle poem of wedlock as binding as its natural symbol in the oak and eglantine it is nothing but a question of terms when the sweet and solemn oath is exchanged after all well the thing had to be and my fairy who should have come dressed like the green lace wing must drag after her a preposterous train of watered tabby or moir antique bombazine or some such unnameable stuff at something terrifying the yard johnny the best of men was likewise my best man and in the enthusiasm of both parts pursued us flying with a dropping fire of telegrams in cypher which punctuated our honeymoon with merriment and afterwards why i started life dependent on my wife and what was to say against it a sense of honour pooh fine honour or kindness to wreck two lives on a sentiment of vanity that curse of the golden balance go fall into love my friend really into love i mean and marry you a wife and learn what mutual confidence means after the second day you will be beating your brains to remember which of you it was brought the money into the concern but that is not to say you will be justified in leading an idle life mchant poulain says an old french proverb peut devenir bon cheval nature having given me a certain fanciful inventiveness which might appear to be my most negotiable asset i thought i would try writing for a living and even began with some illusions about literature with a capital and the certainty of high purpose and high endeavour meeting in time with their due recognition and reward but long was not wanted to put me out of that preposterous conceit and make me understand the terms upon which literature is permitted to include itself among the high arts such as the forming of a trust or the exploiting of a pill or hair wash i then stuffed a manuscript into an old potted beef tin and forwarded it to an enterprising publisher with the intimation that it had been discovered on a dust heap and that my terms were such and such not as author but as entrepreneur the ruse being appreciated at its worth by a sagacious spirit and the venture launched on a flood tide of puffery proved an instant success the literary value of the book may have been anything or nothing it ran into its twenty fifth edition on a much solider basis and i found myself suddenly the possessor of capital ira and johnny were both immensely indignant with me when they discovered the truth that occurred on the very day on which my wife had unearthed from keats a quotation which she considered peculiarly applicable to my destiny and the ideals which ruled it to die content on pleasant sward leaving great verse unto a little clan i laughed as i kissed her good poets make unpractical fathers i said and you must not excite yourself my loveliness this money well invested is going to prove the nest egg of our song bird we must line the nest you know if we want the bird to sing and now being independent of the public i am going to pull its ears you donkey she said and pulled mine so ends the great skene mystery the symbol of whose stopping is to be found at this day if one is curious enough to look for it in the little lead plug let into a hole in the floor of the old court at westminster where once was inserted the rod which held the screen which protected the judges from the draughts and if i am richard gaskett still i have at least earned a popular title to my name the end notes the eye equals johnny himself the ego that is to say all his
