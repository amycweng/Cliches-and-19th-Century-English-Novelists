hall piccadilly chetwynd calverley introductionthe young stepmother i ouselcroft one summer evening mildred calverley accounted the prettiest girl in cheshire who had been seated in the drawingroom of her fathers house ouselcroft near daresbury vainly trying to read passed out from the open french window and made her way towards two magnificent cedars of lebanon at the farther end of the lawn she was still pacing the lawn with distracted steps when a wellknown voice called out to her and a tall figure emerged from the shade of the cedars and mildred uttered a cry of mingled surprise and delight is that you chetwynd ay i dont you know your own brother mildred and as they met they embraced each other affectionately have you been here long chetwynd she asked why didnt you come into the house i didnt know whether i should be welcome mildred tell me how all is going on then you have not received my letters addressed to bellagio and milan i wrote to tell you that papa is very seriously ill and begged you to return immediately did you get the letters no in fact i have heard nothing at all from any one of you directly nor indirectly for more than two months how extraordinary but how can the letters have miscarried i might give a guess but you would think me unjustly suspicious is my father really ill mildred really very seriously ill about a month ago he caught a bad cold and has never since been able to shake it off doctor spencer who has been attending him the whole time didnt apprehend any danger at first but now he almost despairs of papas recovery gracious heaven exclaimed the young man i didnt expect to be greeted by this sad intelligence you have only just come in time to see papa alive within the last few days a great change for the worse has taken place in him mamma has been most attentive and has scarcely ever left him she is acting her part well it seems cried chetwynd bitterly but dont call her mamma when you speak of her to me mildred let it be mrs calverley if you please i dont wish to pain you chetwynd but i must tell you the truth mrs calverley as you desire me to call her has shown the greatest devotion to her husband and doctor spencer cannot speak too highly of her she has had a great deal to go through i assure you since his illness poor papa has been very irritable and fretful and would have tried anybodys patiencebut she has an angelic temper you give her an excellent character mildred he remarked in a sceptical tone i give her the character she deserves chetwynd everybody will tell you the same thing all the servants idolise her you know what my opinion of her is and how dearly i love her she is quite a model of a wife dont speak of her in those rapturous terms to me mildred unless you desire to drive me away i cant bear it i wish to think kindly of my father now he has caused me much unhappiness but i forgive him i never can forgive her i own you have a good deal to complain of chetwynd and i have always pitied you you are the only person who does pity me i fancy mildred it is not often that a man is robbed of his intended bride by his own father it is quite true that teresa and i had quarrelled and that my father declared if i didnt marry her he would marry her himself but i didnt expect he would put his threats into executionstill less that she would accept him i didnt know the fickleness of your sex it is entirely your own fault chetwynd that this has happened said his sister but i know how much you have suffered in consequence of your folly and hasty temper and i wont therefore reproach you whatever your feelings may be it is your duty to control them now papa passed a very bad night and sent this morning for mr carteret the attorney and gave him instructions to prepare his will i always understood he had made his will mildred he made a handsome settlement uponhis wife it is as i tell you chetwynd mr carteret was alone with him in his room for nearly two hours this morning and i believe he was directed to prepare the will without delay and to return with it this evening indeed exclaimed chetwynd gloomily that bodes ill to meto both of us in fact he will leave all his property to teresato his wife i am certain of it nothing of the sort chetwynd cried his sister come into the house and see him if he has made up his mind to commit this act of folly and injustice all i can say wont prevent it ah here is carteret he exclaimed as a mail phaeton entered the lodge gate and drove up to the hall door the attorney and his clerk descended and leaving his carriage to the care of a groom mr carteret rang the bell come in at once chetwynd and you will be able to see papa before mr carteret is admitted come with mequick chetwynd suffered himself to be persuaded and passed through the drawingroom window with his sister but he was too late the attorney and his clerk had already gone upstairs ii teresa chetwynd only son of mr hugh calverley a retired liverpool merchant residing at ouselcroft in cheshire was somewhat singularly circumstanced as will have been surmised from the conversation just recountedbut he had only himself to blame rather more than a year agowhen he was just of agehe had fallen in love with his fathers ward teresa mildmay a young lady of great personal attractions but very small fortunehad proposed to her and been accepted teresa had lost both her parents her mother lady eleanor mildmay daughter of lord rockingham died when she was quite a child her father general mildmay an indian officer of distinction was one of mr calverleys most intimate friends and hence it chanced that the latter was appointed teresas guardian general mildmays demise occurred at cheltenham about two years prior to the commencement of our story by her guardians desire teresa then came to reside with his daughter at ouselcroft though mildred was two or three years younger than her friend and they were very dissimilar in character a sisterly affection subsisted between them originating when they were at school together at brighton their friendship had never since been disturbed to mildred therefore it was a source of the greatest satisfaction when teresa took up her abode with them the two girls differed as much in personal appearance as in character both were remarkably goodlooking teresa mildmay had a very striking countenance her features were classical in mould her complexion dark her eyes magnificent and arched over by thick black brows her tresses were black as jet luxuriant and of a silky texture and were always dressed in a manner that best suited her her figure was lofty and beautifully proportioned the expression of her face was decidedly proudtoo proud to be altogether agreeable nevertheless she was extremely admired teresa possessed great good sense and good judgment and was looked upon by her guardian as a model of prudence and propriety as he frequently consulted her upon household matters and indeed asked her advice upon many other points she naturally acquired considerable influence over him a very charming girl was mildred though her style was quite different from that of teresa she was a blonde a ravishingly fair complexion a dimpled cheek a lip fashioned like a cupids bow teeth like pearlsthese constituted her attractions her figure was slight but perfectly symmetrical and nothing could be sweeter than her smile such were the two fair inmates of ouselcroft before a change took place in the establishment having proposed to his fathers beautiful ward as we have stated and been accepted chetwynd who could not brook delay was anxious that the marriage should take place at once to this however the prudent teresa objected she was of a cold temperament and reflection convinced her that she had not done wisely in accepting chetwynd but for several reasons she hesitated to break off the engagement she did not like to lose a comfortable home and hoped that the young man who had hitherto been very careless and extravagant might turn over a new leaf in this expectation she was disappointed chetwynd was very handsome and agreeable and had many good qualities but his temper was excessively irritable and he was reckless in regard to expense his oxford debts which were heavy had been paid by his father and he then promised amendment but did not keep his word on the contrary he continued his extravagant courses though intended for the law he would not study but led a mere life of pleasureriding daily in the parks and visiting all public places of amusement and his father who was a great deal too indulgent did not check him on his return to ouselcroft after an absence of a couple of months during which he had not deemed it necessary to write to teresa she received him very coldly and provoked by her manner he told her next day when they were alone that he did not think he should be happy with her if you really believe so chetwynd she said the marriage ought not to take place i release you from your engagement the remarkable calmnessalmost indifferencewith which she spoke piqued him and he exclaimed very well i accept it there is an end of all between us scarcely were the words uttered than he repented and would have recalled them he looked appealingly at her but she seemed so cold that he became fortified in his resolution mr calverley soon learnt what had happened from mildred but feeling sure he could set matters right he sent for his son and insisted on his marrying miss mildmay on pain of his severest displeasure chetwynd refused point blank you wont cried the old gentleman ready to explode i have already given you an answer sir rejoined his son i adhere to my determination pray dont put yourself in a passion it wont have any effect upon me very well said mr calverley with difficulty controlling his rage since you decline to fulfil your engagement ill marry her myself ridiculous cried his son ridiculous or not youll find i shall be as good as my word pshaw the young lady wont accept you he was mistaken however the young lady did accept the old gentleman and so readily that it almost seemed she preferred him to his son within a month they were married before the marriage chetwynd went abroad and did not keep up any communication with his family they ascertained however that he was at bellagio on the lake of como apparently mr calverley had no reason to regret the extraordinary step he had taken teresa made him an excellent wife and seemed quite devoted to him she studied him in everythingread the newspaper to him of a morning chatted agreeably to him when they drove out together in the barouche played and sang to him in the evening and in short kept him constantly amused she managed his large establishment perfectlybetter than it had ever been managed before she quarrelled with none of his old friendseven though she might deem some of them boresbut always appeared delighted to see them above all she continued on the most affectionate terms with mildred who had never disapproved of the match nothing could be more judicious than her conduct at first everybody cried out mr calverley was an old fool but they soon said he was a very sensible man and exceedingly fortunate he was not however destined to enjoy a long term of happiness hitherto he had scarcely known a days illness but a few months after his marriage his health began rapidly to decline teresa tended him with the greatest solicitude iii mr calverley repairing to the invalids chamber we shall find mr calverley seated in an easychair his head supported by a pillow for nearly a fortnight he had not left his bed but he insisted on getting up that day he had been a finelooking old gentleman but he was now wonderfully reduced and his attire hung loosely on him still his countenance was very handsome his young wife was seated on a tabouret by his side watching him anxiously with her large black eyes she was wrapped in an indian shawl dressinggown which could not conceal her perfectlyproportioned figure give me a glass of wine teresa he said in a scarcely audible voice i feel that dreadful faintness coming on again she eagerly obeyed him with difficulty he conveyed the wine to his lips but having swallowed it he seemed better taking his wifes hand he looked at her earnestly as he thus addressed her i must soon leave you teresa nay do not interrupt me i know what you would say it must be my love i cannot be deceived as to my state you have been an excellent wife teresaa great comfort to mea very great comfort you are aware i have given my solicitor mr carteret instructions respecting my will i will now tell you what i have done i have the most perfect confidence in you teresa and i know you will carry out my instructions be sure of it my dear she murmured teresa he continued speaking very deliberately i have left my entire property to you to me she ejaculated a slight flush tinging her pale cheek oh love it is not right you should do this i am amply provided for already by the handsome settlement you made upon me and i tell you at once if you leave me your property i shall not keep it i shall divide it between chetwynd and mildred a faint smile lighted up the features of the dying man i had formed a correct opinion of you teresa he said looking at her affectionately i know the goodness of your heart and the rectitude of your principles then slightly changing his manner he added i must now make an effort to explain myself and i pray you to give strict attention to what i am about to say i have left you the whole of my property because i feel certain it will be placed in safe hands and i mean you to represent myself i listen she murmured first with regard to chetwynd i do not exactly know how he is circumstanced but i fear he is in debt he has always been extravagant i think it will be best to continue the allowance i have hitherto made him of six hundred a year for the present and if he marries or reforms let him have thirty thousand pounds it shall be done exactly as you enjoin said his wife earnestly beyond the sum i have settled on you teresa continued the old man i estimate my property at sixty thousand pounds of this one half is to go to chetwynd provided he reforms the other half to mildred on her marriage provided she marries with your consent this house with the plate pictures books furniture carriages and horses and all the lands attached to it are yoursfor life oh you are too good to me she exclaimed her eyes filling with tears i have now told you all he said i leave you mistress of everything and since you know my wishes i am sure you will act up to them i will i will she ejaculated in broken accents enough i shall now die content he then closed his eyes and his lips slightly moved as if in prayer teresa constrained her emotion by a strong effort and for a few minutes perfect silence prevailed the door was then softly opened by an elderly manservant out of livery who came to inform his master that mr carteret had returned show him up at once norris said mr calverley opening his eyes his clerk is with him said the butler show the clerk up as well rejoined the old gentleman shall i withdraw asked mrs calverley as the butler retired perhaps you had better my dear till the will is signed replied her husband mrs calverley remained till the attorney appeared and having exchanged a word in a low tone with him left the room iv father and son tall and thin and very businesslike in manner was mr carteret sitting down quietly beside the old gentleman and taking the will from his clerk he proceed to read it though conducted with due deliberation the ceremony did not occupy many minutes and when the attorney had finished reading the document mr calverley declared himself perfectly satisfied all you have to do is to sign it sir said the attorney accordingly a small table was placed beside the invalids chair and the will was duly executed and attested pray call in my wife said mr calverley as soon as this was done when mrs calverley reappeared she was informed by her husband that the will was executed yes the business is done madam observed mr carteret with a very singular expression of countenance shall i leave the document with you sir no take charge of it replied mr calverley well perhaps it will be best with me observed the attorney glancing at the lady as he spoke he was in the act of tying up the instrument preparatory to consigning it to his clerk when the door opened and chetwynd and his sister came in the old gentleman looked greatly startled by the unexpected appearance of his son and did not for a few moments recover his composure scarcely knowing what might ensue mrs calverley stepped between them i was not aware of your return chetwynd said mr calverley as soon as he was able to speak i have only just come back sir replied his son regarding him steadfastly i hope i have arrived in time to prevent you from doing an act of injustice to me and my sister you will have much to answer for chetwynd if you agitate your father at this moment interposed mrs calverley you see what a critical state he is in i cannot help it madam rejoined the young man i must and will speak to him while he is able to listen to me pray dont go i beg of you mr carteret he continued to the attorney who was preparing to follow his clerk out of the room it is proper you should hear what i have to say i have reason to believe sir he added to his father that you have left your entire property to your wife and have made my sister and myself entirely dependent on her if this is really the case i entreat you to alter your determination i dont understand why you permit yourself to talk to me thus chetwynd interrupted the old gentleman his anger supplying him with strength at all events i shall not tolerate it even supposing it were as you state i have a perfect right to bequeath my property as i see fit and you have not proved yourself such a dutiful son as to merit consideration on my part wait till the fitting season and you will learn what i have done no sir i wont wait till your ears are deaf to my prayers i will speak while you are able to listen to me i may have given you some offence but do not carry your resentment to the grave bethink you that whatever you do now will be irreparable i cannot bear this cried the old man take him away he distracts me mr chetwynd said carteret i am extremely reluctant to interfere but your presence certainly disturbs your father very much let me beg you to retire the young man showed no disposition to comply perhaps chetwynd when i have spoken said mr calverley trying to calm himself you will either go or keep silence i have done what on mature consideration and with the prospect of death before me i deem best for you and your sister and i am certain my wishes will be most faithfully carried out what you say sir seems to intimate that you have placed us entirely in the hands of your wife cried his son why should you compel us to bow to her will and pleasure because she will take care of you rejoined the old man and though you are twoandtwenty you have not come to years of discretion that is your opinion sir but granting it to be correct does it apply to my sister your sister makes no complaint said his father looking affectionately at her she knows i have done all that is right she is in good hands yes i am quite sure of that papa cried mildred pray dont think about me chetwynd she added to him in a low tone i wouldnt have brought you here had i imagined you would make this terrible scene i really must interfere to prevent the continuance of a discussion which i am aware can lead to no beneficial result interposed mr carteret i would again beseech you mr chetwynd not to trouble your father i know he has good reasons for what he has done have you anything further to say to me sir he added to mr calverley stop a minute mr carteret i beg of you cried chetwynd i am yet in hopes that i may move him let me make one more appeal to your sense of justice sir he added to his father i promise you it shall be the last i cannot listen to you replied mr calverley you refuse then to alter your will positively refuse rejoined the old gentleman for heavens sake let me die in peace can you not prevail on him to go he added to his wife and daughter he will kill me outright you hear what your father says cried mrs calverley in an authoritative tone go i command you yes i will go rejoined chetwynd but not at your bidding you are the sole cause of this misunderstanding between my father and myself by your arts you have cheated me out of my inheritance ah ejaculated mrs calverley this is madness exclaimed mr carteret trying to drag him from the room hear my last words sir cried chetwynd to his father i never will touch a shilling of your money if it is to be doled out to me by this woman and he rushed out of the room v the old butler pushing aside the attorneys clerk whom he found on the landing he hurried downstairs and had just snatched up his hat in the hall when he perceived the old butler eyeing him wistfully he had a great regard for this faithful old servant whom he had known since he was a boy so he went up to him and patting him kindly on the shoulder said goodbye dear old norris i dont mean to remain a minute longer in my fathers house and i may never return to it farewell old friend you shant go out thus sir unless you knock me down rejoined norris detaining him youll do yourself a mischief no one is in the diningroom please to go in there i want to have a few words with youto reason with you and he tried to draw him towards the room in question but chetwynd resisted reason with me he exclaimed i know what youll say norris youll advise me to make it up with my father and bow the knee to my stepmother but ill die rather mr chetwynd its a chance if your father is alive tomorrow morning think of that and what your feelings will be when hes gone youll reproach yourself then sir for i know youve a good heart ive got you out of many a scrape when you were a boy and im persuaded something may be done now if youll only condescend to listen to me well ill stay a few minutes on purpose to talk to you but i hear carteret coming downstairs i dont want to meet him i dont want to meet anybodynot even my sister then ill tell you what to do sir go up the back staircase to your own room its just as you left it no one will know youre here ill come to you as soon as i can and he almost forced him through a foldingdoor into a passage communicating with the back staircase chetwynd had disappeared before the attorney and his clerk reached the hall but mr carteret stopped for a moment to speak to the old butler ah weve had a frightful scene norris he said it will surprise me if the old gentleman survives it i suppose mr chetwynd is gone i really cant say sir he was here a few minutes ago looking rather wild eh im sure he looked wild enough when he passed me just now observed the clerk i thought hed have thrown me over the banisters serve you right too muttered norris nothing could be more injudicious and i may add more unfeeling than his conduct to his father remarked carteret im sorry to hear it said the butler but you must make some allowance for him i can make every allowance rejoined the attorney but no good purpose can be answered by such violence as he gave way to on the contrary irreparable harm is done not irreparable harm i hope sir i very much fear so he used language towards mrs calverley that i dont think she will ever forgive its of the last importance that he should be set right with her should you see him before he goes tell him so i will sirif i do see him theres masters bell excuse me i must go upstairs dont mind me norris i can let myself out as i drive back at mrs calverleys request i shall call on doctor spencer and send him to see mr calverley at once that will save time very good sir replied the butler and he flew upstairs while mr carteret and his clerk went out at the front door has anybody just left the house edward inquired mr carteret of his groom who was waiting with the phaeton near the door no sir replied the man i fancied he was not gone thought the attorney i am glad i spoke to norris vi selfexamination chetwynd had become more tranquillised since he entered the room that had once belonged to himand that might be said to belong to him stillsince it had always been kept for him a comfortable bedchamber with windows looking upon the garden night was now coming on but it was still light enough to see every object in the room and chetwynd examined them with interestalmost with emotion the furniture was precisely the same he had left the narrow iron bed without curtains and covered with an eiderdown quiltthe easychair on which he used to sit and smokethe books on the shelf and the prints on the walls were still there as of yore nothing seemed to have been disturbed when he last occupied that room teresa was his fathers ward and believing himself in love with her he indulged in dreams of future happinessfor there seemed no obstacle to their union now all was gone teresa had become hateful to him yet somehow or other her image was associated with the room throwing open the windows he looked out into the garden and after listening to the singing of the birds sat down in the easychair and tried to lay out a plan for the future impossible his mind was much too confused for the task he could decide on nothing never having done anything during his life but amuse himself he had no idea what he should have to do when thrown upon his own resources compelled to examine himself he found his knowledge of business exceedingly limited however he had plenty of friends and did not doubt they would help him to a situation of some kind the thought that most annoyed him was that he had wellnigh spent all his money he had not enough to pay a passage to australia at length norris made his appearance and explained that he could not come sooner having had a good deal to do in mr calverleys room doctor spencer had paid a visit to his patient and had only just left however all is quiet for the present said the butler and i will therefore beg you to come with me to my room where i have got a little supper for you i shall really be glad of it norris i suppose we shant meet any of the other servants no i have taken care of that sir replied norris in the butlers pantry to which they repaired they found a cold pigeonpie and a bottle of claret on the table and being very hungry chetwynd made a hearty meal im sorry i cannot give you a very good report of what has been going on upstairs sir said the butler though your father is not so bad as i feared he has been put to bed and doctor spencer has seen him as i told you the doctor gave him some stimulant that helped to revive him and has left a small phial with mrs calverley from which she is to administer a few drops to him as she may deem fit i hope he may last out the night and i think he will for he seemed better when i left him just now heaven grant you may see him again sir i despair of doing anything with him norris never despair sirnever despair well thats a good maxim extraordinary things have sometimes been done when all has been deemed hopeless fresh wills have been made almost in extremis it may be so in my fathers case but i dont think it likely you must remain in the house tonight sir its your last chance is there a chance norris you shall judge for yourself sir when i was in your fathers room just now standing by his bedside he spoke to me about you in a way that showed his good feelings towards you had returned evidently he didnt want mrs calverley to hear what he said but she was in the dressingroom though the door was partly open he asked me in a low voice if you were really gone and seemed much relieved when i told him you were still in the house but begged me not to mention it to his wife it may alarm her norris he said i couldnt say anything more to him at the time for she came out of the dressingroom but i shall have another opportunity tonight of one thing im certain sir but i shall have another opportunity tonight of one thing im certain siryou havent lost your hold of your fathers affections at this moment a slight sound outside caught chetwynds ear wishing to ascertain if there was a listener he immediately got up and opening the door looked along the passage right and left but it was quite dark and he could distinguish no one it was a false alarm he said as he came back for the moment i fancied it might be mrs calverley no fear of that sir she never comes down here let us go back to my room i shall feel easier there after what youve told me norris i shant think of leaving tonight thats the right thing to do sir cried the butler joyfully bring the bottle of claret and the glasses with you and come along said chetwynd vii terrible suspicions in half a minute more they were in the old room upstairs the blinds were drawn down the candles on the chimneypiece lighted the claret and glasses set on the table chetwynd was seated in an easychair and old norris had taken a place opposite him now norris said chetwynd i should like to ask you a few questions in the first place what is the matter with my father till i came here this evening i have never heard he was unwell what is his complaint what does doctor spencer say about him doctor spencer says its a complete break up replied the butler but i dont think he understands the case at all your father used to be a remarkably stout man for his years as i neednt tell you sir i never recollect him having a days illness till his marriage and indeed he was as well as ever for three months when he caught a cold and then a very sudden change occurred and i thought all would soon he over with himbut he rallied did he quite recover from his cold no sir he was much weakened and didnt regain his strength he looked to me as if gradually wasting away why so he was i suppose norris there is nothing but what is perfectly natural in all this yet you seem suspicious i hope he has been fairly treated sir why should you think otherwise because he has symptoms that i dont exactly like sir then lowering his voice as if afraid to speak the words aloud he added it looks to me almost like a case of slow poisoning chetwynd seemed horrorstricken at the idea you must be mistaken norris he said it cannot he whatever opinion i may entertain of the person it is evident you suspect i am certain she is incapable of such a monstrous crime have you mentioned your suspicions to doctor spencer or any one else i told doctor spencer i thought it a very strange illness but he said there was nothing unusual in itit was simply the result of a bad cold it was quite impossible he said that mr calverley could be more carefully attended to than by his wife she had really kept him alive i dont know what he would have said if i had ventured to breathe a word against her did you warn my father it was your duty to do so if you really believed he was being poisoned my immediate discharge would have been the consequence said norris and how could i prove what i asserted doctor spencer thought me a stupid old fool my master would have thought me crazy mrs calverley would have thought a lunatic asylum fitter for me than ouselcroft and miss mildred would have been of the same opinion so i held my tongue and let things go on had you been at home sir i should have consulted you and you could have taken such steps as you deemed proper but it is now too late to save him if this were true it would be dreadful exclaimed chetwynd but i cannot believe it it must have been found out doctor spencer who is a very clever shrewd man has been in constant attendance on my father and must have been struck by any unusual symptoms in his illness but he appears to have been quite satisfied that everything was going on properly to make an accusation of this sort with nothing to support it would have been culpable in the highest degree and i am glad you kept quiet still i can hardly reconcile my conduct to myself sir said norris but i fear i should have done no good no you would have done great mischief i am quite certain you are utterly mistaken norris did not seem to think so but he made no further remark after a brief silence he got up and said i must now go up to my masters room and see whether he wants anything perhaps i may find an opportunity of speaking to him viii death of mr calverley left alone chetwynd revolved what the butler had told him and on considering the matter he came to the conclusion he had previously arrived atthat there was nothing whatever to justify the old mans suspicions i cannot imagine how he has got such a notion into his head he thought but according to his own account he has not a shadow of proof to support the charge besides setting all else aside there is no motive for such a crime she could not wish to get rid of my father perhaps she might desire to come into the property but even if she were bad enough to do it she would never run such a frightful risk no no the supposition is absurd and monstrous at this moment the very person of whom he was thinking came in and closed the door in her hand she had a small lamp but she set it down she looked very pale but her manner was perfectly composed though there was a slight quivering of the lip chetwynd arose and regarded her in astonishment you need not be alarmed at my appearance she said i have no unfriendly intentions towards you i heard you were still here and came to speak to you i am anxious to prevent further unpleasantness you are acting very foolishly why should you quarrel with me whatever you may think i mean you well by this time chetwynd had recovered from his surprise and regarding her sternly said i have no desire to hold any conversation with you madam but my conduct requires explanation i was about to depart but have been induced to remain for various reasons i have learnt matters that have determined me to see my father again the latter words were pronounced with great significance but did not seem to produce any impression upon mrs calverley i do not wish to prevent you from seeing him chetwynd if you will promise to behave quietly she replied i cannot let him go out of the world in the belief that you have acted properly to him said chetwynd fiercely then you shall not see him nothing you could allege against me would produce the slightest effect upon him but you shall not disturb his latest moments you dare not leave me alone with him no she replied in a severe tone because you cannot control yourself in my opinion you ought to ask your fathers pardon for your manifold acts of disobedience and if you do so in a proper spirit i am certain you will obtain it you venture to give the advice he said but have you yourself obtained pardon from my father pardon for what she cried for any crime you may have committed he replied it is not for me to search your heart i disdain to answer such an infamous charge she rejoined contemptuously have you not shortened his days what mean you by that dark insinuation she cried my meaning is intelligible enough he rejoined but i will make it plainer if you will a singular change come over her countenance but she instantly recovered and threw a scornful glance at chetwynd what have you done to him he demanded striven to make his latter days happy she replied and i believe i have succeeded at any rate he seemed happy that was before his illness observed chetwynd since his illness i have nursed him with so much care that those best able to judge think i preserved his life i saved him from all pain and annoyance and his confidence in me was such that he has left all to my management i know it madam and you have been in haste to assume the power but it may be wrested from your hands make the attempt she rejoined defiantly you will only injure yourself just then voices were heard outside that startled them both and checked their converse great heaven it is your father exclaimed mrs calverley he has risen from the bed of death to come here next moment the door was thrown open and the old gentleman came in sustained by norris a dressinggown scarcely concealed his emaciated frame his features had the most ghastly expression and bore the impress of death but for the aid of the old butler he must have fallen to the ground behind him came mildred carrying a light why did you allow him to quit his couch cried his wife in a voice of anguish i remonstrated with him replied norris but i could not prevent him he would come down to see his son i likewise tried to dissuade him but in vain said mildred chetwynd is here is he not cried the old man i cant see him yes i am here father he replied springing towards him and throwing himself at his feet have you come to grant me forgiveness yes my son replied the old man but first let me hear that you are reconciled to my dear wifeyour stepmother answer me truly is it so father hesitated chetwynd stand up my son said the old man chetwynd obeyed now speak to me is there peace between you if you can forgive her father i will forgive her i have nothing to forgive she has been the best of wives to me and is without a fault these are my last words your blessing fatheryour blessing almost shrieked chetwynd the old man made an effort to raise his hands but strength and utterance failed him and he fell dead into his sons arms end of the introduction book the firstmildred i suitors mrs calverley had been nearly a year a widow she was still at ouselcroft and apparently meant to remain there no change whatever had been made in the establishment and old norris was still in his place the will had not been disputed and the widow was in possession of her late husbands entire property she intended to allow chetwynd six hundred a year in accordance with his fathers request and instructed mr carteret to pay him the amount quarterly but he peremptorily refused to accept any allowance from her and ordered the money to be returned he had remained at ouselcroft until after the funeral and then went abroad as may be supposed no reconciliation took place between him and his stepmother hitherto the fair widow had lived in perfect retirement with mildred and was only to be seen arrayed in deep mourning in daresbury church in the vaults of which her husband was interred but she now began to pay visits and receive her friends when mildred reappeared in society after her temporary seclusion she created quite a sensation we are afraid to say how many persons fell in love with her she was still in mourning of course but her dark attire set off her fair tresses and exquisitely delicate complexion and suited her slight graceful figure then her amiable and captivating manner heightened the effect of her charms and rendered her almost irresistible during her fathers lifetime she had been greatly admired and was accounted as we have said the prettiest girl in cheshire but her beauty was more talked about now and many a gallant youth thought himself excessively fortunate if he could obtain her hand for a waltz but mildred was by no means a flirt and had no desire to make conquests on the contrary she was a very quiet girl and gave the herd of young men who beset her at balls and parties very little encouragement she did not care to dance much and would only dance with those who pleased her or amused her there was no sort of rivalry between the lovely girl and her beautiful stepmother that there were already numerous aspirants to the hand of the wealthy young widow was certain but it was equally certain she was in no haste to take another husband she therefore felt no jealousy of mildred but was delighted to see her admired and sought after and would willingly have promoted any advantageous match mildred however made some objection or other to all who were recommended to her thus when mrs calverley praised young mr capesthorne and said he would have a fine old elizabethan mansion with a park attached to it and asked if he wouldnt do the young lady replied that she admired mr capesthornes old house but didnt care for him again when colonel blakemere who was about to return to madras and wanted to take a wife with him paid her marked attention and got mrs calverley to back his suit mildred settled the matter by declaring she would never go to india however these were nothing as compared with what followed it never rains but it pours and offers now came by the dozen mrs calverley received a number of little notes the writers whereof begged permission to wait upon her intimating that they had an important matter to lay before her and at the same time making some slight reference to mildred that left her no doubt as to their object before replying to any of them she consulted mildred and having ascertained her sentiments agreed to see a couple of them on a particular day and within half an hour of each other on the appointed day she was alone in the drawingroom seated in an easychair and wondering who would appear first when mr vernon brook was announced by norris mr vernon brook belonged to a good old family but was a younger son dark sallowcomplexioned and longvisaged he piqued himself upon having a vandyke face to assist the expression he scrupulously shaved his cheeks and cultivated a pointed beard he had ridden over from his fathers place which was about ten miles off and arrived in very good spirits deeming himself sure of success mrs calverley received him very graciously and begged him to be seated after a few words had passed between them he came to the point ive a question to ask you my dear mrs calverley which i hope you will be able to answer in the affirmative your daughterstepdaughter i ought to sayis a very charming girl and i want to know if i have your permission to pay my addresses to her he said this in a very easy manner and as if quite certain the response would be favourable mrs calverleys looks rather discouraged him i must be allowed to consider the matter mr brook she replied my late husband entrusted his daughter entirely to my care and i cannot allow an engagement to take place unless i feel sure it would conduce to her happiness but this would not amount to an engagement my dear madam though it might lead to oneat least i hope so it will be best to come to a clear understanding at first mr brook i think it right to say that i see no objection to you you have many agreeable personal qualities and are unexceptionable in regard to family but i am not exactly aware of your expectations vernon brooks dark cheek coloured and he rather hesitated he was not prepared for such a pointblank question i am a younger son as you are aware mrs calverley he said and like most younger sons my expectations are not very great i may as well speak frankly mr brook she rejoined he who aspires to miss calverleys hand must bring a corresponding fortune he must have a thousand a year or a prospect of it i am sorry to say i have neither the one nor the other but i hope my want of fortune may not be a bar i think we could be very happy together possibly but the days of romantic marriages are over and only exist in novels i have dealt with you very fairly mr brook miss calverley as i have said was left to my care by her father and i shall act for her as he would have acted but i have reason to believe mr calverley would not have made it a sine qua non that a suitor to his daughter should be a man of property you have been misinformed mr brook no one can be so well acquainted as myself with my late husbands intentions then i am not to hope it would be useless sir mr vernon brook arose and was reluctantly preparing to depart when norris announced sir bridgnorth charlton thereupon he hurriedly bade mrs calverley adieu bowed stiffly to the newcomer and made his exit ii sir bridgnorth charlton sir bridgnorth charlton baronet of charlton hall in staffordshire a very fine place was a person of considerable importance he had been a member for the county and was still a zealous politician that he had not married earlier in life was owing to a disappointment he experienced which had deeply affected him and caused him to remain a bachelor in age sir bridgnorth was not far from sixty still handsome though rather portly and exceedingly gentlemanlike in manner he had seen mildred at a county ball and being much struck by her resemblance to his former love the old flame was revived and he determined to offer his hand accordingly he wrote to mrs calverley as we have explained sir bridgnorth had never been in ouselcroft before and after a few observations on the beauty of the grounds he said you will no doubt have conjectured why i have done myself the honour of waiting upon you maam mrs calverley slightly moved you have a very lovely stepdaughter it is not necessary for me to launch into her praises but i may say i have only seen one person in the course of my life who has charmed me so much that person would have been my wife had she not jilted me and wedded another miss calverley shall be lady charlton if she will accept me you do us great honour sir bridgnorth observed mrs calverley i dont know whether i am right maam he pursued but i prefer making this offer through you instead of direct to the young lady as you can put an end to the affair at once if you think proper i neednt enter into any particulars you know my position you know what sort of place i have got you know i can make a good settlement on my wife as well as give her a title the main question iswill miss calverley have me is she wholly free for i would not for the world interfere with any other engagement i have suffered too much myself not to be careful i am not foolish enough to persuade myself she can love me but i believe i could make her a very good husband and hope she would be happy i am quite sure she would be indulged he said this with an honest manly sincerity that produced a strong effect upon mrs calverley in a voice of some emotion she remarked my own husband as i neednt tell you sir bridgnorth was considerably older than myself and no one could be happier than i was with him you encourage me to hope madam that the disparity of years may not prove an objection supposing the young lady to be entirely disengaged may i be permitted to see her most certainly sir bridgnorth i would much rather she answered for herself than i should answer for her ah i see her in the garden if you will step out with me to the lawn i will present you to her sir bridgnorth willingly complied though he felt some little internal trepidation a variety of emotions agitated him mildred was at the further end of the lawn but she came to meet them and he thought her even more charming in her simple morning costume than in evening dress i had the pleasure of seeing you at the ball at stafford the other night miss calverley he said after the presentation had taken place you interested me exceedingly from the striking resemblance you bear to a young lady to whom i was tenderly attached in former days i will tell you that little story some time or other should you desire to hear it meantime it may suffice to say that i was actually engaged to her but she threw me over for a betterlooking man and married him it was a severe blow and i did not recover it for a long time i made up my mind never to marry and for fiveandtwenty years adhered to my determination but see what our resolutions are worth the sight of you dispelled mine in a moment as i gazed at you my youth seemed to return i felt as much enamoured as i had done before and it was with difficulty i could prevent myself from going up to you and saying behold your lover i am very glad you didnt sir bridgnorth said mildred i knew you would think me a madman he continued and fearing i might be guilty of some indiscretion i would not even be introduced to you but i watched you throughout the evening and your image has haunted me ever since feeling that my happiness is at stake i have come here to plead my cause in person and have just spoken to mrs calverley now you know all not quite all my love said mrs calverley i am bound to add that in making his proposal to you through me sir bridgnorth has behaved in the handsomest manner i am convinced of it said mildred but do not crush my hopes at once cried sir bridgnorth in alarm give me the chance of winning your affections i dont desire an immediate answer but i am very fickle myself sir bridgnorth and extremely liable to change my mind you shall have no reason to complain of me as you do of your former love i dont complain of her he said in a quiet tone then you are extremely forgiving for in my opinion she used you shamefully you must not say a word against her exclaimed sir bridgnorth why not inquired mildred in surprise for an excellent reason he replied she was your own mother mildred could scarcely repress a cry i thought as much said mrs calverley your fair inconstant was the beautiful annabella chetwynd my husbands first wife exactly so said sir bridgnorth i never beheld her since her marriage he added to mildred no wonder therefore your appearance produced such an effect upon me for a moment i thought she had come to life again i shall always take an interest in you and shall always be delighted to serve you since i cannot be your husband you must allow me to be a friend that offer i gladly accept sir bridgnorth she replied extending her hand towards him he took it and pressed it to his lips you may rely upon me as you could have done upon your own father he said with an earnestness that bespoke his sincerity call on me when you will i will answer the appeal and now farewell i hope you are not going sir bridgnorth said mrs calverley pray stay and spend the remainder of the day with us i am charmed to make your acquaintance i shall be quite grieved if you go dear sir bridgnorth added mildred since you ask me i cannot refuse he replied but my carriage is waiting at the door i will give orders that it shall be put up immediately said mrs calverley it is so kind of you to stay and she went into the house to give the necessary directions iii inquiries mildred now felt quite at ease with sir bridgnorth his manner towards her was so kind that she almost began to regard him in the light of a father excuse me if i ask you a few questions relative to your brother chetwynd he said i am influenced by no impertinent curiosity but simply by the desire to ascertain if i can be of any service to him i am aware that a serious misunderstanding occurred between him and mrs calverley at the time of your fathers death and i have also heard that he absolutely refuses to accept any allowance from her what you have heard is quite correct sir bridgnorth replied mildred mrs calverley desires to allow my brother six hundred a year and has instructed mr carteret her solicitor to pay him the amount quarterly but he declines to receive the money being excessively indignant that my father should have left her the entire control of his property but what has become of your brother what is he doing i really cannot tell you sir bridgnorth she replied he came here just before poor papas death and remained till after the funeral but he shut himself up in his own room and saw no one except old norris the butler who is still with us i had no idea he was going away so suddenly for he did not acquaint me with his intention or even take leave of me or i would have tried to dissuade him from the step though i fear i should have been unsuccessful his mind seemed a good deal disturbed by painful circumstances that had occurredchiefly if not entirely of his own causingand i dreaded to excite him still farther i have since reproached myself for my lukewarmness but i acted under the advice of doctor spencer after his abrupt departure he wrote to me from an hotel in london saying he was going abroad and in all probability should not return for two or three years but mr carteret found out that he was still in town and sent him a cheque for three hundred pounds the cheque was returned at once accompanied by a letter stating that he would accept nothing from mrs calverley his conduct is inexplicable said sir bridgnorth but i suppose some effort has been made to communicate with him every effort has been made but without any satisfactory result he left the hotel i have mentioned with the expressed intention of going abroad whether he really did so we have been unable to discover we fear he has no resources we know from norris whom he took into his confidence while he was here that he had very little money that is dreadful exclaimed sir bridgnorth he was pointed out to me a year or two ago at ascot and i thought him a remarkably fine young man but i was told he was very wild and extravagantplayed and betted heavily he has been very extravagant sir bridgnorth poor papa paid his debts more than once but could never keep him in bounds that was the reason why he left him dependent upon mamma so i understood said sir bridgnorth and i think he did quite right i am sure he acted for the best replied mildred and i am quite certain mrs calverley would have carried out papas intentions had she been able but chetwynd thwarted their designs by his fiery and ungovernable temper heaven knows what will become of him she exclaimed the tears starting to her eyes it makes me very unhappy to think of him i fear i have distressed you observed sir bridgnorth much touched perhaps i ought not to have spoken i thank you sincerely for talking to me about my poor brother she replied i may appear indifferent to him but i am not so i love him dearly and would do anything for him but i know not how to proceed such is the peculiarity of his tempersuch his pride that if i could find him he would accept nothing from me if he thought it came from mrs calverley even if he were starving he would refuse aid from her well i must try what i can do said sir bridgnorth he can have no antipathy to me the first thing is to discover where he is i will see carteret and hear what he has to say i thank you from the bottom of my heart sir bridgnorth cried mildred with effusion you are indeed a father both to poor chetwynd and myself just then mrs calverley reappeared no more on this subject before mamma i pray sir bridgnorth said mildred it would be painful to her i will be careful he replied mrs calverley came to say that luncheon was ready and they went into the house with her iv portraits the more sir bridgnorth saw of mildred the better pleased he was with her mrs calverley did not produce quite so favourable an impression upon him though he thought her very beautiful and very clever she seemed to him wanting in heartperhaps designing taking this view of her character he came to the conclusion that she had married mr calverley for his money and possibly might have alienated him from his son three or four of mildreds admirers called during the afternoon and they all seemed surprised at finding sir bridgnorth so much at home at ouselcroft they could not believe that mildred had accepted himyet it looked rather like it the young lady however did not trouble herself much about them but leaving them to stroll about the garden with mrs calverley she took sir bridgnorth to the library telling him she wanted to show him a picture it was the portrait of a very handsome young man painted by a wellknown artist of the day the features were regular and finely formed and very haughty in expression the likeness was excellent and sir bridgnorth recognised it at once tis your brother chetwynd he said and wonderfully like him i should have known it anywhere he was extremely handsome then observed mildred but i fear he must be much changed now at that time he thought he should have all his fathers property and expected to marry the beautiful teresa mildmay yes i know the story said sir bridgnorth and do not wonder at his vexation at the double disappointment he has suffered much for his hasty temper things look very dark just now but let us hope all may come right in the end she then drew his attention to another picture your father yes i see time was when i should have turned away from his portrait but i have quite forgiven him now since poor papas death mrs calverley cannot bear to look at that portrait remarked mildred but for my entreaties she would have it put away and she now rarely enters the room that is not surprising said sir bridgnorth the portrait awakens painful memories but i am always pleased to look at it and i loved papa dearly said mildred i often come here by myself and think i am with him at this juncture their discourse was interrupted by the sudden entrance of the very last person they expected to see v the pocketbook it was chetwynd he looked pale and haggard and his features had a sombre and stern expression very different from that depicted in the canvas before them he closed the door after him as he came in and started on perceiving sir bridgnorth whom he evidently had not expected to find there uttering an exclamation of mingled surprise and delight mildred sprang towards her brother and flung her arms round his neck while returning her embrace he said in a low voice who have you got with you sir bridgnorth charlton she replied he takes great interest in you and has just been making inquiries about you not many minutes ago i told your sister it would give me sincere pleasure if i could render you any service said sir bridgnorth i did not expect so soon to have an opportunity of saying the same thing to you i beg you will look upon me as a friend i am greatly beholden to you sir bridgnorth replied the young man i have very few friends left mine are not mere idle professions as you will find if you choose to put them to the proof said sir bridgnorth you speak so earnestly and so kindly that i cannot but credit what you say rejoined chetwynd and i am the more inclined to believe you since i have never done you a favour indeed if my recollection serves me right you have more reason to dislike than to befriend me your sister will tell you that the past is forgotten sir bridgnorth has a noble heart said mildred you may speak freely before him he knows all that has occurred and is aware that you have refused to accept any allowance from mrs calverley and i may add that i sympathise with you said sir bridgnorth what has brought you back so suddenly said mildred are you in any difficulty in a most desperate difficulty he replied i want two hundred pounds and must have the money by tomorrow morning i could procure it at once from carteret but i would rather shoot myself than accept a farthing from mrs calveriey can you help me i can interposed sir bridgnorth quickly luckily i have the amount about me in this pocketbook he added producing one as he spoke you will find the sum you require repay me at your convenience a thousand thanks sir bridgnorth cried chetwynd you have indeed conferred a very great obligation upon me and i shall not speedily forget it ere long i hope to be able to return you the money dont trouble yourself on that score but let me see you soon come to me at charlton i cannot promise to visit you immediately sir bridgnorth replied the young man why not inquired mildred do not ask me to explain he rejoined i am scarcely my own master and where i to make a promise i might not be able to fulfil it i must now begone stay cried sir bridgnorth can i not bring about a reconciliation between you and mrs calveriey i think i could accomplish it if you will consent to some arrangement never replied chetwynd and i beg that my visit and its object may not be mentioned to her how did you discover i was in this room asked mildred old norris whom i saw on my arrival told me i should find you in the library and i concluded you were alone but i have found a friend as well and now i can answer no more questions ever mysterious and incomprehensible cried mildred i do not like to part with you thus you must he rejoined it is necessary that i should be in london tonight he then bade them both farewell tenderly embracing his sister and renewing his thanks to sir bridgnorth just as he was about to depart the door was opened by old norris who called out mrs calverley is coming to the library i wont see her cried chetwynd fiercely but there was no retreat and he was compelled to remain in another moment mrs calverley appeared her astonishment at beholding chetwynd may be imagined nor though she strove to veil it could she altogether conceal her annoyance i did not expect to find you here chetwynd she said i came to see my sister madam he replied haughtily and having had a brief interview with her i am now about to depart and with a stiff bow he quitted the room as soon as she could recover her speech mrs calverley observed to sir bridgnorth you see with what impracticable material i have to deal any friendly overture on my part is always scornfully rejected well chetwynd must take his own course and if he suffers for his wilfulness he has only himself to blame do you feel at liberty to tell me what he came about mildred i do not she replied you were present at the interview i suppose sir bridgnorth quite unintentionally madam he answered and my lips are sealed this incident rather threw a damp upon the pleasure of the day mrs calverley looked displeased and mildred appeared anxious and thoughtful so sir bridgnorth ordered his carriage but before taking his departure he had a little private conversation with mildred and promised to come over again to ouselcroft on an early day vi brackley heath mrs calveriey had a very pretty pony phaeton which she was accustomed to drive herself easy as a loungingchair and with the two longtailed bay ponies attached to it the luxurious little vehicle formed a very nice turnout one fine morning about a week after sir bridgnorths visit mrs calverley and mildred set out in the pony phaeton with the intention of calling on lady barfleur and her daughter at brackley hall which was about six or seven miles from ouselcroft usually they were attended by a groom but on this particular occasion he was left at home the ponies were full of spirit and eager to get on but the ladies would not indulge them and proceeded quietly along the pleasant lanes through a rich and fertile district abounding in farms where some of the best cheeses in the county are made to reach brackley hall however they had to cross an extensive heath a great part of which was very wild and marshy but this brown and uncultivated tract where turf alone was cut and where there were two or three dangerous swamps offered the charm of contrast to the rich meadows they had just quitted here there were no farmhouses no cowsheds no large bams no orchards but the air was fresh and pleasant and lighted up by the brilliant sunshine even brackley heath looked well at least our fair friends thought so and the ponies were compelled to walk in consequence yet there was nothing remarkable in the prospect as the reader shall judge the whole scene owed its charm to the fine weather on the left the heath was bordered by the woods belonging to brackley hall and through a break in them the upper part of the fine old timber and plaster mansion could be descried on the right the country was flat and uninteresting planted in places by rows of tall poplars and a canal ran through it communicating with the river mersey in front but at some distance rose a hill crowned by the ruins of an old castle and having a small village and grey old church in the immediate neighbourhood in bad weather the heath had a dreary and desolate aspect here and there a hut could be perceived but these miserable habitations were far removed from the road and might have been deserted since no smoke issued from them and nothing could be seen of their occupants a few sheep were scattered about in spots where the turf was covered with herbage but they seemed wholly untended rooks there were in flocks from brackley park plovers and starlings even seagulls found their way to the morass while the ladies were contemplating this scene which they thought highly picturesque and commenting upon its beauties they were startled and indeed terrified by the sudden appearance of two formidablelooking fellows who had been watching their approach from behind an aged and almost branchless oak that grew near the road evidently from their peculiar garb tawny skin black eyes and raven locks these individuals were gipsies they did not leave their purpose in doubt for a moment but rushing towards the ladies with threatening gestures shouted to them to stop mrs calverley tried to whip on the ponies but before they could start off they were checked by one of the gipsies who seized the reins while his comrade addressing mrs calverley demanded her whip and as she hesitated to give it up he snatched it from her and threw it on the ground excuse my freedom my lady he said in accents meant to be polite but that sounded gruff and menacing we cant allow you to go till weve had some talk with you but we wont detain you longer nor we can help we wants any money you may have about you together with ornaments rings watches earrings and sich like deliver em up quietly and you wont be molestedwill they ekiel no replied the other ruffian who stood at the heads of the ponies it would hurt our feelins to use wiolence to two sich lovely creaters meanwhile mildred who wished to preserve her watch which had been given her by her father was trying to detach it from the guard but could not accomplish her object without attracting the attention of the gipsy near mrs calverley dashing round to the other side of the carriage he caught hold of the chain and broke it but failed to secure the watch mildred screamed loudly though she had little expectation of help look quick clynch shouted ekiel in a warning voice give me the watch without more ado cried the gipsy to mildred but she spread her hands over it and redoubled her outcries here take my purse and begone said mrs calverley thank ye my lady rejoined clynch quickly appropriating the purse but thats not enough we must have everything youve got about you you shall have nothing more fellow cried mrs calverley with great spirit and see assistance is at hand if you stay a minute longer you will be caught and as she spoke a gentleman was seen galloping towards them followed by a groom baulked of their prey the gipsies ran off and made for the morass with the intricacies of which they seemed well acquainted a minute or so afterwards their deliverer came up a finelooking young man between twenty and thirty and having decidedly a military air but a stranger to them both vii captain danvers i hope you have lost nothing ladies cried the stranger the robbers have taken my purse replied mrs calverley and but for your timely aid they would have carried off all our ornaments my chain is gone said mildred but i dont mind it they did not get my watch which i value extremely i owe its preservation entirely to you sir she added with a grateful look at the stranger i am happy to find i have been of any service to you he replied bowing follow the rascals tom he added to his groom and try to capture one or both of them impossible i fear captain replied the groom they can go where no horse can go in that marsh if they know the ground as they seem to do but ill do my best and he speeded after the fugitives who were still in sight hold the reins for a minute mildred while i pick up my whip said mrs calverley allow me cried the stranger and jumping down from the saddle he presented the whip to mrs calverley who gracefully acknowledged the attention we are really very much indebted to you sir she said you greatly overrate the service he rejoined i have literally done nothing hearing cries and perceiving you were stopped by robbers i galloped on to your aidthat is all may we learn the name of our deliverer she asked i am captain charles danvers he replied nephew to sir lycester barfleur of brackley hall which you can see through the trees yonder but i dare say you know the place we were on our way thither to call on lady barfleur when we met with this alarming adventure observed mrs calverley an idea seemed suddenly to occur to captain danvers are you not mrs calverley of ouselcroft he inquired she replied in the affirmative adding and this is my stepdaughter miss calverley i felt convinced of it he cried again bowing i am indeed fortunate in obtaining an introduction to a young lady of whom i have heard so much you can pay compliments as well as rescue ladies from robbers it seems captain danvers observed mildred slightly blushing we should have met you i have no doubt at brackley hall very likely he rejoined but i prefer an accidental meeting of this kind it is more romantic i hope you are not going to turn back if you are you must allow me to escort you but they will be delighted to see you i am sure at brackley and you can recount your adventure to them and extol your gallantry at the same time captain danvers laughed mildred i have quite recovered from my fright mamma so i think we may as well go on do by all means cried captain danvers vaulting on his horse mrs calverley assented and they were just setting off when the groom was seen returning so they waited until he came up i see you have failed tom said his master yes captain replied the man touching his hat im very sorry but it was no use attempting to follow them i should have got over head and ears in a quagmire immediate information of the robbery must be given to the police at frodsham said captain danvers it is scarcely worth while to take any more trouble about the matter said mrs calverley my purse had very little in it and i dont care much for my chain since my watch is safe added mildred the party then set off but not at a very quick pace for captain danvers rode by the side of the ponycarriage and chatted with its fair occupants viii brackley hall captain danvers lias already been described as a handsome young man of about fiveandtwenty and it may now be added that he was tall wellmade and had marked featuresthe manly character of his physiognomy being heightened by his brown moustaches a dark velveteen shootingcoat boots of supple leather that ascended to the knee where they were met by a pair of knickerbockersloose dutchlooking trousersformed his costume while his brown curling locks were covered by a black felt hat such as it was the dress suited him and both ladies thought it very becoming captain danvers was in a cavalry regiment which was quartered at madras and he had recently come home on leave his father sir gerard danvers resided at offham court in kent and was thought very wealthy unluckily charles danvers was not an eldest son the party had now entered the park and were proceeding along a fine avenue leading to the house which stood right in front of them brackley hall which was in admirable preservation considering its great antiquity dated back to the period of edward the fourth or even earlier constructed almost entirely of timber and plaster it was remarkable for the singularity of its form it was only three storeys high the upper storey projecting far beyond the lower but the summit of the building was occupied by a lofty gallery more than a hundred feet in length that looked externally like a lantern since it had continuous ranges of windows on every side most curious was the timberwork the gables and lintels being richly carved as was the porch the immense bay windows which constituted the chief beauty of the house were framed with heavy transom bars and exquisitely latticed in the courtyard was a chapel surmounted in olden times by a tall square tower but this had been taken down the hall was surrounded by a moat and approached by a wide stone bridge another bridge communicated with the gardens which were extensive and laid out in a quaint formal style with terraces stone steps fountains quincunxes clipped yewtrees alleys and a bowlinggreen we must not omit to mention that the old mansion had the reputation of being haunted adjoining the house was a grove of noble elms wherein a colony of rooks had been settled for centuries about half a mile off at the rear of the mansion was a small lake or mere remarkable for the blackness of its water but black as was the mere it abounded with fish and at certain times of the year was a great resort of wild fowl captain danvers had sent on his groom to the hall to inform sir leycester and lady barfleur that mrs calverley was coming on to call on them and also to explain what had occurred consequently when the ladies had crossed the bridge and entered the court they found sir leycester and lady barfleur with the fair emmeline waiting to receive them and they had no sooner alighted than they were overwhelmed with expressions of sympathy some of the servants who were assembled in the court seemed likewise greatly excited sir leycester an old foxhunter and rather choleric was excessively wroth and vowed he would never rest till he had caught the rascals he had no idea whatever he said that the country was infested with such vermin but catch them he would mrs calverley endeavoured to dissuade him from his purpose but in vain i only waited to see you or i should have been off before he said youll excuse me quitting you so abruptly since i am going on your business but id much rather you didnt go sir leycester said mrs calverley im afraid the gipsies may offer a desperate resistance im sure they will added mildred no matter ill have them rejoined sir leycester if you really are going on this gipsyhunt my dear uncle ill go with you said captain danvers no no i dont want you charles rejoined sir leycester remain with the ladies you must stay till i return my dear mrs calverley she promised that she would and after a word or two with lady barfleur he proceeded to the stables and ordered a hunter to be saddled immediately he also told booth the coachman on whom he could place reliance that he should require him and a couple of grooms to attend him while the horses were being saddled a footman brought a brace of pistols which sir leycester had sent for armed with these and accompanied by booth and one of his own grooms together with his nephews groom tom he set out on the expedition shaping his course towards the further side of the morass where he expected to find some traces of the robbers ix lady barfleur lady barfleur had been a very fine woman in her day and though her beauty was now somewhat passed she was still a stately dame and accorded extremely well with the old mansion of which she was mistress the drawingroom to which she conducted her visitors was a very splendid apartment and merits a brief description the ceiling was adorned with pendants and the upper part of the walls was covered with a profusion of plaster ornaments among which were the arms of elizabeth and james the first the dark oak wainscoting was richly carved in arches and pilasters producing a very fine effect the principal feature of the room however was the magnificent fireplace rising to a great height it was adorned with pillars and sculptured figures that supported the architrave above which were emblazoned the arms of the barfleurs the furniture was consistent with the antique character of the roomnone of it being of a later date than the early part of the seventeenth century as lady barfleur moved slowly and somewhat stiffly about this noble apartment or seated herself in a highbacked chair carved in oak black as ebony she looked as if she belonged to the same date as the furniture and her hair having become prematurely grey aided the illusion not so emmeline she was a very charming representative of the young lady of our own period an exceedingly pretty brunette she had splendid black eyes shaded by long silken lashes and arched over by finelypencilled brows lovely features ripe red lips and teeth like pearlsand as she was very lively the latter were often displayed she was not tall but her figure was symmetry itself and cinderella might have envied her tiny feet she was about the same age as mildred and they were great friends at first the discourse turned chiefly upon the robbery which lady barfleur begged might be fully described to her but it was soon changed to other topics for awhile captain danvers seemed undecided whether to devote himself to the beautiful and wealthy widow or her lovely stepdaughter but at length he began to pay exclusive attention to the former probably because she gave him most encouragement indeed mrs calverley seemed more favourably inclined towards him than to any other suitor since her husbands death captain danvers it appeared had only arrived at brackley a few days previously and this accounted for his not having met the ladies of ouselcroft before whether mildred was altogether pleased by having him carried off in this manner we will not say not the slightest sign of annoyance was manifest she laughed and chatted gaily with emmeline and when that young lady proposed that they should go and look at the gallery she readily assented and left mrs calverley in quiet possession of the handsome captain x the gallery ascending a beautiful spiral oak staircase the two young ladies soon reached the gallery which it has already been mentioned was situated at the top of the house like all the other rooms in the old mansion the gallery was maintained in its original state at all events it had undergone no alteration since as appeared from an inscription above the door exceedingly light and cheerful as might be expected from the multitude of windows it seemed of immense size it had a wooden roofthe rafters being painted and the panels were covered with tapestry or hung with family portraits in the room were several curious old cabinets i am always charmed with this gallery exclaimed mildred as she gazed around it in admiration if i lived here i should spend all my time in it you would get tired of it rejoined emmeline for my part i prefer my own little chamber with its carved oak bedstead and beautiful baywindow yes your room is very pretty but not to be compared with this grand gallery the gallery is too large to be pleasant said emmeline indeed i rarely come here unless we have company but do sit down i want to have a little private and confidential talk with you i hope you have some affair of the heart to communicate said mildred as she sat down on an oldfashioned sofa covered with utrecht velvet and just large enough for two while emmeline placed herself beside her and took her hand you must know then began miss barfleur that two or three years ago i had a ttette with a very handsome young man we were seated on this very sofa mamma and several other persons were present but they were too far off to overhear what passed that is one advantage of a very large room remarked mildred but i am sorry this ttette occurred so long ago i hope it has been renewed no and i fear it never will be renewed sighed emmeline but i have not forgotten it did it come to a positive proposal inquired mildred not exactly but if the gentleman had proposed i am sure i should have accepted him and i feel i never can love any one else you think so now i suppose he is still unmarried shortly after the interview i have mentioned he was engaged to another person but the engagement was broken off and he is now free have you seen him again lately not for a long long time mildred but i love him still despite his inconstancy and i should like to know something about him emmeline said mildred regarding her fixedly you are not referring to my brother chetwynd to whom else could i refer was the reply mildred uttered an exclamation of surprise i perfectly remember chetwynd speaking of you in rapturous terms she said and telling me he had had a strong flirtation with you in the gallery at brackley hall but i had no idea you were at all serious on the occasion oh what a chance of happiness he has missed had he been fortunate enough to possess you how different would have been his life i loved him said emmeline with emotion and i dont believe teresa mildmay ever did i entirely agree with you remarked mildred i have listened to your recital with the deepest interest dearest emmeline and i wish i could give you a good account of chetwynd but i really cannot i saw him the other day but only for a few minutes at ouselcroft inquired emmeline eagerly yes he came there quite unexpectedly and left immediately i am afraid his hasty departure doesnt look as if he had made up his quarrel with mrs calverley alas no and i greatly fear he never will become reconciled to her perhaps you are aware he wont accept anything from her yes and i admire his spirit still he is very foolish he is punishing himself not her but he adhered to his word i shouldnt like him half so much if he yielded then your regard wont be lessened for i feel certain he wont yield i judged him rightly you see said emmeline and i persuade myself he will triumph in the end and now dearest mildred before we finish our discourse will you faithfully promise to let me know when you next see him or hear from him i wont delude you emmeline i dont expect either to see him or hear from him sir bridgnorth charlton has very kindly undertaken to look after him but he may not have an opportunity of doing so unlike anybody else chetwynd seems to shun those who love him or would serve him i hope he wont shun me said emmeline not if he could be made aware that you take an interest in him but how convey the information he does not correspond with me and i dont even know his address or what way a letter could reach him then i must remain in the same state of uncertainty as ever said emmeline in a despairing tone you give me small comfort mildred i pity you from my heart dearest emmeline but comfort you i cannot for a moment emmeline seemed overpowered by emotion she then found relief in tears and her head dropped on mildreds shoulder think of him no morethink of him no more cried mildred he does not deserve your love i his sister say so emmeline made no response but continued to sob neither of them were aware that lady barfleur had entered the gallery greatly surprised at what she beheld her ladyship stood still fortunately she did not hear the words uttered by mildred so she could only guess at the cause of this sudden outburst of grief at length she announced her presence by a slight cough and mildred perceived her calm yourself dearest girl she whispered to emmeline your mother is here here exclaimed emmeline looking up yes i see can she have heard anything i think not but be calm or you will betray yourself thereupon they both arose and emmeline did her best to repress her emotion and succeeded in forcing a smile you will scold me mamma when you learn that i have been so foolish as to weep at a very pathetic story told me by mildred she said i am glad to find it is nothing serious replied lady barfleur have you come to tell us that papa has captured the gipsies no he has not yet returned replied lady barfleur i came to let you know that mrs calverly and captain danvers have gone to the garden perhaps you may like to join them there shall we mildred by all means was the reply i shouldnt think i had been at brackley unless i had had a stroll in the delightful old garden dont wait for me ill follow said lady barfleur glad to escape further questioning the two delinquents flew down the spiral staircase and hastened to the garden xi what passed in the garden do you know mrs calverley i have never been at your place ouselcroft and i hear its uncommonly pretty this remark was made by captain danvers as he was seated by the side of the charming widow on a bench near one of the fountains come and see it and judge she replied we shall be at home tomorrow give me the greatest pleasure to ride over he said a country place is charming but i almost wonder you havent got a house in town i think of taking one she replied mildred has never been in townnever resided there i ought to say her papa objected to noise and racketdidnt care for the parks or the opera and disliked large parties i dont think he could have stood a season in town i prefer quietude and the country myself however mildred ought to be considered and as she wishes to mix a little more with society than she is able to do here we shall go to london for a time pon my soul youre exceedingly kind cried the captain miss calverley is blessed with a most indulgent mammasister i was going to say but i recollected myself in time i shall make her as happy as i can so long as she remains with me replied mrs calverley when my late husband entrusted his daughter to my care he knew i should do my duty to her and your first duty he remarked with a smile is to get her well married that will be easily accomplished for i hear there are many prtendants no wondershe is a most lovely creature and will have a very good fortune said mrs calverley i make no secret that i mean to give her thirty thousand pounds as a marriage portion captain danvers was astounded if she was to have such a fortune as this he began to think he had better turn his attention to the stepdaughter he endeavoured to look indifferent but mrs calverley perceived that the remark had told as she intended it to do you are the most generous of your sex mrs calverley he observed few women circumstanced as you are would make so great a sacrifice i dont consider it a sacrifice captain danvers i regard it as a duty i simply represent her father what he would have done i shall do i cannot withhold my admiration of conduct as rare as it is praiseworthy said the captain i repeat you deserve infinite credit for your generosity but mr calverley i believe left a son as well as a daughter what will he say to this magnificent portion he has no voice in the matter replied the lady my husband left the entire control of his property to me a wise mana very wise man cried the captain chetwynd calverley has been very wild and extravagant said the widow it was necessary therefore to tie up the property quite necessaryquite proper remarked the captain though i shouldnt like it myself he thought is chetwynd satisfied with the arrangement may i ask very much the reverse she replied but that is immaterial he doesnt know what is good for him said the captain none of us do he mentally ejaculated then you approve of the course i am about to pursue captain danvers entirely my dear madamentirely he replied i think it most judicious and now you have asked me a good many questions let me ask you one in return said mrs calverley delighted to answer any questions you may put to me he replied wondering what she was going to say but dont answer this unless you like she observed let me hear it he rejoined fearing something unpleasant was coming how is it that your lovely cousin emmeline has not married i know she has had several very good offers pon my honour i cant tell i fancybut mind its only fancyshe has had some disappointment i should think that scarcely possible observed mrs calverley why she is an only child and will be a great heiress well thats the only solution i can give of the mystery i know lord bollington proposed to her and i know my uncle would have liked the match to take place but the young lord was refused possibly she has an attachment observed mrs calverley thoughtfully if so its a great pity here she comes with miss calverley said captain danvers as the two young ladies were seen advancing along the terrace xii brackley mere by this time all traces of tears had disappeared and emmelines dark eyes looked lustrous as ever judging from her lively manner no one would have dreamed that she nourished a secret attachment but she kept it carefully locked up in the recesses of her heart and had no confidante except mildred captain danvers rose to meet them but mrs calverley retained her seat we shall see now how he acts she thought he did not leave her long in doubt he immediately began an animated conversation with mildred and kept by her side as they walked round the garden leaving emmeline to amuse mrs calverley no doubt the handsome captain could make himself extremely agreeable if he chose and he now exerted himself to the utmost and succeeded having expatiated upon the beauty of the formal old garden they were surveying and saying how much he preferred it to the landscape style he turned the discourse to the amusements and gaieties of london and soon found that mildred was really anxious to spend a season in town whereupon he expressed the greatest satisfaction as he should frequently have an opportunity of meeting her by this time lady barfleur had made her appearance and as she could report nothing of sir leycester she suggested a visit to the mere it is a nice shady walk there through the wood she said and if you have not seen the mere i think you will be struck by it not by its beauty mamma remarked emmeline but rather by its blackness well such blackness as that water boasts is a beauty said captain danvers in my opinion the mere is well worth seeing there are all sorts of legends attached to it said emmeline amongst others there is a superstition that when anything is about to happen to our house a great piece of black oak that has been sunk for ages at the bottom of the lake floats to the surface an idle story remarked lady barfleur you excite my curiosity said mrs calverley i should like to see this mysterious lake you must excuse my accompanying you said lady barfleur captain danvers will conduct you there with the greatest pleasure said the captain i hope you will go too miss calverley oh of course she replied so they all set off with the exception of lady barfleur who rarely got beyond the garden in a very few minutes they had plunged into a wood through which a narrow road led to the mere in some places the path was overarched by trees and the branches formed a delightful screen on that hot day captain danvers led the way with mildred and the path being only wide enough for two the others were obliged to follow as the wood seemed to inspire such a tone his accents became low and tender suddenly they burst upon the lake in all its sombre grandeur the water looked intensely black but when examined it was found to be perfectly clear the broad expanse was surrounded by trees which in some instances advanced beyond the bank the surface of the mere was unruffled for not a breath of wind was stirring and reflected the trees as in a mirror occasionally however a fish would leap up and the smooth water was for a moment rippled but the effect of the scene was not cheerful an air of gloom brooded over the place that impressed the beholder with melancholy both mrs calverley and mildred acknowledged the feeling at the point where the visitors had approached it the lake was shallow and occupied by a large bed of reeds and bullrushes but at the opposite extremity the water was profoundly deep and supposed by the common folk to be unfathomable on the left and not far from where they stood was a boathouse and captain danvers offered to row them to the further end of the lake so that they might have an opportunity of completely surveying it the proposal was gladly accepted repairing to the shed they embarked in a large flatbottomed boat better adapted for fishing than moving rapidly through the water however it answered the purpose captain danvers took the sculls and contrived to get mildred next him the clumsy craft moved slowly on and was now and then stopped that the ladies might look around as they drew near the lower end the lake seemed to become darker and the trees that shut it in assumed a yet more sombre appearance here it was deepest captain danvers was tugging at the sculls but still making very slow progress when the boat struck against something in the water that gave it a great shock the captain ceased rowing and looking round to see what he had come in contact with to his surprise and consternation he beheld the blackened trunk of a huge oak hitherto the dusky mass had scarcely appeared above the surface but on being thus forcibly struck it rolled round in such manner as to display its enormous bulk and then gradually sank all three ladies saw the illomened piece of timber at the same time as captain danvers uttering a cry of fright emmeline stood up and pointing to it exclaimed tis the black oak i told you of one of my fathers house is doomed the others looked aghast but spoke not even captain danvers seemed struck dumb without a word he turned the boats head and began to row back while he was moving round emmeline sat down and covered her eyes to shut the hideous object from her view it is gone said mildred in a low tone try not to think about it i ought to think about it rejoined emmeline scarcely above her breath it is a deathwarning but not to you dearest girl said mildred i would rather it applied to me than to those i love she returned silence prevailed among the party till they landed no more jesting on the part of the captain he looked very gloomy when they got out of the boat he tried to cheer up his fair cousin but did not succeed they walked back quietly to the hall where a painful surprise awaited them xiii pursuit of the gipsies sir leycester barfleur as we have shown had ridden with his attendants to the further side of the morass where he hoped to intercept the gipsies in their flight but he could discover nothing of them posting himself with booth the coachman on a little mound near the marsh he sent off the two grooms to the huts previously mentioned to ascertain whether the fugitives had taken refuge there but his emissaries brought him no satisfactory intelligence and it was the opinion of the turfcutters who inhabited the huts that the gipsies had gone off altogether sir leycester however felt convinced that the rascals were somewhere about and ordered his men to make a careful search directing the turfcutters to assist them again they were all at fault sir leycester next tried the wood that skirted the heath and sent the men on by different routes fixing a place of meeting in the heart of the thicket he himself pursued the main road attended by booth its a pity we didnt bring those two scotch deerhounds with us sir leycester observed the coachman if the gipsies have taken shelter in this woodwe shall never be able to find em without a dog of some sort i believe youre right booth replied sir leycester i dont like hunting men in that way but whats to be done if we cant catch them otherwise its the only sure plan rejoined booth were wasting time now well go and fetch the hounds said sir leycester ride to the keepers lodge as fast as you can if rushton shouldnt be at home go on to the hall but use despatch shall i bring rushton with me as well as the hounds sir leycester inquired booth ay do replied the baronet and a bloodhound asked the coachman with a grin sir leycester signified his assent and booth galloped off he had scarcely started when the baronet regretted the last order given and called out to him not to bring the bloodhound booth however was out of hearing sir leycester then proceeded to the centre of the wood keeping a sharp lookout on either side as he rode along the others had already arrived at the appointed spot but had nothing to tell the baronet felt very much inclined to swear but just at the moment a burly farmer named marple who used to hunt with him came up mounted on a wellbred horse on hearing what was going on marple told the baronet he had just seen a couple of gipsies who appeared to be hiding on the banks of the weever and offered to take him to the exact spot no doubt they are the rogues you are looking for sir leycester he added no doubt of it cried the baronet joyfully come along he then rode off with marple taking the two grooms with him and leaving the turfcutters behind to wait for booth and the hounds the river weever described a wide halfcircle round the east side of the wood the spot referred to by marple being about half a mile off as they rode at a rattling pace they were there in a few minutes but when they approached the river they proceeded cautiously if the gipsies had not decamped they felt sure of catching them the weever being here very deep while there was no bridge within a mile but cautiously as they came on they had been descried and perfectly understanding their design the gipsies were endeavouring to escape by creeping along the bank of the river which was here bordered by willows having got nearly to the end of this screen the fugitives stopped determined if hard pressed to make for the adjoining wood and being both extremely fleet they had no doubt of accomplishing their purpose xiv the bloodhound it soon became manifest to the gipsies that their pursuers were following them and searching carefully about among the willows and they were still more alarmed by the report of a pistol discharged by sir leycester with the view of rousing them from the covert accordingly they dashed off and so busily were their pursuers occupied that a minute or two elapsed before their flight was discovered a piece of ground level as a village green and a couple of meadows lay between them and the desired place of shelter and they had gained the first hedge and were scrambling through it when they were perceived by sir leycester who instantly shouted a viewhalloo and the whole party started in pursuit but not without reason had the gipsies reckoned upon their own speed before sir leycester and his attendants cleared the first obstacle they had leaped a fivebarred gate and were flying across the second field in half a minute more they had plunged into the thicket and fancied themselves secure sir leycester on the other hand who was close at their heels knew very well they had run into the trap and chuckled at the thought of their speedy capture causing his companions to disperse he went towards the centre of the wood expecting to find booth with the keeper and the hounds meanwhile the gipsies being well acquainted with the thicket made their way to its inmost recesses where the brambles and underwood would render it difficult if not impossible for the horsemen to follow them they heard marple and the others on their left and right pushing their way through the trees and vainly endeavouring to get near them they therefore felt quite safe the only unpleasantness being that they might be detained there till night but this feeling of security was quickly dispelled by some sounds they did not at all like they first heard voices at a distance accompanied by the crackling of small branches announcing that some persons on foot were searching for them and ekiel remarked in a low tone to his comrade why thats ned rushton the keepers voice were not safe here if hes after us keep quiet muttered clynch he maynt come this way shortly afterwards a low ominous growl not to be mistaken by the experienced reached their ears and filled them with alarm ned has got a bloodhound with him ekiel said clynch we must kill the brute have you got your spanish knife with you ay but i darent attack that hound give me the knife then ill do it cried clynch we must get out of this place as quickly as we can and run for life run where demanded ekiel to the marsh replied clynch thats our only chance that devil of a dog has taken all my strength out of me dont be afeared of him cried clynch unclasping the cuchillo the point of which was as sharp as a needle just then a long bay proclaimed that the hound had got the scent while the voice stated by ekiel to be that of ned rushton was heard encouraging him the gipsies set off but had not gone far when the formidable hound burst upon them through the underwood quick as lightening clynch turned and dropping on one knee faced the enemy with the cuchillo in his hand for a moment the hound fixed upon him a red deepseated eye and then sprang at his throat but clynch whose gaze had never quitted the terrible animal received him on the point of the knife and drove the deadly weapon to his heart with a fierce yell the hound fell back having thus liberated himself from his formidable foe clynch was making off when ned rushton appeared exasperated by the slaughter of his favourite he discharged both barrels of his gun at the flying gipsy but without effect the shot rattled over the head of the fugitive but did him no harm clynch quickly overtook his comrade and as soon as the ground became clear of underwood they speeded off towards the morass xv the deerhounds meanwhile sir leycester had not been idle he had sent off ned rushton with the bloodhound to unkennel the gipsies but would not allow the other hounds to be unleashed however when he heard the shouts and caught sight of the fugitives one of them with a bloodstained knife in his hand running towards the morass he shouted to booth to loose the dogs and cheering them on started in pursuit the deerhounds quite understood their business and rushed after the gipsies at a tremendous pace followed by sir leycester who vainly endeavoured to keep up with them marple booth and the two grooms likewise joined in the exciting chase after a good run ekiel dropped and as the hounds had to be pulled away from him the incident caused a short delay that enabled clynch to reach the morass there was for no time hesitation so he took the first path that offereda narrow footway that seemed to lead towards the middle of the bog he soon found he had made a bad choice for the path grew narrower and the ground became soft but the deerhounds were after him and behind them came sir leycester who had ventured to ride along the pathway in spite of the warning shouts of marple and the others clynch ran on a little further and then stood at bay preparing to defend himself against the deerhounds with the cuchillo which he had never relinquished at this juncture sir leycesters horse missed his footing and slipped into the bog and in the effort to recover himself threw his rider over his head completely engulfing him cries of consternation arose from all who witnessed the accident but they could render no assistance marple who had all along been apprehensive of disaster flung himself from his horse and hurried to the spot but only to find that the unfortunate baronet had disappeared call off these dogs and ill help you to get him out shouted clynch in the hope of saving the baronets life marple complied and as soon as he was safe from attack the gipsy flung away the knife and setting to work did his best but his help was of no avail the horse was got out but sir leycester had sunk and could not be found plenty of other assistance soon arrived booth the coachman ned rushton the keeper the turfcuttersall were there but though every effort was made and every available appliance used more than an hour elapsed before the body could be recovered it was then conveyed to the hallmarple having gone on before to break the sad intelligence to lady barfleur end of the first book book the secondthe heiress of brackley hall i the last of the old cheshire squires a terrible sensation was caused at brackley hall when tidings were brought there of the fatal accident that had befallen its owner sir leycester had been an excellent master and was beloved by all his household and their regrets for his loss were heartfelt lady barfleur was completely stunned by the shock marple endeavoured to break the sad intelligence to her gradually but his countenance and accents betrayed him rising from the sofa on which she was seated she seized him by the arm and commanded him to tell her the truth thus interrogated he felt compelled to give a direct reply but he regretted doing so when he saw the effect his words produced upon her she looked aghast placed her hand on her heart and then with a halfstifled cry sank upon the sofa marple had taken the precaution to station a female servant at the door and he now summoned her to her mistress lady barfleur had fainted emmeline did not hear of the direful event till she returned from the lake and she then instantly bethought her of the deathwarning she had received she managed to restrain her emotions till she reached her own room whither she was accompanied by mildred who was almost equally shocked and then gave way to a paroxysm of grief mrs calverley was likewise much distressed she could not help reproaching herself as being in some degree the cause of the accident though she had endeavoured to dissuade the unfortunate baronet from pursuing the gipsies feeling certain under the present afflicting circumstances that emmeline would not be willing to part with mildred she settled in her own mind that the latter should remain with her friend for a few days moreover she herself would spend the night at brackley if she could be of any use to lady barfleur such were her mental resolves hitherto she had remained in the garden she now went into the house it was all in confusion the servants appearing quite scared there was no one to whom she could speak for captain danvers had gone off to the marsh the drawingroom was deserted nothing was changed there but how different the noble room looked in her eyes from what it had done in the morning its splendour seemed dimmed the great emblazoned shield over the mantelpiece looked like a hatchment after gazing round for a few minutes she sat down melancholy thoughts intruded upon her perhaps even feelings of remorse assailed her but we shall not search her bosom she began to feel some disquietude at being left so long alone and wondered why mildred did not come down to her possibly she could not leave emmeline suddenly her attention was roused by a disturbance in the entrancehall that seemed to betoken an arrival what it was she could not fail to conjecture trampling of feet as if caused by men bearing a heavy burden and muttered voices were heard then followed other sounds almost equally significant the opening and shutting of doors and the congregating of servants in the hall she waited for some minutes in the expectation of being summoned but as no one came near her she went forth the hall was empty but the diningroom door stood open and at it was stationed the butler the man had a very sorrowful countenance indeed he bowed gravely as she approached and motioned her to enter the room a very touching spectacle was presented to her gaze on a large carved oak table covered with a crimson cloth and placed in the centre of the apartment was laid the body of the unfortunate baronet it was partially covered by a cloak and the stains from the swamp in which he had been engulfed had been carefully removed from his face and grey locks strange to say his features were not changed but seemed to wear their customary kindly expression around were grouped the different members of the household all of whom looked deeply afflicted and some of the female servants were weeping bitterly on one side stood ned eushton with two of his helpers behind him rarely did neds manly visage exhibit such grief as it wore on this sad occasion after gazing steadfastly at his late kindhearted master for some minutes he cast down his eyes and did not raise them again till the moment of departure on the other side stood marple who though burly of frame was as softhearted as a woman he deeply lamented sir leycester and well he might for the baronet had ever been a good friend to him at the end of the apartment stood captain danvers a quiet but not unmoved spectator of the scene if his grief made little outward show it was not the less deep and sincere he was strongly attached to his uncle from whom indeed he had some expectations that might never now be realised but the principal figures in this touching picture have yet to be described emmeline and mildred were kneeling down in prayer at the back when lady barfleur entered the room she had nerved herself as she thought for the ordeal but on catching sight of the body she uttered a cry that thrilled all who heard it rushed up to her dead husband clasped her arms round his neck and fell with her head upon his breast no one ventured to remove her and she was still in this attitude when mrs calverley entered the room the dark oak ceiling the dark oak panels the dim windows harmonised with the sombre character of the picture which made an ineffaceable impression upon mrs calverley the scene suggested many reflections in the room where for many years he had exercised unbounded hospitality and where his ancestors had feasted before him lay the last male representative of the ancient house of barfleur sir leycester had had a son who died when quite young and the title was now extinct all the late baronets estates and possessions would go to his daughter and sole heiress but emmeline thought not of the wealth she had thus suddenly acquired she thought only of the irreparable loss she had sustained in the death of the father who had treated her with constant tenderness and affection and whom she dearly loved but if no selfish thoughts occupied her reflections somewhat akin to them occurred to one near to her who well knew how she was circumstanced mrs calverley knew that emmeline was her fathers sole heiress and looked upon her as a very important personage over whom it would be desirable to obtain an influence such influence could be easily acquired by mildred to whom it was evident emmeline was strongly attached mrs calverley knew much but there was one important matter of which she was totally ignorant how could she have been aware that emmeline cherished a secret attachment to chetwynd the picture we have attempted to describe remained undisturbed for a few minutes when the newmade widow recovered from the swoon into which she had fallen as soon as she could mrs calverley who had come up gently raised her and helped her to quit the room emmeline and mildred arose and followed captain danvers remained till the household had withdrawn and then held a consultation with the butler to whom the entire management of the house had been entrusted for the present by lady barfleur as mrs calverley had foreseen emmeline would not part with mildred and she herself remained till the following day having despatched a messenger to ouselcroft with a note to her housekeeper explaining matters and desiring her to send back some things that she and mildred required passing over the dreary interval that comprised the inquest and the examination and committal of the gipsies we shall come on to the funeral to which a great number of important personagesrelatives connexions and friends of the deceased baronethad been invited sir gerard danvers of offham grange and his eldest son scrope charless brother arrived at brackley hall on the eve of the sad ceremonial up to this time lady barfleur had not quitted her room but she could not refuse to see her brother and nephew and she therefore dined with them it was a triste party as may be imagined for her ladyships presence cast a gloom over it emmeline looked ill mildred was out of spirits and mrs calverley who had come over that afternoon had to supply the conversation both sir gerard and scrope thought her very charming scrope was about thirty tall thin darkcomplexioned and by no means so handsome as his brother but he was exceedingly gentlemanlike and would be very rich and that was much in mrs calverleys opinion so she took some trouble to please him it was with difficulty that captain danvers could maintain a grave exterior mr carteret the solicitor who had acted professionally for sir leycester as he had done for mr calverley had been over that day and when the will of the deceased baronet was examined it was found he had left his nephew charles five thousand pounds impossible after such a windfall as this that the captain who was not overburdened with cash could look very dull members of some of the oldest and best cheshire familiesegerton cholmondeley leigh venables vernon brereton mainwaring davenport and othersattended the funeral sir bridgnorth charlton who had been an old friend of the deceased baronet was likewise invited and came before the funeral cortge set out sir bridgnorth took an opportunity of speaking to mildred and said he would call upon her in a few days as he had something to tell her respecting chetwynd sir leycester was not interred in the little chapel in the court of the old hall where some of his earlier ancestors reposed but in his family vault in the neighbouring church of brackley and was borne thither according to custom on the shoulders of the tenantry sir gerald danvers and his two sons followed on foot with a long train of mourners composed entirely of the deceased baronets retainers the carriages of the important personages we have mentioned closed the procession a word respecting sir leycester ere we lose sight of him for ever not inappropriately he might be termed the last of the cheshire squires since he left none behind who so completely answered to the description of that traditional character he seemed to belong to another agea ruder but manlier age than our own yet sir leycester though sometimes coarse and careless of speech could be most courteous his ancestors had always been loyalalways true to the stuarts brackley hall had held out against the parliamentarians in the time of charles the first and sir chandos barfleur was killed at the siege his son delves was just as faithful to the kings fortunes and lost part of his property but it was restored by charles the second and again jeopardised in circumstances prevented sir wilbraham barfleur from joining the rebellion of from this date the barfleurs became loyal to the reigning family born in the latter part of the last century sir leycester belonged to that epoch rather than to the present he retained the manners of his sire and grandsire and thus became a type of the old schoola type that has now completely disappeared in look bearing physiognomy costume manner he differed from the present generation but there was no better gentleman no cheerier companion no stauncher friend no better rider to hounds than sir leycester barfleur the last of the old cheshire squires ii a consultation about a week after the funeral sir bridgnorth charlton rode over to brackley hall in fulfilment of his promise to call on mildred lady barfleur was not well enough to appear but emmeline and mildred who had been impatiently expecting his visit received him in the drawingroom they were attired in deep mourning and though there was no personal resemblance between them they looked like sisters after some inquiries respecting lady barfleur and messages of condolence to her sir bridgnorth looked at mildred who interpreted his glance correctly and said you may speak freely of chetwynd before miss barfleur sir bridgnorth she takes great interest in him a very great interest added emmeline i hope you bring us some news of him very little replied sir bridgnorth and what i do bring is not satisfactory you desire me to speak plainly about your brother miss calverley most certainly she replied well then you may remember when i accidentally met him at ouselcroft i gave him a pocketbook containing a certain sum of money i am not likely to forget your kindness replied mildred it appears there was rather more in the pocketbook than i thought pursued sir bridgnorthbank notes to the amount of three hundred pounds i mention this because your brother has most scrupulously repaid me the exact sum of which he kept a memorandum he behaved like a man of honour cried emmeline undoubtedly but i did not want the money back i want to assist him i want him to come to meto talk to me will he not do so said mildred i fear not i suspect he is still in difficulties if so he must be got out of them and you must manage it sir bridgnorth said mildred but i cant manage it my dear young lady i dont know where to find him but he must be found cried emmeline easily said but not so easily accomplished rejoined sir bridgnorth smiling at her vivacity i have used every endeavour but can obtain no clue to him is he in london asked mildred i believe so he replied surely then he can be discovered she remarked i have not succeeded in discovering him that is all i can say rejoined sir bridgnorth and i have really taken a great deal of trouble in the business he has been remarkably successful in hiding himself do not keep anything back from me i pray you dear sir bridgnorth said mildred is he without resources i cannot imagine so he replied he must have had some funds to enable him to repay me unless and he paused unless what said mildred you enjoin me to speak the truth replied sir bridgnorth and i will do so at the hazard of giving you and miss barfleur pain my idea is that he has lost money at play mind i have no proof of what i assert it is simply conjecture i fear you are right sir bridgnorth said mildred heaving a deep sigh in your opinion sir bridgnorth said emmeline who had listened anxiously to the discoursein your opinion i say has chetwynd lost a considerable sum of money at play i fear so has he paid it i fear not there was a pause during which the two young ladies regarded each other wistfully at length mildred spoke sir bridgnorth she said chetwynds debts of honourand she emphasised the wordmust be paid and shall be paid at any sacrifice by me you will do me the greatest kindness by finding out exactly how he is circumstanced what he owes and especially what are his debts of honour emmeline looked earnestly at sir bridgnorth as if she felt equally interested in the inquiry sir bridgnorth was evidently troubled and for some moments made no answer excuse me my dear miss calverley he said if your brother is in a scrape i think he should be allowed to get out of itas he best can no exclaimed mildred decidedly it is not like me sir bridgnorth to give such advice no added emmeline equally decidedly he must be freed upon my word said sir bridgnorth surprised whatever may have happened to him this young man cannot be called unfortunate then act as a true friend to him dear sir bridgnorth said mildred make immediate arrangements to get him out of all difficulties you will incur no personal responsibility none whatever said emmeline sir bridgnorth was much touched i think you had better leave him to himself he said but since you wont i must needs help you ill do all i can but i cannot proceed as expeditiously as i could desire i have reason to believe chetwynd is living in london under a feigned name since all private inquiries have proved unsuccessful i will cause some carefullyworded advertisements to be inserted in the newspapers that may catch his eye and bring him forward could he be made aware that a beautiful young lady takes an interest in him i am sure he would speedily reappear but fear no indiscretion on my part nothing shall be disclosed till the proper moment arrives then addressing mildred he added as soon as i can ascertain the amount of his debts i will let you know pay them dear sir bridgnorthpay them she rejoined but they may be very large never mind pay them cried emmeline mr carteret shall repay you no man ever had such a chance exclaimed sir bridgnorth if he does not reform now he is incorrigible i have no misgivings as to the future said mildred well i sincerely trust all will come right observed sir bridgnorth there seems every probability of it i must own just then mrs calverley was announced i must take my leave said sir bridgnorth rising hastily you shall hear from me soon or see me let us see you please said both young ladies before he could depart mrs calverley entered and stopped him ah sir bridgnorth she exclaimed im delighted to meet you i want to have a word with you sir bridgnorth evidently wished to get away but she begged him to remain for a few minutes and he could not very well refuse mrs calverley then went on to the young ladies after the usual greetings had passed she said to mildred i have a letter for you or rather a packet it arrived this morning having given her the letter she moved to a little distance glancing at the superscription mildred turned pale what is it that disturbs you inquired emmeline a letter from chetwynd replied mildred in a low voice come to my room that we may read it together emmeline signified her assent by a look mrs calverley took no notice of what was passing though she must have perceived it before leaving the room mildred went up to sir bridgnorth and addressing him in a low voice said you must not go sir bridgnorth i may have something important to tell you about chetwynd in that case i will stay as long as you please he rejoined meanwhile emmeline prepared to follow her friend will you mind my leaving you for a few minutes dear mrs calverley she said dont stand on the slightest ceremony with me my love replied the other besides i want to have a little talk with sir bridgnorth the two young ladies then went out i am now quite at your service madam said sir bridgnorth as soon as he and mrs calverley were alone then sit down that we may have a confidential chat replied the lady iii chetwynds letter in such haste were the two girls to open the packet that they almost ran up the spiralstaircase to mildreds bedroom in which was a deep bay window in this recess they sat down mildreds hand trembled as she tore open the packet it contained a long closelywritten letter inside which was a folded sheet of paper that looked like a document of some kind this document dropped on the table and was not examined at the moment the letter was dated on the previous day but bore no address ere she had read many lines a mist seemed to gather over mildreds vision unable to proceed she laid the letter down you terrify me cried emmeline what has happened he meditates selfdestruction replied mildred but read the letter dearesti cannot mustering up all her courage emmeline read aloud as follows this is the last letter you will ever receive from me dearest sister and in bidding you an eternal farewell i implore you to think kindly of me with one exception you are the only person in the world whom i love and my latest thoughts will be of her and you you know her and will easily guess her name but i shall not confide it to this sheet of paper in all respects she is superior to the artful and treacherous woman by whom i allowed myself to be deceivedsuperior in beauty and accomplishments and amiable as beautiful had i been fortunate enough to wed her i should have been a different man now it is too late i see my folly and comprehend my loss you see that he dearly loved you emmeline for it is to you that he refers observed mildred but proceed i entreat you i have met with the basest ingratitude men who have received from me favours innumerablehangerson who have sponged upon me and professed the greatest regard for me have shrunk from me and avoided me in my misfortunesmen who have fleeced me who have ruined me and driven me to desperation my funds are almost exhausted but they will last me out i owe nothing for i have paid that kindhearted sir bridgnorth charlton the exact sum he lent me had i not obtained it from him i should have been called a defaulter fortune favoured me for the moment for i won sufficient to discharge my debt to him he would lend me more i doubt not but i will never borrow again as to the woman who has robbed me of my inheritance i have sworn i will accept nothing from her and i will keep my oath she will be responsible for her conduct before heaven again there was a pause but neither made a remark and emmeline went on fear nothing dearest sister i have changed my name and have taken such precautions that my retreat cannot be discovered nothing will be found upon me that can establish my identity a body will be found that will be all gracious heaven ejaculated mildred grant that this dreadful catastrophe may be averted emmelines voice had been suffocated by emotion but after a pause she proceeded mildred i have been reckless and extravagant and have led a most foolish and most useless life i have been a gambler and have squandered large sums upon persons who profited by my follies but i have done nothing dishonourablenothing to tarnish my name as a gentleman i think i could have retrieved my position but it is not worth the trouble i am weary of life sick of the hollowness the ingratitude the perfidy of the world timon of athens did not hate mankind more bitterly than i do i would consent to live if i felt certain of revenge on some of those who have wronged me but on no other condition this is not likely to happen so it is best i should go alas poor chetwynd exclaimed mildred his fancied wrongs have driven him to the verge of madness he seems extraordinarily sensitive and to feel most acutely the slights shown him by his ungrateful associates said emmeline is the letter finished asked mildred no replied emmeline there is a farewell to you but i cannot read it my voice fails me mildred then took the letter and went on with it you know exactly how i am circumstanced mildred i have nothing that i am aware of to leave but i have made my will and in your favour and shall enclose it in this letter i may have some rights of which i am ignorant and if it should prove so i desire that you may benefit by them here is the will she remarked taking up the little document and examining it i see he has observed all necessary formalities strange he should be able to do this at such a time though deeply affected she resumed the perusal of the letter and now farewell dearest sister again i implore you to think of me kindly my faults are inexcusable yet do not judge me harshly the world has done that and with sufficient severity do not suppose these lines are written to move your compassion long before they meet your eye i shall be indifferent to scorn neglect and treachery should an opportunity ever occur of breathing my name to her i have loved say that my chief regret was that i threw away the happiness that might have been mine emmeline uttered an exclamation of despair but it did not interrupt mildred trouble yourself no more about me search will be in vain nothing can arrest my purpose ere tomorrow morn i shall have ceased to breathe and have quitted a world i hate neglect not my last request farewell my sister may you be happier than your unfortunate brother heaven have mercy on his soul exclaimed mildred dropping on her knees and praying fervently emmeline likewise knelt down and prayed after awhile they arose sit down for a moment dearest emmeline said mildred i have something to tell you i believe the fatal act was committed at one oclock this morning why at that precise hour inquired emmeline you shall hear i was sleeping on yonder couch and was awakened by the striking of the clock the moon was shining brightly through the window and i thought i saw a figure standing just where you are seated i should have felt much more frightened than i did if i had not been convinced it was chetwynd though how he came here at that time i could not imagine i called out but no answer was made and i then became seriously alarmed suddenly the figure which had hitherto been looking down raised its head and fixed its mournful gaze upon me i then saw that the features were those of chetwynd but pale as death the phantom did not move from its position but seemed to wave a farewell to me and then melted away in the moonbeams and this phantom you beheld said emmeline who had listened with intense interest in the narrative i saw it as plainly as i now see you replied the other why it appeared to me i now understand the silence that ensued was broken by mildred after carefully replacing the letter and the will in the envelope she said let us go downstairs and communicate the sad news to sir bridgnorth it is right he should know it true replied emmeline but oh dearest mildred i can never like mrs calverley again i look upon her as the cause of this dreadful event you do her an injustice dear emmeline said mildred who however began to regard her stepmother with altered feelings we shall see how she bears the intelligence said emmeline and from that some judgment may be formed iv how the direful news was received by mrs calverley and how sir bridgnorth volunteered to make inquiries as to its truth as the two girls entered the drawingroom their changed appearance and mournful looks struck both sir bridgnorth and mrs calverley who were still seated on the sofa conversing together earnestly sir bridgnorth immediately arose and advancing to meet them said to mildred i am afraid you have not received very good news of chetwynd alas no sir bridgnorth she replied in a sorrowful voice you need give yourself no further concern about my unfortunate brother why not he interrupted anxiously he is gone she replied sadly you shock me greatly he ejaculated mrs calverley and myself have been considering what could be done for him and have just devised a scheme that we hoped might be successful all schemes for his benefit are now useless said emmeline he no longer needs our aid did i hear aright said mrs calverley starting up and coming towards them it cannot be that chetwynd is dead it is so said emmeline but how did he die asked mrs calverley by his own hand replied emmeline regarding her fixedly mrs calverley looked aghast and as if ready to drop i did not understand he had destroyed himself said sir bridgnorth when did this sad event occur can you give me any particulars i can only state that he contemplated suicide replied mildred this letter is a last farewell to me ah then we need not despair of beholding him again said sir bridgnorth with a sensation of relief many a man now alive has threatened to put an end to his existence i hope it may turn out to be so in chetwynds case i sincerely hope so said mrs calverley i have no such belief observed mildred sadly if you had read his most affecting letter you would entertain no doubt as to his determination added emmeline with difficulty refraining from tears we shall soon be able to ascertain the truth said sir bridgnorth not so replied mildred he has taken such precautions that his fate will remain a mystery sir bridgnorth shook his head i cant believe that possible he said it will be important on several accounts to have proof of his death he may have made a will he has made a will and has sent it me in this letter replied mildred indeed exclaimed mrs calverley surprised but he had nothing to leave he seems to have thought otherwise said mildred he fancied he had certain rights and claims and those he has left to me the slight shade that passed over mrs calverleys countenance was not unnoticed by emmeline this shows it will be absolutely necessary to establish the fact of his death observed sir bridgnorth what is the date of the letter you have received it was written yesterday replied mildred but he is not alive now she added solemnly you believe he destroyed himself last night asked mrs calverley i firmly believe so she rejoined mrs calverley then turned to sir bridgnorth and with a coldness that appeared revolting to mildred and emmeline said is any case of suicide reported in the papers this morning i have seen none he replied but it might have escaped me i seldom read such cases emmeline rang the bell and desired the butler to bring the newspapers the order was promptly obeyed and search made but no mysterious death or supposed suicide could be discovered it is needless to ask if any address is given with your letter remarked sir bridgnorth to mildred it is not likely there would be and nothing mentioned that could serve as a guide nothing sir bridgnorth then bade them all a formal adieu and made a final attempt to give them comfort i hope chetwynd may have changed his mind at the last moment he said i believe it will turn out so tomorrow i shall set out on my melancholy errand and institute inquiries you shall hear from me as soon as i have anything to communicate and i promise you one thingi will not remain idle it shall not be my fault if the facts of this painful affair are not discovered end of the second book book the thirdwalter liddel i on westminster bridge nearly at the same date as the incident related in the foregoing chapters and about two hours past midnight a stronglybuilt middleaged man whose garb proclaimed him a mechanic took his way across westminster bridge he was not walking very fast but when the hour was tolled forth from the lofty tower he began to mend his pace glancing occasionally at the sullen river that swept on beneath him the bridge was completely deserted the last policeman he had seen was standing near new palace yard and the belated mechanic was thinking how strange and solitary the usually crowded footway appeared when he descried a figure leaning over the low parapet he had heard many tales of suicide and something in the attitude of the figure caused him to hurry on as he advanced he perceived by the light of the lamp that it was a young man bareheaded for a felt hat was lying on the pavement the person was muttering to himself and his demeanour was altogether so wild that the mechanic was convinced that his suspicions were correct and he therefore called out he instantly turned at the cry and exhibited a haggard visage but instead of replying made an attempt to spring upon the parapet but the workman was too quick for him and seized him before he could execute his desperate purpose the intended suicide quite shook in the grasp of his powerful preserver he was a young man and his brown hair and beard made the ghastly hue of his countenance yet more striking by the contrast moreover he had the look of a gentleman but it was difficult to judge of his condition from his grey tweed habiliments he offered very little resistance to his friendly captor his strength apparently being gone let me go he said in a hoarse voice i dont wish to live madman cried the mechanic whats the matter that you would throw away life thus whats the matter echoed the other with a laugh that had nothing human in it i am ruinedutterly ruined had you let me alone my troubles would have been ended by this time and he made another ineffectual attempt to free himself dont think to get away said the mechanic im sorry for you but its my duty to prevent you from committing this wicked act i shall hold you till a policeman comes up no dont do that cried the wretched man though i dont know where to turn for a nights lodging i dont want to be locked up leave go your hold i promise not to make the attempt again well ill trust you replied the mechanic releasing him they looked at each other for a few moments and both seemed satisfied with the scrutiny the intended suicide was apparently about three or four and twenty tall handsome wellproportioned as already intimated he had brown locks and a brown beard and was dressed in such manner that no precise idea could be formed of his rank in regard to his preserver there could be no mistake his working attire and cap proclaimed his station he had an honest manly countenance in age he might be about fortyfive heres your hat sir he said picking it up i should like to have a word with you before we part perhaps i may be warranted in asking you a question or two especially as my motive is a good one im not influenced by mere curiosity ill begin by telling you my name its joe hartley im a stonemason by trade and live in lambeth palace roadat least close beside it the reason im out so late is that ive been doing a job at paddington but i dont regret it since ive been the humble instrument of saving a fellowcreature now you know all you may care to learn about me and in return i should like to hear something about you i cant tell you who i am mr hartley he replied nor can i acquaint you with my strange history you may guess that i must have been brought to a desperate pass his voice changed as he went on whats a poor fellow to do when hes utterly ruined ive spent all my money pawned my watch my ring and another little trinket ive nothing leftnot a sou but have you no relativesno friends inquired hartley kindly yes ive relatives but ive quarrelled with them and would die rather than go near them he cried in a bitter desperate tone that left no doubt of his fixed determination friends i have none well well i wont argue with you about that said hartley but there is no occasion for one so young as you are to starve there are hundreds of ways in which you may earn a living amongst others you might list for a soldier im much mistaken if you dont stand six feet two theyd take you at the horse guards in a minute i did think of that and perhaps might have done it but i was goaded to this desperate act by a circumstance on which i wont dwell i think i must have been mad very likely i shall enlist tomorrow but you want rest and have nowhere to go come home with me said the stonemason you are very good mr hartley he replied much affected this is real kindness and i feel itfeel it deeply come along then cried hartley theres a policeman moving towards us and hell wonder what we are about you wont tell me your name i suppose call me liddelwalter liddel replied the other its not my real name though i have a right to use it at any rate i mean to be known by it henceforward and it will serve me with the recruiting sergeant it will serve you with me as well said hartley so come along mr walter liddel presently they encountered the policeman who eyed them rather suspiciously but was satisfied with a few words from hartley on quitting the bridge the stonemason turned off on the right into lambeth palace road they walked on in silence for liddel did not seem inclined to talk gradually the street became wider and hartley noticing that his companion began to walk very feebly told him he had not much further to go their course seemed to be stopped by the high wall of the palace grounds but hartley turned into a narrow street on the left called spencers rents and halting before the door of a neat little habitation said here we are walter liddel replied in a faint voice that he was glad of it hartley then knocked softly at the door which was presently opened by his wife ii the house in spencers kents perceiving that some one was with her husband mrs hartley was about to beat an immediate retreat but hartley stopped her and after a short colloquy between the pair the stonemason entered with his companion mrs hartley had disappeared but there was a light in the kitchen into which walter liddel was introduced the hospitable stonemason begged him to sit down and opening a cupboard took from it some cold meat and bread which he set before him and bade him fall to next proceeding to the scullery hartley drew a jug of beer walter liddel ate as voraciously as a famished wolf leaving him to enjoy the first good meal he had made for some days hartley went upstairs and his voice could be heard in consultation with his wife evidently some little preparation for their unexpected guest had to be made by the worthy couple but it was completed before he had finished his meal he was still engaged when hartley reappeared glad to see you getting on so well mr liddel observed the stonemason it aint often weve a spare bed but it so happens that our daughter rose is away so you can have her room anywhere will do for me replied walter who by this time had devoured all the meat and bread and emptied the jug of beer come on then said hartley taking up the candle and signing to his guest to follow him a short narrow staircase brought them to a landing whence two or three doors opened one of which admitted them to a small chamber simply but very neatly furnished it breathed an atmosphere of purity and innocence with which walter exhausted as he was could not help being struck theres your bed said hartley pointing to the neat little couch the patchwork quilt of which being turned down revealed the snowy sheets thank you my good friend i couldnt wish for a better replied walter squeezing the masons horny hand heaven bless you for your kindness to me dont disturb yourself too soon observed hartley im not going out early myself tomorrow ill call you good night so saying he retired and closed the door after him as soon as he was alone the penitent knelt down and besought heavens forgiveness for the sinful act he had attempted and which had been so fortunately frustrated his contrition was sincere and his resolution to lead a better life heartfelt his prayers ended he took off his attire and lying down in the little couch in which innocence alone had hitherto reposed almost instantly fell asleep his slumbers were sound and he had not stirred when hartley had entered the room on the morrow on opening his eyes walter could hardly make out where he was but by degrees the recollection of all that occurred returned to him dont think any more of last night said hartley noticing the pained expression of his countenance its nearly noon but if you feel tired ill come again later on nearly noon cried walter preparing to spring out of bed i ought to have been up hours ago thereupon hartley retired and his guest proceeded to make his toilette with a care that showed he had not forsaken early habits while thus employed he could not help casting his eyes round the chamber and was more than ever struck by its extreme simplicity and neatness everything seemed in its place it appeared like a profanation to invade such a temple of purity on going downstairs he found mrs hartley a middleaged matronly woman decently attired as became her station and still comely it was too late for breakfast and the cloth was spread for dinner on the table was a baked shoulder of mutton and potatoes mrs hartley greeted him very kindly and with great good feeling and good taste made no allusion to the circumstances that had brought him to the house though she could not have been ignorant of them but his appearance prepossessed her in his favour dont say a word about being so late sir she observed with a kindly smile im glad to see you looking so well you must be content to make breakfast and dinner together today sir while walter was making a suitable reply hartley came in and seemed quite surprised and delighted at his guests improved appearance a few hours rest has done wonders with you mr liddel he said this is my wife he added and i will say it to her face that no man could have a better a good husband makes a good wife joe as i always tell you she replied smiling pray sit down sir she added to walter both hartley and his guest had good appetites and a large hole was made in the shoulder of mutton before they had finished their meal far from begrudging walter mrs hartley seemed pleased now mr liddel said hartley as he laid down his knife and fork i must go to my work the missis will take care of you till my return we may have company in the evening i must go and look after some employment said walter time enough for that tomorrow rejoined the mason well have some talk together on the subject tonight meantime keep quiet and the worthy fellow went about his business mrs hartley showed her guest into the little parlour and when she had cleared away the things joined him there and they had a little chat together but whatever curiosity she felt she restrained it limited as was her knowledge of the world she felt convinced that walter was a gentleman she talked to him in a kindly motherly tone that soon drew him out at last after beating about the bush she said in a straightforward way you must excuse me sir if i take upon me to give you advice but dont you think you had better go back to your friends never he replied i will never go back to them if you knew all you would agree that i have been infamously treated no mrs hartley my resolution is taken i am down but i will make my way up in the world to mount the ladder one must begin at the lowest step i approve of your resolution sir she rejoined kindly and if you are determined you cannot fail of success you have youth strength good looks i dare say now she added unable to repress her desire to know something more of him i dare say you think you have been wronged i have had great injustice done me he replied but you must not ask me any questions mrs hartley i shall never speak of what i have been unless you reinstate yourself she supplied exactly and many years may elapse before i can do that ah you dont know she replied with an encouraging smile but you must excuse me i have got the house to attend to you may like to see the paper having spent some little time over the daily paper which she gave him walter took up his hat and went out strolling leisurely along he came to lambeth palace and standing near the pier at the foot of the bridge he watched the boats arriving and departinglanding passengers and carrying them away the lively scene served to amuse him among those who were embarking he noticed a tall thin man dressed in black whose sharp features were familiar to him the individual in question was only just in time and as soon as he got on board the boat was cast off and took its course towards the other side of the river it had not gone far when the tall thin man approaching the stern descried walter and almost started at the sight of him they remained gazing at each other as long as the steamboat continued in view but no sign of recognition passed between them the sight of this person whoever he might be seemed to awaken a train of painful reflections in walters breast he sat down on a bench on the little esplanade and remained there for some time contemplating the busy scene on the river by degrees he recovered his serenity and it was in a more cheerful frame of mind that he returned to the house in spencers rents iii introduces mr tankard mr laekins and mr pledger dapp the tea equipage was set out in the little parlour and walter enjoyed a cup of bohea with mrs hartley very much and passed the evening with her in tranquil converse he began to feel a great regard for the good dame and listened to her advice hartley did not return till nearly supper time and brought with him a frienda neighbourwhom he introduced as mr tankard rather an important personage in his way was mr tankardstout short redfaced possessing a rich mellow voice consequential in manner and respectably dressed in black some of his friends called him silver tankard but hartley took no such liberty mr tankard had been a butler before setting up in business in the lambeth road where he now kept a large china and glass shop though generally distant and proud mr tankard unbent towards walter and was unusually civil to him i like the looks of that young man he observed in a very loud whisper to hartley mrs hartley deemed it necessary to apologise to mr tankard for the poorness of the supper and told him if she had expected the honour and pleasure of his company she would have provided something better but he begged her condescendingly not to mindhe wasnt at all partickler mrs hartley knew better she knew he was exceedingly particular however she did the best that circumstances would allow and as a finish to the rather scanty meal gave him a dish of stewed cheese and a jug not a tankard of ale with a toast in it with this he was tolerably well satisfied after supper hartley asked his guest if he would like to smoke to which proposal mr tankard made no sort of objection a flask of scotch whisky was likewise set on the table scarcely were the pipes lighted when the party was increased by the arrival of mr pledger dapp and mr larkins who it seems were expected by hartley though he had said nothing about them to his wife pledger dapp a brisk little man was a cook and confectioner in the york road and larkins was a greengrocer in the same neighbourhood and likewise went out to wait they worked together with mr tankard and each recommended his friends whenever he had the opportunity more glasses were placed on the table and more hot water and everybody was puffing away the room was soon so full of smoke that mrs hartley could stand it no longer and retired to the kitchen a great deal of merriment prevailed among the company and they laughed heartily at each others stories these related chiefly to their customers at last hartley contrived to bring walter forward by making a direct allusion to him i want to have your opinion about my young friend gentlemen he observed taking the pipe from his mouth he thinks of joining the cavalry but i think it is a pity such a fine young man should throw himself away what do you say gentlemen after a sip of whisky and water the person chiefly appealed to replied i think it would be a thousand pities no doubt he would make a very fine life guardsman but in my opinion he would do much better as a figure footman much better echoed pledger dapp and larkins im not ashamed to say i began life as a page pursued mr tankard and you see what ive arrived at its no secret that i was a cook in a gentlemans family before i set up for myself as a confectioner said pledger dapp and i was a gardener before i became a greengrocer said larkins and he added with a laugh im a gardener now though no longer in service take the advice we all of us give you sir and become a footman said tankard ill answer for it well soon find you a place but ive no qualifications replied walter i dont know the dutiesthat is i know what a footman ought to be well thats quite enough interrupted pledger dapp youll soon learn all the rest it just occurs to me that lady thicknesse of belgrave square is in want of a footman observed tankard that would be a very good thing its a firstrate place lady thicknesse i think ive heard of her remarked walter a widow isnt she widow of sir thomas thicknessemiddleaged and rich besides her town residence she has got a country house in cheshire walter reflected for a few minutes the proposition had taken him by surprise the notion of becoming a flunky amused him vastly and he could hardly entertain it seriously however there seemed to be no difficulty in assuming the part the result of his cogitations was that he felt inclined to adopt the expedient and he told mr tankard so but i cannot offer myself under any false pretence he said lady thicknesse must be made aware that i have never served in this capacity before all his auditors except hartley laughed loudly at his scruples bless you my dear fellow you neednt be so diffident cried mr tankard if lady thicknesse is satisfied thats all you need mind ill set about the business tomorrow in a week i expect youll thank me for my pains youll have a firstrate situation if you get it i promise you remarked pledger dapp very handsome livery and powder observed larkins powder exclaimed walter in dismay is it necessary to wear powder indispensable replied tankard but youll find it very becoming he added with a laugh powder will suit your hair youre above six feet in height eh six feet two replied walter capital cried tankard stay one thing mustnt be neglected he added rubbing his chin expressively you must get rid of that handsome brown beard sdeath must i shave cried walter amid the general merriment certainly my dear fellow replied tankard whoever heard of a footman in a beard follow my instructions and you may make yourself quite easy about the place ill engage you shall obtain it but ive not quite decided myself said walter pooh nonsense you cant do better cried tankard can he gentlemen everybody concurred with him in opinion partly in jest partly in earnest walter assented so much in fact was said in favour of the plan that he began to grow reconciled to it as the clock struck eleven mrs hartley came in and her appearance was the signal for the breaking up of the party while shaking hands with walter mr tankard renewed his promises and said im a man of my word what i say ill do tomorrow ill go to belgrave square and see my friend mr higgins lady thicknesses butler on my return ill call and tell you all about it really mr tankard you are taking a vast deal of trouble not in the least my dear fellow replied the other it is a pleasure to mea very great pleasure and if you knew him as well as i do youd feel that it must be or he wouldnt do it observed hartley laughing in another minute the company were gone and shortly afterwards the whole of the little household had retired to rest visions of his new life floated before walter as he laid his head on the pillow he slept soundly enough but on awakening next morning he rather regretted the promise he had given i dont like the idea of turning flunky he thought but the livery will serve as a disguise iv sigebert smart before going out to his work hartley had a little talk in private with walter fearing he might be inconvenienced from want of moneyhaving heard him say at their first meeting on westminster bridge that he had nonethe worthy stonemason with great consideration volunteered to lend him five pounds on the simple understanding that this sum was to be repaid when walter had earned so much wages thus amply provided with funds walter sallied forth after breakfast to make a few necessary purchases preparatory to entering upon the situation should he obtain itand telling mrs hartley what to say to mr tankard in case that obliging person should call during his absence his first business was to seek out a hairdressers shop and hearing there were several in the lambeth road he went thither he had not proceeded far when he came to an establishment that bore the name sigebert smart in large gilt letters above the window and promised all he desired entering the shop he perceived two personsone a showylooking female stationed behind a counter laden with pots of pomade flacons of oil brushes sponges and perfumery the other a dapper faircomplexioned young man with his blonde hair brushed back from his forehead this was sigebert smart in person having been for a year in paris at a large shop in the rue st honor he considered himself perfectly versed in all the arts and mysteries of a french coiffeur and incomparably superior to any of his rivals in the lambeth road walter thought the hairdresser stared at him rather inquisitively as he entered the shop but the mans manner was perfectly polite and on learning his customers requirements he begged him to step into an inner room communicating by a glassdoor with the shop pray be seated sir said sigebert pointing to a wellstuffed armchair shaved i think you said sir shaved repeated walter before taking the irreparable step said sigebert placing himself in front of his customer and regarding him steadfastly let me ask if you have reflected what dye mean cried walter staring at him in surprise excuse me sir rejoined the hairdresser but have you positively determined to part with that magnificent beard i dont like to lose it i confess replied walter but i have no choice thats hard never in my experience have i beheld a finer beard nor better grown i shall be loth to cut it you are pleased to compliment me said walter it is not my habit sir i assure you generally i am frank to a fault apropos des barbes i will tell you a curious story a gentleman called here last evening and inquired whether a very tall young man dressed in a grey tweed suit exactly like yours sir and having a particularly handsome brown beard the very ditto of yours sir lodged in the lambeth road or hereabouts i told him i had not remarked any such person but you sir answer precisely to the description strange you should put in an appearance next day thats why you stared at me so hard when i entered the shop cried walter couldnt help it sir quite startled and now for a description of the individual who has taken the liberty to inquire about me said walter tall thin sharp features long straight nose professionallooking replied sigebert i know him said walter i saw him yesterday at lambeth pier he said he caught sight of you there he appears most anxious to find you and has been making inquiries about you in the neighbourhood did he mention any name no he was exceedingly reserved on that point but i think hell call again ive no especial desire to see him but now to work must i really commit this outrage cried sigebert flourishing his scissors my soul revolts at the deed walter however insisted and in a very few minutes his luxuriant beard had vanished and his cheeks and chin were perfectly smooth he had just got up from the armchair when the glassdoor opened and a tall man came in you have found your friend at last sir cried sigebert on beholding him i suppose my wife told you he was here she did replied the other walter however did not seem willing to acknowledge the intruder as a friend but drew himself up and regarded him sternlyalmost angrily perhaps i had better retire gentlemen said sigebert you may wish to have a little private converse with this he went out but we rather fancy the door was left slightly ajar how is it that you have presumed to follow me about in this way asked walter in an offended tone you must forgive me sir i saw you yesterday and have searched for you here today it is my earnest desire to induce you to return to your relatives and friends they feared something terrible had happened to you they need not trouble themselves about me rejoined walter i shall not trouble myself about them but i have certain propositions to make to you i reject all propositions it is useless to talk to me i have also a sum of money at your disposal will you not receive it if it comes from a particular quarter and as an allowance no permit me to say sir remarked the tall gentleman in a grave tone that you are acting very injudiciously and are throwing away a great piece of good fortune all can be easily put to rights if you will only allow me to do it and there are many other advantages that might accrue to you to which i cannot now more particularly advert i am the best judge of what concerns myself sir i dont think so rejoined the other you seem obstinately bent upon pursuing a wrong course have you any debts none any liabilities none then why not assume your proper position you will have every aid i understand your objections and though i deem them ridiculous i shall not attempt to combat them at this moment but there are friends willing and anxious to assist you amongst others he added lowering his voice sir bridgnorth charlton sir bridgnorth is an excellent manone in a thousand then you cannot distrust him i do not distrust him on the contrary i have entire confidence in him he is a gentleman and a man of honour let him have the management of your affairs do you come from sir bridgnorth sir bridgnorth is not certain you are alive he fears you have committed suicide it will be a great satisfaction to him and several others to learn that you have not executed your fell purpose suffer them to remain in ignorance i would rather they supposed me dead keep this secret for me i beg of you it is the sole favour you can do me i will reappear at the proper time but meanwhile you will make several persons very unhappyyour sister who has the greatest affection for you as i can testifyand miss barfleur miss barfleur exclaimed walter starting she has no interest in me you are mistaken replied the other sir leycester barfleur having recently died she is now a great heiress the very reason why she should not think of me dont despair make your appearance i have said i will appear at the proper timenot before wont you give me any idea of your projects no do you want money i am ready to advance it to you i want none then our interview is at an end once more i must ask you not to mention that you have seen me i cannot consent to keep those persons who are attached to you in doubtnor ought you to ask it if for reasons of your own you choose to live in concealment and under a feigned name however i may regret your determination i shall not attempt to interfere with it but i am persuaded you will speedily change your mind if i do ill write to you no write to sir bridgnorth he is searching for you he ought to have a letter address him at the grosvenor hotel he is now in town i will do it before we separate give me your word that you wont follow me nor attempt to find out my abode you will gain nothing by the discovery i give you my word replied the other enough said walter i thank you heartily for the trouble you have taken about me adieu on issuing forth into the shop walter found the hairdresser standing rather suspiciously near the glassdoor but he seemed to have some employment at the counter walter however could not help remarking that sigeberts manner towards him seemed more respectful than it had been as he received payment for the task he had performed the hairdresser exclaimed ah sir i fear youll regret the loss of your beard your best friend wouldnt recognise youyoure so much changed but dont lay the blame on me i did my best to dissuade you as he bowed the young man out he looked after him for a moment and saw that he proceeded towards the bridge whereupon the wily sigebert made a significant gesture to his wife as he returned at this juncture the tall professionallooking gentleman came forth and having nothing to pay merely offered his thanks as he went out a hansom cab chancing to pass at the moment he immediately got into it and ordered the driver to go to the grosvenor hotel meanwhile sigebert having divested himself of his apron and put on a hat nodded to his wife and followed walter who was not yet out of sighthis tall figure rendering him easily distinguishable v romney on his way back walter stopped at a large linendrapers shop to purchase some shirts and other articles never dreaming he was followed by sigebert having provided himself with all he required and given orders where the parcel should be sent he proceeded on his course not till he had fairly housed him did the hairdresser discontinue the quest and he then hovered near the spot for some time there was a mystery about walter that greatly excited sigeberts curiosity and he determined to unravel it why what have you done with your beard sir cried mrs hartley as walter entered the house left it at the hairdressers he replied with a laugh well i cant say your appearance is much improved i wish rose had seen you as you were what has your daughter come back cried walter no but i expect her very shortly she has been at harrowonthehill on a visit as i think i told you and ive just got a letter from her telling me she will return today father must meet me at lambeth pier at noon and carry my carpetbagthats what she says but i dont think hell be back in time well ill meet her and carry the carpetbag with the greatest pleasure said walter but you wont know her describe her and i shall not very tall i suppose not veryrather short pretty figure i think so blooming complexion odd you should guess that well she has a pink complexion thats why you call her rose what sort of eyesblack blue grey or nondescript i never heard of nondescript eyes roses are light blue but how stupid i am heres her photograph very like her it is and a very pretty girl it represents replied walter examining it you might have said a great deal more in her praise without being charged with maternal vanity having seen this i can make no mistake not easily for she wears the same blue serge dress and the same hat im sorry youll lose your room but well find a bed for you oh it cant be helped he cried affecting an indifference he did not feel pray has mr tankard been here today ive seen nothing of him as yet she replied well then ill be off ill soon bring your daughter back to you dear me how surprised shell be cried mrs hartley shell wonder who you are dont be afraid ill explain matters as walter went forth he noticed a stout ashplant hanging up in the passage and took it with himvery fortunately as it turned out pleased with the task he had undertaken he marched along quickly and did not remark that sigebert who had seen him come out was on his track a boat had just landed its passengers as walter reached the pier but he saw no one among them bearing the slightest resemblance to the pretty damsel he was looking for however it was not yet twelve oclock about a quarter of an hour later on another steamboat could be seen crossing the river and on a near approach of the vessel the deck not being crowded he easily made out rose her photograph did not do her justice she was even handsomer than he anticipated and her good looks had evidently gained her the unwelcome attentions of a young but dissipatedlooking individual who was standing near her this person whose looks gait dress and manner showed that he belonged to the turf was well known to walter and with good reason since he had won large sums of money from him the young mans name was romney and though he contrived to hold up his head in the bettingring he was not in very good repute and was regarded as a blackleg walter held him in detestation for he mainly attributed his ruin to him though he must have perceived that his attentions were annoying to rose romney did not discontinue them but became more impertinently assiduous as the boat neared the pier and seemed determined not to part with her rose looked out anxiously for her father but could not discover him nor did she perceive any person she knew or whose protection she could claim stepping on shore before her romney offered her his hand but she refused to take it and his proposal to carry her bag was peremptorily declined at this juncture walter came up and pushing the intruder forcibly aside bade him begone and no longer molest the young lady what business have you to interfere cried romney furiously who are you do you know him he added to rose i never saw the gentleman before she rejoined but i am greatly obliged by his assistance gentleman echoed romney scornfully he doesnt deserve the term blackleg and scoundrel vociferated walter do you dare to speak thus of one you have cheated and plundered and seizing him by the throat he applied the ashplant vigorously to his shoulders no one attempted to interfere and when romney was released he made himself scarce as soon as he could perceiving from the observations that reached his ears that the feeling of the bystanders was decidedly against him he was followed by sigebert who had witnessed the encounter and determined to have a word with him meanwhile rose had found another protector mr tankard had come up and was standing with her at a short distance he had given her all needful explanation respecting walter and when the latter joined them after the scuffle she said to him i never imagined you came from our house mr liddel you have really done me a great service but how on earth did you know me i never remember seeing you before i dont suppose you ever did he replied i knew you from the photograph your mother showed me when i offered to go and meet you at the pier in place of your father well i declare that is curious she cried and i promised to carry your carpetbag but mr tankard im sure is too gallant to surrender it quite right replied the other im proud to be of use to miss rose i was just coming to call upon you mr liddel ive been to belgrave square and have got you the situation i saw mr higgins the butler and he says youre to enter upon your duties the day after tomorrow quite soon enough remarked walter laughing theres something about the livery that i have to tell you but that will do byandby added tankard dear me mr liddel exclaimed rose raising her finelyarched eyebrows in surprise youre not going to wear a livery are you livery and powder supplied tankard impossible exclaimed rose no its too true said walter by this time they had reached the house rose rushed in and was welcomed by her mother with kisses and embraces vi rose hartley rose hartley was just nineteen and had all the freshness and bloom of youth a remarkably neat but rather plump figure comely features brilliant complexion sparkling eyes nutbrown hair and particularly small feet constituted the sum total of her charms and she had considerably more than fall to the lot of nine girls out of ten rose was puzzled upon one point she could not exactly understand how walter had found his way to her fathers house and her mother did not care to enlighten her however his appearance and manner pleased her and she felt sure she should soon learn all about him mr tankard said mrs hartley i must get you to help us out of a difficulty with the greatest pleasure my dear madam if it lies in my power i neednt tell you our accommodation is very limited and now rose has returned i fear i know what you are going to say interrupted tankard you wish mr liddel to have a bed at my house i expected the request and am luckily able to comply with it he shall have a room upon my word mr tankard im very much obliged to you said walter not in the least rejoined tankard but we must have a merry meeting tonight mrs hartley you must all come and sup with me mr higgins lady thicknesses butler has promised to give the pleasure of his company and since miss rose has returned ill ask harry netterville of grays inn as im well aware she likes the society of that amiable and agreeable young man pray dont ask mr netterville on my account mr tankard observed rose with affected indifference im not particularly anxious to meet him mr tankard however knew better and said that as soon as he got back he would send off a note to the young gentleman in question mr netterville he explained to walter belonged to the legal profession being clerk to an eminent solicitor in grays inn and now mr liddel i must take you with me said tankard ive got some arrangements to make with you if we dont meet before he added to rose and her mother i shall see you all at nine this eveningthats understood rose would have preferred walter remaining a little longer but as he promised to come round in the course of the afternoon she felt quite reconciled to his departure mr tankard first took his companion to the shop of mr pledger dapp in the york road mr dapp as we have said was a pastrycook and confectioner and the numerous good things on the counter looked very tempting at that hour mr dapp was delighted to see them insisted on serving each with a basin of mockturtle soup and stood beside them while they discussed it at a small table at the further end of the room well is all satisfactorily settled may i inquire mr liddel he said yes alls settled dapp said tankard answering for his friend the very livery is ready indeed cried walter looking up in surprise has it appeared by magic ive not yet had time to enter into details rejoined tankard but when i saw higgins this morning he told me lady thicknesse had left the arrangements entirely to him so we had only to talk them over together and it was then agreed that he should come to my house this evening where he could have an opportunity of meeting you and judge for himself though he entertained no doubt from description that you would suit so far good remarked walter but about the livery you shall hear replied the other it seems that charles brownlow the late footman who was as near as possible your height and figure was discharged at a moments notice for impertinence his livery no doubt will fit you but has he worn it cried walter no it has not been delivered higgins will order the suit to be sent to me so that you can try it in the evening and we can judge of the effect a capital plan laughed dapp a dress rehearsal in fact said walter well it may be useful no doubt youll play your part to perfection said tankard i shall see how i like it myself rejoined walter this is why youve invited the party to supper i conclude exactly replied tankard laughing youve divined my purpose bytheby dapp you must send me a good supper tonighta very good supper mind for how many guests a dozen and make one of them yourself thatll keep you up to the mark ill give you a supper worthy of the silver tankard replied dapp at what hour shall it be ten oclock precisely direct larkins to send me some flowerscut flowers and tell him to come too well do the thing in style nothing shall be neglected i know how particular you are replied dapp but wont you take one of these he added placing a dish of pates before them just then he was obliged to leave his friends to attend to some customers when a couple of pates had been devoured tankard and his companion arose and quitted the shop who is that tall young man remarked one of the customers at the counter mr walter liddel replied dapp i dont think thats the name said the individual ive heard it before and feel almost certain its not liddel dapp made no remark at the time but he afterwards pondered a little upon the matter hes a very singular fellow that walter liddel he thought i expect hell turn out a claimant of some sort or he may be a dook in disguise shouldnt wonder vii tom tankard mr tankards establishment was larger and handsomer than walter expected to find it in the windows there was a very good display of china and glass and the shop was tolerably spacious mrs tankard to whom he at once was presented and who received him very kindly was still goodlooking though somewhat on the wane but she was sharp and intelligent and evidently very well able to attend to the business in her husbands absence the tankards had an only sonan only child we ought to say tom tankard was a much smarter man than his father and much more selfimportant like his father he had a sobriquet and was called cool tankard tom ought to have attended strictly to the shop but being allowed to do pretty much as he liked as a natural consequence he did little or nothing tom was not handsome on the contrary he was decidedly an ugly dog short fat snubnosed roundfaced he had deepseated grey eyes and these had a cunning though rather comic expression his pink cheeks were totally destitute of whisker and his whitybrown hair was cut extremely short a brown newmarket coat was buttoned over his broad chest but his shoulders were out of proportion with his spindling legs which were cased in very tight trousers nevertheless tom was a smart fellow in his way though rather loud in his style and exceedingly particular about the flaming colour of his tie and the size of his gold pin now and then he used to drive in the park when he could afford to hire a drag and took some smart young ladies with him more than once he had ridden at the croydon steeplechases and he occasionally contrived to attend a meet of the surrey hounds tom chanced to be in the shop when walter came in with his father and being struck by his appearance condescended to pay him some attention mr tankard lost no time in informing his wife that mr liddel would occupy a bed in the house for a night or two and then went on to explain that he had invited a few friends for the evening and had directed pledger dapp to send in a little supperthinking it would save trouble mrs tankard received the intelligence with great good nature and tom was told to take mr liddel upstairs and show him the spare room which proved to be a very neat little chamber they were still talking together when mr tankard came up with a large brownpaper parcel and deeming it advisable to mystify his son winked at walter to let him into his plan and then said to the hopeful youth do you know tom mr liddel is going to a fancy dress ball how jolly exclaimed tom what costume as a footman replied old tankard heres his dress as a footman exclaimed tom with a droll expression jeames of buckley squareor chawles well hes just the figure for one of those gentry is he going to the ball tonight no but ive persuaded him to appear in private at my little party this evening that we may see how he looks oh he cant fail to look well said tom somewhat sarcastically but lets see the dress guvnor beg pardon mr liddel i ought to have asked your permission oh dont stand on any ceremony with me i beg cried walter the parcel was then opened and a very handsome suit of livery produced there was likewise another rather smaller parcel inside heres a gorgeous coat heres a brilliant pair of plooshes exclaimed tom holding up the latter youll look uncommon well in these mr liddel no doubt he will said mr tankard but no more of your chaff sir the smaller parcel was then opened and was found to contain a pair of thin shoes buckles silk stockings shirt and white cravat i was going to put you in mind mr liddel observed tankard that youd want several articles to rig you out completelybut here they all are i dare say the shoes will fit you im certain of it replied walter examining them another thing mustnt be forgotten mr liddel said tom since youre going to appear as jeames or chawles youll want your air powderin ill get you a coiffeur when will you have him not till evening replied walter very good said tom he shall be here at eight now go down to the shop tom cried mr tankard send off a note at once to harry netterville and ask him to supper consult your mother and if she approves ask mrs tripp and clotilde mrs sicklemore and flora or anybody else agreeable to her but dont exceed half a dozen for we have got five or six already counting harry netterville no not counting him youve seen rose hartley of course mr liddel cried tom sweet girl aint she harry netterville is rather smitten in that quarter then give him the chance of meeting her said his father thereupon tom disappeared after an early dinner with the tankards walter betook himself to spencers rents and saw rose who was alone in the little parlour evidently she regarded him with more interest than she had done my mother has told me all about you mr liddel she said at least all she knows and i feel exceedingly sorry for you but i hope all will soon be right i am neither old enough nor wise enough to give you advice nor is it right or proper for me to do so but i am sorry you are thinking of becoming a footman i feel quite sure you are a gentleman i have been one interrupted walter but i have no money and must do something the offer was made me and i accepted it any honest employment is respectable so it is undoubtedly what i fear is that you may hereafter regret having taken the step i can leave if i dont like the employment but i must say you talk very sensibly miss rose i wish i had had such a counsellor a year or two ago before i committed my worst follies you wouldnt have listened to me she replied shaking her head i dont knowi might have done but your remarks seem to produce some salutary effect upon me and that is more than i could say of myself formerly then you are improved by misfortune in some respects i think i am but there is considerable room for further improvement mr liddel i am convinced you have a great deal of good in you only do yourself justice i will try he replied but how is it i must again ask that you who are so young are able to give such sensible advice i have a good mother she replied at this very moment mrs hartley came into the room i hope you heard what was said of you maam observed walter your daughter has just been telling me how much she owes you i owe quite as much to her cried the good dame affectionately she is the joy of the house and i dont know what i shall do when i lose her but i suppose i must make up my mind to it one of these days not yet dearest mother said rose i suppose we shall meet the fortunate individual this evening observed walter mr harry netterville eh yes thats the name and a very nice young fellow he is replied mrs hartley i only wish he was a little richer well we must wait contentedly till he becomes so sighed rose poverty and happiness dont go together in married life again i must compliment you on your good sense miss rose remarked walter thats one of my mothers maxims she rejoined but dont call me miss rose please after the service you rendered me this morning i shall always regard you as a friend and so will harry i think i told you that romney the insolent fellow by whom you were affronted was one of those who mainly contributed to my ruin remarked walter he is a great libertine and i hope you may experience no more annoyance from him i may not always be at hand to protect you luckily he doesnt know where i live or i might feel some uneasiness said rose ah those rakes are dreadfulno keeping them off cried mrs hartley at this moment there was a knock at the outer door rather startled mrs hartley went to see who it was and presently returned with a letter in her hand this is for you rose she cried it was left by a stranger who said no answer was required and went away immediately for me exclaimed rose turning pale it is certainly addressed to me but i dont know the handwriting she then opened the letter and after angrily scanning it read it aloud the gentleman who had the great pleasure of meeting miss rose hartley on the steamboat this morning hopes soon to behold her again as her charms have made an ineffaceable impression upon him he feels certain that the incident that occurred on the pier must have been as vexatious to her as to him but she may rest assured that the ruffian who committed the assault shall not pass unpunished so then he has discovered your address cried walter i wonder how he learnt it since he ran off i could not have credited such audacity without proof positive exclaimed rose indignantly does mr romney imagine i will ever exchange another word with him except to express my anger and scorn have i given him any encouragement that he should dare to write me such a letter she added tears of vexation starting to her eyes no no i am sure not cried walter but it is part of romneys system he believes no woman can resist him i now begin to think he will persist in the attempt notwithstanding the chastisement he has received and the utter want of encouragement on your part dear me i declare im all of a tremble cried mrs hartley i dont know what we shall do to get rid of him never mind him cried rose im not at all afraid leave me to deal with him said walter tomorrow ill look after him it is harry nettervilles business to defend me cried rose but i understand the man rejoined walter besides i have still an account to settle with him leave him to me yes mr liddel will manage him best said mrs hartley but ill go and bring in tea a cup will do us all good after this bother as the good dame had foreseen the pleasant beverage soon produced a tranquillising effect and enabled them to spend an hour or two in cheerful converse walter then thought it time to go back to mr tankards but offered to stay and take charge of them if they felt at all afraid mrs hartley said she expected her husband every minute and he would bring them to the party in that case you can dispense with me said walter we shall meet again before long and then youll find me completely transmogrified i am sorry to hear it said rose i like you very well as you are walter laughed and set out taking with him his parcel of purchases viii as a footman preparations for the supper party had already commenced when walter arrived at mr tankards the shop had been closed at an earlier hour than usual but was lighted up and so arranged that the company could walk about it if they thought proper after casting a look around and exchanging a word with mr and mrs tankard both of whom seemed very busy walter went upstairs to his own room which had now been converted into a nice little cabinet de toilette no doubt he was indebted for this attention to mrs tankard his first business was to try on the livery and he was quite surprised to find how well it fitted him we have already said it was a handsome showy suit and on walter who was very tall and extremely well proportioned it produced its full effect what was his first thought as he contemplated himself in the glass when thus metamorphosed may be inferred from the loud laugh into which he burst just at this juncture tom tankard who was now in evening dress came into the room and joined very heartily in the merriment excuse my laughing mr liddel he said but yourself set me off i never beheld such a swell footman before youll astonish em down stairs presently but ive come to tell you the coiffeur is waiting outside i suppose youre pretty nearly ready for him the hairdresser proved to be sigebert smart and great was the surprise of that inquisitive individual when he found that the customer who had so much excited his curiosity had assumed a new rle and found a new lodging can i believe my eyes he exclaimed with a theatrical start do i indeed behold the gentleman whom i was compelled to deprive of his beard i now understand the meaning of that order with a costume like this a beard would be incongruous but is the dress worth the sacrifice cease this foolery and begin said tom the gent wants his air powderin hes goin to a fancy ball as i told you begging walter to take off his coat and flinging a loose gown over his shoulders and giving him a napkin to protect his eyes sigebert set to work and carefully powdered the young mans fine brown locks pausing ever and anon in his task at length he exclaimed as he laid down the powderpuff now youll do sirnow youll do what do you think of the effect mr tom he added appealing to our fat friend hum cried tom without delivering an opinion wants a little more at the back dont it not a particle couldnt be better said sigebert now let me help you on with your coat he added to walter and having thus aided in arraying him he exclaimed in affected admiration why youre quite a picture sir you eclipse the finest of the court lacqueys youd get a firstrate place if you wanted that he would laughed tom whats the damage sigebert would five shillings be too much said the coiffeur with a droll expression its half a crown for a real footman well heres a crown replied walter sigebert received the money with a bow and while putting his things together said may i inquire where the fancy ball takes place not far off replied tom here asked sigebert tom nodded i guessed as much said sigebert judging from this specimen it will be very good but how is it youre not in character mr tom domino and mask easily put on replied tom not caring to enlighten him further upon this sigebert bowed and departed tom attending him as far as the shop as he went out the hairdresser saw pledger dapp whom he knew with his assistants bringing in the supper and he also saw larkins with some flowers but he did not say anything to either of them in fact he was absorbed in thought when he got out into the street he stood still for a few moments and reflected what the deuce is he doing here he thought he seems to have changed his quarters and whats the meaning of this disguisefor disguise i believe it is something may be made of the discovery having arrived at this conclusion he hailed a hansom cab and bade the coachman drive to the grosvenor hotel ix in which miss clotilde tripp and miss flora sicklemore make their appearance not long after sigeberts departure mr higgins lady thicknesses butler arrived and was cordially welcomed by mr tankard stout florid baldheaded wellmannered quiet wearing a white choker and a black dress coat mr higgins seemed the very model of a butler and he certainly was most useful and important in the establishment over which he ruled lady thicknesse confessed she could not do anything without higgins odd things occurred this afternoon remarked higgins after a little preliminary converse and ill mention it now while theres an opportunity sir bridgnorth charlton called on my lady but as she wasnt at home at the time he conferred with me and inquired whether i knew anything about mr chetwynd calverley i told him no i had often heard the name in cheshire but had never that i was aware of seen the gentleman this didnt satisfy sir bridgnorth he next inquired whether we had recently discharged a footman and i told him yes but we had just engaged another though i myself had not yet seen the new man but i expected he would enter on the place tomorrow i had received a very good character of him from you sir bridgnorth then inquired your address which i gave him and likewise the young mans namewalter liddeland he expressed his intention of calling upon you i cant tell what he wants or why he began by asking about mr chetwynd calverley sir bridgnorth has not been here yet and ive nothing to tell him when he does come remarked tankard i never heard of mr chetwynd calverley who is he the son of a rich gentleman who lived at ouselcroft in cheshire he was ruined on the turf and disinherited by his father and his stepmother has got the entire property these circumstances happened about a year ago and were the talk of the county at the time so perhaps you may have heard of them no theyre news to me replied tankard i never was in cheshirenever heard of ouselcroft or the calverleys but the case is not very extraordinary we do hear occasionally of youngsters getting ruined on the turf and being disinherited in consequence its a piece of luck for the stepmother yes and shes young and handsome said higgins their converse was here interrupted by the entrance of mrs tankard and tom both of whom expressed themselves as very glad to see mr higgins the lady wore a yellow satin dress covered with black lace and a rather showy cap and tom had the usual evening dress with white tie and polished boots tea and coffee had just been brought in by a female servant when a knock was heard at the sidedoor and directly afterwards a very tall wellpowdered footman advanced with stately step into the room and announced in agreeable tones not too loud but quite loud enough mr henry netterville nothing could be more effective than walters entrance higgins gazed at him in astonishment prepared as he was to behold a fine tall footman he had not expected such a wellgrown handsome young fellow as this by jove hell do he exclaimed harry netterville who was by no means a badlooking fellow and no smaller than the rest of his species was completely dwarfed by the tall footman tankard and his wife expressed their satisfaction in low tones but the irrepressible tom gave a little applause walter however having done his devoir immediately withdrew being summoned by another knock at the door but presently reappeared and ushered in mrs tripp and her daughter who were quite astonished at being thus introduced and thought the tankards must have taken leave of their senses mrs tripp was a milliner and clotilde tripp who assisted her mother was a very pretty girl and looked upon tom as an admirer but she had a formidable rival in flora sicklemore whose mother kept a berlin wool fringe and trimming warehouse in kennington road flora was quite as pretty as clotildemuch prettier in her own opinionfor had she not bright golden locks and a very fair skinwhile clotildes tresses were coalblack and her complexion olivecoloured both charmers were smartly dressed and both bent on captivating tom like the tripps the sicklemores were filled with amazement at the sight of the grand footman but they felt sure such an extraordinary addition to the establishment could only have been made by tom everybody had now arrived except the hartleys at last they appeared walter received them as he had done the others at the sidedoor and offered to announce them but rose wouldnt let him so they entered the room quite quietly but were very cordially welcomed by the host and hostess and even tom for some reason or other was particularly civil to them he paid rose a great many compliments but they were appreciated by the young lady at what they were worth and she gladly turned to harry netterville who was dying to talk to her and who devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening meanwhile higgins wishing to have a word with the new footman went in quest of him with mr tankard they found him in the shop which communicated with the other rooms bows and presentations took place then the parties shook hands pon my word liddel said higgins in a goodnatured but extremely patronising manner you promise exceedingly well indeed with a little instruction which i shall be extremely happy to give you i unhesitatingly assert you will do such commendation from a gentleman of your judgment and experience is extremely encouraging mr higgins said walter bowing i was really desirous you should see me before i was finally engaged that you might form your own opinion as to my capabilities i had perfect confidence in my friend tankard replied higgins nor did he mislead me you have great personal advantages liddel and they count for much in a footman i will say this for you and you may take it as a high compliment i have never before seen our livery look so well i am much gratified replied walter again bowing a single question and i have done said higgins do you happen to know sir bridgnorth charlton i am aware there is such a person replied walter rather embarrassed ive also a question to ask you liddel remarked tankard did you ever hear of mr chetwynd calverley not lately replied walter without hesitation and i dont think i am likely to hear of him again very soon i fancy he has disappeared altogether but why do you inquire sir sir bridgnorth charlton was asking about him this morning interposed higgins and somehow you got mixed up in the inquiry thats strange replied walter surely he didnt suppose i was mr calverley no he didnt think that rejoined higgins laughing but he wanted some information respecting the young gentleman well im unable to give him any said walter x supper after a brief conference with pledger dapp mr tankard returned with higgins to the company presently the gladsome announcement was made by the fine footman that supper was ready mr tankard showed his guests the way by taking out mrs tripp mrs sicklemore followed with hartley whose arm she took with some reluctance then came larkins with mrs hartley then harry netterville with rose by far the bestlooking couple in the assemblage then came the gallant tom with a young lady on either arm singing to himself like captain macheath how happy could i be with either and lastly came the hostess and mr higgins walter stood at the supperroom door as the company entered and flora and clotilde made some complimentary remarks upon his appearance tom however would not allow them to stop for a moment but took them to their seats and placed himself between them the table was not very large but it was well covered with dishes for pledger dapp had been as good as his word and had given a capital supper the chickens hams and tongues being ready carved could be helped without delay and the lobster salad was pronounced faultless by mr higgins who professed to be a judge the creams jellies and ptisserie were equally good and tom took care the young ladies should have plenty nor was harry netterville less attentive though rose was far more easily satisfied claretcup and sherry were the beverages and the glasses were constantly replenished by pledger dapp ever since the supper began walter had disappeared at length his absence was remarked by flora and clotilde i dont see your fine footman mr tom said the former i suppose he wont wait at supper cant say replied tom he does pretty much as he likes now do tell me mr tom said clotilde is he really a footman to be sure he is cried tom what do you take him for i take him for a gentleman said flora and so do i added clotilde well he is a gentleman in his way said tom what wages do you suppose we give him a hundred a yearquarter in advanceseparate meals hes gettin his supper by himself at this moment will have his pint of champagne though the guvnor only allows us claretcupha ha i dont believe all this stuff youre telling us about high wages and champagne mr tom said flora but im certain theres something extraordinary about your new footman you may as well let us into the secret well if you want to know his history i must refer you to miss rose hartley said tom she can tell you about him is this so rose said harry netterville who overheard the remark dont ask me for any explanation just now please harry she replied id rather not give it why not cried netterville who was rather of a jealous temper have you known him long i never heard of him before i have already said i shall not answer any questions concerning him just now ah yonder he is exclaimed flora i can see him in the shop through the open door i declare he has changed his dress he doesnt look half so imposing now but he is much more like a gentleman said clotilde who also perceived walter in the shop now in his morning attire do be goodnatured mr tom and tell us who he is i would rather stop both your mouths with a little of this trifle said tom helping them harry nettervilles eyes had followed the same direction as those of the two girls he noticed the change that had taken place in walters exterior and said rather sharply clear up the mystery rose not tonight she replied quietly i wish mr liddel would come in and join us at supper said mr tankard to pledger dapp do go and ask him yes pray do mr dapp said flora we can easily make room for him here but walter was prevented just before the message was sent a knock was heard and thinking it was a visitor he went to open the streetdoor and found himself face to face with sir bridgnorth charlton and mr carteret an instantaneous recognition took place on either side walter hastily retreated but neglected to shut the door after him and the two gentlemen followed him into the shop where he checked their further progress you must excuse this intrusion said sir bridgnorth and attribute it to my anxiety to find you i have been searching for you everywhere and rejoice that i am at last successful not so loud sir bridgnorth said the young man pointing to the party in the adjoining room i am only known here as walter liddel what i have to say may be said very briefly and it cannot matter who hears it rejoined sir bridgnorth your friends wish you to return to them i have already given mr carteret an answer said walter i refuse but i would remonstrate with you on your folly it is useless i beg there may not be a scene it will produce no good effect and may do mischief by interfering with my plans but your plans cannot be carried out come to me at the grosvenor hotel tomorrow and i will convince you of their utter absurdity no replied walter i am inflexible in my purpose the only favour i will ask of you and mr carteret is not to reveal my name but my good fellow listen to reason dont take a step you will most assuredly repent hereafter you will thank me most heartily for giving you this advice you wont want money carteret has got five hundred pounds which he will pay over to you you wont want friends for we will all rally round you come dont hesitate it was clear that the worthy gentlemans earnestness had produced an impression walter seemed inclined to yield but still hung back at this moment tankard who had heard some conversation going on came out of the supperroom accompanied by hartley and higgins as they issued forth they shut the door after them i believe i have the honour of addressing sir bridgnorth charlton said tankard bowing yes i am sir bridgnorth replied the other and i feel persuaded you will assist me to restore this rather wrongheaded young gentleman to his friends then i am right in my notion that he is mr chetwynd calverley remarked tankard it is useless to conceal his name though he seems to desire it rejoined sir bridgnorth yes i am chetwynd calverley said the young man i care not who knows it i have been a great fool and i suppose i shall continue one to the end no dont cried hartley advancing towards him and regarding him very earnestly dont commit any more folly perhaps i have a right to advise you you have hartley i fully recognise it replied chetwynd taking his hand you saved my life whatever you advise me to do i will do then go back to your friends said hartley thats my advice and mine said tankard and mine too added higgins i shall be sorry to lose you but thats of no consequence hartley said chetwynd clapping him in a friendly manner on the shoulder you have decided me ill go back at once with sir bridgnorth thats right sirthats right replied the other i owe you a large debt continued chetwynd but ill not fail to pay it you owe me nothing sir rejoined hartley yes i do replied chetwynd earnestly more than i can ever pay he then shook hands with the others and taking the hat and valise which tankard brought for him bade them all three farewell and quitted the shop with sir bridgnorth and mr carteret the end of the third book book the fourthprobation i the first step we will now return to brackley hall where we shall find the two young ladies they were still in a great state of uncertainty in regard to chetwynd though sir bridgnorth had written them a letter calculated in some degree to relieve their anxiety of the two emmeline seemed to suffer mostprobably because her temperament was more vivacious than mildreds but it is certain that the feelings she had formerly entertained for the inconstant chetwynd had completely revived if not become intensified mildred as we have shown was strongly attached to her brother and her affection for him remained undiminished but constant and sad disappointment had taught her to control her emotions she did not say so to emmeline but she scarcely hoped to behold him again mrs calverley was at ouselcroft but she drove over almost every day in the pony phaeton and remained for an hour or two as to lady barfleur she had been almost entirely confined to her room since sir leycesters death things were in this state at brackley hall when one morning about an hour after breakfast the two girls went out into the garden they were in an uneasy and excited state but the soft air and the fragrance of the flowers soothed them that mornings post had brought mildred a brief letter from sir bridgnorth charlton it contained only a few words but they stimulated curiosity and raised hopes tomorrow i shall send a messenger to you with some important intelligence expect him soon after the receipt of this letter b c they had been in the garden some little time and were slowly returning towards the house when they saw a tall figure dressed in black crossing the moat evidently it was the messenger from sir bridgnorth as they had given orders that he should be sent out to them but who was he could it be chetwynd in person not a doubt about it on making this discovery mildred uttered a slight cry and flying to meet her brother was clasped in his arms emmeline stood still and placed her hand upon her heart to check its palpitations in another minute mildred disengaged herself from her brothers embrace and without stopping to make any inquiries and scarcely to exchange a word of greeting led him towards emmeline as he approached emmeline became pale as death and felt as if she should sink to the ground but she sustained herself by a great effort she thought him changed he had a careworn look and his features were sharper but he was still very handsomeand perhaps he had more interest for her looking thus than if he had appeared full of health and spirits he raised his hat as he drew near and took the hand she offered him but did not venture to address her till she spoke i am truly glad to see you again chetwynd she said in kind but tremulous accents we have been very very anxious about you having called him chetwynd formerly she did not hesitate to do so now it is impossible to describe how much he felt her kindness but he did not presume upon it and scarcely dared to lift his eyes towards her i should not have ventured to present myself to you miss barfleur he said after my unpardonable conduct had i not been strongly urged to do so by sir bridgnorth charlton who told me you were good enough to still take an interest in me i felt that i must have for ever forfeited your good opinion not for ever she replied i must go through a long period of probation ere i can hope to regain it he rejoined i do not wish to make professions which you might naturally discredit but i intend henceforward to become a very different man it rejoices me to find you have formed such a praiseworthy resolution dearest chetwynd said his sister i have had a very serious conversation with sir bridgnorth he replied and what he said to me carried conviction with it i am determined to reform as i have just stated i do not expect you to believe in the sincerity of my repentance till i have proved it it may be no easy task to change ones nature to curb a hasty temper and check a propensity to folly and extravagance but i have promised to do it and i will keep my word at any cost i am sure you will said emmeline and the cost will be far less than you expect but you must begin to reform at once said mildred i have already begun said chetwynd had i not done so i should not be here this is my first step and it will lead to all the rest but why should coming here be part of your probation asked emmeline you know not what i felt at the idea of appearing before you he replied and had you treated me with scorn and contempt it would only have been what i deserved blinded by the charms of an artful and deceitful woman i threw away such a chance as rarely has fallen to the lot of man but when i recovered my senses i comprehended what i had lost bitterly did i reproach myselfbut it was then too late to repair my error or at least i thought soand the sense of my folly drove me almost mad i will not attempt to exculpate myself my faults are inexcusable but this is their explanation had it not been for sir bridgnorths encouragement i should not be here on all accounts i am glad you have come replied emmeline i do not doubt what you tell me pass through the period of probation and you may be fully restored to favour how long a period do you enjoin he inquired anxiously a year she replied tis not too much said mildred i am content he answered nay more i am deeply grateful but you must likewise obey my commandshowever hard they may seem said emmeline i will cheerfully obey them all he replied then the first injunction i lay upon you is to become immediately reconciled to your stepmother ah he exclaimed do you refuse no he replied you could not have imposed a harder condition nevertheless i will obey you in all sincerity i promise to forgive herif i can at any rate i will manifest no more resentment but accept your allowance like a rational being said mildred yes sir bridgnorth and mr carteret have argued me out of my scruples i am truly glad to hear it said mildred this is indeed a point gained mrs calverley generally drives over to luncheon observed emmeline i dare say she has arrived come and see her at once chetwynd made no objection and they proceeded to the house ii the second ordeal mrs calverley had arrived and they found her in the drawingroom she appeared greatly surprised at the sight of chetwynd and perhaps not altogether pleased but she quickly recovered herself and greeted him in a friendly manner certainly she did not expect it but he immediately stepped forward and for the first time for a lengthened period shook hands with her let there be peace between us he said willingly she replied i never sought a quarrel with you chetwynd and since you desire a reconciliation i gladly agree to it i am anxious to forget the past you are very kind madam he replied i frankly own i have been much to blame and have no right to expect your forgiveness after this admission on your part there is an end of all misunderstanding between us said mrs calverley some painful but clearly groundless rumours having reached me she added i must say that i am truly rejoiced to see you again i have reason to thank heaven madam he replied gravely that i am still alive but i ought still more to be thankful that my sentiments are changed all my vindictive feelings are gone yes i can answer for it that my dear brother is now in a very proper frame of mind observed mildred in a low tone mrs calverley seemed much relieved by the assurance where are you staying chetwynd she inquired with sir bridgnorth charlton he replied i rode over from charlton park this morning i owe a large debt of gratitude to sir bridgnorth he has behaved like a father to me and has extricated me from all my difficulties without him i know not what i might have become now the world is once more open to me dearest brother exclaimed mildred how thankful i am you have found such a friend i have found other friends though in a very different sphere of life who have rendered me great service and shown me much kindness he replied and i should be ungrateful indeed if i did not acknowledge my obligations to them one day you shall know all and then you will admit that poor men have as good hearts as their richer brethren but for one of my humble friends i should not be here now some bright eyes were dimmed at this remark and a momentary silence ensued it was broken by mrs calverley who said in a kindly tone i hope you mean to make ouselcroft your home chetwynd i shall be delighted to do so since you are kind enough to ask me madam he replied i shall not give you much trouble for i propose to live very quietly dont mistake me she rejoined the house will be as much your own as during your fathers lifetime come and go as you please your friends will always be welcome in a word do just as you like and dont imagine i shall be any restraint upon you you are too kind madam he rejoined somewhat confused i desire to meet you in the same spirit in which you have come to me she said now i hope you understand me i do madam and i will avail myself of your offer in a day or two i will again take possession of my old room it has always been kept for you as you will find but you shall have any other room you may prefer none can suit me so well as that and since you permit me to ask my friends i will mention a gentleman i have just met at charlton as i feel sure he will be agreeable to you do i know him perfectlycaptain danvers i will bring him with me if you have no objection do so by all means she replied i shall be delighted to see him and so i am sure will mildred yes he is very amusing said that young lady captain danvers is my cousin and a great favourite of mine as well observed emmeline i am glad you have formed his acquaintance and i am sure you will like him luncheon being announced at this moment they repaired to the diningroom where they found lady barfleur who had come downstairs for the first time since the day of sir leycesters interment being strongly prejudiced against chetwynd she received him very coldly and as she could be very rude when she pleased she made several very unpleasant observations in his hearing greatly to emmelines annoyance i didnt expect to see your brother here she remarked to mildred i fancied he had got into some fresh scrape worse than any of the others oh no cried mildred almost indignantly he has got out of all his difficulties since when asked lady barfleur dryly mildred made no reply what is he going to do now may i ask pursued her ladyship coming to reside with mamma at ouselcroft replied mildred oh she is good enough to take him back again eh observed lady barfleur well she is very forgiving i must say mamma exclaimed emmeline reproachfully and trying to check her nay i meant nothing muttered her ladyship it is her own concern not mine i have no right to interfere i shall be greatly pleased to have him with me againthat is all i can say observed mrs calverley rather offended for she felt the matter was carried somewhat too far for chetwynds patience and dreaded an outbreak happily none occurred chetwynd could not fail to hear all that was said but appeared calm and indifferent lady barfleur however had not yet exhausted all her displeasure what is he going to do she asked after a pause i suppose he has nothing mrs calverley smiled your ladyship is entirely mistaken she said he has a very fair income and she added with some significance extremely good expectations you may trust me on this point of course replied lady barfleur but allow me to say i was under a very different impression that chetwynd felt highly indignant at this discussion in his presence is certain but he allowed no symptom of anger to appear on the contrary he seemed perfectly indifferent emmeline was very anxious fearing that his visits in future to the house might be interdicted but she was needlessly alarmed as it turned out chetwynds unwonted selfcontrol served him well lady barfleur began to relent and to view him in a more favourable light she made no more rude remarks indeed she seemed rather inclined to be friendly towards him and he so gained upon her by his tact and good nature that before luncheon was ended she observed in an audible whisper to mrs calverley upon my word i must say chetwynd is vastly improved and to emmelines infinite delight she added i shall be very happy to see him at brackley whenever he likes to come over the two girls exchanged a look i think hell do now whispered mildred he has got through this ordeal remarkably well iii the return to ouselcroft three days afterwards chetwynd accompanied by captain danvers came to ouselcroft mrs calverley who seemed to have buried her former quarrels in oblivion gave him a very hearty welcome and was particularly civil to captain danvers mildred had returned on the previous day bringing emmeline with herso there was quite a little party in the house everything look bright and cheerful and chetwynd was received like the prodigal son all the household appeared delighted to see him again and old norris declared it was the happiest day of his life they all thought him changed and that his manner was much more sedate than it used to bethe general impression being that he was greatly improved on entering the hall he stood still for a moment and as he gazed around a singular and indefinable expression crossed his countenance but it passed away quickly and was succeeded by the grave composure that now habitually distinguished him the look however had not been unnoticed by norris who was close beside him watching him anxiously and made the old butler think he was acting a part but it was in his own chamber where no one could observe him that chetwynd gave utterance to a few words that revealed the secret of his breast once more i am in my fathers house he murmured and i will never quit it till i penetrate the mysteries it hides at length i have learned to dissemble and my purpose shall not be thwarted by haste or imprudence the part is hateful to me but i will play it and with care my former want of caution will avert suspicion from my design i will not even make old norris my confidant he remained for some time in his room occupied by a variety of reflections until at last he was disturbed by a tap at the door and on opening it norris came in evidently from his manner he expected that chetwynd would make him the depositary of some secret but he was disappointed whatever may be your motive in coming back i think you have acted most judiciously he said and i am truly glad to find that a complete reconciliation has taken place between you and mrs calverley though i own i never expected it yes norris replied chetwynd we have become really friends at one time i never supposed it would be so as you are well aware but strange things happen i am very much changed since you saw me last well i own you are changed sir but for the bettervery much improved i hope you mean to reside here altogether now i do norris mrs calverley has behaved with great kindness to mewith great generosity i may sayand the animosity i felt towards her has been completely extinguished in consequence she has asked me to make ouselcroft again my home i have accepted the offer and here i shall remain it would have been very unwise to refuse the offer sir said norris but are you convinced of her sincerity i cannot doubt it after such proofs as she has given me i only wonder she has shown so much forgiveness but she shall have nothing to complain of in future i approve of your determination sir let bygones be bygones norris was completely puzzled he did not believe in the reality of the reconciliation either on one side or the other but he saw plainly enough there would be a suspension of hostilities obviously it was greatly to chetwynds interest to yield to his stepmother but hitherto the stepson had proved so obstinate that any arrangement seemed impracticable on the other hand norris had believed that mrs calverley harboured great resentment against him but now she seemed suddenly to have forgiven him were they deceiving each other he thought so iv which of the two captain danvers had never before been to ouselcroft and was charmed with the place the house was admirably kept up and the garden in beautiful order mrs calverley had received him in the most flattering manner and he had found mildred there and his cousin emmeline chetwynd had promised him a pleasant visit and he felt sure it would turn out so what can offer greater attractions than an agreeable country house with two or three lovely inmates captain danvers had not quite made up his mind whether he preferred the wealthy young widow or her pretty stepdaughter there were reasons that inclined him to turn his thoughts exclusively to mrs calverley but mildreds image would not be dismissed he fancied he should be able to decide during his stay at ouselcroft but it was not an easy matter as he found out possibly in accordance with some plan he had formed captain danvers devoted himself on the day of his arrival to mrs calverley next day he seemed inclined to go over to mildred but she did not give him so much encouragement as she had done at brackley and piqued by her indifference he sought by every means to regain the ground he had apparently lost and succeeded but mrs calverley resented the neglect and treated him coldly in her turn he seemed therefore in danger of losing the grand prize though he found it next to impossible to go on with both he was unwilling to give up either he then put the momentous question to himselfto which of the two should he propose clearly mrs calverley would be by far the most advantageous match in a pecuniary point of view and being greatly governed by selfish considerations he inclined towards her still he was really in love with mildred and the thought of losing her was more than he could bear on reflection he found he had put a question to himself that he could not answer that very morning an opportunity offered for saying a tender word to mildred but his courage failed him loving her as he did and feeling sure she loved him in return he hesitated to commit himself they were walking in the garden and the animated conversation with which they had commenced had gradually died away and was succeeded by a silence that was almost embarrassing clearly the moment had arrived what could he dowhat say he took her hand she did not withdraw it and he pressed it to his lips but oh disgrace to manhood no word was uttered he heaved a deep sighthat was all it was almost a relief to him when mrs calverley and emmeline were seen approaching how provoking exclaimed the captain who however was secretly pleased by the interruption had he thought proper he might have moved on but instead of doing so he turned round and met those who were coming towards them mrs calverley who had very quick sight had seen what took place but did not of course make the slightest remark until she found herself shortly afterwards ttette with the captain the others having walked on i think i explained to you captain danvers what my intentions are in regard to mildred she said yes i perfectly recollect he replied you said you meant to give her a marriage portion of thirty thousand pounds and i thought it exceedingly handsome but you did not quite understand me i fancy said mrs calverley regarding him steadfastly i ought to have added that she will have this sum on her marriage provided i approve of her choice ah that proviso makes all the difference exclaimed the captain the money may not be given after all i shall never withhold it unless i see some decided objection to the match she rejoined think over what i have told you no more was said but the caution thus given him produced the effect intended on captain danvers he saw that mildred was completely in her stepmothers power and that the latter would do nothing if offended he now rejoiced that he had not made a positive proposal as he would then have been compelled to take the fair girl without a portion and he was not disinterested enough to do that however he put the best face he could on the matter and said i am obliged to you for the information you have given me had i meant to propose to miss calverley it would not have deterred me but i have no such intention and you expect me to believe this after what i beheld just now said mrs calverley incredulously i expect you to believe what i tell you rejoined the captain rather haughtily and i again assert that i have not proposed to her i am glad to hear it it would have pained me to do a disagreeable thing but you would have done it undoubtedly however since you give me this assurance i need say no more later on in the day chetwynd and captain danvers were smoking a cigar in the dressingroom of the former when the captain broached a subject on which he had been ruminating chetwynd old boy he said i want to ask you a question dont think me impertinent but i should like to know whether it is true that mrs calverley has the entire control of your sisters fortune ill answer the question frankly replied chetwynd she has my father as you may be aware made an extraordinary will and it was the strange disposition of his property that caused the quarrel between myself and my stepmother you talk of my sisters fortune properly speaking she has none she has a handsome allowance from mrs calverley who always declares she will give her a portion of thirty thousand pounds on her marriage provided she approves of her choiceis not that a condition said the captain yes but it means nothing pardon me i think it means a great deal it might cause a match to be broken off it might certainly if acted upon but mrs calverley is very much attached to my sister and will never oppose her choice at least i fancy not i have reason to believe otherwise my dear chetwynd she has already given me a pretty strong hint have you said anything to her about mildred no but she has spoken to me and has clearly intimated that i am not the man of her choice were i to be accepted depend upon it mildred would have no portion you think so im sure of it can you help me i dont see how i have no influence over mrs calverley and am determined not to meddle in any family matters besides i should do no good but i dont think there is any real ground for apprehension as i have just said she is extremely fond of mildred and if she felt my sisters happiness were at stake she wouldnt interfere with any engagement she might form i am certain of that though i cannot aid you i will tell you who can and most efficientlyyour cousin emmeline barfleur i wonder she has not occurred to you my dear fellow i have had no time for consideration rejoined the captain i have only just received this obliging hint from mrs calverley but i entirely agree with you emmeline is the person of all others who can aid me let us go and look for her at once most likely we shall find her in the garden for they are not driving out this afternoon chetwynd assented so they flung away their cigars and went downstairs v how captain danvers was thrown over by both ladies mrs calverley was in the drawingroom occupied with a novel and feeling easy as far as she was concerned the two young gentlemen went out in quest of the girls and soon found them at a sign from captain danvers emmeline came and sat down beside him on a lawnchair while chetwynd and his sister walked on now charles what have you got to say to me she inquired i want to talk to you about mildred well i am prepared to listen it would be quite superfluous to tell me you are in love with her for i know that very well indeed if i am not mistaken you were interrupted in making a proposal this very morning i own the soft impeachment but the interruption seems to have been fortunate for i should have got into a serious scrape if the proposal had been actually made how so she exclaimed in astonishment mrs calverley holds her stepdaughters destinythat is her fortunein her own hands and has since given me clearly to understand that in my case mildred would be portionless and pray what else could you expect you have been flirting so outrageously with mrs calverley herself that you have caused her to regard her stepdaughter as a rival were it not that mildred may suffer from your conduct i should say you were very properly punished i declare i thought you had proposed to mrs calverley not quite he replied laughing then you have misled her no wonder she is angry when she finds you so inconstant will you do me a good turn dearest emmeline i cant promise i feel greatly displeased with you myself im sorry for that but perhaps the mistake can be remedied how can it be done no you have lost mildred and must put up with mrs calverley this suggestion threw the captain into a fit of despair she is very handsome pursued emmeline very rich and has got this fine house with all the furniture plate pictures horses and carriages you wont be so badly off i would rather have mildred with her portion sighed the captain but you must take her without a portion you see how will you like that it is not to be thought of give me some advice my advice to you is to retire from the field altogether you are laughing at me that is cruel under the circumstances it is the best thing you can do but i mean to stay and hope to gain my point mildreds hand yes and the portion you must cease to pay attentions to mrs calverley i have done so and you see the result i think i had better resume them that would be most improper and i cannot countenance such a proceeding one or the other it must benot both but i must keep mrs calverley in good humour or there will be a quarrel and that must be avoided you are incorrigible laughed emmeline the sooner you go the better i have just told you i dont mean to go ah here comes mrs calverley pray dont desert me expect no assistance from me deluder as mrs calverley came up they rose to receive her i am sorry to disturb you she said you seemed engaged in a very interesting discourse we were talking about you replied emmeline about me cried mrs calverley in affected surprise yes but i cant tell you what we were saying it mightnt be agreeable to you i will take my chance of that well then i was just saying to captain danvers that if i had such a charming place as you possess and such a good income i would never marry again i have no idea of marrying again observed mrs calverley carelessly i may sometimes listen to the nonsense talked to me she added glancing at captain danvers but i rate it at what it is worth i prefer being my own mistress if i wanted companionship i might think differently but as things stand at present i shall certainly adhere to my resolution such resolutions are never kept said captain danvers your sex are allowed to change their mind as often as they please at all events i shall wait till mildred is married she rejoined then i dont think you will have to wait long remarked captain danvers you are mistaken rejoined mrs calverley mildred i feel sure will not marry immediately this was said with so much significance that both her hearers were struck by it and emmeline gave her cousin a slight pinch as much as to say there sir you see what you have done at this instant chetwynd and mildred returned from the further end of the garden and joined the party on the lawn captain danvers thought mildreds manner colder to him than it had been before but he soon received an explanation of the change from chetwynd who took him aside and said i have had some conversation about you with my sister and have ascertained her sentiments it will be useless to propose to her you will be refused is this quite certain my dear chetwynd quite certain whether she is acting by mrs calverleys advice i cant say but she has made up her mind to refuse you the captain was confounded apparently he had lost his chance with both ladies vi mrs calverley renders chetwynd an important service next morning while the party were assembled at breakfast captain danvers announced his intention of terminating his visit which he declared had been most agreeable and though pressed to stay by mrs calverley he declined i have promised to spend a few days with lady barfleur before my return to town he said and must not disappoint her i have written to tell her she may expect me at dinner today then you really mean to leave us said mrs calverley this is a very short visit i hoped you would spend at least a week here but you wont be far off and can come back again if you are so inclined i shall be very glad to see you mildred did not say a word if she had spoken he would have assented you are very good he rejoined but it is possible i may be summoned to town it is quite certain you will find brackley very dull after this lively house charles said emmeline take my advice and stay where you are a little solitude will suit my present mood he rejoined if i feel very very lonely ill ride over here well we offer you our society said mrs calverley all of you asked the captain glancing at mildred who was on the opposite side of the table but she did not look at him if you are positively going ill ride over to brackley with you this afternoon observed chetwynd and stay to dinner said the captain my aunt will be very glad of your company that she will im sure observed emmeline suppose we all go what say you she added to mildred the young lady appealed to shook her head the drive will do you good said emmeline be persuaded no thank you not today replied mildred captain danvers looked at her imploringly but she remained steadfast well since you are so perverse you deserve to be left behind said emmeline you shall drive me in your ponycarriage dear mrs calverley with greatest pleasure replied the lady but i cant promise you an adventure then feeling that the remark might awaken painful recollections she stopped short during the latter part of this discourse norris had entered the room and approaching chetwynd told him in a whisper that two persons wanted to see him on important business who are they inquired chetwynd thinking there was something strange in the butlers manner they didnt give their names sir replied norris and ive never seen them before ive shown them into the library quite right ill come to them after breakfast better see them at once i think sir observed norris significantly on this chetwynd got up without disturbing the party and following the butler out of the room repaired to the library where he found the two personages looks dress and deportment proclaimed their vocation coarse stout redfaced vulgarlooking dogs they seemed up to their business each was provided with a stout stick having seen such fellows before chetwynd instantly understood what they were but they would not have left him long in doubt as he entered the room one of the twain stepped up to him and said with an attempt at a bow mr chetwynd calverley i presume chetwynd replied in the affirmative my names grimsditch said the fellow and my mates name is hulse we are officers we have a writ against you for seven hundred pounds but i owe no such sum replied chetwynd beg pardon sir said grimsditch but we have the particulars you gave a bill for six hundred pounds to philip marsh romney esq with costs and interest it now amounts to a hundred more youll find it quite correct sir added hulse i dare say youll recollect all about it i recollect something about a gambling debt to mr romney for six hundred pounds but i was told i ought not to pay it and i wont sorry to hear you say so sir replied grimsditch we hoped the matter would be quietly settled but if it cant be you must come along with us chetwynd looked very angry for a moment and seemed inclined to kick them both out of the room we cant help it sir said grimsditch we must do our duty however unpleasant it may be to us added hulse make no excusesi dont want them said chetwynd ill be back directly cant part with you sir said grimsditch planting himself before the door so as to prevent egress against rule hulse will ring the bell if you wish it do so then said chetwynd the bell was rung and the summons immediately answered by norris who must have been close at hand chetwynd then sat down at a table on which writing materials were placed and traced a few hurried lines on a sheet of paper which he enclosed in an envelope take this note to mrs calverley he said to norris instantly sir replied the butler glancing indignantly at the officers while norris went on his errand chetwynd remained seated at the table with his back towards the officers in a few minutes the door opened and captain danvers came in with a note in his hand out of my way men he said as he marched past them mrs calverley has sent you a cheque on the chester bank for the amount you requireseven hundred pounds he added to chetwynd pay these fellows and get rid of them heres the bill with charges and all particulars said grimsditch following him to the table and theres the cheque said chetwynd giving it to him after he had endorsed it all right sir replied grimsditch on chester i see my own bank cant be better always glad to have one of them cheques in my pocketbook and now sir he added if youll allow me to sit down ill give you a receipt this business completed grimsditch got up bowed and was retiring with his companion when chetwynd called out to them stay a minute he said in a stern tone i wish you to understand that i consider this as a most nefarious transaction i have been robbed sir exclaimed both officers not by you but by your employer philip marsh romney is a consummate scoundrel tell him so we wont do you such a bad turn sir rejoined grimsditch mr romney might bring an action for libel no he wont said chetwynd he knows better he may have done with me but i have not done with him tell him that at all events we will replied the officers as they disappeared im glad youve got rid of those rascals chetwynd said captain danvers upon my soul i think mrs calverley has behaved remarkably well on receiving your note she got up to write the cheque at once and begged me to take it to you she wouldnt bring it herself you see as her presence might have annoyed you yes it was very well done i admit and i am greatly obliged to her but you dont seem half grateful enough said danvers oh yes i am gratefulvery grateful replied chetwynd shortly afterwards he went to mrs calverley and said you have rendered me a great service but i dont know when i shall be able to repay you repay me whenever it may be convenient she replied or not at all just give me a memorandum that i have advanced you seven hundred pounds that is all i require vii how chetwynd and emmeline plighted their faith in the old chapel no persuasion on emmelines part would induce mildred to go to brackley that day nor would she bid captain danvers adieu the other arrangement was carried out the captains valise being sent on by his groom who at the same time took a note from emmeline to lady barfleur to let her know whom she might expect about three oclock the party set off the two ladies in the ponycarriage the gentlemen on horseback the day was fine but sultry and as they crossed the heath a peal of thunder was heard in the distance but it came to nothing mrs calverley certainly did not seem to regret mildreds absence she was unusually lively and appeared quite to have forgiven the captains inconstancy and to be willing to take him into favour again so he renewed his assiduities chetwynd looked preoccupied he rode by the side of the ponycarriage but did not converse much with emmeline who was struck by his sombre expression of countenance it was the same at brackley they walked together in the garden but he spoke little and did not breathe a word of love had he something on his mind in the courtyard of the old hall as already stated there was an ancient chapel in excellent preservation originally it was devoted to the rites of the church of rome as it must needs have been since it was built nearly a hundred years before the reformation chetwynd had often admired the exterior of the old fabric but had never been inside it and emmeline offered to show it to him as they passed through the court the door being unfastened they went in the windows were filled with stained glass of the richest hues and there was a large sculptured monument that instantly caught the eye to sir simon barfleur and dame beatrix his wife who flourished in the time of henry the seventh other monuments there were that somewhat encroached on the space of the little structure but none of the family had been interred in the vault beneath for more than a century the chapel was provided with a large pew for the family and guests and seats for the household a venerable divine the reverend mr massey officiated as chaplain and had done so for sixty years after advancing a few steps chetwynd paused and looked round every object was coloured by the painted glass now illuminated by the rays of the declining sun after admiring this glowing picture for a few moments he joined emmeline who was standing near the precincts of the altar his countenance had still the melancholy look it had borne throughout the day but he gazed earnestly at emmeline as he said in a low supplicating voice i have not yet proved myself worthy of your love but if i dared i would entreat you to plight your faith to me here for some minutes she made no reply but seemed occupied with serious reflection she then said i think i may trust you chetwynd you may he replied in accents that bespoke his sincerity she hesitated no more but freely gave him her hand i hereby solemnly plight my faith to you chetwynd she said if i wed you not i will wed no other that i swear his countenance underwent an instant change and became lighted up with joy he repeated the words she had uttered but added i must not claim your hand my task is not completedscarcely begun i am witness to the vow you have made said a voice behind them looking round they perceived the old chaplain mr massey who had followed them unseen into the chapel a venerable man in age more than fourscore with silver locks and a most benevolent expression of countenance heaven bless your union whenever it takes place and though i may not live to see it he said i trust you may unite us reverend sir said chetwynd but you ought to know who i am i do know sir replied mr massey and i have perfect faith in you or i would not have sanctioned this solemn engagement should it be carried out as i doubt not it will mr chetwynd calverley may esteem himself the most fortunate and the happiest man in england i have known the fair young lady who has just plighted her faith to him since she was a child and have loved her as a father and have met with none of her sex in any way comparable to her again i say to you mr calverley you are most fortunate and should the almighty bless you with this treasure guard it as you would your life i will replied chetwynd deeply moved they did not remain many minutes longer in the chapel but repaired to the house accompanied by mr massey viii the haunted boom the day as previously stated had been fine but exceedingly sultry and the sunset portended thunder just as those about to return to ouselcroft were preparing for departure a heavy thunderstorm came on and as there seemed every likelihood of its continuance they were easily induced to pass the night at brackley a messenger was immediately sent off to mildred to prevent alarm and captain danvers undertook that chetwynd should be put to no inconvenience in regard to his toilette there was no difficulty about beds for there was a superfluity at brackley a large chamber was assigned to chetwynd containing an antique canopied bedstead with twisted oak pillars and heavy brocade curtains the splendour of which was somewhat dimmed by years there were a couple of old black cabinets in the room and the dark oak panels were hung with sombre tapestry or adorned with portraits the only modern furniture was a cardtable set with two chairs in the centre of the room opposite the end of the bed candles were placed upon the table and a couple of packs of cards very likely these preparations had been made by order of captain danvers chetwynd had heard there was a haunted room at brackley but it never occurred to him that this was the identical apartment and though captain danvers was aware of its ghostly reputation he thought it best to say nothing about it he accompanied his friend to the room having previously supplied him with such articles as he might require for the night and then pointing to the table said shall we have a game at cart no thank you replied chetwynd ive vowed never to touch cards again well i wont tempt you to break your oath replied danvers laughing good night i hope youll sleep well and he quitted the room chetwynd sought his splendid couch and though the thunder rattled awfully overhead and the lightning blazed he speedily fell asleep how long he slumbered he could not tell nor could he exactly say what awoke him but when he opened his eyes he perceived a light in the room at first he thought it must be the lightning for he was certain he had put out the bedcandle but this illumination was continuous looking up to his great surprise he perceived two elderly gentlemen seated opposite each other at the cardtable the wax candles were lighted and the two strange personages were playing at cart or some other game an unaccountable dread seized chetwynd as he watched them and he wondered how they came to be there at that time of night perhaps they might not be aware of his presence so he thought he ought to apprise them of it raising himself on the pillow to examine them more narrowly he perceived that one of them was sir leycester barfleur and the otherhis own father astounded and dismayed at this discovery he felt utterly unable to speak and remainedgazing at them while they continued their game at last they threw down their cards and got up then mr calverley as it seemed exclaimed in an unearthly voice ive won upon which sir leycester in accents equally unearthly replied not yet then they both looked towards the occupant of the bed and the expression of their countenance was so fearful that chetwynd was unable to endure it and fell back insensible when he recoveredor rather when he awokehe did not feel quite sure that the supernatural appearance which he thought he had witnessed might not have been a dream on examination the candles did not appear to have been lighted and both packs of cards were untouched this seemed to favour the idea that it must have been a dream but chetwynd could not believe so he felt sure he had seen the two old men captain danvers was curious to learn how his friend had passed the night and owned that the room was said to be haunted chetwynd made an evasive reply ill tell you a strange thing said danvers my uncle sir leycester once lost a large sum to your father in this room they have not yet finished the game said chetwynd i saw them playing during the night ix what passed between captain danvers and mrs calverley in the garden after the stormy night came a magnificent day brackley looked so charming that the guests were in no hurry to depart captain danvers took a stroll in the garden with mrs calverley resolved that the interview should decide his fate it was idle to think any more of mildred who had behaved very heartlessly in refusing to bid him adieu his selection was made he would offer his hand to the beautiful and wealthy widow who had given him every encouragement the bowlinggreen though delightful was rather too damp after the rain of the previous night and the benches were not yet dried so they moved on towards a shady walk where the captain commenced i hope you have quite forgiven me my dear mrs calverley he said i can scarcely account for my folly but i can assure you i am now quite sensible of it and will never again offend in the like manner indeed i will put it out of my power to do so by binding myself indissolubly to you do you mean this as an offer she said certainly he replied what else can it mean then i must have a little time for consideration i cannot make up my mind in a moment on such an important point the captains ardour was very much damped he had flattered himself he should be at once accepted but you dont reject me he said anxiously no you must remain on trial for a month if i am quite satisfied with your conduct during that interval i may become yours then it is not to be an engagement he cried yes i am quite willing it should be an engagementbut not binding on either party such an arrangement amounts to nothing he said if you love me well enough to give me your hand accept me now and let the marriage be fixed for some early day i cannot agree to that she replied we shall have to come to an understanding on many points we are sure to do that he replied i agree to all beforehand you shall have your own way entirely i shall be a very goodnatured husband i am not so sure of that she replied with a slight laugh men who make promises of compliance beforehand often turn out most impracticable that wont hold good in my case well you shant say that i take you in for i announce that i mean to retain entire possession of my own property the captain could scarcely hide his confusion at this unexpected intimation however he did not make any objection in a word my house will be conducted precisely as it is now pursued mrs calverley that is just what i should like he rejoined arrange it as you please i shall never interfere have we come to a distinct understanding yes and if you retain these sentiments we shall probably agree are we not now agreed on the main points she replied but our engagement must be private for the present i have my reasons for the request i wont ask them but comply in all things you shall be obeyed she smiled very graciously if not every affectionately and gave him her hand which he raised to his lips her beautiful features underwent a slight change at that moment and the expression startled captain danvers so much that he almost repented the step he had taken but it was now too late to retreat though our engagement will be secret you can come to ouselcroft whenever you please she said only remember there must be no renewal fear nothing he replied there shall be no more of that they then returned to the house and on the way thither met emmeline and chetwynd the former smiled on seeing her cousin and mrs calverley together but made no remark later on however when an opportunity offered she said to captain danvers all is settled i perceive between you and the rich widow what makes you think so he asked both of you look as if you already repented she replied but i hope you may be happy captain danvers rode back with them to ouselcroft but he did not stay nor did he see mildred however he agreed to return in a few days emmeline was distressed to find her friend looking less cheerful than usual indeed she appeared decidedly lowspirited i hope you are not troubling yourself about my unworthy cousin charles said emmeline i wish i could cease to think of him replied mildred with a sigh i have tried but in vain you must think of him no more dearest girl said emmeline mildred looked at her anxiously what is it dont keep me in suspense she cried he is engaged to mrs calverley replied emmeline mildred became white as death engaged to her she ejaculated oh this is too much she would have fallen if emmeline had not caught her fortunately this occurrence took place in mildreds own room and restoratives being at hand it was not necessary to summon assistance x an invitation to town next day a letter was forwarded to emmeline from brackley it was from lady thicknesse of belgrave square of whom mention has been previously made lady thicknesse it may be stated was a sister of lady barfleur though several years her junior and consequently aunt to emmeline the letter which had an enormous black border and was sealed with black wax was to the following effect it will give me great pleasure my dearest niece if you will come and spend a few weeks with me in belgrave squarequite quietly of course i think the change will do you good and i shall be very glad of your society for i have been rather triste of late poor sir leycesters death affected me a great deal i dont ask my sister to accompany you for i know she wont stir from brackley but i shall be very glad if you will bring with you your friend mildred calverley i remember her as a very charming girl and know you are much attached to her she must not expect any gaiety you will be as quiet here as you are in the country adieu dearest emmeline come as soon as you can and dont fail to bring mildred with you i write separately to your mamma emmeline was in mildreds room when lady thicknesses letter was delivered to her she read it aloud to her friend and on finishing it exclaimed now mildred what do you say will you go to town with me i am sure my aunt lady thicknesse will be very glad to see you and she is most agreeable and kindheartedbut i neednt describe her since you have seen her yes i know her slightly and am persuaded i shall like her much when i know her better then you will go certainly since you wish me to accompany you i confess i dont feel happy here just now it will be an escape mrs calverley wont object i suppose on the contrary replied mildred with a singular smile i think she will be glad to get rid of me for a time im sure there will be no difficulty on mammas part observed emmeline why here is a note from her that i have not read as i expected she cried she urges me to accept the invitation and hopes you will accompany me let us go downstairs and settle the matter at once they found mrs calverley seated with captain danvers in the drawingroom engaged in a very interesting ttette and the discovery increased mildreds desire to be gone the captain rose and bowed to her and she made him a very freezing salute in return it appeared that he had brought the letters from brackley and having heard of the invitation from lady barfleur had mentioned it to mrs calverley so that she was fully prepared i know what you are come to tell me she said captain danvers has already informed me of lady thicknesses invitation and i sincerely hope you intend to accept it since the plan is agreeable to you we shall do so replied emmeline and we propose to go soon said mildred as soon as you please my love said mrs calverley smiling i wont delay you you can set out tomorrow if your preparations can be made in time we have very few preparations to make remarked emmeline we are not going to any parties i will write to lady thicknesse to prepare her for our arrival tomorrow evening you will want some one to take charge of you observed mrs calverley you cant travel alone captain danvers was about to offer himself but a look from mrs calverley checked him chetwynd will take charge of them she said this proposition was very agreeable to the two young ladies and when chetwynd made his appearance a few minutes afterwards he readily agreed to it so the matter was settled later on emmeline and mildred went to brackley in order to spend the evening with lady barfleur captain danvers remained to dine with mrs calverleyso they saw nothing of him next morning chetwynd came over fully prepared for the journey and mrs calverley was with him wishing to see them off with praiseworthy punctuality all the boxes and portmanteaux were ready at the appointed time having been packed by the young ladies themselves as they did not mean to take a ladysmaid with them lady barfleur took leave of her daughter in private and bedewed her cheek with tears when she embraced her at parting but not many tears were shed on either side when mildred bade her stepmother adieu captain danvers offered his hand to the offended damsel as she stepped into the carriage but she declined the assistance accompanied by chetwynd the two girls drove in the large oldfashioned carriage to chester whence they proceeded by rail to london arriving at kensington about six oclock having conducted them to lady thicknesses residence in belgrave square chetwynd took leave promising to call on the morrow he then drove to the grosvenor hotel where he engaged a room and ordered dinner end of the fourth book book the fifthlady thicknesse i in which chetwynd learns how a quarrel has taken place between rose and harry netterville after he had dined chetwynd took a hansom cab and drove to lambeth alighting at the foot of the bridge he walked to hartleys house in spencers rents wondering whether he should find any one at home he knocked but not very loudly and the summons was presently answered by mrs hartley who came from the kitchen with a light why bless me if it aint mr walter liddelor rather i ought to say mr chetwynd calverley she exclaimed very nearly letting the candle drop in her surprise who would have thought of seeing you here tonight sir ive just come to town mrs hartley he replied and i couldnt help calling to inquire how you all are how is your worthy husbandand how is rose both are well sir she replied in a tone that did not sound very cheerful but pray come in sir she added leading him to the little parlour with which he was so familiar when another candle was lighted and he had taken his seat she remarked a good deal has happened since you went away sir nothing unpleasant i hope he inquired youll be sorry to hear that roses engagement with harry netterville is broken off broken off he exclaimed that is bad news indeed on what account i was going to say on your account sir but that wouldnt be right she replied however this is what has taken place an anonymous letter has been sent to harry netterville making reflections upon roses conduct with you and as harry is very jealous he believed what was said and reproached her and rose being very hasty a quarrel ensued and they both declare they wont make it up but i hope they will for im sure theyre very much attached to each other im surprised as well as grieved by what you tell me mrs hartley replied chetwynd i thought harry netterville had more sense than to be influenced by an anonymous slanderer he ought to have treated the letter with scorn he knows rose too well to doubt her for a moment yes and thats what makes her so angry with him harry has never had the slightest reason to complain of me she says and now he gets this false wicked letter which is only written to make mischief he thinks it all true i fancy i can give a guess at the writer said chetwynd the villain had a double motive for sending the letter but i will see harry netterville myself tomorrow and talk to him i fear youll only make matters worse sir he is very prejudiced and stupid but the affair cannot be allowed to remain in this state i owe it to myself to set it right well you must talk to rose sir i expect her back shortly shes gone about a place a place exclaimed chetwynd yes since her quarrel with harry she has determined to go into service and our good friend mr tankard has got her a situation as ladys maid she is gone this evening to belgrave square to see lady thicknesse who has engaged her now indeed you surprise me cried chetwynd this is a strange coincidence yes i thought youd be surprised when i mentioned the name as you recollect that was the house but here she comes she exclaimed as a knock was heard at the door rose my dear she added heres some one waiting to see you i know who it is replied her daughter i expected to find mr chetwynd calverley here in another moment she had taken off her hat and cloak and came into the room looking as pretty as ever and what could hardly have been expected under the circumstances in very good spirits i felt almost certain i should find you here mr calverley she said after salutations rather more distant than formerly had passed between them you will understand why i say so when i tell you i have just seen your sister and miss barfleur and two more charming amiable young ladies i never beheld it will be quite a pleasure to me to attend upon them and i must say they appeared equally well pleased with me they seemed to know all about me yes i had described you to them remarked chetwynd so they told me said rose its a curious thing altogether but what makes it more singular is that i should go to the house at the very time of their arrival i believe i was engaged by lady thicknesse expressly to attend to them mrs hartley had uttered a great many exclamations as her daughter went on and she now said and how do you like lady thicknesse rose very much indeed was the reply she is a middleaged lady perhaps turned fifty but still goodlooking and has a fine tall figure and dresses very richly i should have thought more of her if i hadnt been so much taken up with the young ladies she received me very graciously and said i should suit her perfectly especially as her niece miss barfleur and miss calverley seemed pleased with me nothing was said to her ladyship in reference to any previous matter inquired chetwynd nothing whatever sir replied rose the young ladies spoke to me in private i had likewise some conversation with mr higgins who cautioned me but i told him i should never breathe a word on the subject you neednt feel the slightest uneasiness sir tomorrow i enter upon my duties and am sure i shall be very happy i sincerely hope so rose said chetwynd i am very sorry for the misunderstanding that has occurred ive told mr calverley all about the quarrel my dear remarked mrs hartley im very angry indeed with harry cried rose and dont feel at all inclined to make it up with him youll think differently byandby i dare say observed chetwynd my belief is that the writer of that mischievous letter to harry is no other than the scoundrel who annoyed you in the steamboat and whom i chastised for his insolence the same idea occurred to me said rose and i should have mentioned my suspicions to harry but he would listen to no explanations knowing his jealous temper i never told him of that occurrence as i fancied it would put him out i also blame myself for not mentioning one or two circumstances that have occurred since your departure but i really felt frightened has romney made an attempt to see you again asked chetwynd more than once she replied he annoys me dreadfully when my father is with me he keeps out of the way but i cannot always have a protector at my side this is one reason why i have resolved to go into service i shall be secure from my tormentor i hope he wont trouble you much longer remarked chetwynd just then a knock was heard at the door it was rather sharp and surprised the hearers who can that be cried rose uneasily ill go and see replied her mother the person at the door was no other than tom tankard he inquired for rose and mrs hartley begged him to come in and ushered him at once into the little parlour tom who was dressed in evening attire appeared very much surprised at the sight of chetwynd and would have retreated if he could have done so with a good grace declining to take a seat he addressed himself to rose and said i hope you will excuse this intrusion miss hartley but i am the bearer of a message to you from my friend mr harry netterville he wishes to know whether you will grant him an interview shall i said rose in a low voice nay dont appeal to me replied chetwynd exercise your own discretion i ought to say that mr netterville is without observed tom so that he requires an immediate answer when i inform him who his here i dont feel quite sure that he will come in he can please himself said rose tell him in reply to his message that i will see him but not alone have the goodness also to tell him from me mr tom observed chetwynd that i have a few words to say to him i intended to call on him tomorrow i will do your bidding sir replied tom but i remark pray dont make any remarks at present sir interrupted chetwynd just convey my message tom bowed and left the room he was attended to the streetdoor by mrs hartley who waited to see whether he would return ii harry nettervilles jealous rage some persuasion on tom tankards part was evidently required to induce harry netterville to enter the house but at length he reluctantly consented to do so and followed mrs hartley into the parlour as soon as he saw chetwynd he could no longer control himself but flew into a transport of jealous rage and would certainly have made a scene if tom who was close behind had not checked him a sort of calm being restored chetwynd remarked allow me mr netterville before anything more is said to offer a word of explanation my presence here this evening is purely accidental i have just arrived in town and came to inquire after my good friends it grieved me to learn that a misunderstanding has arisen between you and rose but i am sure it can be easily set right the anonymous letter you have received was from a great reprobate who for purposes of his own wished to destroy your confidence in this good and truthful girl who is sincerelyattached to you and unfortunately he has succeeded in his object your explanation though plausible has very little weight with me sir replied netterville i only consented to enter the house to convince myself by ocular demonstration that you are here having done that i shall depart farewell deceitful girlfarewell for ever stay harry cried rose rushing towards him and seizing his arm i cannot allow you to depart thus listen to the explanation mr calverley desires to give you you have been made a dupe i know it rejoined netterville bitterly but i will be duped no longer it is idle to say how much i have loved you faithless girl i now tear you from my heart for ever oh dont say so dearest harry she cried it is all a mistake you will be sorry when you find out your error you have been very foolish foolish he exclaimed in a tremendous voice your conduct has been enough to drive me mad if you really love me as you pretend come away with me now no i cant do that dear harry you shall whether you like it or not he said seizing her arm frightened by his violence she uttered a cry rushed back and flung herself into chetwynds arms who was coming forward to assist her as may be imagined this occurrence inflamed the jealous lover to the highest pitch and tom tankard had some difficulty in holding him back let me go cried netterville struggling with his friend my worst suspicions are now confirmed let me go i say ill punish him no you shant cried tom who could scarcely refrain from laughing at the absurdity of the scene youve committed folly enough already come along and he dragged him out of the house i didnt believe harry could behave in such an extraordinary manner said rose as soon as he was gone he terrified me so much that i scarcely knew what i was about i hope youll excuse me sir theres nothing to excuse replied chetwynd but you must judge your lover as leniently as you can his violence only proves the strength of his affection for you i would rather he didnt show his affection in this way she rejoined certainly he allowed his passion to carry him a great deal too far said chetwynd but he will be very sorry tomorrow when he comes here again he will find me gone and i shant write to him said rose dont make resolutions you are sure to break said chetwynd and now adieu possibly i may see you tomorrow in belgrave square bidding good night to mrs hartley and leaving a kindly message for her husband he then quitted the house iii lord courland lady thicknesse widow of sir thomas thicknesse of haslemere cheshire was some four or five years younger than her sister lady barfleur in her day she had been considered a great beauty and was still attractive for her manners were extremely agreeable she habitually resided in belgrave square and not being fond of the country seldom spent more than a couple of months in the autumn at haslemere she still had a large establishment much larger than she required for the state of her health did not allow her to keep much company and she no longer gave any of those grand parties that had once made her the fashion lady thicknesse had no children but she was proud and ambitious and her great desire was that emmeline should marry a person of rank during sir leycesters lifetime she despaired of accomplishing her purpose for he would allow no interference on her part his demise however left the stage clear and as emmeline had now become a great heiress the matter seemed quite simple and easy the noble husband had only to be chosen after a little consideration she fixed upon lord courland the eldest son of the earl of lymington who seemed to possess all the requisites and in whom she herself felt an interest besides he was a great friend of her nephew scrope danvers a circumstance that seemed very favourable to her design lord courland was about fourandtwenty very much liked generally on account of his agreeable manners and sufficiently goodlooking she had never heard him express an opinion on the subject but she fancied he was just the man who would desire to marry an heiress the real question was whether emmeline would accept him on this point lady thicknesse had no misgiving having perfect reliance on her own powers of persuasion her plan settled she wrote the letter we have seen to her niece it quite answered its purpose and excited no suspicion all the rest followed as narrated on their arrival in belgrave square lady thicknesse received the two girls with every demonstration of delight and she appeared so amiable and affectionate that they were charmed with her she was told that chetwynd calverley had brought them to town but she attached no importance to the circumstance not conceiving it possible that emmeline could care for him until now she had never seen mildred and was quite surprised by her beauty had she known she was so goodlooking she didnt feel sure she should have asked her she might outshine her niece next morning the two girls who were both in very good spirits and looking very well after their journey were seated in the large and splendidly furnished drawingroom when lady thicknesse began to open her plan bytheby emmeline she said i ought to mention that your cousin scrope danvers is in town and will very likely call this morning for he knows you will be here i hope he may and bring with him his friend lord courland i neednt tell you that lord courland is the eldest son of the earl of lymington but i may say he is very agreeable and singularly unaffected for a person of his rank and i am persuaded you will like him i dare say i shall replied emmeline i have heard charles danvers speak of him as a very nice fellow he is a great favourite of mine i own said lady thicknesse his father is in very bad health so it cannot be long before he becomes earl of lymington and master of guilsborough castle one of the finest places in hampshire but i wont say any more about him youll see him presently and judge for yourself the opportunity soon offered scarcely had lady thicknesse done singing the young lords praises than he and scrope danvers were announced decidedly he produced a favourable impression tall and slight of figure with features agreeable in expression if not handsome he was easy and refined in manner and seemed to possess great tact he had lightbrown hair a beard of the same hue and very good teeth both girls were pleased with him and he was evidently struck by their beauty but he paid no exclusive attention to emmeline and talked quite as much to mildred as to her his sole aim seemed to be to amuse them and his chat being very lively and some of his stories very diverting he perfectly succeeded when he and scrope rose to depart after a visit of half an hour during which there was no pause in the conversation lady thicknesse asked them both to dinner and the invitation was acceptedmuch to the delight of the girls well what do you think of lord courland observed lady thicknesse who thought the affair had commenced capitally have i said too much in his praise not at all replied emmeline i never spent half an hour more agreeably nor i added mildred i feel quite ashamed of myself for laughing so much but i really couldnt help it he is an excellent talker i hope you will see a great deal more of him during your stay in town said lady thicknesse i hope we shall rejoined emmeline he promises to be a very agreeable acquaintance he may possibly be something more than a mere acquaintance my love remarked her ladyship significantly i think you have made a conquest he seemed quite captivated not by me my dear aunt if he was captivated by either of us it was by mildred she has made the conquest quite unintentionally replied mildred but i agree with lady thicknesse you were the chief attraction emmeline smiled and shook her head well whoever wins him will have good reason to congratulate herself said lady thicknesse we shant quarrel about him thats certain said emmeline im quite ready to retire from the field in your favour she added to mildred i should like nothing better than to see you lady courland i fear we are getting on a little too fast dear girls said lady thicknesse who was not pleased by the turn things seemed taking i have raised expectations that may never be realised i really dont think lord courland is a marrying man i entertain quite a different opinion aunt said emmeline within a week i feel sure he will have proposed to mildred i hope miss calverley wont take what you say seriously observed lady thicknesse she may be disappointed no indeed i shant said mildred i have no idea of catching this young lord i am not dazzled by his rank though not insensible to it i am charmed with his affability and good nature but that is all you wont find a rival in me dearest emmeline never mind me mildred said emmeline you know very well i am out of the question i ask you plainly wouldnt you like to be lady courland i cant tell replied the other i havent thought about it then well talk it over and ill give you my reasons said emmeline youd better hear mine first remarked lady thicknesse but tell me what you meant by bidding miss calverley not to mind you and adding she knew very well you are out of the question that is an ambiguous phrase it is intelligible enough to mildred my dear aunt and only means that i have no idea of marrying at present but how came you to form such a silly resolution you mustnt ask me my dear aunt not now but at some more suitable time i shall think it my duty to require an explanation rather fortunately the discourse was interrupted just at that moment by chetwynd who was ushered into the room by higgins lady thicknesse had never seen him before and was very much struck by his appearance she had no idea he was so handsome and a suspicion of the truth then crossed her could he be engaged to emmeline but she dismissed the notion as soon as formed she had been prejudiced against him by the accounts she had heard of his follies extravagance and impetuous temper but his good looks and quiet deportment operated strongly in his favour and he had not been in the room five minutes before she felt disposed to like him and evinced her friendly feeling by asking him to dinner on his part chetwynd was very much pleased with her ladyship and could not help smiling as he thought to himself what might have been the consequence if his original plan had been carried out iv a view of the ring road after some little time spent in conversation emmeline remarked to lady thicknesse as you dont mean to drive out till after luncheon aunt and as there is still plenty of time mildred and myself would like to take a walk in the park if you have no objection chetwynd will accompany us with the greatest pleasure he said you will see all the world for people now go to the park in the morning as well as later in the day so i understand she replied may we go dearest aunt lady thicknesse assented upon which the two girls withdrew to make the necessary preparation for the promenade in these they were assisted by their new ladys maid rose who had commenced her duties that morning to their great delight as soon as they were ready they set out with chetwynd and took their way along wilton street and through albert gate to the serpentine the morning being extremely fine a great many people were about and even at that early hour the banks of that lovely sheet of water were thronged with fashionable pedestrians while the adjacent rides and drives were crowded with wellmounted equestrians of both sexes and splendid equipages unaccustomed to such a display our two country girls were struck with admiration how could they be otherwise passing in review before them or grouped around were some of the loveliest and best dressed women in the land and certainly no better specimens of the youthful aristocracy could be found than might be seen mounted on those thoroughbred steeds guiding those wellappointed drags and lighter vehicles or lounging cigar in mouth against the iron railing in its way the scene was very striking to the regular frequenters of the ring crowded as it was it was not difficult to decide that the two lovely girls dressed in deep mourning were strangers every one was struck by their remarkable beauty and wondered who they were information on this point could not be had since no one possessed it some persons remembered chetwynd calverley who was standing beside the unknown fair ones and fancied they might be his sisters and this notion being promulgated soon obtained general credence among the equestrians was one who instantly recognised themthis was sir bridgnorth charlton riding up to the railing he made his presence known to chetwynd who instantly went to speak to him and explained that the girls had just come to town and were staying with lady thicknesse in belgrave square delighted to hear it said sir bridgnorth bowing and waving his hand to the girls tell them ill call tomorrow why not call today said chetwynd they will be charmed to see you and so will lady thicknesse she was talking of you not an hour ago but had no idea you were in town come if you can i will replied sir bridgnorth and with another friendly salute to the two girls he rode on among the loungers collected near the rails when sir bridgnorth pulled up was romney his quick ears caught all that was said he learnt that the two girls were staying with lady thicknesse and that chetwynd was on intimate terms with her ladyship together with some other information that he thought might be useful to him though he was quite close at hand chetwynd did not observe him but returned to the young ladies who were very glad to learn that sir bridgnorth meant to call upon them it was now almost time to return but the scene was so lively and amusing that they remained for a few minutes longer during this interval rather a smart mailphaeton passed by slowly containing a couple of showilydressed but decidedly pretty girls and driven by a young man who tried to look a swell was rather loudly dressed and seemed very vain of his coachmanship in the occupants of this vehicle chetwynd to his great astonishment recognised some acquaintances of his ownthe loudlydressed young swell who appeared to think so much of himself being no other than tom tankard and the young ladies with him miss clotilde tripp and flora sicklemore how tom came to be possessed of such an equipage and such a pair of horses chetwynd could not conceive perhaps he had hired them perhaps some friendly coachman whose master was out of town had lent them to him in any case tom paraded them as his own the supercilious air with which he gazed around and which only excited ridicule and contempt though he thought otherwise was intended to convey that impression he fancied people were staring at him in admiration when they were merely laughing at him as a fool at last his eyes alighted on the tall figure of chetwynd conspicuous amid the throng and he gave him a familiar nod but chetwynd pretended not to see it enraged by the slight tom turned to the girls with him and said theres that tall fellow whom you saw dressed up as a footman at our house he chooses to cut me but ill be even with him he shant cut and come again i can tell him perhaps he didnt see you suggested clotilde oh yes he did rejoined tom he couldnt help seeing me since he was looking this way at the time never mind ill serve him out what two pretty girls those are with him cried flora not to compare with two others close at hand rejoined tom gallantly ah we cant accept that compliment mr tom said flora those are two very stylish young ladies indeed i cant see it remarked tom i dont admire women in black i like something brightsomething in your style miss flora or in mine suggested clotilde exactly said tom i hope that fellow wont tell the guvnor that he saw me driving you in the park good gracious i hope not exclaimed both girls but hes not likely to see mr tankard is he observed clotilde dont knowjust possible if he should therell be a jolly row the guvnor ll never rest till hes found it all out well dont let us spoil our pleasure by thinking about it said flora its very charming never enjoyed anything so much in my life as this drive not even our drive to hampton races said tom with a knowing look not even that she replied im sure we shall always feel indebted to you for a most delightful day mr tom said clotilde well it is pleasant cried tom i like to see all these fine folks and i like to be seen myself but i dont like to be cut confound that fellow i cant forget him thats not like you tom to let such a small thing worry you observed clotilde youre right said tom my maxim isnever bother yourself if you can help it and now let us move on a little faster v lord courland continues undecided while tom and his fair friends were pursuing their course chetwynd and the two young ladies were quitting the gay scene as they made their way through the throng they encountered lord courland and scrope danvers who had been watching them from afar and had both come to the conclusion that the two prettiest girls to be seen in the park on that morning were miss barfleur and miss calverley lord courland did not know which he admired most at one moment he thought emmeline the prettiest but the next he gave the preference to mildred your cousin miss barfleur is certainly a most charming girl scrope he said but you prefer miss calverley supplied the other no i dont say that rejoined lord courland but miss calverley has lovely features and an enthralling expressionat least i find it so i see you are half in love with her already my lord said scrope rather disappointed i quite admit that miss calverley is very beautiful but dont forget that my cousin emmeline is a great heiress i am only indulging in a little sentiment my dear boy said lord courland either of those girls must be admired for herself alone your fair cousin needs no large fortune to enhance her attractionsneither does miss calverley looking at them as equally well endowed in this respect i should be puzzled to choose even if choice were allowed me but when to almost matchless beauty miss barfleur adds the possession of great wealth there can be no hesitation there i entirely concur with your lordships opinion said scrope and had not my uncle sir leycester been a very crotchety fellow she would have been married long ago even your lordship would have found some difficulty with him i dare say he replied but who is that with them miss calverleys brother chetwynd i thought so he is uncommonly handsome he has been very wild and extravagant but i believe has taken to better ways i dont know him myself but my brother charles who has seen a good deal of him gives a very favourable account of him and says he is an excellent fellow bytheby charles has been very much in love with miss calverley but i believe all that is at an end and chetwynd calverley is not a suitor to miss barfleur asked lord courland that would never be heard of for a moment rejoined scrope he has run through all his property and as far as i can understand is entirely dependent upon his stepmother he may desire to repair his fallen fortunes he wont repair them by a marriage with miss barfleur said scrope in a decided tone but see they are evidently going away shall we join them by all means replied lord courland so they went up to them as previously mentioned and the two gentlemen having been introduced to chetwynd with whom they were much pleased the whole party walked on to albert gate where lord courland and scrope took leave the others proceeding to belgrave square lady thicknesse had always been noted for her dinners and she still maintained her reputation she had a good french cook and an excellent butler as we know her chef monsieur zephyrus had been a pupil of the renowned olivier givors of orleans and did credit to his master on this occasion zephyrus sent up a charming little repast that pleased all who partook of it a small round table sufficed for the party which only numbered seven among the guests was sir bridgnorth who was asked at a very late hour but he stood upon no ceremony and was delighted to meet the two girls again it was quite impossible to say whether lord courland intended to devote himself to emmeline or mildred as a matter of course he took down lady thicknesse to dinner and sat between her ladyship and emmeline but he managed to talk a great deal to mildred who was placed opposite him and had the girls been rivals neither of them could have boasted of a triumph next to mildred was sir bridgnorth and emmeline was separated from chetwynd by scrope danvers who sat on her left and prevented all conversation between them chetwynds deportment was very quiet during dinner and he said little but in the evening he talked a great deal to lady thicknesse and pleased her so much that she gave him a general invitation to the housea point he was very desirous to gain vi lady thicknesse has a conference with scrope nearly a week passed much in the same way the young ladies walked out in the morning with chetwynd drove out in the afternoon with lady thicknesse and dined at eight with nearly the same party and on an equally good dinner very little progress however seemed to be made with the important affair lady thicknesse had in hand her ladyship began to get tired and had a private conference with her nephew scrope but he could not help her i cannot make out whether or not lord courland has spoken to emmeline she observed if he has she has said nothing to me nor has his lordship said anything to me rejoined scrope though i have given him several pretty strong hints the affair must take its course we shall spoil all by precipitation i sometimes think emmeline has a secret attachment observed lady thicknesse after a short pause if my conjecture be right it must be for chetwynd calverley impossible my dear aunt exclaimed scrope no its not impossible said lady thicknesse chetwynd is an exceedingly fine young gentleman and calculated to inspire an attachment i have half resolved to question her better write to lady barfleur i think i have written to my sister and very cautiously but as yet i have received no answer to my letter well then wait till you do before taking any steps things are going on very smoothly but very slowlytoo slowly for me that cant be helped you must control your impatience dear aunt i didnt count on this delay i expected the matter would be concluded in a week i think i shall consult sir bridgnorth charlton if any one is in young calverleys secrets he is but he wont betray them he may give me some advice his advice will be exactly the same as mine he will recommend you to keep quiet i really dont see any occasion for alarm things appear to me to be going on very wellif you could only think so courland wont be driven mildred calverley is decidedly in the way pm very sorry i invited her perhaps it was a mistake however she cant be got rid of now and pm not sure emmeline would have come without her a slight pause ensued after which lady thicknesse saidbytheby your brother charles is coming to town ive just got a letter from him i think i shall ask him to stay with me for a week is he really going to marry mrs calverley he says nothing about her i believe the match is broken off she wants to keep all her property to herself had she behaved generously as she ought to have done and settled a handsome sum on charley it would have been a famous thing for him no doubt but it never does to be dependent upon an imperious woman like mrs calverley so he is quite right in my opinion to beat a retreat while there is yet time lady thicknesse seemed to take a different view of the matter pm sorry he has thrown away such a chance she remarked has she a large income four or five thousand a year charley tells me old calverley was very rich as you must be aware and she has got all his money not all surely chetwynd and mildred must have some of it both are dependent upon her chetwynd has had a very bitter quarrel with her and has only just made it up i think he acted very wisely since he is completely in her power what a singular position she is placed in old calverley must have been in his dotage to give it her she is still young and handsome not many years older than mildred and quite as goodlooking i saw her at sir leycesters funeral and was charmed with her no doubt she is very fascinating you excite my curiosity i should like to see her i dare say you will have the opportunity but you wont see her as mrs charles danvers why not they may still come to an understanding well if you can bring them together again and prevail upon her to make a handsome settlement on charley you will do a great thing remarked scrope with a laugh i will consider what can be done replied lady thicknesse meantime i will write and ask charles to come and stay with me thus ended their conference vii the visit to mrs hartleys rose hartley made a charming ladys maid she was so pretty dressed so neatly had such nice manners and was so cheerful goodnatured and obliging that the two young ladies were enchanted with her they had a dressingroom in common and nothing pleased them better than a chat with the lively little damsel while she dressed their hair or assisted in making their toilettes while thus employed rose appeared to the greatest advantage and the pretty soubrette whose figure rivalled those of her mistresses in her neat morning dress and the two lovely girls in their very becoming dishabille formed a picture of grace and beauty brought together in this way it was quite natural that she should relate her little story to them they had listened to it with much interest and expressed the greatest indignation at the annoyance she had experienced but advised her not to trouble herself as they felt sure her persecutor would not dare to annoy her now one morning however she showed them a letter she had just received and evidently from the same source in it the writer said he had just discovered her abode and would pay her a visit ere long they were inclined to laugh at it and treat it with contempt but as she seemed uneasy they advised her to consult mr higgins the butler who had been very kind to her and treated her like a daughter higgins recommended her not to go out unattended for a few days as she might be annoyed but added if the gentleman ventured to call at the house he would have reason to repent his audacity when the young ladies heard what the butler said they thought he was quite right but emmeline added you shant be kept indoors by this impudent varlet who deserves to be horsewhipped lady thicknesse says we can have the carriage whenever we please well take it out this morning and you shall go with us delighted beyond measure hose essayed to express her thanks well pay your mother a visit pursued emmeline we want to see her but i should have liked to give her some notice of your kind intentions said rose rather embarrassed no that would defeat our object said mildred we wish to take her by surprise rose had nothing more to say so the carriage was ordered at once all three got into it and were driven to the esplanade near lambeth bridge where they alighted and walked towards spencers rents emmeline would not allow the footman to accompany them great was mrs hartleys confusion at this unexpected visit she was busy in the kitchen at the time and when rose rushed in to tell her miss barfleur and miss calverley were at the house she uttered a cry of astonishment and blamed her daughter for not letting her know beforehand dont scold her mrs hartley cried emmeline who heard all that was passing we wouldnt allow her to prepare you for our visit we wanted to see you just as you are dear me its very kind of you miss cried the good dame not venturing to show herself be pleased to step into the parlour and ill come to you as soon as ive put myself a little to rights rose will show you the way smiling as they went into the little room which they thought very tidy and well furnished the young ladies sat down and sent rose to her mother who presently came in and made many apologies for keeping them waiting both were very much pleased by her appearance and after she had been presented to each of them in turn she said to mildred and so youre mr chetwynds sister miss well i dont see any great resemblance i never was considered very much like my brother observed mildred smiling ah you might be proud of resembling him miss for hes a very fine young gentleman dont you agree with me miss she added turning to emmeline yes he is generally considered very goodlooking replied the young lady slightly blushinga circumstance that mrs hartley did not fail to remark whoever gets mr chetwynd for a husband will do well she said of that im certain and she would have launched still more strongly into his praises had not rose checked her im very glad to have an opportunity of thanking you for your great kindness to my brother dear mrs hartley observed mildred he always speaks of you with gratitude and says you were quite like a mother to him i felt like one she replied it touched my heart to see him but heaven be thanked all thats gone by and i trust hes happy as he deserves to be nothing would please me better than to hear that he has found some charming young lady to all in good time mrs hartley interrupted mildred you shall be let into the secret i promise you as soon as there is one to communicate mrs hartley looked as if she thought that would be very soon but she didnt venture to give utterance to her sentiments and now let us speak about your daughter mrs hartley said emmeline we came to talk of her she will tell you i think that she is happy in her new place i ought to be said rose since every kindness is shown me but she sighed as the words were uttered ah you cant help thinking of harry netterville i suppose observed her mother he doesnt deserve your love these dear young ladies shall hear my opinion of him not unless its favourable said emmeline well ive nothing to say against him except that i dont want to have the engagement renewed replied mrs hartley why not asked both young ladies eagerly because i dont think it would be for my daughters advantage im afraid she will never be satisfied without him said mildred if i thought so i wouldnt oppose it rejoined the good dame then take the assurance from us said both young ladies earnestly after that i have nothing to say observed mrs hartley rose must decide for herself oh thank you dearest mother exclaimed her daughter kissing her i should then say that if her speech was here interrupted by a knock at the door good gracious i hope nobody is calling said mrs hartley dont mind us cried the young ladies you had better not let anybody in mother whispered rose as mrs hartley went out she closed the parlour door after her but some conversation could be heard going on in the passage familiar tones reached roses ears and she said to the young ladies i do believe it is harry netterville himself how strange if it should be cried mildred next moment mrs hartley returned her countenance wearing a very singular expression who do you think has just come in she said to her daughter i know very wellharry netterville replied rose yes he knows you are here what shall i say to him for you before answering rose looked at the young ladies as much as to ask what do you advise see him by all means observed emmeline alone no here bring him in my dear mother said rose no culprit ever presented a more abject appearance than did harry netterville as he entered the room with mrs hartley he seemed thoroughly ashamed of himself and could hardly look at the young ladies may i ask what has brought you here this morning mr netterville inquired rose i didnt expect to find you dearest rose he replied in a penitential tone that touched all the listeners except the one it was meant to move i came to see your mother why do you address me as dearest rose said the young damsel rather severely you are still dear to me and must ever remain so he replied i confess i have behaved very badly well the poor fellow cant say more said emmeline moved by his looks and manner i hope you will forgive him do added mildred netterville awaited his sentence with anxiety but rose did not seem inclined to pardon him at once you have acted so unreasonably that i cannot forgive you till you have made some amends she said i am ready to do anything you may enjoin he replied you shall deliver me from the annoyance to which i have been subjected and which has caused our disagreement she replied you shall find out the writer of that anonymous letter to yourself and who has likewise written other infamous letters to me and punish himpunish him as he deserves when you have done this i will forgive you but not till then we quite approve of your decision rose said mildred and till mr netterville has done this he doesnt deserve your regard he ought not to hesitate i dont hesitate he replied energetically thats right said rose i begin to like you again here is the last letter i have received read it she added tossing it to him after scanning its contents netterville turned pale and this has just reached you he asked with quivering lips yesterday she replied the writer must be discovered he said viii how harry netterville found romney when the carriage came from belgrave square those within it were not aware that it was followed by a hansom cab from which a person having the appearance of a gentleman alighted near vauxhall pier and addressing the footman said in a very civil tone calculated to obtain a response pray is this lady thicknesses carriage it is sir replied the man touching his hat is her ladyship with it pursued the inquirer no sir we only brought the two young ladies here are they gone to the palace i dont think so sir they have got the ladysmaid with them then i know where they are thank you very much and he walked off in the direction of spencers rents as the individual we have mentioned who was by no means badlooking walked on he considered within himself what course he should take and being utterly unscrupulous he determined to go to the house and see rose whatever might be the consequences just as he arrived at the corner of spencers rents he encountered harry netterville whom he knew by sight and accosted him without hesitation can you tell me which is mrs hartleys house he asked netterville had no idea who stood before him but he was surprised at the inquiry and rejoined rather sharply pray what business have you with mrs hartley i might decline to give an explanation to an inquiry put in such terms said the other but i have no objection to tell you that i wish to speak to her about her daughter her daughter exclaimed netterville starting back and assuming an angry look perhaps you are the very person of whom i am in quest have you recently addressed a letter to miss hartley have you written to me i have written no letters at all replied the stranger my object is to warn mrs hartley against a certain individual who is he demanded the attorneys clerk eagerly a very designing individual named henry netterville replied the stranger so astounded was netterville that for a moment he could hardly reply at length he said what have you to allege against the person whose name you have mentioned much but it is for mrs hartleys ear i am not likely to communicate to one unknown to me then learn sir to your confusion that i am henry netterville indeed exclaimed the other i shall not retract a word i have said i shall convince mrs hartley that she ought to get rid of you for what reason demanded netterville show cause why i propose to do so but since you force me to speak i will say you are acting a most dishonourable part you profess love for rose when you are making love to another you offer her your hand when you are already engaged i engaged exclaimed netterville this is news to me to whom am i engaged pray to miss clotilde tripp if i am rightly informed replied the accuser if not to her to miss flora sicklemore you must be confounding me with tom tankard said netterville i never paid the young ladies in question the slightest attention and now allow me to ask a question who are you sir who interest yourself so much in my concerns and of whom i know nothing i am not aware that i ever saw you before but though you pretend ignorance i strongly suspect that you know me very well i believe you are the person who have been annoying rose i think you wrote the lying epistle to me and the unmanly letters to her you imposed upon me for a time but i have now found you out accident has delivered you into my hands and i dont mean to part with you rose is at home at this moment come with me and apologise to her or ill break every bone in your body i will do nothing of the sort replied romney for it was he well see that cried netterville and springing upon him suddenly he caught him by the collar and dragged him towards the house which was not very far off finding his struggles ineffectual romney submitted for he did not care to call out for assistance as that would have led to an exposure which he desired to avoid it chanced at this precise moment that the door of mrs hartleys house opened and the two young ladies came forth attended by rose but the spectacle that greeted their eyes sent them instantly back for they guessed what had occurred another ineffectual struggle took place at the door but romney was dragged in by netterville and forced into the parlour whither the ladies had retreated with rose and her mother beg pardon ladies said netterville still keeping fast hold of his captive i hope youll excuse the intrusion oh never mind us they rejoined we are glad you have caught the wretch is this the scoundrel who has annoyed you rose said netterville it is she replied then down on your knees and ask her forgiveness said netterville to his prisoner and he forced him to this humiliating posture i have done nothing to call for this usage said romney you deserve a horsewhip cried mrs hartley and if my husband were here youd have it dare you say to my face that you have not several times annoyed me in the street asked rose do you deny writing those shameful letters to me i should not have written them if you had not given me encouragement he rejoined it is false cried rose i have never given you any encouragement i detest you we do not believe a word he says rose cried mildred in accents of scorn and indignation let him go mr netterville the presence of such a creature is disagreeable to us begone cried netterville releasing him in obedience to the injunction begone i say doubleconvicted liar and coward and as romney departed he kicked him through the open door into the street the crestfallen blackleg stood for a moment before the house as if about to return but he had not the courage to face netterville and sneaked off i think you have now got rid of him rose said netterville as he returned to the parlour yes he wont trouble her again im sure cried emmeline you have served him quite right you are a brave fellow harry cried rose taking his hand and gazing at him proudly and affectionately and a lucky fellow as well he replied if this stupid scoundrel had not thrown himself in my way i should not have caught him so quickly ix captain danvers arrives in belgrave square two days after the incident just related the party at lady thicknesses house in belgrave square was increased by the arrival of her nephew captain danvers whom she had invited to spend a week with her by this time mildreds resentment had in some degree abated though she still treated him with coldness but the captain looked so unhappy that her heart was touched with compassion and she soon showed a disposition to relent one morning on coming down to breakfast he found her and emmeline in the diningroom and the latter perceiving she was rather in the way goodnaturedly left them together the captain immediately took advantage of the opportunity mildred he said in his softest tone will you allow me to offer an explanation i do not want any explanation captain danvers she replied i have ceased to take any interest in you i hope not he replied i trust i may be able to exculpate myself you will find that rather difficult she said yet hear me i implore you he entreated in such moving accents that she could not refuse first let me inquire whether mrs calverley has sent you any special information he said i have not heard from her for nearly a week she replied indeed i have not written to her then you are not aware that all is at an end between us your brother scrope told me that the engagement was broken off did he tell you it was broken off by me he did she replied colouring slightly mildred i could not have married her for a short space she seemed to cast a spell over me but i soon recovered from it and found that you alone are mistress of my heart and that i could not live without you but i had lost youi had forfeited your regard and could never hope to regain it you judged correctly said mildred but her looks rather belied her words though justly punished i was resolved not to unite myself to a woman i cannot love and who i believe is equally indifferent to me a pretext for breaking off the engagement was easily foundnay presented itself certain she would refuse i required a handsome settlement to be made upon me her answer as i anticipated set me free and now dearest mildred he added venturing to take her hand which she did not withdraw you have heard my explanation can you forgive me you do not deserve forgiveness she replied in a voice that showed she relented i know it he said raising her hand to his lips but i feel that i am forgiven further discourse was interrupted by the entrance of lady thicknesse and emmeline both of whom had witnessed the tender incident just described and understood that a reconciliation had taken place but neither made a remark ive an agreeable surprise for you said lady thicknesse who do you think is coming to me tomorrow youll never guess so i may as well tell youmrs calverley exclamations of surprise rose from all but no one seemed particularly pleased i was not aware you knew her aunt remarked captain danvers who did not care to conceal his vexation i have never seen her replied lady thicknesse but i wrote to say i should be delighted to make her acquaintance and hoped she might be induced to spend a week with me while mildred and emmeline are in town she has just answered that she accepts my invitation with the greatest pleasure and i may expect her tomorrow she will make a delightful addition to our little party i am not so sure of that muttered captain danvers what put it into your head to ask her dear aunt said emmeline a conversation i had with scrope he extolled her so much that i longed to see her i wish he had held his tongue mentally ejaculated the captain just then higgins and a footman brought in breakfast and an end was put to the conversation later on when she had an opportunity of saying a word to lady thicknesse privately emmeline observed i think aunt youll regret asking mrs calverley though very handsome very clever and very agreeable shes extremely mischievous everybody has been trying to get out of her way and now we shall have her in our midst again i shall be very much surprised if she doesnt cause some unpleasantness dont be afraid of that my dear said lady thicknesse laughing i expect shell be very useful useful in what way aunt i cant explain but such is my opinion i advise you to take care of her aunt depend upon it shes a very designing woman x mrs calverley makes an important conquest next day mrs calverley arrived in plenty of time for dinner she looked extremely well and produced a most favourable impression upon lady thicknesse who thought her one of the handsomest and best bred woman she had ever seen and would not believe a word that had been said against her the meeting with mildred was not very cordial but mrs calverley who was a most accomplished actress contrived to make it appear that there was no want of affection on her part and completely imposed upon lady thicknesse with emmeline it was the same thing whatever feelings she secretly entertained for that young lady she professed the greatest regard for her nor did she exhibit any coldness or resentment towards captain danvers of whose conduct she had just reason to complain no one could have guessed that they had recently quarrelled in short lady thicknesse could see nothing in her but what was charming and congratulated herself upon having invited her a splendid chamber was assigned her with an adjoining room for her ladysmaid laura as usual there was a small dinnerparty on that day consisting of lord courland sir bridgnorth charlton scrope captain danvers and chetwynd mrs calverley had a little talk with chetwynd in the drawingroom and they appeared on the most friendly terms but their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of lord courland who was presented to the beautiful widow and claimed her attention evidently the young lord was very much struck with her and seeing the effect she had produced she exerted herself to the utmost and before the end of the evening had completely enthralled her new admirer to scrope who knew his friend well it seemed almost certain mrs calverley would eclipse emmeline hitherto as we have shown lord courland had divided his attentions between the two girls but on this occasion he was engrossed by the fascinating widow and had eyes for no one else sir bridgnorth came to the same conclusion as scrope and as he had taken mrs calverley down to dinner and found himself rather de trop he was able to judge even lady thicknesse began to see the error she had committed in introducing so dangerous a rival mrs calverley was far more to be feared than mildred and might carry off the prize however the beautiful widow acted with great discretion apparently she attached no importance to the conquest she had made when rallied on the subject next morning by lady thicknesse she owned that she had flirted a little with lord courland but had not for a moment regarded his attentions seriously i am glad to hear you say so replied her ladyship had it been otherwise you would have run counter to a plan of mine to tell you the truth i rather wish to bring about a match between his lordship and emmeline nothing could be better said mrs calverley i wouldnt interfere with it for the world but i fear there is a little difficulty that you may not be aware of i suspect emmeline has an attachment the same notion has occurred to me but i have never questioned her and she has said nothing to me to whom do you suppose she is attachedto chetwynd no it is only surmise on my part but still i think i am right if she wont accept lord courland it will be monstrously provoking after all my trouble he has met her every day for nearly a fortnight and the affair has not advanced a single step she seems to like his society but nothing more and he appears just as much pleased with mildred as he is with her have you tried to bring him to the point have you spoken to him no my nephew scrope danvers is strangely averse to such a course he is wrong pardon me if i say you ought to come to an immediate understanding but scrope advises me to proceed very cautiously there may be excess of caution as well as too little something must be done i will speak to his lordship if you like i shall feel immensely obliged if you will i should like to place the affair in your hands i am confident you will manage it better than i can i shall be able to put questions to him that your ladyship could not is he coming here today may i ask i am not quite sure but he will dine here tomorrow xi lady thicknesse consults sir bridgnorth lord courland did not call on that morning but scrope did and had a private conference with lady thicknesse in her boudoir he looked very grave as he addressed her your matrimonial scheme is at an end my dear aunt he said courland has fallen desperately in love with mrs calverley her ladyship uttered a cry of astonishment he declares she is the most charming woman he ever met i feel certain he will propose to her now what is to be done it seems embarrassing certainly but you need have no uneasiness i have just been talking to her he wont be accepted dont delude yourself my dear aunt he cried mrs calverley would like very much to be lady courland i feel quite sure she may tell you otherwise but it is so she is an ambitious woman what is to be done exclaimed lady thicknesse in consternation we must gain time i have prevented him from calling here today how did you manage that by telling him i wanted to ask charles a few questions meantime you must speak to emmeline but i very much fear she wont mind me said lady thicknesse ill get sir bridgnorth to do it hes the very man for the purpose and fortunately hes in the house i left him just now with the ladies then beg him to come to me said lady thicknesse scrope needed no second bidding but immediately quitted the boudoir and reappeared a few minutes afterwards with the goodnatured baronet i wont interrupt the ttette which her ladyship wishes to have with you sir bridgnorth said scrope as he left them together pray be seated sir bridgnorth said lady thicknesse i want your advice and assistance both are at your ladyships service he replied i expected nothing less from you you are a real friend it is a very delicate matter on which i desire to consult you and she paused does it relate to a matrimonial alliance between lord courland and your niece miss barfleur you have guessed right replied lady thicknesse you can assist me most materially in the affair if you will emmeline i know has a very great regard i may almost say affection for you and might possibly speak more freely to you than she would to me will you ascertain what her sentiments are respecting lord courland i can give your ladyship the information you desire at once replied sir bridgnorth and shall really be glad to do so indeed i have thought of speaking to you on the subject but feared you might deem me impertinent any expectations your ladyship may have formed of such an alliance must be dismissed it will never take place you think so sir bridgnorth said her ladyship looking dreadfully chagrined i am quite sure of it he replied miss barfleur will never accept him you would not make this assertion so positively without good reason i am certain sir bridgnorth said lady thicknesse i had the declaration from miss barfleurs own lips he replied and was requested to repeat it to your ladyship i am also permitted to mention a circumstance that will prevent any discussion on the subject you are not about to tell me she is engaged i hope sir bridgnorth said her ladyship manifesting fresh alarm such is the fact he replied quietly it is desirable you should know the truth it is proper i should know the whole truth sir bridgnorth she rejoined to whom is my niece engaged speak frankly to chetwynd calverley he replied without hesitation lady thicknesse did not seem much surprised for she expected the answer but she said in a haughty decided tone that union can never take place a slight smile played on sir bridgnorths kindly countenance i do not see how it can be prevented he said she is an heiress and lady barfleurs consent has been obtained lady thicknesse looked thunderstruck and remained silent for a few moments and then said why have i been kept in ignorance of this engagement i suppose emmeline felt i should disapprove of it as i do most decidedly i certainly think the matter ought to have been communicated to your ladyship said sir bridgnorth but since the marriage in all probability will not take place for some time i suppose it was not deemed necessary to mention it at present that explanation does not satisfy me sir bridgnorth i feel highly offended i suppose mrs calverley has been in the dark as well as myself she has replied sir bridgnorth and in her case i think the caution was judicious she is not to be trusted with any secrets but her own and those she can keep i shouldnt wonder if she wins the prize that has been offered to miss barfleur it seems likely said her ladyship there is one consolatory circumstance in this disagreeable affair the marriage will not take place for some time i trust it may be indefinitely postponed thinking the interview had lasted long sir bridgnorth arose but her ladyship would not let him depart thus and said pray come and dine with me as usual i shall expect you at eight by that time i hope i shall have got over my vexation dont imagine i shall make a scene i never do make scenes i shall say nothing to emmeline till tomorrow au revoir and she extended her hand to him as sir bridgnorth took the delicately white fingers he felt inclined to raise them to his lips but he didnt and withdrew xii another explanation meanwhile another explanation took place in the drawingroom between mrs calverley and emmeline they were standing close beside a window looking upon a square and sufficiently removed from a central table near which were seated captain danvers with chetwynd and his sister i have brought you here my love to have a few words with you commenced mrs calverley i am commissioned by lady thicknesse to ask a question which she doesnt like to ask herself if you havent already discovered it i must tell you she has set her heart upon marrying you to lord courland i am very much obliged to her said emmeline but i suppose my consent will be first obtained that is the very point upon which i have undertaken to consult you said mrs calverley should his lordship propose are you inclined to accept him he is not likely to propose to me replied emmeline i may congratulate you on the conquest you have made i am quite as indifferent to his lordship as you appear to be my love rejoined mrs calverley i shouldnt have supposed so laughed emmeline but of course i take your word for it pray tell my aunt i am sorry to disappoint her but she has made a wrong choice for me may i add anything more may i assign a motive for your conduct may i tell her you are already engaged tell her whatever you please dear mrs calverley but make her clearly understand that no persuasion shall ever induce me to marry lord courland i surrender him entirely to you never mind me but do tell me who is the highlyfavoured individual you have chosen can you not guess there is but one person i could choose and he is not very far off chetwynd cried mrs calverley yes and you have accepted him again the answer was in the affirmative he is indeed most fortunate exclaimed mrs calverley one question more and i have done i know what you would ask replied emmeline mamma has given her consent but the marriage will not take place for some months oh how delighted i am cried mrs calverley with difficulty refraining from embracing her at this juncture chetwynd arose he had been watching them and guessed what they were talking about as he approached mrs calverley sprang forward to meet him chetwynd she said i have just received some information that has given me the greatest pleasure i think i ought to have been let into the secret but i am too much overjoyed to complain i am glad the disclosure has been made he said the maintenance of the secret has placed emmeline in a false position but no harm has ensued observed the young lady i have only just discovered my aunts scheme or i should have acquainted her with the engagement i now regret that i did not do so when i first came to town and i am at liberty to explain all to lady thicknesse inquired mrs calverley you will greatly oblige me said emmeline i shall be very glad to escape the task i will go to her at once said mrs calverley and quitting the room she repaired to the boudoir there she found that sir bridgnorth had been beforehand with her and explanations being unnecessary she talked the matter over quietly with lady thicknesse and endeavoured to reconcile her to the arrangement apparently with some success mrs calverley had quitted the boudoir rather more than half an hour and lady thicknesse was alone and lamenting the failure of her scheme when scrope again made his appearance his countenance had a singular expression and he remained standing while he said in rather a stern voice dont give yourself any concern about emmelines imprudent engagement with chetwynd calverley aunt i have just learnt something that will enable me to put an end to it you dont say so what is it exclaimed lady thicknesse in surprise i cannot explain now he rejoined wait till tomorrow but finding her ladyship could not repress her curiosity and determined not to gratify it he abruptly quitted the boudoir leaving her in a high state of excitement xiii a soiree dansante a party was to be given that evening at the house in belgrave square but below stairs not above exceedingly indulgent to her servants lady friends and he had invited the tankards to whom he owed a return and several others of our acquaintancenamely mrs tripp and the charming clotilde mrs sicklemore and the fair flora mr and mrs hartley harry netterville pledger dapp and larkinsto a soire dansante of course the servants of the house were included and they mustered very strongfootman coachman page housekeeper ladysmaid housemaids and kitchen maid nor must we omit to mention rose and mrs calverleys ladysmaid laura who had some pretension to good looks most important however of all was the french cook monsieur zephyrus who next to mr higgins himself was the principal person in the establishment a very smart young man was zephyrus when not compelled by the duties of his vocation to disguise himself in a white apron white veste and white bonnetdenuit he now wore an evening dress made by a fashionable tailor in the boulevard italien the peculiar cut of which proclaimed its french origin and as he had a light figure he looked very well in it zephyrus was not badlooking and had a dark complexion black eyes and large black whiskers of which he was not a little vain when in full dress as on the present occasion he wore a lorgnon stuck in his right eye on the previous day he had paid a visit to his friend sigebert smart whom he had known in paris and invited him and madame smart to the party both accepted the invitation with delight in addition to a piano brought from upstairs and on which mrs tripp had kindly consented to perform a violin violoncello and cornet had been provided by mr higgins nothing indeed was neglected the large housekeepers room in which dancing was to take place was brilliantly lighted up and decorated and supper prepared by monsieur zephyrus himself was to be served in the salle manger nothing was seen of the kitchen not till ten oclock when dinner and all other matters upstairs had been disposed of did the company begin to assemble of course they were obliged to descend the area steps but the passage once gained and the doors thrown open they were surprised by the splendour of the scene they were received by mr higgins who was supported by monsieur zephyrus first to arrive were the tankards tom was very much struck by the appearance of zephyrus and wondered who he was never supposing him to be a cook his father told him he was a cordon bleu but that did not enlighten him and the marked attentions paid by the gallant frenchman to madame sigebert smart when she arrived with her husband puzzled him still more he could not understand how such a distinguishedlooking personage could be on intimate terms with a coiffeur and his wife as soon as he got an opportunity he said to sigebert whos that very polite french gent talking to madame monsieur zephyrus replied the coiffeur dont you know him i dont recollect seeing him before remarked tom the guvnor says hes a cordon bleu what does that mean scarcely able to refrain from laughing sigebert replied it means that hes a knight of the saint esprit the order was given him by louis napoleon chevalier zephyrus is entitled to wear a broad blue ribbon with a cross attached to it but he doesnt put it on now he seems a very condescending sort of fellow for a chevalier said tom no nonsensical pride about him none whatever replied sigebert youll find him very affable but dont talk to him about cookery he dislikes that subject ill take care to avoid it said tom by this time the whole party having assembledguests and inmates of the housemrs tripp was conducted to the piano by higgins and the musicians began to strike up then it was that zephyrus who acted as master of the ceremonies clapped his wellgloved hands and exclaimed messieurs un quadrilleprenez vos dames that means were to take our partners for a quadrille mamzelle said tom stepping up to clotilde shall i have the honour too late mr tom she replied coquettishly already engaged to monsieur zephyrus ah the chevalier knows how to take care of himself i perceive cried tom yes youd better look quick and secure flora or shell be snapped up said clotilde acting on the advice tom hurried off but would have been too late if the thoughtful young lady had not reserved herself for him all the cavaliers seemed choosing partners but the master of the ceremonies would only allow four couples in the first quadrille these were himself and clotilde tom tankard and flora harry netterville and rose and sigebert and laura will you be our visavis monsieur grandpot he said to tom with the greatest pleasure chevalier replied our young friend but my names not grandpot im mr tom tankard mille pardons exclaimed zephyrus but we call a tankard a grand pot dargent be pleased to take your place monsieur tom the quadrille then commenced monsieur zephyrus danced with wonderful spirit and lightness cutting cross capers forward capers side capers back capersnow executing the boree step the courant step and the gaillard stephopping jumping bounding and ending with a pirouette that astonished all the beholders tom tankard tried to imitate him but the performance was a mere caricature and though it excited laughter must be pronounced a failure sigebert was more successful he had figured at the grand chaumire at paris and treated the company to some of the fantastic steps he had seen performed there and at other salles de danse in the bois de boulogne though very much amused by what he beheld harry netterville did not indulge in any of these absurdities both flora and clotilde danced very well as they had had some practice at cremorne but rose was very quiet a rigadoon followed which again enabled monsieur zephyrus to display his grace and skill then a valse in which flora fell to the share of the frenchman and clotilde to sigebert tom was obliged to content himself with madame sigebert for rose declined to dance with him when the valse was over a country dance was called for by mr higgins who wished to dance with mrs tankard and led off with her almost everybody joined in this lively dance which was carried on with the greatest spirit and amid much laughter for more than half an hour the elderly people seemed to enjoy it as much as the young folks but mr higgins and mrs tankard could not go down a second time monsieur zephyrus who was evidently quite captivated by clotilde induced her to dance with him to the great disgust of tom who began to feel a little jealous of the gay frenchman however flora contrived to console him harry netterville and rose thoroughly enjoyed the merry country dance and did not feel in the least fatigued by their exertions the company then proceeded to supper where we have already explained the menservants of the house who were intended to wait went in first mr higgins gave his arm to mrs tankard and was followed by mr tankard and mrs tripp mr larkins and mrs hartley with the rest of the party a very elegant supper greeted themquite a triumph of skill on the part of monsieur zephyrus who had done his best iced champagne and moselle cup were to be had in plenty tom tankard was in raptures by jove he cried i never saw a nicer supper lady thicknesse must have a capital cook monsieur zeyhyrus who chanced to be near him smiled enchanted to find you are pleased with my performance monsieur tom he saidyour performance chevalier cried tom you dont mean to say you prepared the supper mais oui mon cher said zephyrus proudly i and no one else dont you know i am lady thicknesses cook give you my word i wasnt aware of it till this moment cried tom i was told you are a cordon bleu and so i am said zephyrus but dont you understand that a cordon bleu means a firstrate cookthats my description for a few moments tom seemed lost in astonishment he then exclaimed the guvnors completely taken me in the company did not seem inclined to leave the supper table and no wonder considering the excellence of the repast and the abundant supply of champagne but mr higgins who was very careful thought they had sat long enough and moved off to the ballroom where the music again struck up and dancing recommenced with even more spirit than before the only person who looked discontented was tom tankard he had drunk a good deal of champagne and it had got into his head and made him rather quarrelsome he felt jealous and angry at the evident preference shown by clotilde for monsieur zephyrus they were again engaged in a polka ordinarily tom was very fond of a polka but on this occasion he refused to join in the dance but stood on one side and noticed the passionate glances bestowed by the frenchman on the inconstant charmer his breast swelled but he was obliged to devour his rage when the polka ceased several couples proceeded to the supperroom for a glass of champagne and amongst them were zephyrus and clotilde in a minute or two the others came back but the frenchman and the fair syren did not appear maddened by jealousy tom went in search of them as he approached the supperroom the door of which was partly open he perceived at a glance that they were alone together and that zephyrus who was seated beside her was still pouring forth tender speeches in her ear but they were too much engrossed by each other to notice him his first impulse was to rush in upon them but hearing his own name pronounced he stood still i hope you dont care for that grand nigaud tom tankard said zephyrus indeed it is hardly possible you canhe is so frightfully ugly besides being ridiculous and stupid but i believe he flatters himself you are in love with him he certainly pays me a great deal of attention replied clotilde but if he fancies i am in love with him he is very much mistaken in fact to confess the truth i am becoming rather tired of him that gives me hopes said zephyrus i shall try and please you better you please me very much said clotilde you dance charminglymuch better than tom he cannot dance at all said zephyrus contemptuously but dancing is the least of my accomplishments i am a skilful musician i ride well drive well shoot well and cook well added clotilde the supper you have given us was perfect ah you shall taste a wedding breakfast but not prepared for that odious tom tankard for whom then inquired clotilde before an answer could be returned tom rushed into the room and quite frightened clotilde by his looks so you are getting tired of me are you he cried to the fickle girl how long have you been tired only this very morning you said you liked me better than any one else but this french cook has made you change your mind he may have you and welcome ive done with you for ever you dont mean it dear tom she cried penitentially yes i do he rejoined and im glad ive found you out in time but i cant say much for your choice he added casting a glance of scorn at his rival what have you to say against me saar cried zephyrus with a fierce gesticulation and shaking his clenched hand at tom you wont frighten me monsieur observed tom quietly consider yourself thrashed but i wont cried zephyrus i never was thrashed and never will be yes you will cried tom and being somewhat of a bruiser he dealt him a smart tap on the nose or somewhere near it that knocked him backwards against the table upsetting a number of glasses with a tremendous crash clotilde ran screaming out of the room diable vous avez poch mon oeil au beurre noir monsieur cried zephyrus as he picked himself up but you shall pay for the affront with your lifes blood dont be afraid monsieur said tom stoutly ill give you satisfaction in any way you like sword pistol or this he added holding up his clenched fist but the duel is no longer allowed in your country said zephyrus then well settle our quarrel in yours rejoined tom ill go over with you to boulogne or dieppe whenever you please while these menaces were exchanged mr higgins mr tankard and several others had entered the room alarmed by the crash of glass and clotildes cries they instantly perceived that a conflict had taken place whats the meaning of this disturbance gentlemen cried mr higgins cant you spend the evening quietly im ashamed of you tom cried mr tankard the quarrel wasnt of my seeking guvnor said the young man but it wont end here cried zephyrus holding a handkerchief to his face i hope it will rejoined higgins tom said his father sternly i insist on your making an apology to monsieur zephyrus i make an apology rejoined the youth dont expect it guvnor nor will i accept an apology said zephyrus i will have his life sigebert he added to the coiffeur who had entered the room with the others you shall be my parrainmy second with great pleasure replied the other if you talk of fighting a duel ill have you both bound over to keep the peace said higgins but come weve had quite enough of this nonsense shake hands like good fellows im quite ready said tom ill either fight or make friends as suits monsieur zephyrus best this was said in such a goodnatured way that it pleased the frenchman and he seemed disposed to make up the quarrel im sorry i hurt you for i dont believe youre half a bad fellow said tom there will that suffice parfaitement replied zephyrus taking the hand offered him bravo cried higgins now let us all have a glass of champagne and then well go back to the ballroom we must have a reel no more dancing for me said tom nonsense cried his father i insist that you dance with clotilde do you consent monsieur said tom with a droll look at zephyrus she now belongs to you you shall have her back altogether if you like replied the frenchman nay i wont tax your generosity so far said tom with a laugh champagne was here handed round and after the brimming glasses had been emptied they all repaired to the ballroom clotilde flew to tom on his appearance and he was foolish enough to forgive her a reel was called in which all the company took part except poor monsieur zephyrus who was obliged to apply a piece of brown paper steeped in brandy to his injured orb xiv an unpleasant inquiry next morning about eleven oclock chetwynd found his way as usual from the grosvenor hotel to the house in belgrave square he had breakfasted very pleasantly with sir bridgnorth charlton who was staying at the same hotel as himself and had not the slightest idea that anything disagreeable awaited him but he was rather struck by higginss manner as he let him in evidently the butler had something to communicate it may be proper to mention that since chetwynds resumption of his own name and appearance in his true character at lady thicknesses no allusion to the past had ever been made by higgins who had always been particularly respectful mr calverley he said as they stood together in the vestibule i must prepare you for an interview with her ladyship and mr scrope danvers they are in the diningroom and i am directed to conduct you thither on your arrival i know nothing but should any questions be asked me you may rely on my discretion i am greatly obliged to you higgins replied chetwynd but you are at liberty to tell all you know respecting me i desire no concealment of course i should be glad to throw a veil over the past if i could but that is impossible no more was said the butler ushered him into the diningroom where he found lady thicknesse and her nephew her ladyship received him with her customary good nature and begged him to be seated but scropes manner was cold and haughty after a few preliminary remarks by lady thicknesse scrope interposed and in a very grave tone said will you allow me to ask you a few questions mr calverley i shall be sorry to give you pain but circumstances compel me to adopt this disagreeable course since the questions you desire to put refer no doubt to a very painful period of my life it might perhaps have been better if you had spoken to me in private rejoined chetwynd but proceed pray understand that it is at my particular request that lady thicknesse is present said scrope we have long been aware that some time ago you were in great difficulties and on bad terms with your father and stepmother but until very lately neither of us knew you had attempted to commit suicide what you have heard is quite true sir replied chetwynd i was driven to desperation by my own folly but i have never ceased to feel deep remorse for the attempt and i daily thank heaven that i was saved from the commission of the sinful act hitherto lady thicknesse had looked down but she now regarded him with an interest she had never felt before these sentiments do you credit sir said scrope but i must now ask what steps you took immediately after the attempt i endeavoured to obtain employment in what way i decline to answer that question sir replied chetwynd as you please sir said scrope i can easily obtain the requisite information and he rang the bell the summons was promptly answered by the butler higgins observed scrope when charles brownlow the former footman was discharged did mr tankard apply for the place he did sir for his son no sir for a young man named walter liddel are you certain that was his real name i cant be quite sure sir replied higgins at any rate it was the name given me by mr tankard did you see the party spoken of oh yes sir i saw him at mr tankards house and was very much pleased with his appearance the livery suited him extremely well oh then he had on the livery yes sir i wished to see how it fitted and it did fit him to admiration i never saw such a finelooking footman in my life and you engaged him at once sir i thought him a great catch did he enter on the situation something prevented him either his father died quite suddenly and left him a large fortune or else he married i dont recollect which be serious if you please higgins have you ever seen him since not that i am aware of sir should you know him again if you saw him i dont think i should sir i only saw him in livery and a handsome livery like ours sets a man off to advantage are these all the questions you propose to ask me sir one more and i have done and i beg you will answer it distinctly do you see him now walter liddel no sir you are a very cautious fellow higgins but it wont do said scrope speak out higgins said chetwynd i have no wish for concealment now i look again remarked the butler to scrope i should say there is a very strong resemblance between walter liddel and mr chetwynd calverley enough cried scrope you may retire higgins bowed and left the room and now said chetwynd may i ask the meaning of this inquiry my object is merely to establish a fact replied scrope lady thicknesse and myself have just learnt to our great surprise and annoyance that our charming relative emmeline barfleur has had the imprudence to form an engagement with you imprudence sir cried chetwynd i might use a stronger term but that will suffice it cannot be very agreeable to those connected with her that the daughter of the proud sir leycester barfleur who might marry any one she pleases should throw herself away upon afootman chetwynd absolutely started but controlled himself by a great effort i now understand your anxiety to secure lady thicknesses presence at our interview he said you have aimed a cowardly blow at me but it has failed in effect i treat your observation with scorn then turning to lady thicknesse he added since your nephew refuses to give me credit for acting like a gentleman i must inform your ladyship that emmeline is acquainted with the ridiculous circumstance of which so much has been made and it merely excited her laughter i have confessed all my follies and faults to heralland she has forgiven me because she believes in my promises of amendment as he spoke the door opened and emmeline herself entered the room accompanied by mildred and sir bridgnorth charlton xv evidence in chetwynds favour i thought i should be required as an important witness in the inquiry which i understood is going on here said emmeline stepping quickly forward so i have come to give my evidence you are too late my love said lady thicknesse the inquiry is over has it ended satisfactorily asked emmeline not to me replied chetwynd your cousin scrope has endeavoured to show that if you had not intentionally been kept in the dark as to certain matters you would not have entered into an engagement which he holds to be utterly unworthy of you nor has he acknowledged his error though every assurance has been given him that he is mistaken will my amiable but incredulous cousin accept my assurance to the same effect observed emmeline he shakes his head and declines to answer he is therefore out of court nevertheless i will tell him and all who choose to listen to me that mr chetwynd calverley has behaved in the most honourable manner and has concealed nothing from me i will also tell my proud cousin and he may make what use he pleases of the information that i have engaged myself to as good a gentleman as himself and that nothing that he or any one else can say will induce me to break my promise thank you from my heart said chetwynd now is your time to speak if you have anything to say observed emmeline to her cousin but scrope shrugged his shoulders and declined the challenge then i will tell you one thing which you dont know and perhaps wont believe when you are told it said emmeline chetwynd himself proposed to go through a period of probation before our engagement took place and he readily agreed that the marriage should be deferred for a year will that content you i should be better pleased if it were postponed altogether muttered scrope let me say a word for my friend chetwynd interposed sir bridgnorth as yet it is somewhat early to declare that he has reformed but i sincerely believe in his professions and i feel persuaded he will carry them out i wont disappoint you sir bridgnorth said chetwynd earnestly i have entire confidence in you rejoined the baronet and so have i said lady thicknesse i am so well satisfied with the explanation that has taken place that i give my full consent to emmelines engagement i am delighted to hear you say so dearest aunt cried the young lady you make me quite happy it would have grieved me to incur your displeasure i dont care a bit about scrope wont you even give me credit for the desire to serve you said scrope no i am displeased by your uncalledfor interference you do more harm than good before deciding against my friend chetwynd scrope said sir bridgnorth you ought to give him a fair trial that is all i desire remarked chetwynd six months hence if i have not proved myself worthy of emmeline i will retire from the field i take you at your word said scrope am i to decide the point no because you have shown yourself unfair and ungenerous said emmeline at this juncture captain danvers entered the room and uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing so many persons present i wondered where you all were he said what important affair have you been discussing a marriage replied lady thicknesse and everybody except scrope is pleased with it said emmeline oh never mind him remarked the captain hell come round to the general opinion dont be too sure of that said scrope ten to one you come round before a month said his brother done rejoined scrope i wish i could bet said emmeline id lay fifty to one that in less than a week scrope will own his mistake and ask my pardon ill back you said sir bridgnorth looking at scrope taken rejoined that person and now let us go upstairs said lady thicknesse not to the drawingroom dear aunt rejoined captain danvers why not there inquired her ladyship surprised because we should interrupt a very tender interview said the captain lord courland and mrs calverley are in the drawingroom dear aunt i should think the affair must be settled by this time observed scrope give them another quarter of an hour said the captain the proposition was unanimously agreed to that morning mrs calverleys ladysmaid laura had delivered to her mistress a little billet doux from lord courland entreating the favour of a private interview the request was granted and through the instrumentality of mr higgins who was consulted by laura it was arranged that the meeting should take place in the drawingroom the obliging butler undertaking that the pair should not be interrupted never had the charming widow looked more beautiful than on that morning as she sat in the drawingroom awaiting lord courlands appearance her breast swelled with triumph and her eyes shone with more than their customary splendour great pains had been taken with her toilette by laura who assured her with a smile that she looked enchanting and added that there was not another person in the house to be compared with her the fair widow believed what was said and might be excused for doing so under the circumstances since she had at once carried off the grand prize from those whom she regarded as competitors lord courland was enraptured when he beheld her he did not throw himself literally at her feet when the discreet higgins who had ushered him into the room had retired but he manifested all the ardour of an impassioned lover he gave utterance to a few expressions of delight as he sat down beside her on the sofa and pressed her hand to his lips but his looks were far more eloquent than his words xvi lord courland proposes to mrs calverley to many a courageous man a proposal is a formidable business but lord courland certainly did not appear to find it so nor was it necessary for the beautiful widow to give him any encouragement need i say i adore you he exclaimed you must be conscious that from the first moment i beheld you i was fascinated by your charms she smiled softly but made no audible response he continued in the same passionate strain let me have a word to say i am not an object of indifference to youthat you requite my love she regarded him more tenderly than before but spoke not he could not misunderstand the look you love me he cried your eyes confess more than your lips are willing to avow you force me to snatch an answer from them he added suiting the action to the word now you are mine teresa he continued still holding her hand soon to be viscountess courland hereafter countess of richborough but you are silent speak i conjure you tell me you are content can you doubt it she replied with a look that seemed to penetrate the inmost recesses of his breast and you really truly love me really truly she rejoined i never loved till now may i credit this he remarked somewhat incredulously i am willing to be deceived i repeat you are the only person i have ever really loved another kiss followed the gratifying assurance which might possibly have been correct are you ambitious teresa asked the enamoured young nobleman i do not think so she rejoined i am influenced by your agreeable qualities not by your rank though a recommendation your title would not have gained you my hand but i ought to tell you i am not very rich and i shall not have much during my fathers lifetime it matters not she replied with a smile i have a tolerably good income and ouselcroft is rather a pretty place as i think you will own when you see it no doubt scrope says you have one of the nicest seats in cheshire i cannot contradict him since i entertain the same opinion myself but you must come and see it i shall not prolong my stay in town possibly i may return tomorrow so soon i have nothing to detain me and under present circumstances i shall be glad to get back it will be far more agreeable to me to see you at your own house than here observed lord courland then be it so she replied come as soon as you please shall i bring scrope danvers with me by all means i have plenty of room besides brackley lady barfleurs residence is only a few miles off miss calverley resides with you i believe yes and a great delight she is to me i couldnt do without her and chetwyndpardon my asking so many questionsis he also with you for the present i hope you like him i like him immensely im sure we shall get on together uncommonly well and now am i at liberty to inform lady thicknesse and scrope that you have consented to become lady courland yes i think it will be quite proper to do so she replied not many minutes afterwards voices were heard without the door was thrown open by higgins and lady thicknesse and most of the persons whom we left below entered the room as lord courland arose and advanced to meet her ladyship she could not fail to be struck by his joyous air i hope i may congratulate your lordship she said do i look like a rejected suitor he remarked not exactly she replied i should say all has gone well yes my suit has prospered he said but i am entirely indebted to your ladyship for the treasure i have gained that you have gained a treasure i am certain rejoined lady thicknesse but i do not see how you owe it to me is it not here that i have found it he said but for you i might never have met the only person who can make me happy by this time mrs calverley herself had come forward to participate in the general felicitations what think you of this proposed marriage observed sir bridgnorth in a low tone to chetwynd i think very little about it replied the other it will never take place wherefore not i cannot explain myself said chetwynd but depend upon it i am right well time will show said sir bridgnorth i am going down to charlton tomorrow come and spend a few days with me i feel certain there will be a general move and so it proved no sooner did mrs calverley announce her intention of returning to ouselcroft on the morrow than emmeline and mildred said they should return at the same time though lady thicknesse besought them to stay a few days longer at last when she could not prevail upon them to remain she declared she would go down to haslemere for a short time and while in cheshire would come and spend a week with her sister lady barfleur at brackley hall determined not to be left out captain danvers likewise volunteered to go to brackley indeed from the various plans proposed and discussed there seemed every prospect that the whole party would soon meet again in the country as it was quite impossible that emmeline and mildred could part with rose it was arranged that she should accompany them and in the mean time the little damsel was allowed to take leave of her friends one of the best dinners monsieur zephyrus had ever served formed the farewell entertainment the merit of the repast was fully appreciated but the company was not so lively as heretofore next day the party broke up though the purpose for which she had assembled her guests had not been accomplished goodnatured lady thicknesse was content and her congratulations to mrs calverley were sincere as to the fair widow who had now reached the summit of her ambition she did not attempt to disguise her satisfaction since she had formed the engagement with lord courland a slight but perceptible change had taken place in her demeanour her manner to mildred was more haughty before her departure she had a private conference with her noble suitor when a good many matters were talked over but in the pleasantest way possible in fact all seemed couleur de rose lord courland attended her to the station and while bidding her adieu she reminded him that in three days she should expect him at ouselcroft doubt not you will see me he rejoined in the same railway carriage with mrs calverley were two young ladies a ladys maid and two gentlemen the gentlemen were chetwynd and sir bridgnorth who were about to accompany the ladies to chester the ladysmaid was remarkably pretty but there was a tear in her bright eye the cause of which will be understood when we mention that on the platform stood a tall blackwhiskered young man gazing wistfully at her harry nettervillefor it was hedid not dare to approach the carriage but waved his hand as the snorting engine started on its journey and bore his love away end of the fifth book book the sixththe clause in mr calverleys will i old nobbis questions laura carriages ordered by telegraph were waiting for the ladies at chester and conveyed them to their respective destinations mrs calverley attended by laura drove direct to ouselcroft emmeline and mildred accompanied by rose who had now got over her grief and was full of curiosity to behold her new abode proceeded to brackley hall sir bridgnorth and chetwynd stopped to dine at the queens hotel and then went back to the nearest point on the line to charlton hall where they arrived about nine oclock as a matter of course the important news that their mistress was engaged to be married to lord courland was immediately communicated to the household by laura and caused a great sensationsome of the servants being pleased while the others did not exactly know how their own particular interests might be affected the unexpected intelligence produced a singular effect upon norris for a time he remained absorbed in thought neither expressing approval nor disapproval he then called laura into the butlers pantry and begging her to be seated said this is a very sudden affair laura i cant understand it you must be very stupid mr norris cant you understand that a young nobleman like lord courland may easily fall over head and ears in love with such a captivating lady as mrs calverley i wasnt surprised at all i felt sure she would carry him off and so she did the girls hadnt a chance with her mr higgins told me his lordship never said a tender word to either of them i dare say it has been a great disappointment to lady thicknesse but mrs calverley cant help that its a great match to make observed norrisa very great match is the weddingday fixed bless you no exclaimed laura why his lordship only proposed yesterday a deal will have to be done before the marriage takes place youre right remarked norris drily what does miss mildred think of it i cant tell replied laura but its perfectly immaterial what she thinks mrs calverley hasnt consulted her and doesnt mean to consult her but i dont fancy she likes it not that she cares for his lordship for i believe she has made it up with captain danvers however im not in the secret for the girls have got a ladysmaid of their own and she doesnt talk much but if thats the case we shall have a lot of marriages before long how so laura inquired norris why its certain miss barfleur has accepted mr chetwynd accepted mr chetwynd exclaimed the old butler thats good news indeedtoo good to be true im afraid oh no its quite correct rejoined laura mr higgins told me there was a great consultation about it yesterday lady thicknesse and mr scrope danvers it seems object to the match but miss barfleur is determined to have him and when a young lady makes up her mind opposition is useless mr norris especially when the young lady is a great heiress rejoined the butler now tell me something about our new master laura for i suppose we shall have to call his lordship master before long is he handsome well there is a difference of opinion on that point mr norris she replied but he has a very stylish look and is extremely affable in his manner in short he looks like a person of rank but hes coming here in a few days and then youll be able to judge for yourself coming here is he cried norris gruffly id rather he kept away i suppose he wants to see whether the place will suit him being engaged he must take it whether it suits him or not observed laura ah you are a wit miss laura said the butler well the description you give of lord courland is satisfactory but i shall be sorry to see my old masters property pass into other hands have you any idea what mr chetwynd thinks of the match not the slightest replied laura except that i feel certain it cant be satisfactory to him or his sister impossiblequite impossible cried norris such is mr higginss opinion observed laura your mr higgins seems a very sensible man remarked norris i should like to have some talk with him you would find him most agreeable as well as very shrewd said laura you will be pleased im sure to hear that he thinks very highly of mr chetwynd another proof of his discernment said norris bythebye where is our young master have you left him in town he came with us as far as chester but he has gone to charlton hall with sir bridgnorth for a few days he would have done better to come on here and miss mildred you say has gone to brackley with miss barfleur well a great change is at hand it wont affect you laura but it will affect me lord courland will find me too old he will require a younger and smarter butler and i shall be dismissed oh i hope not dear mr norris cried laura that would grieve me excessively it will be so my dear he replied and i almost think mrs calverley herself will be glad to get rid of me if she does she will provide for you i am not sure of that old servants are not always rewardedvery rarely indeed i should say ah if my good old master had lived it would have been different but i feel convinced i shall not retain my place unless something happens and it may happen he added significantly what do you mean mr norris i cant explain my meaning but perhaps on consideration mrs calverley may deem it expedient to keep me on ill give her a hint said laura as she quitted the room ii the cabinet on going upstairs after looking for her mistress in the bedchamber where she had left her laura proceeded to a small cabinet in which the late mr calverley was wont to transact his private business write his letters and hold consultations with his tenants and others here in a large oak chest all the old gentlemans deeds and bulky documents were deposited while an escritoire contained his smaller papers accountbooks and memoranda on tapping at the door of the cabinet laura was bidden by her mistress to come in from the expression of mrs calverleys countenance it was clear that something had gone wrong and the sharp ladysmaid scarcely needed any information on the point when she observed that several of the escritoire drawers were pulled out you cant find something i perceive maam said laura can i help you youll do little good laura replied the lady ive searched these drawers most carefully and cant find what i want is it a letter may i venture to ask said laura no its much more important than a letter replied mrs calverley nothing less than my late husbands will good gracious maam exclaimed laura i hope you havent lost it lost itno besides it wouldnt much matter if i had since the will has been proved but i cant conceive what has become of it i placed it in one of those drawers myself i hope it has not been stolen it couldnt be stolen maam if it was safely locked up in one of those drawers said laura i wish youd let me search for it it will be useless but you may try on this laura turned over the contents of the drawers which were chiefly old letters and memoranda but without success its gone no doubt maam she said yes i felt sure you wouldnt find it remarked her mistress the occurrence is most vexatious but i wont worry myself any more about it now i shall see mr carteret in the morning you know ive telegraphed to him to come to me oh yes maam and i guessed what you wanted to consult him about rejoined laura with a knowing look tell me laura said mrs calverley what do your fellowservants say about my engagement with lord courland speak freely i should like to know the truth in general they are very much pleased maam but old mr norris is rather afraid he shall lose his place he fancies his lordship may prefer a younger butler well that is just possible remarked mrs calverley norris is a faithful old servant and i am greatly attached to him but he is growing superannuated i think it might be prudent to keep him on for a time maam said laura with a certain significance since he has lived so long in the family mrs calverley looked inquiringly at her has he said anything to you laura only that he hoped his services might not be forgotten but he said it in a way that meant a great deal i think it would be well not to get rid of him at present maam i have no intention of doing so replied mrs calverley i have a great regard for him as you know so i told him maam does he doubt it he seems uneasy and resentful and unless quieted i think he may make mischief in that case his dismissal would be unavoidable but i hope he will display better judgment assure him that i have not the slightest idea of parting with him and that it will be entirely his own fault if he does not remain here for many years longer i will tell him what you say maam replied laura and i am confident it will give him great satisfaction you have no further commands for me i suppose i would rather you didnt mention downstairs that the will is missing it will be time enough to make inquiries about it tomorrow when i have consulted mr carteret i shall see you again before i retire to rest certainly maam replied laura as she withdrew left alone mrs calverley locked up all the drawers of the escritoire and then sat down to reflect that the will had been abstracted she now felt certain but by whomand with what design at one moment her suspicions alighted on old norris but she instantly rejected the supposition as inconsistent with his character besides she could see no motive for the theft since the instrument would be valueless to him in every way again how could he know that it was placed in the escritoireand had he a key of the drawer no no norris could not be the thief but who else could have taken it unable to answer the question she turned her thoughts to other matters mrs calverleys feelings were of a mingled character though pride and triumph predominated her anxieties had increased and every step she took seemed fraught with difficulty but she shook off all misgivings and congratulating herself on her splendid achievement determined at whatever risk and whatever might be the consequences to carry out the important arrangement she had made iii how the will was found mrs calverley as already intimated had sent a telegraphic message from london to mr carteret desiring him to come to her next morning at ouselcroft and she gave him a hint of the business on which she wished to consult him by mentioning that she expected lord courland accordingly about ten oclock next morning in compliance with the summons he had received mr carteret made his appearance and was conducted by norris to the cabinet just described where he found the beautiful widow seated at a desk with writing materials before her i am so much obliged to you for coming to me mr carteret she said giving him a very warm welcome i want to see you most particularly pray sit down if i am not mistaken madam you are about to form an important matrimonial alliance he remarked you have guessed rightly mr carteret she said with a smile i went up to town a few days ago perfectly free and have returned engaged to lord courland to his lordship accept my congratulations he said rather gravely but i am obliged to treat the affair as a matter of business and must dismiss all sentiment does his lordship propose to make a handsome settlement upon you no doubt he would if it were in his power but he is unable to do so i feared not replied carteret but i hope he doesnt expect a settlement to be made on him i rather think he does replied the lady but surely you have not made any promise to this effect observed carteret indeed i have sir she rejoined you look surprised but i really could not do otherwise i have promised to settle half my property upon him but how will you fulfil your promise i see no difficulty in the way she rejoined i have only to give you the necessary instructions if that were all it would be easy enough but i can scarcely conceive it possible you can be in ignorance of in ignorance of what she hastily interrupted of the clause in your late husbands will which directs that in the event of your marrying again the whole of the property shall go to mildred thus you will have nothing more than the settlement made upon you before your marriage is this so asked mrs calverley with some astonishment i was not aware of it it is exactly as i state he replied i am amazed to find you have not read the will i have read it she cried but i did not notice the clause you mention i will show it you in a moment if you will give me the will he said i fear the will has been stolen she rejoined stolen he ejaculated yes i wished to refer to it last evening but could not find it had you put it in a safe place i put it in one of the drawers of this escritoire the drawers were all locked but the will was gone have you examined the drawers today asked carteret i have not because i consider further search completely useless i should like to satisfy myself before making inquiries said carteret mrs calverley unlocked the top drawer and opened it and had no sooner done so than mr carteret sprang forward exclaiming why there it is had it come there by magic mrs calverley could scarcely believe her eyes are you certain you examined this drawer said carteret quite laura searched it after me but how came the will back that i cannot explain replied mrs calverley but it is clear one of the servants has a key that fits this lock i scarcely like to say sobut i suspect norris i cant believe the old man capable of such an act said carteret however well speak of that presently first let me convince you that my statement in regard to the will is correct here is the clause it is at the very end of the instrumentand i hereby declare that if my dear wife teresa shall marry again without the consent in writing first had and obtained of my dear daughter mildred then and in such case the whole of my property hereby devised to my said wife shall go and revert to my said daughter mildred anything heretofore expressed to the contrary notwithstanding thus you see madam he pursued if you marry again all your property which may be roughly estimated at five thousand pounds per annum will go from you and you will have nothing but your settlement i cannot imagine how this important clause escaped you neither can i said mrs calverley but it will now be necessary to decide whether you will sacrifice your present large income or break off the important match you have just formed i dont think you can have much hesitation in my opinion when lord courland learns how you are circumstanced he will be anxious to retire i do not think so exclaimed mrs calverley well you will have an excellent opportunity of testing the sincerity of his affection i am taken quite by surprise as you see mr carteret said mrs calverley who was greatly agitated and must have time for consideration before i can decide i anticipate no difficulty it is certainly an awkward dilemma said carteret but i dont see how you can get out of it unless you are content to remain single i quite thought you understood your position or i should have ventured to give you some advice before i wish you had said mrs calverley i little imagined mildred held my destiny in her hands she cannot be aware of her power i have no means of judging replied carteret but i fancy not then let her be kept in ignorance for a short time till we are able to think the matter over i cannot will not give up lord courlandi love him that alters the case madam but though i cannot give him up i know not whether he is disinterested enough to take me with my small fortune fifteen hundred a year is not a small fortune said carteret and you have that at any rate if lord courland loves you as strongly as i am persuaded he does i am sure he will be content with it but he has been led to expect more said mrs calverley yes that is unfortunate his expectations having been raised so highly a disappointment may ensue but i do not anticipate a rupture is to be apprehended let me state that i did my best to prevent the introduction of this objectionable clause into the will but my remonstrances were ineffectual mr calverley was determined if she marries again the property shall return to my family he said so i was obliged to carry out his instructions i know not what are your plans madam but my advice to you is to delay the marriage as long as you can so that some arrangement may be made with miss calverley i will follow your advice mr carteret but when mildred discovers her power i think she will prove impracticable it may be so he rejoined but you are still mistress of the situation she may prevent your marriage but she can do nothing more evidently she is in the dark at present keep this matter secret till you have concocted your plans you will then be able to make a better arrangement but you forget that i have an enemy in the house whoever abstracted the willand i still suspect norrisis in possession of the important secret and will communicate it that is certain struck by what she said mr carteret reflected for a few minutes under the circumstances it may be well to keep on good terms with old norris he said chetwynd and mildred i find are both absent so that you need not apprehend immediate interference from either of them summon me if you require my counsel and i will come at once i can render you no service just now but mind make no proposition to mildred without consulting me and he left the cabinet as he went out he found norris in the hall and took the opportunity of speaking to him well norris he said youre going to have a great change in the house before long how does it suit you not at all sir replied the old butler who looked very gloomy id rather things remained as they are but do you really think sir this marriage will take place whats to hinder it remarked carteret looking at him inquiringly nothing that i know of replied norris but perhaps mrs calverley may change her mind she has got everything she wants now except a husband replied carteret laughing and he may cost too dear said norris too dear what do you mean a young nobleman is not to be had for nothing replied norris well mrs calverley can afford to pay a high price for such a luxury if she chooses said carteret however thats not the way to look at the matter norris this is a very great match and must be conducted in a befitting manner a large settlement must necessarily be made i dont dispute that sir said norris but can a large settlement be made the rascal has read the will thought carteret of course it can he added aloud mrs calverley can do what she likes with her own well you ought to know better than me sir said norris but i fancy youre mistaken i always understood my old master didnt wish his wife to marry again and i concluded he would take precautions to prevent her doing so i wouldnt advise you to make such observations as those to any one but me norris said carteret not even to mr chetwynd or miss mildred sir i see what you are driving at norris but you had better hold your tongue and keep quiet youll do yourself no good by meddling in what does not concern you things are by no means settled most certainly the marriage wont take place at present very likely it may not take place at all but if it does the testamentary directions will be strictly carried out thats all i wished to know sir replied the butler i wont say a word more to any one and he attended mr carteret to the door where the solicitors mailphaeton was waiting for him iv a letter prom lord courland on quitting the cabinet the door of which was locked and taking the key with her mrs calverley went out into the garden looking apparently quite cheerful though she had an anxious breast and had just sat down on a lawn chair when a letter that had arrived by post was brought her by laura as yet mrs calverley had said nothing to her ladysmaid about the restoration of the will as she thought it best to leave that matter in doubt for the present and she now allowed her to depart without any allusion to the subject indeed she was dying to read her letter which she saw was from lord courland it was just such a letter as might have been expected from him but there were some passages in it that produced an effect contrary to that intended by her noble suitor and heightened her uneasiness i must write you a line dearest teresa he began though i have nothing to say except to tell you how supremely wretched i feel now you are gone however i try to console myself by the thought that i shall soon behold you again and in your own house which i long so much to seeas it will be my abode when i am made the happiest of mortals by the possession of your hand i have to thank mr calverley for two thingsfirst that he was considerate enough to die and secondly that he left his large property at your entire disposal i shall always entertain the highest respect for his memory this may seem rather heartless jesting sweet teresa but it is the simple expression of my feelings really very few men would have behaved so well as your late husband but he fully appreciated you i wish i could follow his examplenot by quitting you for i dont intend to do that if i can help it for many years to comebut by making a handsome settlement upon you fortunately you have enoughenough for us bothand i cannot sufficiently thank you for your kind promises my devotion shall prove my gratitude ouselcroft you tell me is a charming place and i ought not to accept it or any share in it but i can refuse nothing you offer menot even that priceless treasure yourself i do not ask you to write to me though one word would enchant me and enable me to endure this separation adieu sweet teresa i shall count the minutes till we meet the perusal of this letter gave mrs calverley infinitely more pain than pleasure for she now feared she should never be able to carry out her noble suitors wishes and she saw plainly that he would not be content with the income derived from her settlement she read the letter again and this conviction struck her even more forcibly on the second perusal she revolved the matter in her mind very deliberately what could she do dark thoughts possessed her there seemed only one way of extricating herself from the difficulty she shrank from it but it recurred again and again till she became ffamiliarised with the idea and it appeared less dreadful than at first the step seemed unavoidable she resolved to answer lord courlands letter but very briefly and to make no allusion to her promises to him though he seemed to expect it she was still buried in thought when laura came to her and with the familiarity which this favourite attendant usually displayed said dear me maam you look dreadfully pale i hope nothing has gone wrong nothing whatever replied mrs calverley with a forced smile i have had a most charming letter from lord courland but i feel rather faint the air doesnt seem to revive me so i shall go indoors and she arose i came to tell you maam said laura that old norris is greatly obliged by your kind promise to him he says he now feels quite easy there was no need to trouble himself before observed mrs oalverley bythebye i havent told you that the will has been found indeed maam where exclaimed laura in the top drawer of the escritoire im sure i searched that drawer maam mr carteret found it at once but dont say anything more about it i dont want the matter talked about bythebye i mean to drive over to brackley in the ponycarriage this afternoon and shall take you with me im always pleased with a drive maam especially to brackley replied laura as they entered the house they met the aged butler who bowed respectfully to his mistress much obliged to you for thinking of me maam he said youve always shown me great kindness not more than you deserve norris she replied graciously it was quite a misapprehension i assure you i never intended to part with you and should never think of doing so without making you a comfortable provision id rather stay where i am maam replied the butler after living in it for half a century a man gets attached to a house then rest easy norris she rejoined you shall stay here to the lastthat i promise you the old butler muttered his thanks for he felt rather husky and mrs calverley went upstairs to her own room v showing what mrs calverleys dressingbox contained after closing the door mrs calverley approached the large psyche that stood opposite her and ejaculated no wonder laura was struck by my appearance i do look frightfully pale i must take care my looks dont betray me but her countenance assumed a deathly hue and her limbs seemed scarcely able to support her as she moved towards the door communicating with the dressingroom there she stopped her entrance apparently being barred by a shadowy figure resembling her dead husband but teresa as we have shown was a woman of high courage and not to be daunted by superstitious fears convinced that the figure was a mere effect of her imagination she passed into the inner room and then standing still for a moment till she had quite recovered her selfpossession proceeded to unlock a large dressingbox that stood upon the toilettable and took from it a small casket apparently containing scent bottles when the casket in its turn was unlocked by a diminutive and peculiarlyshaped key four very small phials were disclosed teresa selected one of them filled as it seemed with a very bright spirit held it up for a moment and then taking out the stopper breathed at the contents of the phial just then a slight noise disturbed her and she became aware that she was watched by laura who was standing at the bedroom door though appalled at the sight she exhibited no sign of alarm but with the utmost coolness said i thought some eaudeluce would do me good i always take it for the migraine from which i am now suffering but you need not stay order the ponycarriage in half an hour and be ready yourself by that time laura not for an instant doubting the truth of what she was told laura withdrew and she was no sooner gone than mrs calverley wrapped the small phial in her embroidered pockethandkerchief and then replaced the casket and carefully locked the dressingbox vi poison in the cup half an hour later mrs calverley who had completely recovered and indeed looked remarkably well drove over to brackley in the ponycarriage attended by laura and a groom the two girls were in the garden when she arrived at the hall but lady barfleur who was much impressed by the brilliant engagement mrs calverly had formed received her with great ceremony accept my congratulations dear mrs calverley she said i felt sure you would marry well but i did not expect you would make such a great match as this you are fortunate in every respect it seems for emmeline tells me lord courland is exceedingly goodlooking and agreeable i hope he may like ouselcroft i should be very sorry if you left this part of the country dont be alarmed dear lady barfleur rejoined mrs calverley i should never think of leaving ouselcroft and i am persuaded lord courland will be pleased with the place i expect him on thursday you must all come and dine with me during his stay i dont give dinners now as you know but i must see him he will be delighted to dine with you i am sure but i must bring him over some morning to see the old hall by all means replied lady barfleur you will always be welcome here the two girls came in fresh from the garden emmeline looked blooming and full of spirits but mildred complained of slight indisposition and in fact did not seem very well mrs calverley noticed these symptoms with secret satisfaction they favoured her dark design you seem rather poorly this morning my love she said i am a little out of sorts replied mildred i think i caught cold on the journey but i shall soon be better better when a certain person arrives whispered emmeline well he will be here this evening or tomorrow at latest dont fall ill before he comes unfeeling creature exclaimed mildred with a sickly smile just then the luncheonbell was rung and the ladies proceeded to the diningroom it might have been noticedif such a trifling circumstance could attract attentionthat mrs calverley carried her embroidered kerchief in her hand while they were crossing the hall the reverend mr massey made his appearance and after saluting lady barfleur and the others went in with them to luncheon as they took their seats at table mrs calverley easily managed to get a place next her stepdaughter some little progress had been made with the repast which it is supposed ladies enjoy more than dinner when emmeline remarked you must let us have some champagne today mamma please mildred is rather out of spirits the proposition was seconded by the chaplain who was always exceedingly cheerful and had been conversing very agreeably with lady barfleur so the wine was brought and handed round by the butler you must not refuse mildred cried emmeline the champagne was ordered expressly for you and for me added the chaplain laughing for you as well said emmeline you are entitled to a second glass even as the words were spoken with singular boldness and dexterity and screened by the handkerchief mrs calverley contrived to let fall two or three poisonous drops from the phial into mildreds glass the action passed completely unnoticed mildreds attention being diverted at the moment no peculiarity was perceptible in the flavour of the champagne it seemed excellent and really believing the exhilarating wine would do her good mildred emptied the glass in answer to a friendly sign from the chaplain mrs calverley raised the glass to her lips but her handkerchief had disappeared the enlivening effect of the wine on the party was speedily apparentexcept in the instance of mildred who began to feel ill and was obliged to rise from table and leave the room mrs calverley who seemed greatly concerned and was very attentive to her wished her to see doctor spencer but she declined insisting that it was a mere passing indisposition emmeline was of the same opinion but rose hartley who bad been summoned to attend her thought otherwise and prevailed on her to retire to her own room by this time she had become so faint that rose had to assist her to mount the spiral staircase to disarm suspicion mrs calverley remained for an hour conversing with lady barfleur and mr massey and played her part to perfectioncharming them both before setting out on her return she went upstairs to see mildred and found her lying on a couch with emmeline and rose by her side the glow of the painted glass in the baywindow somewhat disguised the sufferers paleness no touch of pity agitated teresas breast as she gazed at her victim on the contrary she secretly exulted in the success of her direful attempt nevertheless she inquired with wellfeigned solicitude how do you feel now my love somewhat better i think mamma replied mildred i am so glad to hear you say so remarked mrs calverley i hoped to take you and emmeline back with me to ouselcroft but that is quite out of the question now quite maam observed rose i think miss calverley ought to have medical advice so do i rejoined teresa shall i send for doctor spencer my love no mamma replied mildred if he comes i shall be laid up for a week as i know from sad experience you recollect how tiresome he was during my last illness and wouldnt let me stir i wont have him now unless im obliged better let her have her own away whispered emmeline unconscious that she was playing into mrs calverleys hands she wants to see a certain person on his arrival here well you mustnt blame me if any harm ensues rejoined teresa i really think she ought to have immediate advice rose looked imploringly at her but did not venture to remonstrate well i shall come over tomorrow morning said mrs calverley and then what then asked mildred faintly i shall go and fetch doctor spencer myself unless you contrive to get well in the interim however i shall feel easy about you knowing youre in good hands yes rose and i will take every care of her said emmeline dont bring doctor spencer or send him till you see me again i beg mamma said mildred promise me that mrs calverley gave the required promise though with apparent reluctance as she bade her victim adieu and kissed her fevered brow mildred instinctively recoiled from the contact of her lips vii pangs op remorse no trace of anxiety could be discerned on mrs calverleys beautiful countenance as she drove back to ouselcroft with laura by her side on the contrary she seemed quite elated struck by her want of feeling the ladysmaid said i am sorry to hear miss mildred has been taken ill oh there is nothing much the matter rejoined mrs calverley she has been slightly indisposed all the morning and something disagreed with her at luncheon glad to hear it maam i was afraid from what rose hartley said it was a serious attack oh no replied mrs calverley she thought so little of it herself that she wouldnt let me send for doctor spencer i shall drive over again tomorrow and trust to find her quite recovered i should think a little eaudeluce would do her good maam remarked laura why do you think so asked mrs calverley startled she seems to have had such a sudden seizure like yourself maam mine was merely a violent headache laura accompanied by faintness ah she exclaimed in real alarm after vainly searching for it in her bag what did i do with my handkerchief i hope i havent left it behind no its here maam replied laura giving it her you had laid it on the seat oh thank you laura cried mrs oalverley looking inexpressibly relieved and squeezing the handkerchief to make sure the phial was safe inside it she put it into her bag i wonder why she was so agitated just now thought laura all signs of exultation had now vanished from mrs calverleys countenance and she looked thoughtful and uneasy during the rest of the drive and scarcely made a remark to laura who could not account for the sudden and extraordinary change in her mood on arriving at ouselcroft she went upstairs almost immediately to her own room but contrary to custom and greatly to the surprise of the ladysmaid did not take her with her this time on going into her dressingroom she did not neglect to lock both doors feeling now safe from intrusion she sat down to reflect but there was such a turmoil in her breast such confusion in her brain that she found it impossible to do so calmly the fancied loss of her handkerchief with the phial inside it which if it had really occurred must have inevitably led to the discovery of the terrible crime she had committed had completely unnerved her all was now quiet but when the dreadful catastrophe occurred suspicion would be instantly aroused and the slightest circumstance that bore upon the dark deed would be weighed and examined the will which had been prepared by carteret and which she could not doubt had been read by norris supplied the motive of the crime inasmuch as it showed that her stepdaughters death would be extraordinarily advantageous to herselfso advantageous indeed as almost to suggest mildreds removal evidence sufficient to condemn her could be furnished by laura whose strange curiosity had enabled her to become a fatal witness against her when she clearly understood the frightful position in which she was placed her terror increased and she would have given all she possessed and all she hoped to gain if the deed could be undone so agonising were her remorseful feelings that life had become intolerable she resolved to put an end to it and by the same means she had employed to remove mildred she had not yet put by the phial though she had come thither for the express purpose of doing so with a terrible feeling of exultation at the thought of escaping the consequences of her last crime and of another crime equally dreadful that still weighed upon her conscience she raised the phial to her lips with the intention of swallowing the whole of its deadly contents but her fatal purpose was arrested by a tap at the bedroom door for a few moments she could scarcely collect her thoughts and when she spoke her voice was hoarse who is it she demanded laura replied the person in the bedroom may i come in no rejoined the wretched teresa i have only come to tell you that mr chetwynd has just arrived with two young men said laura the mention of that name produced an instantaneous effect on mrs calverley and dispelled her fears even if he had come to charge her with her crime she would have met him and defied him tell mr chetwynd i will come down directly she said in a firm voice who are the persons with him do you know them they are two young men whom i saw at lady thicknesses maammr harry netterville and mr tom tankard i dont know what business theyve come about but i fancy it relates to rose hartleymiss barfleurs ladysmaid completely reassured by this remark mrs calverley told laura to go down at once and desire norris to offer the young men some refreshment and as soon as she found that the inquisitive ladysmaid had departed she unlocked the dressingbox replaced the phial in the casket and then having made all secure went downstairs viii harry netterville and tom tankard appear at ouselcroft mrs calverley found chetwynd in the library with the two young men who bowed very respectfully as she made her appearance what has happened she said to chetwynd i thought you were staying with sir bridgnorth i have only just come from charlton he replied we have got a strange business on hand as you will admit when you learn what it is you have heard me speak of an infamous scoundrel named romney well it seems that this daring libertine who for some time has persecuted rose hartley with his addresses has resolved to carry her off from brackley such audacity seems scarcely credible exclaimed mrs calverley it is nevertheless certain he is about to make the attempt this very night said netterville my friend tom tankard discovered his design in a very singular manner as he will tell you yes maam said tom with one of his best bows i went to get my hair cut yesterday by a coiffoor named sigebert smart and while i was undergoing the operation sigebert who is rather too familiar says to me do you remember rose hartley mr tom to be sure i do says i and a very pretty girl she is she has gone to brackley hall in cheshire with miss barfleur and miss calverley but she wont remain there long remarked sigebert why not says i dont she like the place cant tell about that observed sigebert but theres a gentleman going to look after her indeed says i pricking up my earsfor i thought of my friend harry netterville it wont be any use if he does youre very much mistaken there mr tom says he with a knowing look im going with him you says i in astonishment yes and if we cant manage it the deuce is in it manage what says i you dont mean to carry her off that will depend said he there may be an enlevement but i dare say shell come willingly enough on hearing this i said no more to alarm him for i knew who he meant and wished to catch the rascal but i presently inquired when do you set out on this expedition tomorrow he replied we shall get down to brackley hall in the dusk of the evening but dont go and talk about itespecially to harry nettervilleor youll spoil all i promised to keep silence but had no sooner left the rascally hairdressers shop than i took a cab and drove to grays inn to see harry and tell him what i had found out at first he didnt believe it i couldnt said netterville the attempt seemed too wild but tom convinced me it would be made we then arranged our plans and having ascertained from lady thicknesses butler higgins that mr chetwynd calverley had gone to spend a few days with sir bridgnorth charlton we set off for stafford early this morning and saw mr calverley hoping he might feel disposed to accompany us and he did not hesitate a moment no cried chetwynd and i confess the intelligence you brought gave me the utmost satisfaction for i felt that at last romney had delivered himself into my hands i judged it best to come on here instead of proceeding direct to brackley he added to mrs calverley as i feared to alarm the rascals but i shall send over a note to warn rose and give her some instructions romney must not escape me i should be very sorry for that said mrs calverley but it is rather unlucky that mildred should have been taken ill this morning and rose is obliged to be in attendance upon her she is not seriously ill i trust inquired chetwynd anxiously no and emmeline can stay with her while rose leaves her for a time said mrs calverley nothing more will be needful said chetwynd then turning to netterville and pointing to the writing materials on the table he added sit down and prepare a note to rose and i will send it off a once by a groom to brackley together with another letter from myself so saying he quitted the library with mrs calverley but presently returned for nettervilles letter which he gave to the groom enjoining him to set off at once meanwhile norris came to the library and invited the two young men to come to the butlers pantry where a substantial repast was set out for then together with a bottle of claret i say harry remarked tom as he discussed the pigeonpie and quaffed the claret i shouldn mind an expedition like this every day if i could insure such prog and what a beautiful creature that mrs calverley is i declare im quite in love with her myself how do you feel very comfortable replied harry i can think of nothing but rose oh rose lubly rose chanted tom take another glass of claret thatll cure you ix the attempted abduction on that same evening about nine oclock two individuals who had recently alighted from a hired carriage at no great distance from brackley hall and had contrived to cross both bridges traverse the courtyard and get into the gardenthese two persons we say were standing near a yewtree alley looking towards the ancient mansion which could be distinguished through the gloom with its picturesque outline of gables and windows there were lights in some of the windows but the general appearance of the house was exceedingly sombre fortunately for the two individuals we have mentioned there were no dogs in the courtyard these protectors were all with the keeper ned rushton not even a watchdog was kept at the hall so that no alarm was given well i think you may succeed in your design said one of the pair if you can only contrive to get the girl out of the house theres the difficulty the carriage is not more than a quarter of a mile off we must have it much closer at hand presently replied the other i wonder we havent seen lomax he ought to be here by this time i hope he has not played us false let us go towards the house on this they quitted the garden crossed the moat and reentered the courtproceeding with the utmost caution but there did not seem any one about however they soon discovered that some slight preparations had been made for them reared against the side of the house was a ladder which could easily be shifted to any other spot that was required and not far from the ladder was an open baywindow without curtains in the deep recess of which window a candle was set that illuminated the chamber and showed rose was its sole occupant this arrangement of things appeared so promising that it almost looked like a snare but romney did not hesitate without giving himself a moment for reflection he carried the ladder to the open window mounted as quickly as he could and sprang into the room followed by sigebert on seeing them rose flew towards the door but was instantly followed by romney who fastened a scarf over her mouth so as to stifle her cries all this was executed with wonderful success but it is quite possible rose might have made more noise if she had thought proper she did not even struggle much when they proceeded to take her through the window she goes very quietly thought sigebert i believe we shall have no trouble whatever with her in my opinion shes not at all disinclined to be carried off having got first down the ladder sigebert received the precious burden from his principal but as soon as romney landed he once more took charge of the fair damsel and endeavoured to get her out of the court hitherto she had been quiet enough but she now made a grand disturbance she quickly succeeded in tearing the scarf from her face and then the court rang with her cries in answer to which came forth harry netterville and tom tankard who had been hidden in the old chapel each being armed with a stout stick they soundly belaboured both rascals after a while both caitiffs were released but only for a worse punishment as they were running off in the hope of gaining their carriage they were stopped by chetwynd and taken in charge by a couple of police officers by whom they were conveyed in their own carriage to knutsford where they were locked up in the gaol x how mildred recovered on going over to brackley next morning mrs calverley found mildred much better and decidedly out of danger she had not expected such a favourable change and could not very well account for it but for many reasons she was glad the poison had not taken full effect of course mildred was still very weak though rapidly recovering but as her symptoms differed in no respect from those of an ordinary illness now it seemed quite unnecessary to consult doctor spencer thus the evil woman escaped that danger but though she had been saved the perpetration of this dreadful crime and its consequences she felt no regret no pity touched her heart even as she looked at mildred on that morning while suffering from the poison she had administered she resolved to complete her workbut more deliberately so that there should be no possibility of detection while thus planning mildreds destruction she feigned the greatest affection for her and seemed beyond measure rejoiced at her recovery perhaps she rather overacted her part for both mildred and emmeline doubted her sincerity however since this favourable change had taken place she now proposed that both girls should come over to ouselcroft next day and bring rose hartley with them mildred felt sure she should be quite well by that time so the proposition was agreed to at this particular juncture mrs calverleys great desire was to render herself agreeable to everybody she therefore pretended to take a great interest in rose hartley and made her give her full particulars of the intended enlvement from rose she learnt that all had been prepared for the intruders and that romney and his companion had completely fallen into the trap miss barfleur was good enough to lend me her room for the occasion said rose as it was very conveniently situated for our plan and we hoped they would venture into the house and so they did taking the ladder which had been placed close at hand ready for them they mounted to the window got into the room seized me tied a scarf over my mouth and carried me off but i was soon free while my assailants after receiving a sound thrashing from harry netterville and tom tankard were taken in their own chaise to knutsford gaol where they are likely to remain some time so that at last i am rid of my persecutor i am glad of it cried mrs calverley the business was capitally managed but where are harry netterville and his friend they are still here maam replied rose and perhaps they may remain for a day or so ask them to come over to ouselcroft tomorrow said mrs calverley i will direct mr norris to take care of them we shall have some festivities going on im sure it is very kind of you maam said rose they will be delighted with the invitation the young ladies i believe are going to you tomorrow yes and you will come with them said mrs calverley therefore i make this proposition in regard to your friends thinking it may be agreeable to you it is most agreeable to me maam said rose and i am exceedingly obliged to you a few days at two such charming countryhouses as brackley and ouselcroft will be a great treat to harry and his friend well i hope they may enjoy themselves said teresa and now take care to get miss calverley quite well by tomorrow we mustnt have any more illness oh shell get well today maam im sure said rose with a significant look captain danvers is expected the tact and goodnature displayed by mrs calverley quite charmed rose who had not previously a very great liking for her the two young men were enchanted by the invitation to ouselcroft tom tankard had fallen desperately in love with mrs calverley his egregious vanity made him imagine she was struck by his appearance and he fancied it was on his account that he and netterville were invited to ouselcroft xi more letters next morning several letters arrived at ouselcroft and were brought by laura to mrs calverleys dressingroom the first opened by the lady was one from lord courland as full of ardour and passion as his last letter but considerably shorter its chief object was to mention that he and scrope danvers would make their appearance in plenty of time for dinner but he added as a postscript that he was dying with curiosity to behold ouselcroft the place is not yet mine thought teresa but rest easy you shall not be disappointed my project is only deferred the next letter opened was from lady thicknesse this was quite unexpected her ladyship had talked of coming to ouselcroft but at a later date she now volunteered a visit but we must give her own words you have pressed me so strongly to come to you dear mrs calverley that i cannot resist i propose to come to you tomorrow about midday i have got a surprise for you you will wonder what it is but as you will never guess i must tell you i am bringing with me my chef zephyrus and i place him at your disposal charming exclaimed teresa this will be a great delight to lord courland i know how highly he appreciates monsieur zephyruss performances nothing could please me better but he is not the only one it seems i shall have an entirely new household i shall also venture to bring with me my butler higgins he is a very clever man and i think you will find him useful but if he is at all in the way he can go on to brackley oh i am so glad higgins is coming cried mrs calverley he will be of the greatest use and will enable me to get rid of that suspicious old norris whose eye seems ever upon me but stop i must not offend old norris or i shall arouse another enemy he must be kept in the background as much as possible so far my letters have been very satisfactory here is another and i think it is from sir bridgnorth charlton let us see what he says since chetwynd does not seem disposed to return i must come to ouselcroft have you room for me for two or three days plenty of room and shall be delighted to see him remarked mrs calverley heres a note from captain danvers she added with indifference they all seem resolved to come here well i dare say i shall be able to accommodate him but besides these there was one person on whom nobody counted this was mr tankard he had written a letter to chetwynd saying he was coming with his friend mr higgins and hoping it might not be considered a liberty chetwynd went at once to norris and the old butler glad to find that higgins was coming to see him undertook that beds should be prepared for that important personage and tankardto say nothing of harry netterville tom tankard and zephyrus with such a party below stairs it seemed more than probable that some of the gaieties of belgravesquare might be repeated at ouselcroft having ascertained the train by which lady thicknesse must of necessity arrive mrs calverley met her at the station in her ponycarriage the whole of the luggage which was rather cumbrous together with zephyrus higgins and tankard came by a special omnibus lady thicknesse was one of the very few persons whom mrs calverley really liked and she showed she was glad to see her the day happened to be fine so they had an extremely pleasant drive of five or six miles to ouselcroft lady thicknesse was in high good humour and disposed to be pleased with everything the approach to the house charmed her properly speaking there was no park but there was a good deal of land that had a very parklike character being tolerably well timbered while all the hedges were taken down as the carriage was stopped for a moment at a good point of view lady thicknesse exclaimed you are most fortunate dear mrs calverley this is just the house to live in i am sure lord courland will be of my opinion but her ladyship was quite as much pleased with the house on a nearer inspection as she had been on a more distant survey the gardens and grounds were perfection and as she looked out on the smooth lawn from her chamber window she thought she had never seen a lovelier place mrs calverley had an interview with zephyrus soon after his arrival and expressed her great satisfaction at having the advantage of his services flattered by her compliments the distinguished chef promised her an excellent dinner but to achieve his object he declared he must have absolute control of the kitchen this was readily accorded him and everything else he required so he proceeded to make his arrangements and struck terror into the breast of the cook and her assistants by his arbitrary manner pursuing her policy of conciliation mrs calverley was very kind and courteous in her manner to mr higgins and mr tankard begged them to make themselves at home and desired norris to show them every attention harry netterville and tom tankard likewise came in for a share of her civilities they had just been to knutsford to attend the examination of romney and his companion who were sentenced by a full bench of magistrates to six months imprisonment mrs calverley expressed her great satisfaction at the result and took the opportunity of complimenting the young men on their prowess her observations were very simple but tom was greatly elated by them there did you see how sweetly she smiled on me he said to netterville i told you i was high in favour tom was not particularly gratified by his fathers unlookedfor appearance on the scene thinking perhaps his own importance might be diminished what the deuce has brought the guvnor down here he remarked to netterville we could have done very well without him hes come to look after you ive no doubt tom observed netterville laughing no its higgins cried tom he cant live without higgins where higgins goes tankard must go too i believe if higgins set off for jerusalem by next train if there is a railway to jerusalem tankard would set off after him but i must shut up here come the guvnor and higgins i hope they didnt overhear my remarks but it seemed they did for they both shook their hands at him xii lord courland arrives at ouselcroft when lord courland and scrope danvers arrived later in the day a very pretty picture was presented to them on the lawn which was charmingly kept the whole party now staying in the house were assembled and judging from the lively sounds that reached the ear they were all amusing themselves very well the two girls were playing lawn tennis with chetwynd and captain danvers and sir bridgnorth who had arrived about an hour previously was conversing with lady thicknesse and mrs calverley it was rather unfortunate that all the ladies should be in mourning but in spite of the sombre costumes the scene looked gay and pleasant mrs calverley had sent her carriage to the station for lord courland and scrope and no sooner had his lordship alighted than without waiting for any formal announcement by norris he flew to that part of the lawn where teresa was seated she did not wait till he came up but hastened towards him and a very loverlike meeting took place so much ardour as teresa now displayed seemed scarcely consistent with her character but either she was passionately in love with lord courland or she feigned to be so after exchanging a few words and we suppose we must add a few kisses they walked off to another part of the garden having apparently a great deal to say to each other that would not brook an instants delay lady thicknesse and sir bridgnorth looked after them with a smile well and how do you like ouselcroft inquired teresa i have hardly had time to look around me he replied gazing on her at present i can behold only one object but i really want to have your opinion does the place equal your expectations it surpasses them you have seen nothing yet you ran away from the lawn which is the prettiest part we will go back there presently when we have had a few minutes to ourselves too many curious eyes were upon us when one is desperately in love as i am one wants solitude but you will soon be mine not quite so soon as we anticipated some little delay i find will be unavoidable i hope not said lord courland with a look of disappointment i would rather the marriage were expedited than delayed i am afraid that will be quite impossible said teresa i shall have to make some preparatory arrangements i thought the property was entirely in your own hands he said so it is she replied and there is really nothing to prevent the marriage from taking place immediately then yield to my impatience i beseech you i have consulted my lawyer and he advises a little delay lawyers always are tedious they have no consideration for ones feelings even when nothing has to be done but draw up a settlement they will make a long job of it i fancied all might have been arranged in a few days signed sealed and delivered perhaps it may said teresa but we are getting quite serious in our discourse all matters of business must be deferred till tomorrow when i doubt not they can be satisfactorily arranged i think if i could say a word to your lawyer i could make him use more despatch said lord courland i scarcely think so replied teresa uneasily i have given him all needful instructions but there is the first bell we must go and dress for dinner by the time they reached the lawn the whole party had gone into the house so they had it to themselves and remained there for a few minutes lord courland was positively enchanted with the place and could scarcely find terms sufficiently strong to express his admiration then you do like the house cried teresa it is everything i could desire he replied i hope to make it yours ere long she said but you must not be too impatient i am eager to possess you sweetheartnot the house he rejoined ah if i thought so sighed teresa but i know better they then passed through one of the drawingroom windows and were met by norris who conducted lord courland to his room xiii a dance on the lawn never before bad a dinner so perfect been served at ouselcroft but in the opinion of the distinguished chef sufficient justice was not done to it he was very particular in his inquiries of norris and higgins both of whom were in attendance and discovered that some of his best dishes had been neglected by the guest for whom he had specially prepared them this was very vexatious but zephyrus endeavoured to console himself by reflecting that lord courland was in love and about to be married either of which misfortunes as he termed them was sufficient to account for his lordships want of appetite however the repast was not wasted but appeared again in the servants hall where quite as large a party sat down to it as had done in the diningroom and it would seem they were far better judges since the very recherch dishes that were previously neglected were now completely devoured as it happened to be a lovely moonlight night and very warm mrs calverley took out the whole of the guests upon the lawn and they had not been there long when captain danvers suggested a dance with the drawingroom windows left wide open it was found that the piano sounded quite loud enough lady thicknesse who was a very good musician immediately sat down and played a waltz lord courland and teresa with two other couples were soon footing it lightly on the smooth turf and a very agreeable impromptu little dance was got up but this was not all at the instance of lord courland a servants dance was got up at the farther end of the lawn near the two cedars of lebanon already described notice of the proposed dance was given by norris at the very moment when the party in the servants hall had finished supper nothing could have been more agreeable to tom tankard and zephyrus than the suggestion they had heard that dancing was going on in the garden and if they could not join it they at least desired to look on but this proposition completely satisfied them the main difficulty seemed in regard to the music but on inquiry it was found that the footman could play the flute the coachman the violin and the groom the banjo and provided with those instruments they proceeded to the lawn when the band struck up it was found very efficient and elicited great applause it was decided to commence with a quadrille and finish with sir roger de coverley as may be supposed harry netterville had already secured a partner in rose but a contest occurred between tom tankard and zephyrus for the hand of laura and the frenchman proving successful tom was obliged to content himself with clarissa the rather smart upper housemaid both the portly mr higgins and the still more portly mr tankard took part in the quadrillethe one dancing with the cook and the other with the second housemaid lucy who was quite as pretty as clarissa owing to the bright moonlight the quadrille could be distinctly seen by the party near the house and afforded them great amusement indeed when zephyrus danced his cavalier seul lord courland and teresa came forward to witness the performance tom tankard was likewise stimulated into an extraordinary display by the presence of mrs calverley and the other ladies but sir roger de coverley was the real success of the evening in this cheerful dance form was set aside mrs calverley led off with lord courland and danced down the long lines making tom tankard supremely happy by giving him her hand for a moment she was followed by emmeline and chetwynd after whom came mildred and captain danvers sir bridgnorth induced lady thicknesse to walk through a part of the dance with him but her ladyship retired long before she got to the bottom the dance seemed interminable and was not brought to a close till long after the great folks had withdrawn old norris declared this was the merriest evening he had ever spent at ouselcroft since mr chetwynd was christened and he thought the good times were coming again before retiring to her own room teresa accompanied lady thicknesse to her chamber and sat with her for five minutes during which they talked over the events of the eveningher ladyship being of opinion that everything had gone off remarkably well and that so far as she could perceive lord courlands affability and good nature had produced a very good effect upon the establishment i think his idea of a servants dance on the lawn was excellent she said and i am very glad you allowed it higgins told me they were all greatly pleased it was particularly kind in your ladyship to take part in it observed mrs calverley well i havent danced for many a year but sir bridgnorth seemed so anxious i could not refuse him i was delighted to see that he had prevailed remarked mrs calverley with a smile i think your ladyship will very soon have to consider whether you are inclined to give him your hand altogether he is certainly very devoted i have a very great regard for sir bridgnorth said lady thicknesse and think him very kindhearted and as it seems to me exactly suited in some respects perhaps he is said lady thicknesse at all events i dont dislike him and charlton is really a very fine place remarked teresa so im told said lady thicknesse bythebye i didnt expect to find sir bridgnorth here i owe the pleasure of his company entirely to your ladyship said mrs calverley had he not expected to meet you i am certain he would not have come you flatter me said her ladyship evidently pleased when i beheld you together on the lawn this evening pursued mrs calverley and especially when i saw you together in the dance i was rejoiced that the meeting had taken place as i knew how it must end and now good night and pleasant dreams teresa entered her own room in a very lively mood and continued so as long as laura stayed with her and diverted her with her chat the ladysmaid had nothing but what was satisfactory to say of lord courland he had produced a most agreeable impression upon the household and his goodnatured deportment in the dance had carried all the suffrages in his favour even old norris is pleased with him said laura and if tomorrow goes off as well as today everybody will be enthusiastic do you think we shall have another dance maam monsieur zephyrus is so anxious to try the polka with me i said id ask you we shall see replied mrs calverley i cant make any promises i hope youre not falling in love with zephyrus laura i thought he seemed very attentive to you there was nothing particular about him i assure you maam replied laura its his way but you seemed to encourage him well theres no choice between him and tom tankard and i cant bear that forward young man would you believe it maam the vain little fool flatters himself you are struck by his appearance i think him a most ridiculous object said mrs calverley but now before you go i have an order to give you and i wish particular attention paid to it should mr carteret come tomorrow morning i wish him to be shown at once to my cabinet it shall be done maam depend upon it replied laura who thereupon withdrew xiv how mrs calverley passed the night until lately it had not been teresas custom to fasten her chamber door but as soon as laura was gone she locked it and the dressingroom door as well she then sought for the phial of poison and placed it on a small table near her bed why she did this she could scarcely tell probably she felt that if an impulse of selfdestruction assailed her during the night she would yield to it and get rid of the ceaseless mental torture she endured though all had gone well since lord courlands arrival she had been greatly alarmed by some remarks he had made and had vainly endeavoured to tranquillise herself by thinking that the difficulties and dangers that beset her could be easily overcome now she was left alone she saw the folly of such reasoning she felt that her marriage project could only be accomplished by the commission of another crime lord courland had given her several hints that convinced her he would claim the fulfilment of her promise and how could she fulfil it if mildred were not removed but the contemplation of this crime awakened such horror in her breast that sleep fled and her thoughts drove her almost distracted unable to rest she arose wrapped herself in a dressinggown and sat down trying to calm her thoughts but in vain a lamp burning on the table on which the phial was placed kept that terrible object constantly before her and seemed to prompt her to have recourse to it being long past midnight it was to be supposed that all the inmates of the mansion except herself were buried in slumber but the restless woman felt sure she heard footsteps in the gallery outside who could be there at that hour she was not left long in doubt a tap was heard at the door and to her inquiry who was there a voice answered rose everything alarmed her now and even this visit terrified her but after a moments delay she opened the door and saw rose in a robe de chambre belonging to one of the young ladies and holding a taper in her hand pardon me for disturbing you madam she said but miss calverley has been taken suddenly ill and is very faint and miss barfleur has sent me to you for some salvolatile or some other stimulant to revive her on hearing this an infernal idea crossed teresa give her three or four drops of eau de luce from this phial said teresa giving her the poison i have just taken that quantity myself for i have not felt well tonight not more than four drops mind be very particular and when you have given her the dose bring back the phial to me wont you give it to her yourself maam said rose no i would rather not leave my room replied teresa lose no time the spirit of darkness has aided me cried teresa as rose departed on her terrible errand the deed will now be done though not many minutes elapsed before rose returned it seemed a century to teresa she could scarcely restrain herself from going to the room occupied by the victim at length rose reappeared bringing the phial with her teresa received it with trembling fingers has she taken the drops inquired teresa in a scarcely articulate voice she has replied rose she was very unwilling to take them but miss barfleur and myself persuaded her you did right observed teresa she will be well before morning i hope so said rose but you look very ill yourself maam i am ill replied teresa but dont mind me go back to miss calverley i hope i shall now get some sleep as soon as rose was gone teresa again locked the door amid the turmoil of thoughts that agitated her she preserved a sort of calm that enabled her to go through the business she had to do without a moments loss of time she unfastened the dressingbox replaced the bottle of poison took out another phial resembling it and really containing eau de luce and then made all secure again this done she drank a very small portion from the phial and placed it where the poison had stood before seeking her couch she unlocked both her doors judging it best to manifest no uneasiness did she sleep how are we to account for it she had scarcely laid her head on the pillow than she fell into a deep sound slumber that was not disturbed by a dream and that lasted till daybreak xv how doctor spencer was sent for little did the many guests staying at ouselcroft imagine what had occurred during the night they slept on undisturbed by any idea that a direful deed was being enacted in an adjoining chamber roses nocturnal visit to mrs calverley was heard by no one and since then all had been tranquil was mildred better was she sleeping at all events those with her were quiet thus when the large establishment arose at an early hour for they had an unusually busy day before them no alarm whatever had been given no report was brought downstairs that miss calverley had been taken ill during the night but the housemaids were bustling about and getting the rooms ready for the guests who might be expected to make their appearance some two or three hours later rose had promised harry netterville overnight that she would meet him in the garden at six oclock and they would have a stroll together but though the morning was charming the young damsel did not make her appearance greatly to harrys disappointment monsieur zephyrus was more fortunate laura had engaged to meet him at the same early hour and she was true to her appointment she must have been up soon after it was light for she had evidently spent some time over her toilette zephyrus was enraptured by her costume and looks and paid her many highflown compliments in french the import of which she understood undoubtedly she looked very captivating the amorous pair did not remain long on the lawn though they met there but sought a retired walk they had not however proceeded far when they saw another couple advancing towards them whom they instantly recognised as tom tankard and clarissa salutations were exchanged in the most approved style praises bestowed on the beauty of the morning and on the delightful singing of the birds and they were about to separate when laura thought proper to give tom a friendly caution if you dont want to meet your father she said i advise you to keep clear of the lawn hes there with mr higgins and our old butler mr norris since thats the case well turn back if you please miss clarissa my guvnors an odd sort of man and he dont like my paying attention to young ladies clarissa who was very goodnatured did not mind which way she went so laura suggested they should walk together to the fishponds which were about half a mile distant and they set off in that direction amongst those who were early astir on that fine morning and who had come forth into the garden was chetwynd of course he know nothing that had happened during the night but a strange foreboding of ill oppressed him he found old tankard and higgins on the lawn and after a brief converse with them he was proceeding to the stables when norris came up and begged to have a word with him and they went into the library together i am going to ask you a singular question sir said the old butler and i will explain my motive for doing so presently do you think this marriage with mrs calverley and lord courland will really take place i believe it will norris replied chetwynd i see nothing to prevent it i dont know whether all the preliminary arrangements are settled but his lordship appears perfectly satisfied and so he ought to be if what i hear is true it will be more advantageous to you than to him said norris i dont understand you rejoined chetwynd regarding him fixedly when i say advantageous to you sir i mean to your sister observed the butler but it cannot fail to be beneficial to you you ought to pray that the marriage may take place instead of opposing it what the deuce are you driving at norris it appears to me sir that you have never read your fathers will you are right i have not but i know that the property is left entirely to his wife very true sirvery true but there is a most important proviso of which you are evidently ignorant in the event of the widow marrying again she forfeits the property which then goes to the testators daughter mildred are you sure of this norris cried chetwynd astounded quite sure sir replied the old butler i have read the will myself most carefully as i have already said the best thing that can happen to you is that your stepmother should marry again but will she make this sacrifice i fear not can she be aware of the proviso you have mentioned norris impossible to say rejoined the old butler i should think so she has the will in her possession i do not see how it can fail to act as a bar to a second marriage unless she comes to some arrangement with miss mildred that she will never do said chetwynd my sister i am certain will never surrender her rights to her has the matter been broached to miss mildred inquired norris impossible or i should have heard of it then nothing is left mrs calverley but to break off the match and that is the point from which i started said norris it is incomprehensible she should have allowed the affair to proceed so far said chetwynd i am altogether perplexed but i will have an early interview with my sister this morning and hear what she has to say something must be done forthwith she cannot give a tacit assent to the arrangement at this moment rose hartley appeared at the open window and chetwynd called her in i was looking for you sir said rose who appeared very anxious i came to tell you miss calverley is very ill indeed exclaimed chetwynd surprised and alarmed she was taken ill in the night with a renewal of the attack she experienced the other day at brackley but recovered for a time and obtained some hours sleep but she is worse again this morning what ails her asked chetwynd i can scarcely describe her illness but she suffers a great deal of pain i think she ought to have immediate advice she shall replied chetwynd i should wish to see her myself not now sir later on has mrs calverley seen her he asked eagerly no sir but she sent her some eau de luce by me some eau de luce yes sir i knocked at her chamber door in the middle of the night and she gave me a small bottle that was standing by her bedside miss calverley only took a few drops of it quite enough i should think muttered norris well dont give her any more at present said chetwynd i havent got any more to give her replied rose i took back the phial mark that sir observed norris why mark it inquired rose never mind him said chetwynd go back to my sister at once and remain with her till doctor spencer arrives dont give her anything more and dont let mrs calverley come near her if you can help it mind that said norris emphatically rose looked at him but made no remark tell her i have something to say to her and must see her this morning but dont make her uneasy said chetwynd i suppose miss barfleur is with her yes you may be sure she wont leave her sir replied rose your message shall be delivered to your sister and your instructions attended to as soon as rose was gone norris could no longer contain himself here we have it as plain as possible sir he cried the sole bar to the marriage is to be removed dont you see it sir i do plainly enough how else should she fall suddenly ill just at this time whatever you may think norris and however difficult you may find it to do so i insist upon it that you hold your tongue said chetwynd authoritatively if you disobey me youll ever afterwards lose my favour now go and send for doctor spencer at once and leave the rest to me dont fear me sir said norris ill keep silence as long as you enjoin me and he proceeded to the stables and sent off a mounted groom for doctor spencer xvi chetwynd makes communication to sir bridgnorth chetwynd was pacing to and fro on the lawn occupied with painful and distracting thoughts and scarcely knowing what course to pursue when he was joined by sir bridgnorth charlton who saw he was greatly disturbed and kindly inquired what was the matter chetwynd found it somewhat difficult to explain as he did not desire for the present to enter into details but he mentioned that his sister had been taken ill during the night and was still rather seriously indisposed this was quite sufficient to account for his anxious looks however chetwynd desired to consult his friend and therefore said to him i have a communication to make to you dear sir bridgnorth which i am convinced will give you great surprise and very likely induce you to take a totally different view of certain matters now before you my sister and myself have hitherto been completely in the dark in regard to a very important provision of my fathers will indeed exclaimed the baronet i should not have conceived that possible what is it pray from examination of the will it appears that if mrs calverley marries again the whole of the property bequeathed her by my father goes to mildred now indeed you surprise me exclaimed the baronet and is it possible this very important proviso has only just been discovered such negligence is inconceivable the proviso cannot i think have been known to mrs calverley or she would not have proceeded so far with her present matrimonial arrangements but whether known to her or not it is the fact now comes the important questiondoes she mean to marry lord courland i have no doubt of it replied sir bridgnorth unless prevented she will marry him most assuredly then she will forfeit her property besides she can make no settlement upon him yes she has property of her own she can settle that true but will that be sufficient i cannot say replied sir bridgnorth i am not in lord courlands confidence as yet i dont think his lordship has been let into the secret nor is it desirable he should be he must look after his own affairs it is not your business to prevent the marriage but to forward it if mrs calverley does not choose to tell her noble suitor how she is circumstanced that is her own concern she is a very clever woman and can take care of herself i should not have thought her capable of making such a sacrifice as this for any man but she seems to be really in love with lord courland or perhaps she is resolved at whatever cost to make an important match at any rate her scheme must not be thwarted not unless it should turn out to be mischievous observed chetwynd it cannot be mischievous to mildred said sir bridgnorth lord courland probably will be disappointed when he finds the property pass away from him but that will be the worst that can happen and if his lordship is a loser charles danvers will be an immense gainer how oddly things turn out after all charles may become master of ouselcroft in right of his wife ah here he comes he added as the captain made his appearance i wish i could tell him what a brilliant prospect he has before him but i musnt well are you laying out your plans for the day said captain danvers as he came up no we were talking about you replied sir bridgnorth i was wishing you might be able to reside here ah thats out of the question now rejoined the captain its a charming place but i fancy both chetwynd and myself shall soon be shut out of it lord courland is certain to make a great change and bring in a new set if i had been master here my aim would have been to keep my old friends about me chetwynd should always have had his room and old norris should have remained in his place im glad to hear you say so remarked sir bridgnorth im certain mr calverley never meant his property to be disposed of in this fashion its a great pity half didnt go to mildred ay it ought to have been divided between chetwynd and his sister that would have been the right thing to do now mildred is not even to marry except with her stepmothers consent you need have no uneasiness on that score remarked chetwynd mildred will have her marriage portion and something besides you think so said captain danvers ill answer for it rejoined chetwynd and if you require an additional guarantee im ready to give it said sir bridgnorth but mind should you ever come to be master here i shall hold you to your promise to make us all at home you shant need to remind me of it should that fortunate day ever arrive said the captain at that moment the person who seemed to stand most in the captains way came forth and wished them good morning they all fancied he assumed a little of the air of the master of the house i must consult you on a little matter after breakfast sir bridgnorth he said i know you are a man of great taste it strikes me some alterations might be made in the garden i hope your lordship wont touch the lawn remarked sir bridgnorth it is very much admired the lawn itself is charming said lord courland but i dont like those two sombre cedars they were my fathers especial favourites observed chetwynd i hope your lordship will spare them i should consider it a sacrilege to remove them said sir bridgnorth i dont carry my veneration for trees quite so far rejoined lord courland and as i have no particular associations connected with the two cedars i shall merely consider whether my lawn cannot be improved my lawn whispered chetwynd to captain danvers he is master here already i will get you to walk round with me presently sir bridgnorth said lord courland and favour me with your opinion on the general arrangements if i may venture to give your lordship my opinion without walking round replied sir bridgnorth i would strongly advise you to let the gardens and grounds alone it is allowed to be one of the prettiest places in the country and i should be sorry if it was destroyed but i dont mean to destroy the place i desire to improve it such improvements as your lordship contemplates i fear would destroy its character said sir bridgnorth and that is what i should regret just then the breakfast bell put an end to the discourse and attracted the party to the house xvii doctor spencer lady thicknesse and scrope danvers were in the breakfastroom when the others came in and her ladyship said to them i am very sorry mrs calverley will not be able to make her appearance at breakfast this morning i hope she is not unwell remarked lord courland she is not very well replied her ladyship but she wishes to confer with doctor spencer he has been sent for to attend miss calverley who has been taken ill during the night indeed exclaimed captain danvers anxiously she seemed quite well and in excellent spirits last evening perhaps she took cold observed lady thicknesse i fear we remained out rather too late only think of my dancing sir roger de coverley in the open air if i had been laid up like mildred you would have been to blame she added to sir bridgnorth but your ladyship is looking better than ever he rejoined gallantly you ought therefore to thank me well i dont think im the worse for it and i certainly enjoyed the dance very much breakfast was then served and lady thicknesse presided at the table she took care to have sir bridgnorth beside her and they seemed the most cheerful persons present for the absence of the three other ladies cast a gloom over the rest of the party meanwhile doctor spencer was with mrs calverley in her dressingroom she having given orders that he should be brought there immediately on his arrival an elderly man with white hair jetty eyebrows and black eyes the expression of his countenance was kindly and composed his accents agreeable and his manner singularly pleasing all his patients liked him mrs calverley had been a great favourite with the doctor and he had hitherto had a very high opinion of her founded not only upon his own notion of her character but on the praises bestowed upon her by her late husband she thought his manner less cordial than it used to be but she was so troubled she could scarcely judge i am very sorry miss calverley is ill he said taking a seat what is the matter with her i cant exactly tell she rejoined i have not yet seen her this morning we were all dancing on the lawn rather late last evening and she may have taken cold dancing on the lawn exclaimed doctor spencer shaking his head that was imprudent mildred is delicate she has got a chill i suppose i cant tell her maid came to me in the middle of the night and said miss calverley felt very sick and ill so i sent her a restorative she took a few drops of eau de luce as i understood and i thought she was better for i heard nothing more till the morning when i learnt that the sickness was not gone so i sent for you during this explanation doctor spencer kept his eye fixed on mrs calverley in a manner she did not like this is not a feverish cold as i thought he observed but i shall be better able to judge when i see her emmeline barfleur and their maid occupy the same room with her so she has had plenty of attendance i should have gone to her if she had been alone at this moment a tap was heard at the door and emmeline came in she looked very much frightened and said hastily pray come and see miss calverley at once doctor spencer she has just fainted doctor spencer instantly prepared to obey take these restoratives with you said mrs calverley giving him several small bottles and come back to me when you have seen her i will replied the doctor as he followed emmeline some little time elapsed before doctor spencer appeared again to the guilty woman who awaited her sentence it was an interval of intense anxiety but she endeavoured to maintain her calmness fearing to betray herself thinking she ought to be employed she sat down to write a letter but had not got very far with it when doctor spencer came into the room closing the door after him he fixed a strange and searching glance upon her and so terrified her by his looks that she could not speak nor did he break the silence at length she gave utterance to these words i am afraid you bring bad news doctor is she seriously ill she is he replied sternly but i think i shall be able to save her what ails her inquired mrs calverley have you no idea none whatever she replied looking perplexed poison has been administered to her impossible she exclaimed i cannot be deceived said doctor spencer the attempt has been twice made in each instance the dose was fortunately too small to be fatal the slight nervous tremour that agitated mrs calverley was not unnoticed by the doctor this is a terrible accusation to make she said but it can be easily substantiated he rejoined indeed it would be difficult to conceal the evidence of the crime on whom do your suspicions alight doctor asked mrs calverley as firmly as she could on any one in attendance upon her one of them has been an unconscious instrument he replied but the hand that really provided the poison was elsewhere after a short pause he added in a stern tone madam yours is the hand by which the deed has been done mine she exclaimed fiercely and defiantly nay it is useless to deny it he rejoined i have but to search this chamber to find proof of your guilt search it then she cried in the same defiant tone doctor spencer glanced around and his eye quickly alighted upon the dressingbox open this box he cried seizing her hand and drawing her towards it open it i say he reiterated in a terrible voice there the poison is concealed so overpowered was she by his determined manner that she did not dare to disobey without offering the slightest resistance she unlocked the box and disclosed the casket he uttered a cry of satisfaction on beholding it now unlock this he said giving her the casket again she obeyed but instantly took forth a phial containing the poison and would have swallowed its contents had not doctor spencer snatched it from her why do you treat me thus cruelly she cried why not let me die because i desire to give you a chance of life he rejoined if your intended victim escapes the fate you designed her i will not denounce you if she dies you know your doom do you think she will live asked teresa her life hangs on a thread but a few daysperhaps a few hourswill decide for the present i will keep your terrible secret and screen you from suspicion but only on the condition that you remain here and abide the result of your dreadful crime attempt to fly and i will instantly check you now you know my fixed determination and you will remain in constant attendance on mildred she asked i shall he replied and rest assured i shall do my best to save her with this he left the room taking the phial with him xviii doctor spencer has an interview with chetwynd while the terrible scene just described was taking place upstairs chetwynd had quitted the breakfasttable and repaired to the library where he proposed to have an interview with doctor spencer after the latter had seen mildred he subsequently learnt from norris that the butler had had a private conference with the doctor on his arrival and had given him some information that would serve to guide him in his proceedings chetwynd thought the doctor a long time in coming down and when at last he entered the library the young man did not augur very well from his looks i am afraid you find my sister worse than you expected doctor he said she is in a very precarious state replied doctor spencer still i hope to save her life then assuming a different manner he added i had better mention at once that norris has made certain disclosures to me the truth of which i have just ascertained you are satisfied then that an attempt has been made to poison my sister i am replied the doctor by her stepmother by mrs calverley i have discovered the poison in her room and have it now in my possession then what should prevent us from instantly delivering her up to justice no pity ought to be shown her i think differently said the doctor i have promised that if i can save your sisters lifeas i hope i canher own shall be spared she does not deserve such consideration cried chetwynd perhaps you will think differently said the doctor calmly when i tell you that it is your sisters wish that she should be spared for a life of penitence the dear girl entreated me so earnestly to screen her intended murderess that i consented chetwynd was deeply moved mildred is an angel of goodness he exclaimed in a voice half suffocated by emotion you would say so if you had seen her as i have done said the doctor no one could be more gentle and patient though she suffers much and she is perfectly resigned to her fate whatever it may be but she desires spiritual counsel and miss barfleur has written to mr massey the chaplain of brackley requesting him to come to her forthwith and it is certain he will promptly obey the summons under such painful and peculiar circumstances and where it is necessary that secrecy should be observed no better man could be found than mr massey i am certain of it said chetwynd i have had experience of his goodness he is as judicious and discreet as he is strict in his religious duties i must now go said the doctor but i shall return again ere long i need not say more to you about the necessity of attending to your sisters wishes should she be disturbed or excited i will not answer for her life i have already cautioned norris and i think he will attend to my injunctions i will also speak to him said chetwynd but you need not fear any indiscretion on his part since you have made him aware of my sisters wishes he will attend to themfor he is strongly attached to her though he detests mrs calverley unluckily the house is full of company and you are also i conclude aware under what circumstances lord courland is invited yes i understand that a matrimonial arrangement has been all but concluded between his lordship and mrs calverley it is idle to speculate as to what will now be the result but i counsel you in no way to interfere impossible you can do so without some explanation which cannot now be given your sisters wishes ought to be your paramount consideration with this injunction the doctor took his departure xix what passed between lord courland and mr carteret lord courland was in the drawingroom after breakfast amusing himself as well as he could and hoping mrs calverley would soon make her appearance and dispel his ennui when norris brought him a message from mr carteret who said that if perfectly convenient to his lordship he should be glad to see him for a few minutes lord courland was delighted he was aware that mr carteret was mrs calverleys lawyer and was particularly anxious to have a little conversation with him ill come to him at once he said where is he ill take your lordship to him replied the butler and he conducted him to the cabinet in which as we have explained mrs calverley was wont to transact her private business mr carteret was alone and bowed very respectfully as his lordship entered after a little preliminary discourse lord courland remarked in a very easy tone as if everything was satisfactorily settled i hope we shall be able to complete our arrangements mr carteret i hope so my lord replied the solicitor but i am desired by mrs calverley to offer you some explanation as she fears there has been a slight misunderstanding on your lordships part it is always better these affairs should be arranged by professional men who dont hesitate to ask each other questions i thought there were no questions to ask said lord courland rather surprised everything appeared clear so it seemed but i find on conferring with mrs calverley that she was under a misapprehension as to her power what do you mean sir cried his lordship quickly if i am rightly informed she has absolute control over her late husbands property she has so now my lord replied the solicitor you dont mean to insinuate that she forfeits the property in case she marries again cried his lordship in dismay that is precisely her position my lord replied mr carteret calmly the property will go to her stepdaughter miss mildred calverley why was i not informed of this before cried lord courland looking very angry it is on this point that i desire to offer your lordship an explanation said the solicitor until mrs calverley conferred with me about the settlement she was quite unaware of her ability to make one this is incredible sir cried lord courland i shall make no remarks but it is useless to proceed with the business your lordship seems to form a very unjust and improper opinion of my client said mr carteret she was greatly distressed when she made the discovery i have mentionedbut more on your lordships account than on her own though she will lose this large property she can still settle fifteen hundred a year on your lordship and has instructed me to say that she will do so i do not feel inclined to accept it sir replied lord courland haughtily then i am to understand that the match is broken off it is replied lord courland in the same haughty tone permit me then to remark on my own part said mr carteret that i think mrs calverley is much better off with her large property than with a title i will communicate your decision to her i have the honour to wish your lordship a good morning and he quitted the cabinet xx the parting between teresa and lord courland left alone lord courland did not feel by any means satisfied with what he had done he was really in love with mrs calverley and now that he seemed likely to lose her his passion revived in all its force he had made certain of a large fortune and vexation at his disappointment had carried him farther than he intended it was disagreeable to lose so charming a place as ouselcroft and such a splendid income as he had been promised but it was far more disagreeable to loose the object of his affections moreover fifteen hundred a year though it would not bear comparison with five thousand was not to be despised altogether he blamed himself for his precipitancy and resolved if possible to set matters right with this determination he was about to quit the cabinet when teresa made her appearance she looked exceedingly pale and ill and thinking he was the cause of her suffering he felt inclined to throw himself at her feet and entreat forgiveness but she checked him by her manner which was totally changed and almost freezingly cold i have learnt your decision my lord she said in accents devoid of emotion and entirely approve of it i would not have it otherwise but i was wrong dearest teresa he cried i retract all i have said and pray you to forgive me i will take you without fortune i cannot live without you a melancholy smile played upon her pallid features would i had known this before she said but it is now too late why too late he exclaimed despairingly i have told you i will take you as you are do as you please with your own i will ask nothing alas she exclaimed sadly i repeat it is now too late i cannot wed you lord courland uttered a cry of anguish not wed me he ejaculated what hindrance is there to our union that did not exist before pardon me sweet teresa i feel i have deeply offended you by my apparent selfishness but i will try to make amends i am sure you love me i do she replied earnestly and with a look of inexpressible tenderness you are the only person i have ever lovednot for your rank but for yourself had i been fortunate enough to wed you i should have been happyhappier than i deserve to be not than you deserve to be dearest teresa yes she replied in accents of bitterest selfreproach i have no right to expect happiness what is the meaning of this he exclaimed regarding her in astonishment do not question me she replied some time or other you will understand me i merely came to tell you it is best that we should part and therefore i approve of your decision as conveyed to me by mr carteret but i recall it he cried think no more of it sweetest teresa again i say it is too late she rejoined in a sombre tone it is idle to prolong this discourse which can lead to nothing farewell do you then bid me depart i do not bid you but we cannot meet again if so it would be useless to stay but you will think differently when you become calmer you mistake she said i was never calmer than now had i not felt so i would not have seen you but the parting moment is come again farewell and with a look that remained for ever graven on his memory she disappeared bewildered as if he had been in a troubled dream lord courland remained for some time in the cabinet seriously reproaching himself with having caused the mental malady with which he thought teresa had become suddenly afflicted he then went downstairs intending to consult lady thicknesse but found she had gone to brackley hall with sir bridgnorth charlton who had driven her thither in his phaeton however as his lordship could not rest in his present anxious and excited state he determined to follow her and explaining his difficulty to scrope though without entering into particulars the latter offered to accompany him and they went at once to the stables to procure horses xxi how mrs calverley made her will on returning to her dressingroom after the painful interview with lord courland mrs calverley sat down for a few minutes to collect herself and then taking a large sheet of paper from a drawer began to write out a formal document she pursued her task without intermission for more than half an hour and then having completed it rang the bell for laura shall i bring your breakfast maam asked the ladysmaid no i do not require any breakfast replied mrs calverley let me persuade you to take some maam you look very ill i am too busy just now rejoined mrs calverley beg mr carteret to come to me you will find him in the library i also wish to see mr higgins request him to come up to me in about five minutesnot before i understand maam stay cried mrs calverley i have several letters to write and shall not want you if you like you can drive to brackley in the ponycarriage oh thank you maam may i take monsieur zephyrus with me monsieur zephyrus and anybody else you like you neednt take the groom laura departed full of glee shortly afterwards the attorney made his appearance pray sit down sir she said i wish you to read this document why you have been making your will i perceive he cried as he took the paper will it suffice she asked briefly it seems to me from a hasty glance that it will answer perfectly he replied but we will go through it you divide your property equally i find between chetwynd and mildred quite right but i do not approve of the bequest of five thousand pounds to lord courland however i suppose it must stand it must she observed in a peremptory tone mr carteret then went on i am much pleased that you have remembered your late husbands old servant john norris the faithful fellow well deserves the thousand pounds you are good enough to leave him i also observe that you have made several minor bequests and have not forgotten your attendant laura martin i believe laura is attached to me remarked mrs calverley i have no doubt of it said mr carteret as executors i see you have appointed sir bridgnorth charlton and chetwynd with a legacy to the former of a thousand pounds no appointment could be more judicious the will requires no alteration i wish to execute it at once said mrs calverley in that case we shall require another witness we cannot have norris since he is a legatee i have provided for that said mrs calverley and have told laura to send up lady thicknesses butler higgins he may be without i will see replied carteret finding higgins at the door he explained the business to him and brought him in the butler bowed respectfully and seemed greatly struck by mrs calverleys changed appearance but he made no remark i want you to witness my will mr higgins she said i am ready to do so maam he replied but i would rather witness any other document the attorney then placed the will before mrs calverley and she executed it with a firm handthe two witnesses duly attesting her signature this done higgins was about to depart when mrs calverley gave him a purse that was lying on the table this is far more than i desire or deserve maam he said with a grateful bow but i trust you may live many and many a year and make half a dozen more wills i do not think i shall she murmured faintly with another profound bow higgins retired all is now finished madam said carteret shall i take charge of the will no leave it with me she rejoined seeing she did not desire to say more the attorney hastened to depart she remained sitting firmly upright till he was gone and then sank backwards xxii chetwynd is summoned to his sisters room and is sent by her to teresatheir interview meanwhile chetwynd had been summoned by rose and a very touching spectacle met his gaze as he entered his sisters chamber near the couch on which mildred was lying looking the very image of death sat mr massey before him on a small table was the sacred volume from which he had been reading and he was offering up a prayer for the preservation of the sick girl kneeling by the bedside and joining fervently in the prayer was emmeline with the appearance of the venerable divinehis silver locks and benignant aspectthe reader is already familiar but his features now wore a saddened and anxious expression he was really alarmed by mildreds state and scarcely thought it possible she could survive chetwynd and rose had entered so noiselessly that they did not disturb the others and good mr massey continued his prayer quiet unconscious he had other hearers except those close at hand at length he ceased and chetwynd advanced and bending reverently to the good chaplain took his sisters hand hitherto she had not perceived him but a smile now lighted up her pallid features and she murmured his name on hearing his approach emmeline rose from her kneeling posture i am glad you are come dear chetwynd said mildred i was afraid i might not behold you again i would have come before had i thought you desired to see me dearest sister he replied but how do you feel somewhat better she replied mr masseys consolatory words have done me as much good as the medicines i have takenmore perhaps doctor spencer tells me i shall recover and i have great faith in him trust only in heaven dear daughter observed mr massey who did not wish her to delude herself i hope i am now prepared she said in a tone of perfect resignation i shall quit this world without regret a frame of mind attained by fewbut the best said the chaplain here emmeline could not restrain her tears and rose sobbed audibly i will retire for awhile dear daughter said the good chaplain rising you may have something to say to your brother and he moved to a little distance with rose what would you with me dearest sister asked chetwynd any injunctions you may give me shall be strictly fulfilled i wish to see mrs calverley she said better not he replied i think so too added emmeline her presence will only disturb you i must see her before i die said mildred bring her to me if you can she is in her own room chetwynd made no further remonstrance but proceeding to mrs calverleys chamber which was on the same floor and at no great distance tapped at the dressingroom door a faint voice bade him come in he found teresa lying back in the chair as last described and was quite shocked by her appearance what brings you here chetwynd she asked has mr carteret sent you no he replied i have come to tell you that mildred desires greatly to see you i am unable to move as you perceive or i would go to her what does she desire to say to me any question you may ask me in her name i will answer in her name then i ask youas you will have to answer at the bar of the divine tribunalhave you endeavoured to take away her life by poison the wretched woman made an effort to speak but her power of utterance completely failed her since you do not deny the charge i hold you guilty he said i am guilty she replied the attempt has been twice made twice ejaculated chetwynd had you no pity on her none replied teresa my heart was hardened she stood in my way and i did not hesitate to remove her horrible exclaimed chetwynd but your murderous design has failed she will recover you may not believe me when i tell you i am glad to hear it replied teresa nevertheless it is so the infernal fire that burnt for a time so fiercely in my breast is extinguished i had listened to the promptings of the evil one and bartered my soul to him for worldly gain that will profit me nothing if i could i would pray for mildreds recovery but heaven would not listen to me you cannot judge of the extent of heavens mercy if your repentance is sincere you may be forgiven alas i have sinned too deeply i have no hope for the future but i have striven to make atonement for my crimes atonementin what way demanded chetwynd by restoring the whole of the property i have wrongfully taken from you and your sister there is my will she added pointing to it when you examine it you will see what i have done and i trust you will be satisfied chetwynd stared at her in astonishment almost doubting whether he heard aright convince yourself that i have spoken the truth she said chetwynd opened the will and glanced at its contents she kept her eye fixed upon him as he did so i see it is in your own handwriting he remarked but do you perceive that i have left my entire property excepting certain bequests to yourself and mildred i do he replied do you likewise notice that i have appointed you and your friend sir bridgnorth charlton joint executors of my will i do are you satisfied he made no reply you do not answer you have deceived me often and may be deceiving me now he rejoined she uttered something like a groan and then said i cannot blame your incredulity but keep the willkeep it securely it will soon come into operation i cannot misunderstand the dark hint you have just thrown out cried chetwynd you have swallowed poison seek to know no more she rejoined you had best remain in ignorance instant assistance must be obtained he cried you must not die thus nothing will save me she replied do you refuse spiritual aid he cried good mr massey is with mildred will you see him i will she rejoined send him to mesend him quickly or it may be too late chetwynd hastily departed but in a very short space of time returned with the chaplain mr massey had been told why he was summoned and regarded the dying woman with profound compassion being greatly touched by her appearance we must be alone and undisturbed he said to chetwynd i will keep watch outside replied the other no one shall enter and with a pitying look at teresa he quitted the room xxiii sir bridgnorth proposes to lady thicknesse and is accepted on that morning as previously intimated sir bridgnorth charlton had offered to drive lady thicknesse to brackley hall and as mrs calverley did not make her appearance and no other arrangements were made in consequence of mildreds illness she accepted the proposal with delight secretly hoping that a proposal of another kind might follow her ostensible purpose was to spend the day with her sister lady barfleur and return to dinner everything promised well the weather was propitious and as sir bridgnorth assisted her to her place in front of his wellappointed and wellhorsed mailphaeton he squeezed her hand in a manner that seemed to proclaim his intentions but his deportment and discourse when they had started on the drive left her in no doubt he lowered his voice and bent down his head when he addressed her so that what he said could not be overheard by the two grooms behind for an elderly gentleman he acted the part of a suitor very creditably if his looks were not impassioned his manner was devoted lady thicknesse was pleased and with good reason for the match if it took place would be satisfactory in all inspects a better parti than sir bridgnorth could not be found he had the recommendation of an excellent social position rank and wealth moreover he was extremely good tempered though somewhat of an invalid lady thicknesse was a most charming companion and a great deal more amiable than socalled charming people usually are besides being very rich very well bred and very agreeable she had a special recommendation to sir bridgnorthshe had no family he had resolved never to marry a widow with incumbrances lady thicknesse looked remarkably well that morning her pale and delicate complexion was a little warmer than usual and her eyes rather brighter but she was not in high spirits indeed she never was in high spirits her manner being always subdued she questioned sir bridgnorth about charlton and seemed delighted with his description of the place i hope you will see it ere long he said with a peculiar smile that made her heart flutter and caused her to cast down her eyes now seemed sir bridgnorths opportunity after clearing his throat he remarked it appears to me that such a residence as charlton with a large park attached to it and a house in belgravesquare would form a remarkably nice combination of town and country what does your ladyship think as a rule i am not very fond of the country she replied but i fancy i could be happy anywhere under certain circumstances under what circumstances he asked bending down his head dont ask she replied avoiding his ardent gaze but i am particularly anxious to know he said my own happiness being dependent upon the answer could you contrive to spend six months at such a dull place as charlton yes very well she replied raising her eyes and looking him full in the face provided you will agree to pass the other six months in belgrave square sir bridgnorth could scarcely believe what he heard is that a bargain he exclaimed joyously if so let us conclude it at once with all my heart she replied i am quite satisfied with the arrangement and i ought to be and am said sir bridgnorth i am sure i have got the best of it you say so now she rejoined with a smile but you may alter your opinion after six months experience of belgrave square never he exclaimed my only fear is that your ladyship may get tired of charlton then dismiss that apprehension she rejoined i cannot feel ennui if you are there just then the clatter of hoofs was heard behind them and the baronets spirited horses startled by the sound set off at a pace that gave her ladyship a momentary fright but the runaways were quickly checked and sir bridgnorth looking round saw that lord courland and scrope danvers were galloping after them what the deuce is the matter he shouted nothing replied scrope then take it quietly said the baronet my horses wont stand that noise thereupon the pace was slackened on both sides and lady thicknesse asked lord courland if he was going to brackley i hope you are she added my sister lady barfleur will be charmed to see your lordship i want to consult your ladyship he replied bringing his horse as close to her as he could and speaking in a low voice i hope nothing has gone wrong she inquired rendered rather uneasy by his looks im very much afraid the match wont come off he replied unless your ladyship will kindly act for me i will do anything you desire she rejoined earnestly it would grieve me beyond measure if any contretemps occurred i cannot explain matters fully at this moment he said but it is certain i am entirely to blame since your lordship so frankly makes that admission she rejoined there can be no difficulty in arranging the quarrelfor quarrel i suppose it is i will tell you all when we get to brackley he said but meantime i may mention a circumstance of which i am quite sure neither your ladyship nor sir bridgworth are aware your lordship must speak in a lower tone if you would not have me hear all you say remarked the baronet but i do wish you to hear this rejoined lord courland mrs calverley has only just discovered that if she marries again the whole of her property goes to chetwynd and mildred you amaze me cried sir bridgnorth when this piece of information was first communicated to me by carteret continued his lordship i yielded to an impulse of anger for which i now reproach myself and declared i would break off the match i dont wonder at it said the baronet but when i subsequently had an interview with mrs calverley herself my purpose changed i found my affections were so strongly fixed i could not execute my threat i am delighted to hear it said lady thicknesse such disinterested conduct does your lordship the greatest credit then i presume all will go on as before i hope so he replied but i am in doubt mrs calverley seems quite firm in her determination to break off the engagement but she has nothing to complain of remarked sir bridgnorth on the contrary she is the sole cause of the misunderstanding i take a totally different view of the matter from your lordship and i suspect i am much nearer the truth if she is now resolved to break off the match it is because she is unwilling to lose her property oh pray dont put that unfair construction on her conduct exclaimed lady thicknesse it seems to me quite natural said sir bridgnorth quite consistent with her character he added in a whisper to lady thicknesse she seems very greatly troubled observed lord courland and if anything occurs in consequence i shall never forgive myself your lordship alarms yourself without reason i think said lady thicknesse you have not seen her this morning i suppose i have not she replied then you dont know how ill she looks i am very sorry to hear it replied lady thicknesse but she will soon get well again if the matter is settled as i am persuaded it will be i ought to tell you she has bidden me farewell said his lordship dont despair rejoined lady thicknesse ill undertake to bring you together again im sorry you didnt call me in at the time but its not too late now your ladyship gives me hopes said lord courland retiring if she marries as i trust she may observed sir bridgnorth as soon as his lordship was out of hearing it will be an immense thing for chetwynd and mildred but i doubt whether she will make such a sacrifice for lord courland i believe she is very much in love with him remarked lady thicknesse possibly said sir bridgnorth but this is too much to pay as to her being in ignorance of the contents of her late husbands will i never can credit that yet it puzzles me to conceive what she meant to do somehow or other her plan has failed your ladyship thinks the matter will be easily settled i am not of that opinion to tell you the truth dear sir bridgnorth said lady thicknesse i do feel rather uneasy about mrs calverley if your ladyship knew her as well as i do he replied in an indifferent tone you wouldnt feel uneasy at all my firm conviction is that she wont marry lord courland if she doesnt i shall alter my opinion of her said her ladyship sir bridgnorth smiled and giving his horses a slight touch with the whip he quickened their pace and the newly engaged pair soon arrived at brackley xxiv the race between zephyrus and tom tankard about a mile in the rear of sir bridgnorth was mrs calverleys ponycarriage driven by laura by whose side was zephyrus very smartly dressed indeed and wearing a paris hat while in the grooms place at the back and looking very like a groom himself sat tom tankard tom thought himself rather slighted by being placed in an inferior situation to the chef but he was obliged to submit or stay behind the first part of the drive was pleasant enough zephyrus was charmed with the carriage and the ponies and declared the equipage was as pretty as any to be seen in the bois de boulogne he was likewise enchanted with mademoiselle lauras skill as a whip and it was a gratification to him that tom tankard of whom he entertained a secret jealousy should be kept in the background but this latter circumstance together with lauras evident preference for zephyrus vexed tom and made him ready to pick a quarrel with the frenchman he soon grew very sullen and took no part in the conversation but this they did not mind they did not care for his company and laura only brought him because she didnt like to drive out alone with the frenchman precisely the reverse of tom and full of life and spirit zephyrus had something amusing to say about everything laura was quite enchanted never before had she enjoyed so pleasant a drive but then she had never before driven anybody except her mistress and the groom and she didnt condescend to talk to grooms when they reached the heath tom shook off his sulkiness and surveying the scene called out look here monsieur heres a famous place for a steeplechase a fine place indeed observed zephyrus i should say you could here have all the dangers you desire i wouldnt advise you to try the heath mr tom observed laura sir leycester barfleur lost his life in that dreadful quagmire but a capital footrace might be run on the hard turf said tom how say you monsieur shall we have a trial of speed half a mile for half a sovrin shall i run mademoiselle said zephyrus laura gave him a look as much as to say by all means youll beat him agreed cried zephyrus mademoiselle laura shall hold the stakes and decide so saying he placed a small piece of gold in her hand his example being followed by tom our mark shall be yonder tree said zephyrus pointing to the shattered oak near which the ladies had been robbed by the gipsies there and back asked tom there and back of course replied zephyrus before we start said tom let it be clearly understood whoever wins is to sit beside miss laura bon cried zephyrus i shall be certain to occupy that envied place not so certain rejoined tom with a knowing wink ready in a minute and in another minute off at a signal from laura who had great difficulty in holding in the ponies when the start was made there seemed very little doubt that the frenchman would win for he was extremely agile and ran far more lightly and fleetly than our fat friend tom but it soon appeared that young tankard intended some ruse for he was still more than a hundred yards from the oak and sixty or seventy behind zephyrus when he suddenly turned round and ran back as fast as he could zephyrus did not at first see what his opponent was about but the moment he did he likewise turned and set off after young tankard at such a pace that even then it seemed probable he would overtake him but by dint of extraordinary exertion tom managed to reach the ponycarriage in time to spring into the coveted seat beside laura just as the frenchman came up come out sir vociferated zephyrus youve lost lost the racebut won the seat rejoined tom with a triumphant laugh come out i insist cried the frenchman to prevent the conflict that seemed imminent laura interfered but she could not induce tom to surrender the seat so she tried to pacify zephyrus by giving him the stakes adding that they should soon be at brackley where a change could be made quietly matters being thus arranged though by no means to lauras satisfaction she drove on and had just entered the park when captain danvers dashed through the lodge gate and soon came up to them apparently surprised at the sight of laura he stopped for a moment to speak to her what are you doing here laura he inquired my mistress allowed me to drive the ponycarriage to brackley captain she replied rather quickly for she didnt like to be thus questioned and i brought these gentlemen with me but dont you know your mistress is dangerously ill cried the captain not the least idea of it i assure you captain or i shouldnt be here cried laura looking dreadfully frightened but ill go back immediately i dont think youll find her alive was the captains consolatory remark but you may be of some service what is it sir cried laura what is it captain danvers however paid no attention to the inquiry but dashed off as hard as he could to the hall its something terribleim sure of it said laura i feel ready to faint change places and ill drive you back said tom its lucky im here i dont know what i should have done without mr tom said laura as she took his seat and gave him the reins and whip dont lose any time i wont depend upon it rejoined tom the ribbons are in good hands now theyre in mine take my advice dear girl and dont make yourself uneasy till you get there time enough then alls for the best you see monsieur if you hadnt given up that place youd a been forced to give it up since you cant drive youre mistaken sir i can driveand very well too rejoined zephyrus but not so well as me said tom ill bring you to ouselcroft in no time he added to laura and he soon got the ponies into such a pace as they had never travelled before xxv captain danvers brings distressing news leaping from his steed in the courtyard of the old hall captain danvers inquired for lady thicknesse and learning that she was with lady barfleur in the drawingroom he hastened thither and found the two ladies in question with lord courland sir bridgnorth and his brother scrope his looks caused general consternation since all could perceive from them that some direful calamityhad happened lord courland rushed up to him and taking his hand said you bring us bad news im afraid captain danvers i do indeed my lord he replied in a sorrowful tone very painful news at these words the whole party gathered round him to whom does your bad news relate inquired lady thicknesse chiefly to mrs calverley he replied great heaven my worst fears are realised exclaimed lord courland in a voice of anguish and despair does she still live death would be a release in her present state replied captain danvers she has swallowed poison poison echoed several voices and i am the cause of this dreadful act cried lord courland calm yourself my lord i entreat you said captain danvers it is not exactly as you suppose that love for you has led this unhappy lady into the commission of a dreadful act is certain but the attempt at selfdestruction which no doubt will end fatally has been made solely to escape the consequences of her crime the whole assemblage listened in horror to what was said i will not ask you for any farther explanation cried lord courland unless you feel justified in giving it to me but you have made certain dark allusions that ought to be cleared up you charge mrs calverley whom i love dearly in spite of all with the commission of a dreadful crime to which she was instigated by love for me what has she done is it a secret no my lord replied captain danvers with great feeling it is perfectly well known at ouselcroft she has attempted to poison her stepdaughter mildred but what was the motive demanded lord courland to prevent mildred from profiting by her fathers will had she died before the projected marriage the property would have remained with teresa lord courland looked aghast there is every reason to hope mildred will recover pursued the captain doctor spencer is confident he can save her he cannot save mrs calverley because remedial measures were too long delayed a groan burst from lord courland pardon me lady barfleur he said turning to her if i quit you thus abruptly i know you will excuse it under the circumstances i shall return at once to ouselcroft i will go with you said scrope and they quitted the room together i am quite as agitated and distressed as his lordship observed lady thicknesse you must take me back sir bridgnorth i will order the horses at once he replied in a few minutes the phaeton shall be ready and he departed on the errand i grieve to leave thus dearest sister said lady thicknesse but it cannot be helped i know it cannot lady barfleur replied let me see you tomorrow but nobody has told me how emmeline is you neednt be uneasy about her dear aunt replied captain danvers through all this anxiety and trouble emmeline has kept up most wonderfully i saw rose her attendant not much more than an hour ago and she said her young mistress had scarcely suffered from a headache and now dear aunt i must take a hasty leave like the rest i shall return to ouselcroft to see the end of this sad business adieu shortly afterwards sir bridgnorth appeared at the door to give lady thicknesse notice that the phaeton was ready it is fortunate you have got sir bridgnorth with you sister observed lady barfleur he is one of the most sensible and most agreeable men i know i am glad to hear you say so sister replied lady thicknesse he proposed as he drove me here this morning and i accepted him bless me that is news cried lady barfleur come here dear sir bridgnorth she added signing to him i must have a word with you i have just heard something that has enchanted me you are made for each other now dont stop here a moment longer but take her to the carriage goodbye xxvi teresas confession alone with the dying teresa take comfort said the good chaplain regarding her with tenderness and compassion ease your breast by a full confession and then if your repentance is sincere doubt not heavens goodness and mercy our blessed saviour will not desert you on this teresa knelt down before him and though he strove to raise her she would not quit the humble posture prepare yourself for a dreadful relation reverend sir she said clasping her hands i had the best and kindest of husbands who studied my every wish and strove in every way to make me happy i persuaded him i was happy but i deceived him the yoke i had put on was unsupportable an evil spirit seemed to have taken possession of my breast i strove to dismiss the wicked thoughts that assailed me but they came back again and again and with greater force than before i had not a fault to find with my husbandhe was kindness itself yet i sought to get rid of him by poison it was long before i could make up my mind to the dreadful act but i was ever brooding upon it at last i obtained the poison minute doses of which would kill without exciting suspicion but not till my husband was attacked by some slight illness did i administer the first dose he grew worse but it seemed only a natural increase of the malady and the symptoms excited no suspicion whatever in his medical attendant the progress of the poison being so slow and insidious moreover i was constantly with my victim and acted as his nurse the good chaplain covered his face with his hands and a short pause ensued which was broken by teresa and now comes the astounding part of my narration she said i can scarcely credit my own hardness of heart as i saw this kind and excellent man who loved me so dearly gradually wasting awayliterally dying by inchesi felt no compunctionnone i counted the days he could live here there was another pause and the guilty woman had to summon up resolution before she could proceed to free myself from my marriage fetters was only part of my scheme she said my greedy spirit would not be content without my husbands property and this i felt certain i could secure he doted upon me i had obtained his entire confidence i knew his inmost thoughts he had quarrelled with his son i aggravated the dispute and took care to prevent a reconciliation which could have been easily effected had i so desired it my ascendancy over my infirm husband was now so great that he acted upon all my suggestions and by hints cunningly thrown out i easily induced him to make a will in my favour persuading him i would carry out his wishes in regard to his son and daughter did no suspicion cross him inquired the chaplain not till the last night of his life she replied but i think it did then if he suspected me he never taxed me with my guilt at this moment a sudden change came over her and she gazed strangely into the vacancy what troubles you inquired the chaplain i thought i saw my husband standing there she replied with a shudder tis fancy proceed with your confession you have more to tell i have she replied with a fearful look the dark tragedy was over intoxicated by the power and wealth i had acquired i contrived to stifle remorse i kept mildred constantly with me her presence seemed to shield me and i sought to make some amends by befriending chetwynd but vengeance was pursuing me though with slow feet my punishment was accomplished in an unforeseen manner hitherto my heart had never known love and i thought myself proof against the tender passion but it was not so i met lord courland at the house of lady thicknesse in london and he at once won my affections and offered me his hand loving him and thinking to bind him to me i promised him half the large property i fancied at my disposal all was arranged and my destined husband had come down here to see his future abode when almost at the last moment i discovered that if i married again the whole of the property would go to mildred this discovery roused all the evil passions in my heart and i determined to remove her in the same manner i had removed her father provided with the means of executing my fell purpose i did not delay it you were present reverend sir when i dropped poison unperceived into her wine and you may remember how soon it took effect i remember she was suddenly seized with illness after drinking a glass of champagne he replied with a look of horror but i little thought the wine had been druggednor did any one she recovered pursued the guilty woman and all might have been well if i could have resisted the dreadful temptation to which i was subjected but i yielded again i contrived to give her poison and another seizure followed doctor spencer was sent for the symptoms could not be mistaken the terrible crime was discovered and quickly traced to me the poison being found in my possession my guilt was established it may comfort you to learn that mildred will recover observed mr massey the medicines given her by doctor spencer have produced a wonderful effect at first i had little hope but now i have every confidence that her life will be spared tis well she replied but my doom is sealed doctor spencer took away the phial containing the poison but i had enough left for myself and you have done this desperate deed he asked i could not live she replied i should go mad but that mildred will live is the greatest possible consolation to me if i could see her and obtain her forgiveness i think i could die in peace but i have not strength to go to her she is here said the chaplain the dying woman raised her eyes and beheld mildred standing before her wrapped in a loose robe and supported by emmeline and rose hartley behind them was chetwynd who closed the door after him as he came in mildreds countenance was exceedingly pale but her eyes were bright and her looks seemed almost angelic to the despairing teresa who crept humbly towards her i do not deserve pardon said the penitent woman yet for the sake of him who died for us and washed out our sins with his blood i implore you to forgive me i do forgive you rejoined mildred i have come hither for that purpose may heaven have mercy upon you since your repentance is sincere daughter said the chaplain may your sins be blotted out and the guilt of your many offences be remitted amen exclaimed chetwynd then farewell said teresa in a faint voice farewell emmeline farewell chetwynd think not of me with abhorrence but if you can with pity without a word more she sank backwards and expired chetwynd caught her before she fell and placed her on a couch all those who had witnessed her death had departed except mr massey who was still in the room when lord courland entered on beholding the body he uttered a frenzied cry and rushed towards it i would have given five years of my own life to exchange a few words with her ere she breathed her last he exclaimed in a voice of bitterest anguish and selfreproach you loved her then deeply my lord said chetwynd she was the only woman i ever loved replied lord courland farewell teresa bending down and kissing her brow he quitted the room with chetwynd xxvii a month later a month must now be allowed to elapse during the interval the dark clouds that hung over ouselcroft have dispersed and the place has once more assumed a pleasant aspect unhappy teresa will never again trouble those connected with her mildred we rejoice to say under the care of doctor spencer has entirely recovered and looks more beautiful than ever she is at brackley with emmeline who has quite regained her spirits and good looks both of which had suffered from her recent anxiety rose hartley is still with them master of ouselcroft chetwynd has already won the hearts of his dependents he looks somewhat older and much graver and norris says he discerns a likeness to his father that he never perceived before as to norris himself we need scarcely say he still holds the most important post in the household and will continue to hold it as long as he is able to do so chetwynd has two guests staying with himsir bridgnorth charlton and captain danversand they will remain at ouselcroft till certain contemplated events come off lady thicknesse is at brackley with lady barfleur and means to stay there for a short time longer she has engaged laura and is very well satisfied with her the talkative ladysmaid suits her exactly sir bridgnorth drives out her ladyship daily in his phaeton and they then discuss their future plans but she has not yet seen charlton nor will she visit her future residence till she goes there as its mistress she has every prospect of happiness with sir bridgnorth who really devotes himself to her and strives to anticipate all her wishes charles danvers and mildred pass all their time together at first they contented themselves with the gardens of brackley but since mildred has grown stronger and is able to take equestrian exercise they have begun to take long rides and are seldom seen between luncheon and dinner captain danvers considers himself a most fortunate man and with good reason for he will have a most lovely bride and a very large fortune but what of chetwynd ought he not to be esteemed fortunate as far as wealth is concerned he has far more than he ever dreamed of and if he weds the heiress of brackley he will become one of the richest men in the county but his chief wealth in his own esteem is in the prize he has won and he looks forward eagerly to the daynow not very far distant he hopeswhen he shall make her his own such is the present state of things at the two houses the inmates of which are constantly together dining with each other daily either at ouselcroft or brackley but we shall perhaps learn more by assisting at a confidential talk that took place one afternoon in the butlers pantry at ouselcroft between old norris and laura well mr norris she said i am come to see how you are getting on we are quiet enough just now but we shall soon have plenty to do in what way asked the butler in the matrimonial line replied laura three weddings will come off very shortly are any of them fixed inquired norris not that i am aware of replied the ladysmaid but they cannot be long delayed all depends upon lady thicknesse when she names the day the other two are sure to follow suit her ladyship i suppose has positively accepted sir bridgnorth asked norris positively replied laura and a very good choice she has made according to my notion for my own part i should prefer the old baronet to either of the young men pooh pooh he wont bear comparison with my young master of course hes very suitable to a middleaged dame like lady thicknesse hes very agreeable i repeat and i think my lady uncommonly lucky in securing him i believe theyve agreed to spend half the year in town and the other half in the country thatll just suit me at any rate theyll have no lack of money said norris but after all lady thicknesse is nothing like so rich as her nieceto say nothing of brackley which must come to the young lady byandby yes theyll have too much observed laura i wonder where mr chetwynd and his lady will reside why hereat ouselcroftof course replied norris i dont feel sure of that said laura i sometimes fancy theyll live at brackley nonsense exclaimed norris mr chetwynd will never leave his fathers house now he has got possession of it im certain of that then captain and mrs danvers may as well take up their quarters at brackley said laura youre settling all very nicely said norris with a laugh but i dont know that lady barfleur will consent to take them i should think not all very well as visitors but not for a permanence well then mrs danvers must buy a place said laura shell have money enough norris laughed but directly afterwards his countenance changed and he said gravely ah laura we live in a strange world a month ago who would have thought things would be in this state then we were talking over mrs calverleys contemplated marriage with lord courland now she is gone and other weddings are about to take place dont mention the poor dear lady mr norris if you wouldnt make me cry said laura taking out her pockethandkerchief she had dreadful faults no doubt but she was always very kind to me and i will say this of her she was the loveliest creature ever beheld she contrived to do a great deal of mischief in her time observed norris granted rejoined laura but you ought to feel some sorrow for her seeing how very handsomely she behaved to you mr norris im sure i feel very much obliged to her for my fifty pounds though i wish it had been five thousand like lord courlands legacy yes thats a good lumping sum observed norris and will console his lordship for her loss i suppose he has got the money remarked laura yes the legacy has already been paid replied norris i thought it had said laura but do tell me mr norrisis it true the poor lady has been seen since her death clarissa declares she certainly beheld her the other evening in the dressingroom replied the butler dear me how dreadful exclaimed laura i should be frightened to death clarissa saw her in the dressingroom you say how was it do tell me clarissas tale is this she was in the poor ladys bedchamber the other evening just as it was growing dusk when fancying she heard a sound in the dressingroom she opened the door which was standing ajar and then beheld an apparition exactly resembling mrs calverley and holding a small phial at which the figure was looking so scared was clarissa at the sight that she could neither cry out nor stir till the apparition turned its head and fixed its eyes upon her their expression was so terrible that she rushed back and fell senseless on the bedchamber floor this is the account she gives and most of the womenservants believe it but i regard it as mere fancy i believe it mr norris replied laura shuddering i once saw mrs calverley myself in the dressingroom in the exact posture you describe her with a little phial in her hand containing eau de luce she said but i am now sure it was poison i shall never forget the look she gave me depend upon it clarissa has seen her spirit may be so observed norris the poor thing cant rest and i dont wonder at it observed laura i suppose these rooms will be shut up mr norris nobody has slept there since the poor ladys death he replied but i cant say about shutting up the rooms i wouldnt sleep there for the world remarked laura indeed after this occurrence i dont think i shall ever venture into the dressingroom again i should always expect to find her there just then a bell was rung and norris instantly prepared to answer the summons my young master wants to see me before he sets out for brackley he said stay where you are for a few minutes i may have something to tell you when norris reappeared he had a very joyful expression of countenance i can tell you something you dont know laura he saidsomething about lady thicknesse i know what it is the weddingday is fixed right when is it to be she exclaimed eagerly this day week replied the butler then her ladyship will get the start of the others said laura im not sure of that replied norris significantly i cant tell you any more now all i know is my young master and captain danvers have just ridden off to brackley xxviii all is settled when chetwynd and captain danvers were about half a mile from brackley park they saw sir bridgnorth and lady thicknesse coming slowly along in the phaeton the pair looked so happy and so completely engrossed by each other that the two young men scarcely liked to interrupt them however sir bridgnorth pulled up and then the others stopped likewise after a few words had passed her ladyship signed to chetwynd to come close to her and said in a low voice i have had some talk with lady barfleur this morning and i think she has consented that your marriage with emmeline shall take place immediately sir bridgnorth who was present at the time lent his aid and spoke so urgently that i think he decided the point i am infinitely indebted to you both said chetwynd glancing at sir bridgnorth you will find emmeline in the garden said lady thicknesse and by the time we come back from our drive i hope all will be satisfactorily settled this day week mindnot later added sir bridgnorth leaning towards him all is ready for us at charlton the baronet then moved on while the others rode off in the opposite direction arrived at brackley our friends ascertained that both young ladies were in the garden and immediately went in quest of them and found them seated near the bowlinggreen this being the first time we have seen them since their deliverance from teresa we are bound to say they were both looking charmingly and in capital spirits mildreds illness hadnt left a trace on her fair countenance on the contrary she seemed prettier than ever no sooner did their lovers appear than they arose and flew to meet them and a very loverlike meeting took place but the couples then separated and chetwynd and emmeline whom we shall accompany moved off to a short distance emmeline said chetwynd i had resolved not to ask you to fulfil your promise to me till i had gone through a years probation nor should i have done so had i not been placed by circumstances in a totally different position from what i was at that time if you have confidence in my reformationif you think i have proved myself worthy of youif you can trust mei will beg you to abridge my term and give yourself to me now but if you have any doubt remainingif you deem it better to wait till the appointed timei pray you to do so your happiness is my chief concern and however irksome the delay may be i shall not complain i have entire faith in you dear chetwynd she replied in a voice of much emotion in every respect you have proved yourself worthy of my love and i am prepared to give you my hand whenever you claim it i claim it at once he said eagerly and as there is now no obstaclefor lady thicknesse tells me your mother has given her consenti pray that our union may take place on the same day as the marriage of her ladyship with sir bridgnorth be it so said emmeline and i hope another marriage will take place at the same time just then the voice of captain danvers was heard at a little distance and he called out dont let me interrupt you but mildred wont fix the day till she is satisfied you are agreed then tell her we are agreed replied emmeline will this day week suit it will suit her perfectly replied the captain you answer for me said mildred laughing but though you speak without authority it is really the day i should choose i felt certain of it or i should not have ventured to say so observed the captain but since all private arrangements are made and we are to be wedded at the same time wont it be more convenient to talk matters over together i am quite of that opinion said chetwynd no dissentient voice was raised so they all came together and began to discuss the general arrangements ere long they were joined by lady barfleur who gave her formal consent to her daughters union with chetwynd and then took part in the discussion it was agreed they should be married in the private chapel belonging to the hall and that the reverend mr massey should perform the ceremony this was the chief matter but they had a good deal to talk over besides and they were still engaged in the discussion when lady thicknesse and sir bridgnorth returned from their drive having already decided upon the private chapel of mr massey the lastmentioned pair had only to express their satisfaction that their own plans had been adopted but they had many congratulations to offer to chetwynd and emmeline xxix conclusion the auspicious day had arrived on which the three marriages were to take place or rather we ought to say four since it had been arranged that rose hartley was to be married to harry netterville at the same time harry had come down two days before to ouselcroft and had brought with him on chetwynds special invitation mr and mrs hartley together with tom tankard who was to act as harrys best man higgins was now staying at brackley and mr tankard had been invited there captain ponsonby an old friend had agreed to act as

and many a year the large courtyard was entirely filled with the tenants and retainers of the lord of the mansionwho henceforward would be represented by chetwyndtheir wives and daughters some of the latter being very goodlooking and very welldressed among our acquaintances was marple the farmer who had been present when sir leycester barfleur was lost in the morass and honest ned rushton the keeper already a brilliant assemblage was collected in the large room upstairs which was beautifully decorated with flowers as were the drawingroom and the hall in fact there were flowers everywhere at length the bell began to ring the several bridal parties assembled in the hall and marshalled by higgins and norris issued forth preceded by a dozen young damsels dressed in white who scattered flowers in their path they then moved through the crowded court to the chapel amid the audiblyexpressed good wishes of the beholders sir bridgnorth and lady thicknesse took the lead and her ladyship looked magnificent in her bridal array then came emmeline escorted by her uncle sir gerard danvers and followed by chetwynd and captain ponsonby she excited general admiration as did mildred who followed on the arm of mr talbot hesketh her mothers first cousin close behind them came captain danvers and his brother scrope lastly came rose charmingly and simply attired in white and looking quite as pretty as the others attended by her mother and leaning on her fathers arm she was followed by netterville and tom tankard laura and clarissa were to act as her bridesmaids but they had already gone into the chapel the little chapel presented an exceedingly pretty sight but it was so full that very few of the tenantry could be admitted the chaplain was already at the altar and his venerable figure completed the charming picture a few minutes elapsed while the several couples were being placed but at length this preliminary proceeding was accomplished and the ceremony commenced at this juncture the scene was exceedingly interesting and long lived in the memory of those fortunate enough to behold it rarely have two more beautiful brides than emmeline and mildred appeared at the altarnay we may say three for rose was little their inferior in beauty and lady thicknesse if she had not youth had remarkable grace and elegance grouped around were the bridesmaids all of whom were young exceedingly pretty and charmingly attired placed somewhat apart was lady barfleur but being in deep mourning she would not mingle with the group the ceremony proceeded and the different couples were united lady thicknesse became lady bridgnorth greatly to the delight of the excellent baronet chetwynd was made supremely happy by the hand of emmeline nor had charles danvers less reason to be content for in mildred he obtained a treasure while we doubt whether any one was happier than harry netterville when he could really call rose his own the ceremony is over we will accompany the happy couplesand they really deserve to be so describedas they cross the still crowded court and pass through lines of bowing tenantry into the hall but we will not join the throng in the drawingroom nor sit down with the large party in the diningroom to the admirable breakfast prepared by monsieur zephyrus we will make passing bows to the beautiful brides we will say farewell to our kindly sir bridgnorth whom we rejoice to say still flourishes we will bid adieu to chetwynd and charles danvers and wish them all happiness we will visit for a moment another table in another room at which we shall find our blooming little rose and her happy husbandnow the happiest couple possibleher worthy father and doting mother tom tankard and his father who keeps him in order marple the farmer ned rushton the keeper and a great many more all of whom are enjoying a most plentiful and excellent repast at which besides wine there is no lack of good strong ale a couple of casks having been broached that morning for the tenantry and general guests our task is done the end
