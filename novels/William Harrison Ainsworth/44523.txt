irons knocked off in newgate the procession from newgate to tyburn the last scene chapter xi dollis hill revisited about an hour after the occurrences at newgate the door of the small backparlour already described at dollis hill was opened by winifred who gliding noiselessly across the room approached a couch on which was extended a sleeping female and gazing anxiously at her pale careworn countenance murmuredheaven be praised she still slumbersslumbers peacefully the opiate has done its duty poor thing how beautiful she looks but how like death deathlike indeed was the repose of the sleeperdeathlike and deep its very calmness was frightful her lips were apart but no breath seemed to issue from them and but for a slightvery slight palpitation of the bosom the vital principle might be supposed to be extinct this lifeless appearance was heightened by the extreme sharpness of her featuresespecially the nose and chinand by the emaciation of her limbs which was painfully distinct through her drapery her attenuated arms were crossed upon her breast and her black brows and eyelashes contrasted fearfully with the livid whiteness of her skin a few short dark locks escaping from beneath her headdress showed that her hair had been removed and had only been recently allowed to grow again poor mrs sheppard sighed winifred as she contemplated the beautiful wreck before herpoor mrs sheppard when i see her thus and think of all she has endured of all she may yet have to endure i could almost pray for her release from trouble i dare not reflect upon the effect that her sons fateif the efforts to save him are ineffectualmay have upon her enfeebled frame and still worse upon her mind what a mercy that the blow aimed at her by the ruffian wild though it brought her to the brink of the grave should have restored her to reason ah she stirs as she said this she drew a little aside while mrs sheppard heaved a deep sigh and opened her eyes which now looked larger blacker and more melancholy than ever where am i she cried passing her hand across her brow with your friends dear mrs sheppard replied winifred advancing ah you are there my dear young lady said the widow smiling faintly when i first waken im always in dread of finding myself again in that horrible asylum you need never be afraid of that returned winifred affectionately my father will take care you never leave him more oh how much i owe him said the widow with fervour for bringing me here and removing me from those dreadful sights and sounds that would have driven me distracted even if i had been in my right mind and how much i owe you too dearest winifred for your kindness and attention without you i should never have recovered either health or reason i can never be grateful enough but though i cannot reward you heaven will dont say anything about it dear mrs sheppard rejoined winifred controlling her emotion and speaking as cheerfully as she could i would do anything in the world for you and so would my father and so would thames but he ought for hes your nephew you know we all love you dearly bless you bless you cried mrs sheppard averting her face to hide her tears i mustnt tell you what thames means to do for you if ever he gains his rights continued winifred but i may tell you what my father means to do he has done too much already answered the widow i shall need little more but do hear what it is rejoined winifred you know im shortly to be united to your nephewthat is she added blushing when he can be married by his right name for my father wont consent to it before your father will never oppose your happiness my dear im sure said mrs sheppard but what has this to do with me you shall hear replied winifred when this marriage takes place you and i shall be closely allied but my father wishes for a still closer alliance i dont understand you returned mrs sheppard to be plain then said winifred he has asked me whether i have any objection to you as a mother and whatwhat was your answer demanded the widow eagerly cant you guess returned winifred throwing her arms about her neck that he couldnt choose any one so agreeable to me winifred said mrs sheppard after a brief pause during which she appeared overcome by her feelingsshe said gently disengaging herself from the young girls embrace and speaking in a firm voice you must dissuade your father from this step how exclaimed the other can you not love him love him echoed the widow the feeling is dead within my breast my only love is for my poor lost son i can esteem him regard him but love him as he ought to be lovedthat i cannot do your esteem is all he will require urged winifred he has it and will ever have it replied mrs sheppard passionatelyhe has my boundless gratitude and devotion but i am not worthy to be any mans wifefar less his wife winifred you are deceived in me you know not what a wretched guilty thing i am you know not in what dark places my life has been cast with what crimes it has been stained but the offences i have committed are venial in comparison with what i should commit were i to wed your father nono it must never be you paint yourself worse than you are dear mrs sheppard rejoined winifred kindly your faults were the faults of circumstances palliate them as you may replied the widow gravely they were faults and as such cannot be repaired by a greater wrong if you love me do not allude to this subject again im sorry i mentioned it at all since it distresses you returned winifred but as i knew my father intended to propose to you if poor jack should be respited if he should be respited repeated mrs sheppard with startling eagerness does your father doubt it speak tell me winifred made no answer your hesitation convinces me he does replied the widow is thames returned from london not yet replied the other but i expect him every minute my fathers chief fear i must tell you is from the baneful influence of jonathan wild that fiend is ever in my path exclaimed mrs sheppard with a look the wildness of which greatly alarmed her companion i cannot scare him thence hark cried winifred thames is arrived i hear the sound of his horses feet in the yard now you will learn the result heaven support me cried mrs sheppard faintly breathe at this phial said winifred shortly afterwardsit seemed an age to the anxious mothermr wood entered the room followed by thames the latter looked very pale either from the effect of his wound which was not yet entirely healed or from suppressed emotionpartly perhaps from both causesand wore his left arm in a sling well cried mrs sheppard raising herself and looking at him as if her life depended upon the answer he is respited alas no replied thames sadly the warrant for his execution is arrived there is no further hope my poor son groaned the widow sinking backwards heaven have mercy on his soul ejaculated wood poor jack cried winifred burying her face in her lovers bosom not a word was uttered for some time nor any sound heard except the stilled sobs of the unfortunate mother at length she suddenly started to her feet and before winifred could prevent her staggered up to thames when is he to suffer she demanded fixing her large black eyes which burnt with an insane gleam upon him on friday he replied friday echoed mrs sheppard and today is monday he has three days to live only three days three short days horrible poor soul her senses are going again said mr wood terrified by the wildness of her looks i was afraid it would be so only three days reiterated the widow three short short daysand then all is over jonathans wicked threat is fulfilled at last the gallows is in viewi see it with all its hideous apparatusough and shuddering violently she placed her hands before her as if to exclude some frightful vision from her sight do not despair my sweet soul said wood in a soothing tone do not despair echoed mrs sheppard with a laugh that cut the ears of those who listened to it like a razordo not despair and who or what shall give me comfort when my son is gone i have wept till my eyes are drysuffered till my heart is brokenprayed till the voice of prayer is dumband all of no avail he will be hangedhangedhanged ha ha what have i left but despair and madness promise me one thing mr wood she continued with a sudden change of tone and convulsively clutching the carpenters arm promise it me anything my dear replied wood what is it bury us together in one grave in willesden churchyard there is a small yewtree west of the church beneath that tree let us lie in one grave mind do you promise to do this solemnly rejoined the carpenter enough said the widow gratefully i must see him tonight impossible dear mrs sheppard said thames tomorrow i will take you to him tomorrow will be too late replied the widow in a hollow voice i feel it will i must go tonight or i shall never behold him again i must bless him before i die i have strength enough to drag myself there and i do not want to return be pacified sweet soul said wood looking meaningly at thames you shall go and i will accompany you a mothers blessing on you replied mrs sheppard fervently and now she added with somewhat more composure leave me dear friends i entreat for a few minutes to collect my scattered thoughtsto prepare myself for what i have to go throughto pray for my son shall we do so whispered winifred to her father by all means returned wood dont delay an instant and followed by the young couple who gazed wistfully at the poor sufferer he hastily quitted the room and locked the door after him mrs sheppard was no sooner alone than she fell upon her knees by the side of the couch and poured forth her heart in prayer so absorbed was she by her passionate supplications that she was insensible to anything passing around her until she felt a touch upon her shoulder and heard a wellknown voice breathe in her earmother she started at the sound as if an apparition had called her screamed and fell into her sons outstretched arms mother dear mother cried jack folding her to his breast my son my dear dear son returned mrs sheppard returning his embrace with all a parents tenderness jack was completely overcome his chest heaved violently and big tears coursed rapidly down his cheeks i dont deserve it he said at length but i would have risked a thousand deaths to enjoy this moments happiness and you must have risked much to obtain it my love i have scarcely recovered from the shock of hearing of your condemnation when i behold you free not two hours since rejoined jack i was chained down in the condemned hold in newgate with a small saw conveyed to me a few days since by thames darrell which i contrived to conceal upon my person i removed a spike in the hatch and with the aid of some other friends worked my way out having heard from thames that you were better and that your sole anxiety was about me i came to give you the first intelligence of my escape bless you for it but you will stay here i dare not i must provide for my safety mr wood will protect you urged mrs sheppard he has not the powerperhaps not the will to do so and if he would i would not subject him to the annoyance the moment my escape is known a large reward will be placed on my head my dress my person will be minutely described jonathan wild and his bloodhounds with a hundred others incited by the reward will be upon my track nay for aught i know some of them may even now have got scent of me you terrify me cried mrs sheppard oh if this is the case do not stay an instant fly fly as soon as i can do so with safety i will return or send to you said jack do not endanger yourself on my account rejoined his mother i am quite easy now receive my blessing my dear son and if we never meet again rest assured my last prayer shall be for you do not talk thus dear mother returned jack gazing anxiously at her pale countenance or i shall not be able to quit you you must live for me i will try to do so replied the widow forcing a smile one last embrace i need not counsel you to avoid those fatal courses which have placed you in such fearful jeopardy you need not replied jack in a tone of the deepest compunction and oh forgive me though i can never forgive myself for the misery i have caused you forgive you echoed his mother with a look radiant with delight i have nothing to forgive ah she screamed with a sudden change of manner and pointing to the window which jack had left open and at which a dark figure was standing there is jonathan wild betrayed exclaimed jack glancing in the same direction the doorthe doordeath he added as he tried the handle it is lockedand i am unarmed madman that i am to be so help shrieked mrs sheppard be silent said jonathan striding deliberately into the room these cries will avail you nothing whoever answers them must assist me to capture your son be silent i say if you value his safety awed by jonathans manner mrs sheppard repressed the scream that rose to her lips and both mother and son gazed with apprehension at the heavy figure of the thieftaker which viewed in the twilight seemed dilated to twice its natural size and appeared almost to block up the window in addition to his customary arms jonathan carried a bludgeon with a large heavy knob suspended from his wrist by a loop a favourite weapon which he always took with him on dangerous expeditions and which if any information had been requisite would have told sheppard that the present was one of them well jack he said after a pause are you disposed to go back quietly with me youll ascertain that when you attempt to touch me rejoined sheppard resolutely my janizaries are within call returned wild im armed you are not it matters not you shall not take me alive spare him spare him cried mrs sheppard falling on her knees get up mother cried jack do not kneel to him i wouldnt accept my life from him ive foiled him hitherto and will foil him yet and come what will ill balk him of the satisfaction of hanging me jonathan raised his bludgeon but controlled himself by a powerful effort fool he cried do you think i wouldnt have secured you before this if i hadnt some motive for my forbearance and that motive is fear replied jack contemptuously fear echoed wild in a terrible tonefear repeat that word again and nothing shall save you dont anger him my dear son implored the poor widow with a look of anguish at jack perhaps he means well mad as you are youre the more sensible of the two i must say rejoined jonathan spare him cried mrs sheppard who fancied she had made some impression on the obdurate breast of the thieftakerspare him and i will forgive you will thank you bless you spare him spare him on one condition i will spare him returned wild on one condition only what is it asked the poor woman either he or you must return with me answered jonathan take me then replied the widow and she would have rushed to him if she had not been forcibly withheld by her son do not go near him mother cried jack do not believe him there is some deep treachery hidden beneath his words i will go said mrs sheppard struggling to get free attend to me mrs sheppard said jonathan looking calmly on at this distressing scene attend to me and do not heed him i swear to you solemnly swear to you i will save your sons life nay more will befriend him will place him out of the reach of his enemies if you consent to become my wife execrable villain exclaimed jack you hear that cried mrs sheppard he swears to save you well replied her son and you spurn the proposal no she accepts it rejoined jonathan triumphantly come along mrs sheppard ive a carriage within call shall convey you swiftly to town come come hear me mother cried jack and i will explain to you why the villain makes this strange and revolting proposal he well knows that but two livesthose of thames darrell and sir rowland trenchardstand between you and the vast possessions of the family those lives removedand sir rowland is completely in his power the estates would be yourshis if he were your husband now do you see his motive i see nothing but your danger replied his mother tenderly granted it were as you say jack said wildand i shant take the trouble to contradict youthe estates would be yours hereafter liar cried jack do you affect ignorance that i am a condemned felon and can inherit nothing but do not imagine that under any circumstances i would accept your terms my mother shall never degrade herself by a connection with you degrade herself rejoined jonathan brutally do you think i would take a harlot to my bed if it didnt suit my purposes to do so he says right replied mrs sheppard distractedly i am only fit for such as him take me take me before an hour you shall be mine said jonathan advancing towards her back cried jack fiercely lay a finger on her and i will fell you to the ground mother do you know what you do would you sell yourself to this fiend i would sell myself body and soul to save you rejoined his mother bursting from his grasp jonathan caught her in his arms come away he cried with the roar of a demon this laugh and his looks alarmed her it is the fiend she exclaimed recoiling save mesave me damnation vociferated jonathan savagely weve no time for any bedlam scenes now come along you mad jade ill teach you submission in time with this he endeavoured to force her off but before he could accomplish his purpose he was arrested and his throat seized by jack in the struggle mrs sheppard broke from him and filled the room with her shrieks ill now pay the debt i owe you cried jack tightening his grip till the thieftaker blackened in the face dog cried wild freeing himself by a powerful effort and dealing jack a violent blow with the heavy bludgeon which knocked him backwards you are not yet a match for jonathan wild neither you nor your mother shall escape me but i must summon my janizaries so saying he raised a whistle to his lips and blew a loud call and as this was unanswered another still louder confusion he cried something has happened but i wont be cheated of my prize help help shrieked mrs sheppard fleeing from him to the farthest corner of the room but it was of no avail jonathan again seized her when the door was thrown open and thames darrell followed by mr wood and several servingmen all well armed rushed into the room a glance sufficed to show the young man how matters stood he flew to the window and would have passed his sword through the thieftakers body if the latter had not quickly interposed the person of mrs sheppard so that if the blow had been stricken she must have received it quiltmendezwhere are you vociferated wild sounding his whistle for the third time you call in vain rejoined thames your assistants are in my power yield villain never replied jonathan put down your burthen monster shouted wood pointing an immense blunderbuss at him take her cried jonathan and flinging the now inanimate body of the poor widow who had fainted in the struggle into the arms of thames he leapt through the window and by the time the latter could consign her to wood and dart after him he had disappeared pursue him cried thames to the attendants and see that he does not escape the order was promptly obeyed jack continued thames addressing sheppard who had only just recovered from the blow and regained his feet i dont ask how you came here nor do i blame your rashness in doing so fortunately ever since wilds late murderous attack the household has all been well armed a postchaise seen in the road first alarmed us on searching the grounds we found two suspiciouslooking fellows in the garden and had scarcely secured them when your mothers cries summoned us hither just in time to preserve her your arrival was most providential said jack you must not remain here another instant replied thames my horse is at the door saddled with pistols in the holstersmount him and fly thames i have much to say said jack much that concerns your safety not now returned thames impatiently i cannotwill not suffer you to remain here i will go if you will consent to meet me at midnight near the old house in wych street replied jack by that time i shall have fully considered a plan which occurs to me for defeating the schemes of your enemies before that time you will be captured if you expose yourself thus rejoined thames however i will be there farewell till midnight replied jack and imprinting a kiss upon his mothers cold lips he left the room he found the horse where thames told him he would find him mounted and rode off across the fields in the direction of town chapter xii the well hole jonathan wilds first object as soon as he had made good his retreat was to ascertain what had become of his janizaries and if possible to release them with this view he hurried to the spot where he had left the postchaise and found it drawn up at the roadside the postilion dismounted and in charge of a couple of farmingmen advancing towards them sword in hand jonathan so terrified the hinds by his fierce looks and determined manner that after a slight show of resistance they took to their heels leaving him master of the field he then threw open the door of the vehicle in which he found his janizaries with their arms pinioned and leaping into it ordered the man to drive off the postilion obeyed and dashed off as hard as his horses could gallop along the beautiful road leading to neasdon and willesden just as the servingmen made their appearance arrived at the latter place jonathan who meanwhile had contrived to liberate his attendants from their bonds drew up at the six bells and hiring a couple of horses despatched his attendants in search of jack sheppard while he proceeded to town dismissing the postchaise at the old bailey he walked to newgate to ascertain what had occurred since the escape it was just upon the stroke of nine as he entered the lodge and mr austin was dismissing a host of inquirers who had been attracted thither by the newsfor it had already been extensively noised abroad some of these persons were examining the spot where the spike had been cut off others the spike itself now considered a remarkable object and all were marvelling how jack could have possibly squeezed himself through such a narrow aperture until it was explained to them by mr austin that the renowned housebreaker was of slender bodily conformation and therefore able to achieve a feat which he mr austin or any man of similar dimensions would have found wholly impossible affixed to the wall in a conspicuous situation was a large placard which after minutely describing sheppards appearance and attire concluded thuswhoever will discover or apprehend the above john sheppard so that he be brought to justice shall receive one hundred guineas reward to be paid by mr pitt the keeper of newgate this placard attracted universal attention while jonathan was conversing with austin from whom he took care to conceal the fact of his having seen sheppard since his escape ireton entered the lodge altogether unsuccessful sir said the chief turnkey with a look of disappointment not unmixed with apprehension as he approached wild ive been to all the flash cases in town and can hear nothing of him or his wives first i went to country toms the goat in long lane tom swore he hadnt set eyes on him since the trial i next proceeded to jenny bunchs the ship in trig lanethere i got the same answer then to the feathers in drury lane then to the golden ball in the same street then to martins brandyshop in fleet street then to dan wares in hanging sword court then to the deans head in st martins le grand and lastly to the seven cities o refuge in the new mint and nowhere could i obtain the slightest information humph exclaimed wild have you been more successful sir ventured ireton jonathan shook his head mr shotbolt thinks he has a scheme that cant fail interposed austin but he wishes to know whether youll be as good as your word in respect to the great reward you offered for jacks capture have i ever broken my word in such matters that he dares put the question rejoined jonathan sternly tell mr shotbolt that if he or any other person takes jack sheppard before tomorrow morning ill double it do you hear i do sir replied austin respectfully two hundred pounds if hes lodged in newgate before tomorrow morning continued wild make it known among your friends and he strode out of the place two hundred pounds exclaimed ireton besides the governors offerthats three hundred i must go to work again keep a sharp look out austin and see that we lose no one else i should be sorry if shotbolt got the reward devilish hard im not allowed a chance grumbled austin as he was left alone however some one must look after the jail and theyre all gone but me its fortunate weve no more jack sheppards or i should stand but a poor chance well i dont think theyll any of em nab him thats one comfort on quitting the lodge wild repaired to his own habitation telling the porter that he would attend to the house himself he bade him go in search of jack sheppard there was something in jonathans manner as he issued this command that struck the man as singular and he afterwards recalled it he however made no remark at the time but instantly prepared to set out as soon as he was gone jonathan went up stairs to the audiencechamber and sitting down appeared for some time buried in reflection the dark and desperate thoughts that were passing through his mind at this time will presently be shown after a while he raised his eyes and if their glance could have been witnessed at the moment it could not have been easily forgotten muttering something to himself he appeared to be telling upon his fingers the advantages and disadvantages of some scheme he had in contemplation that he had resolved upon its execution whatever it might be was evident from his saying aloud i will do it so good an opportunity may never occur again upon this he arose and paced the room hastily backwards and forwards as if further arranging his plans he then unlocked a cabinet opened a secret drawer and lifter ransacking its contents discovered a paper he was in search of and a glove laying these carefully aside he restored the drawer to its place his next occupation was to take out his pistols examine the priming and rub the flints his sword then came in for his scrutiny he felt at and appeared satisfied with its edge this employment seemed to afford him the highest satisfaction for a diabolical grinit cannot be called a smileplayed upon his face all the time he was engaged in it his sword done with he took up the bludgeon balanced it in his hand upon the points of his fingers and let it fall with a smash intentionally upon the table after all he said this is the safest weapon no instrument ive ever used has done me such good service it shall be the bludgeon so saying he slung it upon his wrist taking up a link which was blazing beside him he walked across the room and touching a spring in the wall a secret door flew open beyond was a narrow bridge crossing a circular building at the bottom of which lay a deep well it was a dark mysterious place and what it was used for no one exactly knew but it was called by those who had seen it the well hole the bridge was protected on either side by a railing with bannisters placed at wide intervals steps to aid the descent which was too steep to be safe without them led to a door on the opposite side this door which was open jonathan locked and took out the key as he stood upon the bridge he held down the light and looked into the profound abyss the red glare fell upon the slimy brickwork and tinged the inky waters below a slight cough uttered by jonathan at the moment awakened the echoes of the place and was returned in hollow reverberations therell be a louder echo here presently thought jonathan before leaving the place he looked upwards and could just discern the blue vault and pale stars of heaven through an iron grating at the top on his return to the room jonathan purposely left the door of the well hole ajar unlocking a cupboard he then took out some cold meat and other viands with a flask of wine and a bottle of brandy and began to eat and drink voraciously he had very nearly cleared the board when a knock was heard below and descending at the summons he found his two janizaries they had both been unsuccessful as jonathan scarcely expected a more satisfactory result he made no comment but ordering quilt to continue his search and not to return until he had found the fugitive called abraham mendez into the house and shut the door i want you for the job i spoke of a short time ago nab he said i mean to have no one but yourself in it come up stairs and take a glass of brandy abraham grinned and silently followed his master who as soon as they reached the audiencechamber poured out a bumper of spirits and presented it to him the jew swallowed it at a draught by my shoul he exclaimed smacking his lips dat ish gootvery goot you shall finish the bottle when the jobs done replied jonathan vat ish it mishter vild inquired mendez shir rowland trenchards affaireh thats it rejoined jonathan i expect him here every minute when youve admitted him steal into the room hide yourself and dont move till i utter the words youve a long journey before you thats your signal and a famoush goot shignal it ish laughed abraham he hash a long journey before himha ha peace cried jonathan theres his knock go and let him in and mind you dont arouse his suspicions never fearnever fear rejoined abraham as he took up the link and left the room jonathan cast a hasty glance around to see that all was properly arranged for his purpose placed a chair with its back to the door disposed the lights on the table so as to throw the entrance of the room more into shadow and then flung himself into a seat to await sir rowlands arrival he had not to wait long enveloped in a large cloak sir rowland stalked into the room and took the seat assigned him while the jew who received a private signal from jonathan set down the link near the entrance of the well hole and having made fast the door crept behind one of the cases fancying they were alone sir rowland threw aside his cloak and produced a heavy bag of money which he flung upon the table and when wild had feasted his greedy eyes sufficiently upon its golden contents he handed him a pocketbook filled with notes you have behaved like a man of honour sir rowland said wild after he had twice told over the money right to a farthing give me an acquittance said trenchard its scarcely necessary replied wild however if you require it certainly there it is received from sir rowland trenchard l jonathan wild august st will that do it will replied trenchard this is our last transaction together i hope not replied wild it is the last continued the knight sternly and i trust we may never meet again i have paid you this large sumnot because you are entitled to it for you have failed in what you undertook to do but because i desire to be troubled with you no further i have now settled my affairs and made every preparation for my departure to france where i shall spend the remainder of my days and i have made such arrangements that at my decease tardy justice will be done my injured nephew you have made no such arrangements as will compromise me i hope sir rowland said wild hastily while i live you are safe rejoined trenchard after my death i can answer for nothing sblood exclaimed wild uneasily this alters the case materially when were you last confessed sir rowland he added abruptly why do you ask rejoined the other haughtily becausebecause im always distrustful of a priest rejoined jonathan i have just parted from one said trenchard so much the worse replied jonathan rising and taking a turn as if uncertain what to do so much the better rejoined sir rowland he who stands on the verge of the grave as i do should never be unprepared youre strangely superstitious sir rowland said jonathan halting and looking steadfastly at him if i were so i should not be here returned trenchard how so asked wild curiously i had a terrible dream last night i thought my sister and her murdered husband dragged me hither to this very room and commanded you to slay me a terrible dream indeed said jonathan thoughtfully but you mustnt indulge these gloomy thoughts let me recommend a glass of wine my penance forbids it said trenchard waving his hand i cannot remain here long you will remain longer than you anticipate muttered wild before i go continued sir rowland i must beg of you to disclose to me all you know relative to the parentage of thames darrell willingly replied wild thinking it likely you might desire to have this information i prepared accordingly first look at this glove it belonged to his father and was worn by him on the night he was murdered you will observe that a coronet is embroidered on it ha exclaimed trenchard starting is he so highly born this letter will inform you replied wild placing a document in his hand what is this cried sir rowland i know the handha my friend and i have murdered him and my sister was thus nobly thus illustriously wedded o god o god and he appeared convulsed with agony oh if i had known this he exclaimed what guilt what remorse might have been spared me repentance comes too late when the deeds done returned wild bitterly it is not too late to repair the wrong i have done my nephew cried trenchard i will set about it instantly he shall have the estates i will return to manchester at once you had better take some refreshment before you start rejoined wild youve a long journey before you as the signal was given the jew who had been some time in expectation of it darted swiftly and silently behind sir rowland and flung a cloth over his head while jonathan rushing upon him in front struck him several quick and violent blows in the face with the bludgeon the white cloth was instantly dyed with crimson but regardless of this jonathan continued his murderous assault the struggles of the wounded man were desperateso desperate that in his agony he overset the table and in the confusion tore off the cloth and disclosed a face horribly mutilated and streaming with blood so appalling was the sight that even the murderersfamiliar as they were with scenes of slaughterlooked aghast at it during this dreadful pause the wretched man felt for his sword it had been removed from the scabbard by the jew he uttered a deep groan but said nothing despatch him roared jonathan having no means of defence sir rowland cleared the blood from his vision and turning to see whether there was any means of escape he descried the open door behind him leading to the well hole and instantly darted through it as i could wish cried jonathan bring the light nab the jew snatched up the link and followed him a struggle of the most terrific kind now ensued the wounded man had descended the bridge and dashed himself against the door beyond it but finding it impossible to force his way further he turned to confront his assailants jonathan aimed a blow at him which if it had taken place must have instantly terminated the strife but avoiding this he sprang at the thieftaker and grappled with him firmly built as it was the bridge creaked in such a manner with their contending efforts that abraham durst not venture beyond the door where he stood holding the light a horrified spectator of the scene the contest however though desperate was brief disengaging his right arm jonathan struck his victim a tremendous blow on the head with the bludgeon that fractured his skull and exerting all his strength threw him over the rails to which he clung with the tenacity of despair illustration spare me he groaned looking upwards spare me jonathan however instead of answering him searched for his knife with the intention of severing his wrist but not finding it he had again recourse to the bludgeon and began beating the hand fixed on the upper rail until by smashing the fingers he forced it to relinquish its hold he then stamped upon the hand on the lower bannister until that also relaxed its gripe sir rowland then fell a hollow plunge echoed and reechoed by the walls marked his descent into the water give me the link cried jonathan holding down the light he perceived that the wounded man had risen to the surface and was trying to clamber up the slippery sides of the well shoot him shoot him put him out of hish mishery cried the jew whats the use of wasting a shot rejoined jonathan savagely he cant get out after making several ineffectual attempts to keep himself above water sir rowland sunk and his groans which had become gradually fainter and fainter were heard no more alls over muttered jonathan shall ve go back to de other room asked the jew i shall breathe more freely dere oh christ de doors shut it musht have schwung to during de schuffle shut exclaimed wild then were imprisoned the spring cant be opened on this side deres de other door cried mendez in alarm it only leads to the fencing crib replied wild theres no outlet that way cant ve call for asshistanche and wholl find us if we do rejoined wild fiercely but they will find the evidences of slaughter in the other roomthe table upsetthe bloody cloththe dead mans swordthe moneyand my memorandum which i forgot to remove hells curses that after all my precautions i should be thus entrapped its all your fault you shaking coward and but that i feel sure youll swing for your carelessness id throw you into the well too chapter xiii the supper at mr kneebones persuaded that jack sheppard would keep his appointment with mr kneebone and feeling certain of capturing him if he did so shotbolt on quitting newgate hurried to the new prison to prepare for the enterprise after debating with himself for some time whether he should employ an assistant or make the attempt alone his love of gain overcame his fears and he decided upon the latter plan accordingly having armed himself with various weapons including a stout oaken staff then ordinarily borne by the watch and put a coil of rope and a gag in his pocket to be ready in case of need he set out about ten oclock on the expedition before proceeding to wych street he called at the lodge to see how matters were going on and found mrs spurling and austin at their evening meal with caliban in attendance well mr shotbolt cried the turnkey ive good news for you mr wild has doubled his offer and the governor has likewise proclaimed a reward of one hundred guineas for jacks apprehension you dont say so exclaimed shotbolt read that rejoined austin pointing to the placard i ought to tell you that mr wilds reward is conditional upon jacks being taken before tomorrow morning so i fear theres little chance of any one getting it you think so eh chuckled shotbolt who was eagerly perusing the reward and congratulating himself upon his caution you think soha ha well dont go to bed thats all what for demanded the turnkey because the prisoners arrival might disturb youha ha ill lay you twenty guineas you dont take him tonight rejoined austin done cried shotbolt mrs spurling youre a witness to the bet twenty guineas mind i shant let you off a farthing egad i shall make a good thing of it never count your chickens till theyre hatched observed mrs spurling drily my chickens are hatched or at least nearly so replied shotbolt with increased merriment get ready your heaviest irons austin ill send you word when i catch him youd better send him jeered the turnkey so i will rejoined shotbolt so i will if i dont you shall clap me in the condemned hold in his stead goodbye for the presentha ha and laughing loudly at his own facetiousness he quitted the lodge ill lay my life hes gone on a foxandgoosechase to mr kneebones remarked austin rising to fasten the door i shouldnt wonder replied mrs spurling as if struck by a sudden idea and while the turnkey was busy with the keys she whispered to the black follow him caliban take care he dont see youand bring me word where he goes and what he does iss missis grinned the black be so good as to let caliban out mr austin continued the tapstress hes only going on an errand austin readily complied with her request as he returned to the table he put his finger to his nose and though he said nothing he thought he had a much better chance of winning his wager unconscious that his movements were watched shotbolt meanwhile hastened towards wych street on the way he hired a chair with a couple of stout porters and ordered them to follow him arrived within a short distance of his destination he came to a halt and pointing out a dark court nearly opposite the woollendrapers abode told the chairmen to wait there till they were summoned im a peaceofficer he added about to arrest a notorious criminal hell be brought out at this door and may probably make some resistance but you must get him into the chair as fast as you can and hurry off to newgate and whatll we get for the job yer honr asked the foremost chairman who like most of his tribe at the time was an irishman five guineas heres a couple in hand faix then well do it in style cried the fellow once in this chair yer honr and ill warrant hell not get out so aisily as jack sheppard did from the new prisn hold your tongue sirrah rejoined shotbolt not overpleased by the remark and mind what i tell you ah whats that he exclaimed as some one brushed hastily past him if i hadnt just left him i could have sworn it was mrs spurlings sooty imp caliban having seen the chairmen concealed in the entry shotbolt proceeded to mr kneebones habitation the shutters of which were closed and knocked at the door the summons was instantly answered by a shopboy is your master at home inquired the jailer he is replied a portly personage arrayed in a gorgeous yellow brocade dressinggown lined with cherrycoloured satin and having a crimson velvet cap surmounted by a gold tassel on his head my name is kneebone added the portly personage stepping forward what do you want with me a word in private replied the other stand aside tom commanded kneebone now sir he added glancing suspiciously at the applicant your business my business is to acquaint you that jack sheppard has escaped mr kneebone returned shotbolt the deuce he has why its only a few hours since i beheld him chained down with half a hundred weight of iron in the strongest ward at newgate its almost incredible are you sure youre not misinformed sir i was in the lodge at the time replied the jailer then of course you must know well its scarcely credible when i gave him an invitation to supper i little thought hed accept it but egad i believe he will im convinced of it replied shotbolt and it was on that very account i came here and he proceeded to unfold his scheme to the woollendraper well sir said kneebone when the other concluded i shall certainly not oppose his capture but at the same time ill lend you no assistance if he keeps his word ill keep mine you must wait till suppers over as you please sirprovided you dont let him off that ill engage not to do ive another reason for supposing hell pay me a visit i refused to sign a petition in his behalf to the recorder not from any illwill to him but because it was prepared by a person whom i particularly dislikecaptain darrell a very sufficient reason answered the jailer tom continued kneebone calling to the shopboy dont go home i may want you light the lantern and if you hear any odd noise in the parlour dont mind it not in the least sir replied tom in a drowsy tone and with a look seeming to imply that he was too much accustomed to odd noises at night to heed them now step this way mr whatsyourname shotbolt sir replied the jailer very well mr slipshod follow me and he led the way to an inner room in the middle of which stood a table covered with a large white cloth jack sheppard knows this house i believe sir observed shotbolt every inch of it replied the woollendraper he ought to do seeing that he served his apprenticeship in it to mr wood by whom it was formerly occupied his name is carved upon a beam up stairs indeed said shotbolt where can i hide myself he added glancing round the room in search of a closet under the table the cloth nearly touches the floor give me your staff itll be in your way suppose he brings blueskin or some other ruffian with him hesitated the jailer suppose he does in that case ill help you we shall be equally matched youre not afraid mr shoplatch not in the least replied shotbolt creeping beneath the table theres my staff am i quite hidden not quitekeep your feet in mind you dont stir till suppers over ill stamp twice when weve done i forgot to mention theres a trifling reward for his capture cried shotbolt popping his head from under the cloth if we take him i dont mind giving you a sharesay a fourthprovided you lend a helping hand curse your reward exclaimed kneebone angrily do you take me for a thiefcatcher like jonathan wild that you dare to affront me by such a proposal no offence sir rejoined the jailer humbly i didnt imagine for a moment that youd accept it but i thought it right to make you the offer be silent and conceal yourself im about to ring for supper the woollendrapers application to the bell was answered by a very pretty young woman with dark jewish features roguish black eyes sleek glossy hair a trim waist and a remarkably neat figure the very model in short of a bachelors housekeeper rachel said mr kneebone addressing his comely attendant put a few more plates on the table and bring up whatever there is in the larder i expect company company echoed rachel at this time of night company child repeated kneebone i shall want a bottle or two of sack and a flask of usquebaugh anything else sir nostay youd better not bring up any silver forks or spoons why surely you dont think your guests would steal them observed rachel archly they shant have the opportunity replied kneebone and by way of checking his housekeepers familiarity he pointed significantly to the table whos there cried rachel ill see and before she could be prevented she lifted up the cloth and disclosed shotbolt oh gemini she exclaimed a man at your service my dear replied the jailer now your curiositys satisfied child continued kneebone perhaps youll attend to my orders not a little perplexed by the mysterious object she had seen rachel left the room and shortly afterwards returned with the materials of a tolerably good supperto wit a couple of cold fowls a tongue the best part of a sirloin of beef a jar of pickles and two small dishes of pastry to these she added the wine and spirits directed and when all was arranged looked inquisitively at her master i expect a very extraordinary person to supper rachel he remarked the gentleman under the table she answered he does seem a very extraordinary person no another still more extraordinary indeedwho is it jack sheppard what the famous housebreaker i thought he was in newgate hes let out for a few hours laughed kneebone but hes going back again after supper oh dear how i should like to see him im told hes so handsome im sorry i cant indulge you replied her master a little piqued i shall want nothing more you had better go to bed its no use going to bed answered rachel i shant sleep a wink while jack sheppards in the house keep in your own room at all events rejoined kneebone very well said rachel with a toss of her pretty head very well ill have a peep at him if i die for it she muttered as she went out mr kneebone then sat down to await the arrival of his expected guest half an hour passed but jack did not make his appearance the woollendraper looked at his watch it was eleven oclock another long interval elapsed the watch was again consulted it was now a quarter past twelve mr kneebone who began to feel sleepy wound it up and snuffed the candles i suspect our friend has thought better of it and wont come he remarked have a little patience sir rejoined the jailer how are you off there shoplatch inquired kneebone rather cramped eh rather so sir replied the other altering his position i shall be able to stretch my limbs presentlyha ha hush cried kneebone i hear a noise without hes coming the caution was scarcely uttered when the door opened and jack sheppard presented himself he was wrapped in a laced roquelaure which he threw off on his entrance into the room it has been already intimated that jack had an excessive passion for finery and it might have been added that the chief part of his illgotten gains was devoted to the embellishment of his person on the present occasion he appeared to have bestowed more than ordinary attention on his toilette his apparel was sumptuous in the extreme and such as was only worn by persons of the highest distinction it consisted of a fulldress coat of brown flowered velvet laced with silver a waistcoat of white satin likewise richly embroidered shoes with red heels and large diamond buckles pearlcoloured silk stockings with gold clocks a muslin cravat or steenkirk as it was termed edged with the fine point lace ruffles of the same material and so ample as almost to hide the tips of his fingers and a silverhilted sword this costume though somewhat extravagant displayed his slight but perfectlyproportioned figure to the greatest advantage the only departure which he made from the fashion of the period was in respect to the perukean article he could never be induced to wear in lieu of it he still adhered to the sleek black crop which throughout life formed a distinguishing feature in his appearance ever since the discovery of his relationship to the trenchard family a marked change had taken place in jacks demeanour and looks which were so much refined and improved that he could scarcely be recognised as the same person having only seen him in the gloom of a dungeon and loaded with fetters kneebone had not noticed this alteration but he was now greatly struck by it advancing towards him he made him a formal salutation which was coldly returned i am expected i find observed jack glancing at the wellcovered board you are replied kneebone when i heard of your escape i felt sure i should see you you judged rightly rejoined jack i never yet broke an engagement with friend or foeand never will a bold resolution said the woollendraper you must have made some exertion to keep your present appointment few men could have done as much perhaps not replied jack carelessly i would have done more if necessary well take a chair rejoined kneebone ive waited supper you perceive first let me introduce my friends returned jack stepping to the door friends echoed kneebone with a look of dismay my invitation did not extend to them further remonstrance however was cut short by the sudden entrance of mrs maggot and edgeworth bess behind them stalked blueskin enveloped in a rough greatcoat calledappropriately enough in this instancea wraprascal folding his arms he placed his back against the door and burst into a loud laugh the ladies were as usual very gaily dressed and as usual also had resorted to art to heighten their attractions from patches justly placed they borrowd graces and with vermilion lacquerd oer their faces edgeworth bess wore a scarlet tabby negligeea sort of undress or sack then much in voguewhich suited her to admiration and upon her head had what was called a flycap with richlylaced lappets mrs maggot was equipped in a light blue ridinghabit trimmed with silver a huntingcap and a flaxen peruke and instead of a whip carried a stout cudgel for a moment kneebone had hesitated about giving the signal to shotbolt but thinking a more favourable opportunity might occur he determined not to hazard matters by undue precipitation placing chairs therefore he invited the ladies to be seated and paying a similar attention to jack began to help to the various dishes and otherwise fulfil the duties of a host while this was going on blueskin seeing no notice whatever taken of him coughed loudly and repeatedly but finding his hints totally disregarded he at length swaggered up to the table and thrust in a chair excuse me he said plunging his fork into a fowl and transferring it to his plate this tongue looks remarkably nice he added slicing off an immense wedge excuse meho ho you make yourself at home i perceive observed kneebone with a look of ineffable disgust i generally do replied blueskin pouring out a bumper of sack your health kneebone allow me to offer you a glass of usquebaugh my dear said kneebone turning from him and regarding edgeworth bess with a stare so impertinent that even that not overdelicate young lady summoned up a blush with pleasure sir replied edgeworth bess dear me she added as she pledged the amorous woollendraper what a beautiful ring that is do you think so replied kneebone taking it off and placing it on her finger which he took the opportunity of kissing at the same time wear it for my sake oh dear simpered edgeworth bess endeavouring to hide her confusion by looking steadfastly at her plate you dont eat continued kneebone addressing jack who had remained for some time thoughtful and preoccupied with his head upon his hand the captain has seldom much appetite replied blueskin who having disposed of the fowl was commencing a vigorous attack upon the sirloin i eat for both so it seems observed the woollendraper and for every one else too i say kneebone rejoined blueskin as he washed down an immense mouthful with another bumper do you recollect how nearly mr wild and i were nabbing you in this very room some nine years ago i do replied kneebone and now he added aside the case is altered im nearly nabbing you a good deal has occurred since then eh captain said blueskin nudging jack much that i would willingly forget nothing that i desire to remember replied sheppard sternly on that nightin this roomin your presence blueskinin yours mr kneebone mrs wood struck me a blow which made me a robber she has paid dearly for it muttered blueskin she has rejoined sheppard but i wish her hand had been as deadly as yours on that nightthat fatal nightwinifred crushed all the hopes that were rising in my heart on that night i surrendered myself to jonathan wild and becamewhat i am on that night you first met me love said edgeworth bess endeavouring to take his hand which he coldly withdrew and me added mrs maggot tenderly would i had never seen either of you cried jack rising and pacing the apartment with a hurried step well im sure winifred could never have loved you as well as i do said mrs maggot you cried jack scornfully do you compare your lovea love which all may purchasewith hers no one has ever loved me except me dear insinuated edgeworth bess ive been always true to you peace retorted jack with increased bitterness im your dupe no longer what the devils in the wind now captain cried blueskin in astonishment ill tell you replied jack with forced calmness within the last few minutes all my guilty life has passed before me nine years ago i was honestwas happy nine years ago i worked in this very househad a kind indulgent master whom i robbedtwice robbed at your instigation villain a mistress whom you have murdered a companion whose friendship i have for ever forfeited a mother whose heart i have wellnigh broken in this room was my ruin begun in this room it should be ended come come dont take on thus captain cried blueskin rising and walking towards him if any ones to blame its me im ready to bear it all can you make me honest cried jack can you make me other than a condemned felon can you make me not jack sheppard no replied blueskin and i wouldnt if i could curse you cried jack furiouslycurse youcurse you swear away captain rejoined blueskin coolly itll ease your mind do you mock me cried jack levelling a pistol at him not i replied blueskin take my life if youre so disposed youre welcome to it and lets see if either of these women who prate of their love for you will do as much this is folly cried jack controlling himself by a powerful effort the worst of folly replied blueskin returning to the table and taking up a glass and to put an end to it i shall drink the health of jack sheppard the housebreaker and success to him in all his enterprises and now lets see wholl refuse the pledge i will replied sheppard dashing the glass from his hand sit down fool jack said kneebone who had been considerably interested by the foregoing scene are these regrets for your past life sincere suppose them so rejoined jack what then nothingnothing stammered kneebone his prudence getting the better of his sympathy im glad to hear it thats all he added taking out his snuffbox his neverfailing resource in such emergencies it wont do to betray the officer he muttered o lud what an exquisite box cried edgeworth bess is it gold pure gold replied kneebone it was given me by poor dear mrs wood whose loss i shall ever deplore pray let me have a pinch said edgeworth bess with a captivating glance i am so excessively fond of snuff the woollendraper replied by gallantly handing her the box which was instantly snatched from her by blueskin who after helping himself to as much of its contents as he could conveniently squeeze between his thumb and finger put it very coolly in his pocket the action did not pass unnoticed by sheppard restore it he cried in an authoritative voice oons captain cried blueskin as he grumblingly obeyed the command if youve left off business yourself you neednt interfere with other people i should like a little of that plumtart said mrs maggot but i dont see a spoon ill ring for one replied kneebone rising accordingly but i fear my servants are gone to bed blueskin meanwhile having drained and replenished his glass commenced chaunting a snatch of a ballad once on a time as ive heard tell in wych street owen wood did dwell a carpenter he was by trade and money i believe he made with his foodle doo this carpenter he had a wife the plague and torment of his life who though she did her husband scold loved well a woollendraper bold with her foodle doo ive a toast to propose cried sheppard filling a bumper you wont refuse it mr kneebone hed better not muttered blueskin what is it demanded the woollendraper as he returned to the table and took up a glass the speedy union of thames darrell with winifred wood replied jack kneebones cheeks glowed with rage and he set down the wine untasted while blueskin resumed his song now owen wood had one fair child unlike her mother meek and mild her love the draper strove to gain but she repaid him with disdain with his foodle doo peace cried jack but blueskin was not to be silenced he continued his ditty in spite of the angry glances of his leader in vain he fondly urged his suit and all in vain the question put she answeredmr william kneebone of me sir you shall never be bone with your foodle doo thames darrell has my heart alone a noble youth een you must own and if from him my love could stir jack sheppard i should much prefer with his foodle doo do you refuse my toast cried jack impatiently i do replied kneebone drink this then roared blueskin and pouring the contents of a small powderflask into a bumper of brandy he tendered him the mixture at this juncture the door was opened by rachel what did you ring for sir she asked eyeing the group with astonishment your master wants a few tablespoons child said mrs maggot leave the room interposed kneebone angrily no i shant replied rachel saucily i came to see jack sheppard and i wont go till you point him out to me you told me he was going back to newgate after supper so i maynt have another opportunity oh he told you that did he said blueskin marching up to her and chucking her under the chin ill show you captain sheppard my dear there he stands im his lieutenantlieutenant blueskin were two goodlooking fellows aint we very goodlooking replied rachel but wheres the strange gentleman i saw under the table under the table echoed blueskin winking at jack when did you see him my love a short time ago replied the housekeeper unsuspiciously the plots out cried jack and without another word he seized the table with both hands and upset it scattering plates dishes bottles jugs and glasses far and wide the crash was tremendous the lights rolled over and were extinguished and if rachel had not carried a candle the room would have been plunged in total darkness amid the confusion shotbolt sprang to his feet and levelling a pistol at jacks head commanded him to surrender but before any reply could be made the jailers arm was struck up by blueskin who throwing himself upon him dragged him to the ground in the struggle the pistol went off but without damage to either party the conflict was of short duration for shotbolt was no match for his athletic antagonist he was speedily disarmed and the rope and gag being found upon him were exultingly turned against him by his conqueror who after pinioning his arms tightly behind his back forced open his mouth with the iron and effectually prevented the utterance of any further outcries while the strife was raging edgeworth bess walked up to rachel and advised her if she valued her life not to scream or stir from the spot a caution which the housekeeper whose curiosity far outweighed her fears received in very good part in the interim jack advanced to the woollendraper and regarding him sternly thus addressed him you have violated the laws of hospitality mr kneebone i came hither as your guest you have betrayed me what faith is to be kept with a felon replied the woollendraper disdainfully he who breaks faith with his benefactor may well justify himself thus answered jack i have not trusted you others who have done have found you false i dont understand you replied kneebone in some confusion you soon shall rejoined sheppard where are the packets committed to your charge by sir rowland trenchard the packets exclaimed kneebone in alarm it is useless to deny it replied jack you were watched tonight by blueskin you met sir rowland at the house of a romisch priest father spencer two packets were committed to your charge which you undertook to deliverone to another priest sir rowlands chaplain at manchester the other to mr wood produce them never replied kneebone then by heaven you are a dead man replied jack cocking a pistol and pointing it deliberately at his head i give you one minute for reflection after that time nothing shall save you there was a brief breathless pause even blueskin looked on with anxiety it is past said jack placing his finger on the trigger hold cried kneebone flinging down the packets they are nothing to me but they are everything to me cried jack stooping to pick them up these packets will establish thames darrells birth win him his inheritance and procure him the hand of winifred wood dont be too sure of that rejoined kneebone snatching up the staff and aiming a blow at his head which was fortunately warded off by mrs maggot who promptly interposed her cudgel defend yourself cried jack drawing his sword leave his punishment to me jack said mrs maggot ive the bridewell account to settle be it so replied jack putting up his blade ive a good deal to do show him no quarter poll he deserves none and shall find none replied the amazon now mr kneebone she added drawing up her magnificent figure to its full height and making the heavy cudgel whistle through the air look to yourself stand off poll rejoined the woollendraper i dont want to hurt you it shall never be said that i raised my arm willingly against a woman ill forgive you all the harm you do me rejoined the amazon what you still hesitate will that rouse you coward and she gave him a smart rap on the head coward cried kneebone neither man nor woman shall apply that term to me if you forget your sex jade i must forget mine with this he attacked her vigorously in his turn it was a curious sight to see how this extraordinary woman who it has been said was not less remarkable for the extreme delicacy of her features and the faultless symmetry of her figure than for her wonderful strength and agility conducted herself in the present encounter with what dexterity she parried every blow aimed against her by her adversary whose head and face already marked by various ruddy streams showed how successfully her own hits had been madehow she drew him hither and thither now leading him on now driving him suddenly back harassing and exhausting him in every possible way and making it apparent that she could at any moment put an end to the fight and only delayed the finishing stroke to make his punishment the more severe jack meanwhile with blueskins assistance had set the table once more upon its legs and placing writing materials which he took from a shelf upon it made shotbolt who was still gagged but whose arms were for the moment unbound sit down before them write as i dictate he cried placing a pen in the jailers hand and a pistol to his ear shotbolt nodded in token of acquiescence and emitted an odd guttural sound write as follows continued jack i have succeeded in capturing jack sheppard the reward is mine get all ready for his reception in a few minutes after the delivery of this note he will be in newgate sign it he added as after some further threats the letter was indited according to his dictation and direct it to mr austin thats well and now to find a messenger mr kneebones man is in the shop said rachel hell take it can i trust him mused jack yes hell suspect nothing give him this letter child and bid him take it to the lodge at newgate without loss of time blueskin will go with youfor fear of a mistake you might trust me said rachel in an offended tone but never mind and she left the room with blueskin who very politely offered her his arm meanwhile the combat between kneebone and mrs maggot had been brought to a termination when the woollendraper was nearly worn out the amazon watched her opportunity and hitting him on the arm disabled it thats for mrs wood she cried as the staff fell from his grasp im at your mercy poll rejoined kneebone abjectly thats for winifred vociferated the amazon bringing the cudgel heavily upon his shoulder damnation cried kneebone thats for myself rejoined mrs maggot dealing him a blow which stretched him senseless on the floor bravo poll cried jack who having again pinioned shotbolt was now tracing a few hasty lines on a sheet of paper youve given him a broken head i perceive hell scarcely need a plaister replied mrs maggot laughing here bess give me the cord and ill tie him to this chest of drawers i dont think hell come to himself too soon but its best to be on the safe side decidedly so replied edgeworth bess and ill take this opportunity while jacks back is turnedfor hes grown so strangely particularof easing him of his snuffbox perhaps she added in a whisper as she appropriated the beforenamed article he has a pocketbook hush replied mrs maggot jack will hear you well come back for that by and by and the dressinggown at this moment rachel and blueskin returned their momentary absence seemed to have worked wonders for now the most perfect understanding appeared to subsist between them have you sent off the note inquired jack we have captain replied blueskin i say we because miss rachel and i have struck up a match shall i bring off anything he added looking eagerly round no replied jack peremptorily having now sealed his letter sheppard took a handkerchief and tying it over shotbolts face so as completely to conceal the features clapped his hat upon his head and pushed it over his brows he next seized the unlucky jailer and forced him along while blueskin expedited his movements by administering a few kicks behind when they got to the door jack opened it and mimicking the voice of the jailer shouted now my lads alls ready here we are cried the chairmen hurrying out of the court with their swinging vehicle where is he here replied sheppard dragging out shotbolt by the collar while blueskin pushed him behind and mrs maggot held up a lantern which she found in the shop in with him illustration ayay yer honr cried the foremost chairman lending a helping hand get in wid ye ye villin and despite his resistance shotbolt was thrust into the chair which was instantly fastened upon him there hes as safe as jack sheppard in the condemned hould laughed the man off with you to newgate cried jack and dont let him out till you get inside the lodge theres a letter for the head turnkey mr irreton dye hear yes yer honr replied the chairman taking the note what are you waiting for asked jack impatiently the genlman as hired us replied the chairman oh hell be after you directly hes settling an account in the house lose no time the letter will explain all the chair was then rapidly put in motion and speedily disappeared whats to be done next cried blueskin returning to rachel who was standing with edgeworth bess near the door i shall go back and finish my supper said mrs maggot and so shall i replied edgeworth bess stop a minute cried jack detaining his mistresses here we partperhaps for ever ive already told you im about to take a long journey and its more than probable i shall never return dont say so cried mrs maggot i should be perfectly miserable if i thought you in earnest the very idea is dreadful whimpered edgeworth bess farewell cried jack embracing them take this key to baptist kettleby on seeing it hell deliver you a box which it will unlock and in which youll find a matter of fifty guineas and a few trinkets divide the money between you and wear the ornaments for my sake but if youve a spark of love for me dont meddle with anything in that house not for worlds exclaimed both ladies together farewell cried jack breaking from them and rushing down the street what shall we do poll hesitated edgeworth bess go in to be sure simpleton replied mrs maggot and bring off all we can i know where everything valuable is kept since jack has left us what does it matter whether hes pleased or not at this moment a whistle was heard coming cried blueskin who was still lingering with rachel the captains in such a desperate hurry that theres no time for lovemaking adieu my charmer youll find those young ladies extremely agreeable acquaintances adieu and snatching a hasty kiss he darted after jack the chair meanwhile with its unhappy load was transported at a brisk pace to newgate arrived there the porter thundered at the massive door of the lodge which was instantly openedshotbolts note having been received just before all the turnkeys were assembled ireton and langley had returned from a second unsuccessful search marvel had come thither to bid goodnight to mrs spurling austin had never quitted his post the tapstress was full of curiosity but she appeared more easy than the others behind her stood caliban chuckling to himself and grinning from ear to ear well whod have thought of shotbolt beating us all in this way said ireton im sorry for old newgate that another jail should have it its infernally provoking infernally provoking echoed langley nobody has so much cause for complaint as me growled austin ive lost my wager twenty pounds rejoined mrs spurling i witnessed the bet here he is cried ireton as the knocking was heard without get ready the irons caliban wait a bit massa replied the grinning negrolilly bitsee all right fust by this time the chair had been brought into the lodge youve got him demanded ireton safe inside replied the chairman wiping the heat from his brow weve run all the way wheres mr shotbolt asked austin the genlmanll be here directly he was detained t other genlman said the letter ud explain all detained echoed marvel thats odd but lets see the prisoner the chair was then opened shotbolt by cried austin as the captive was dragged forth ive won after all exclamations of wonder burst from all mrs spurling bit her lips to conceal her mirth caliban absolutely crowed with delight hear the letter said ireton breaking the seal this is the way in which i will serve all who attempt to apprehend me it is signed jack sheppard and so jack sheppard has sent back shotbolt in this pickle said langley so it appears replied marvel untie his arms and take off that handkerchief the poor fellows half smothered i guess what share youve had in this whispered austin to mrs spurling never mind replied the tapstress youve won your wager half an hour after this occurrence when it had been sufficiently laughed at and discussed when the wager had been settled and the chairman dismissed with the remaining three guineas which shotbolt was compelled to pay ireton arose and signified his intention of stepping across the street to inform mr wild of the circumstance as its getting late and the porter may be gone to bed he observed ill take the passkey and let myself in mr wild is sure to be up he never retires to rest till daybreakif at all come with me langley and bring the lantern chapter xiv how jack sheppard was again captured jack sheppard after whistling to blueskin hurried down a short thoroughfare leading from wych street to the back of saint clements church where he found thames darrell who advanced to meet him i was just going said thames when i parted from you at mr kneebones door you begged me to await your return here assuring me you would not detain me five minutes instead of which more than half an hour has elapsed you wont complain of the delay when i tell you what ive done answered jack ive obtained two packets containing letters from sir rowland trenchard which ive no doubt will establish your title to the estates take them and may they prove as serviceable to you as i desire jack replied thames greatly moved i wish i could devise any means of brightening your own dark prospects thats impossible replied jack i am utterly lost not utterly rejoined the other utterly reiterated jack gloomilyas regards all i hold dear listen to me thames im about to leave this country for ever having ascertained that a vessel sails for france from the river at daybreak tomorrow morning i have secured a passage in her and have already had the few effects i possess conveyed on board blueskin goes with me the faithful fellow will never leave me never while ive breath in my body captain rejoined blueskin who had joined them england or france london or paris its all one to me so ive you to command me stand out of earshot rejoined his leader ill call you when youre wanted and blueskin withdrew i cannot but approve the course you are about to take jack said thames though on some accounts i regret it in after years you can return to your own countryto your friends never replied sheppard bitterly my friends need not fear my return they shall hear of me no more under another namenot my own hateful onei will strive to distinguish myself in some foreign service and win myself a reputation or perish honourably but i will nevernever return i will not attempt to combat your resolution jack returned thames after a pause but i dread the effect your departure may have upon your poor mother her life hangs upon a thread and this may snap it i wish you hadnt mentioned her said jack in a broken voice while his whole frame shook with emotion what i do is for the best and i can only hope she may have strength to bear the separation you must say farewell to her for i cannot i dont ask you to supply my placefor that is perhaps impossible but be like a son to her do not doubt me replied thames warmly pressing his hand and now ive one further request faltered jack though i scarcely know how to make it it is to set me right with winifred do not let her think worse of me than i deserveor even so ill tell her that more than once when about to commit some desperate offence i have been restrained by her gentle image if hopeless love for her made me a robber it has also saved me many a crime will you tell her that i will replied thames earnestly enough said jack recovering his composure and now to your own concerns blueskin who has been on the watch all night has dogged sir rowland trenchard to jonathan wilds house and from the mysterious manner in which he was admitted by the thieftakers confidential servant abraham mendez and not by the regular porter there is little doubt but they are alone and probably making some arrangements prior to our uncles departure from england is he leaving england demanded thames in astonishment he sails tomorrow morning in the very vessel by which i start replied jack now if as i suspectfrom the documents just placed in your possessionsir rowland meditates doing you justice after his departure it is possible his intentions may be frustrated by the machinations of wild whose interest is obviously to prevent such an occurrence unless we can surprise them together and by proving to sir rowland that we possess the power of compelling a restitution of your rights force the other treacherous villain into compliance jonathan in all probability knows nothing of these packets and their production may serve to intimidate him will you venture it is a hazardous experiment said thames after a moments reflection but i will make it you must not however accompany me jack the risk i run is nothing to yours i care for no risk provided i can serve you rejoined sheppard besides youll not be able to get in without me it wont do to knock at the door and jonathan wilds house is not quite so easy of entrance as mr woods i understand replied thames be it as you will then well lose no more time returned jack come along blueskin starting at a rapid pace in the direction of the old bailey and crossing fleet bridge for oyster tubs renowned the trio skirted the right bank of the muddy stream until they reached fleet lane up which they hurried turning off again on the left down seacoal lane they arrived at the mouth of a dark narrow alley into which they plunged and at the farther extremity found a small yard overlooked by the blank walls of a large gloomy habitation a door in this house opened upon the yard jack tried it and found it locked if i had my old tools with me wed soon master this obstacle he muttered we shall be obliged to force it try the cellar captain said blueskin stamping upon a large board in the ground heres the door this is the way the old thief brings in all his heavy plunder which he stows in outoftheway holes in his infernal dwelling ive seen him often do it while making these remarks blueskin contrived by means of a chisel which he chanced to have about him to lift up the board and introducing his fingers beneath it with jacks assistance speedily opened it altogether disclosing a dark hole into which he leapt follow me thames cried jack dropping into the chasm they were now in a sort of cellar at one end of which was a door it was fastened inside but taking the chisel from blueskin jack quickly forced back the bolt as they entered the room beyond a fierce growl was heard let me go first said blueskin the dogs know me soho boys and walking up to the animals which were chained to the wall they instantly recognised him and suffered the others to pass without barking groping their way through one or two dark and mouldysmelling vaults the party ascended a flight of steps which brought them to the hall as jack conjectured no one was there and though a lamp was burning on a stand they decided upon proceeding without it they then swiftly mounted the stairs and stopped before the audiencechamber applying his ear to the keyhole jack listened but could detect no sound he next cautiously tried the door but found it fastened inside i fear were too late he whispered to thames but well soon see give me the chisel blueskin and dexterously applying the implement he forced open the lock they then entered the room which was perfectly dark this is strange said jack under his breath sir rowland must be gone and yet i dont know the keys in the lock on the inner side be on your guard i am so replied thames who had followed him closely shall i fetch the light captain whispered blueskin yes replied jack i dont know how it is he added in a low voice to thames as they were left alone but ive a strange foreboding of ill my heart fails me i almost wish we hadnt come as he said this he moved forward a few paces when finding his feet glued to the ground by some adhesive substance he stooped to feel what it was but instantly withdrew his hand with an exclamation of horror god in heaven he cried the floor is covered with blood some foul murder has been committed the lightthe light astounded at his cries thames sprang towards him at this moment blueskin appeared with the lamp and revealed a horrible spectaclethe floor deluged with bloodvarious articles of furniture upsetpapers scattered aboutthe murdered mans cloak trampled upon and smeared with gorehis hat crushed and similarly stainedhis swordthe ensanguined clothwith several other ghastly evidences of the slaughterous deed further on there were impressions of bloody footsteps along the floor sir rowland is murdered cried jack as soon as he could find a tongue it is plain he has been destroyed by his perfidious accomplice rejoined thames oh god how fearfully my father is avenged true replied jack sternly but we have our uncle to avenge whats this he added stooping to pick up a piece of paper lying at his feetit was jonathans memorandum this is the explanation of the bloody deed heres a pocketbook full of notes and a heavy bag of gold said blueskin examining the articles on the floor the sum which incited the villain to the murder replied jack but he cant be far off he must be gone to dispose of the body we shall have him on his return ill see where these footsteps lead to said blueskin holding the light to the floor here are some more papers captain give them to me replied jack ah he exclaimed a letter beginning dearest alivathats your mothers name thames let me see it cried thames snatching it from him it is addressed to my mother he added as his eye glanced rapidly over it and by my father at length i shall ascertain my name bring the light this wayquick i cannot decipher the signature jack was about to comply with the request when an unlookedfor interruption occurred having traced the footsteps to the wall and perceiving no outlet blueskin elevated the lamp and discovered marks of bloody fingers on the boards he must have gone this way muttered blueskin ive often heard of a secret door in this room though i never saw it it must be somewhere hereabouts ah he exclaimed as his eye fell upon a small knob in the wall theres the spring he touched it and the door flew open the next moment he was felled to the ground by jonathan wild who sprang into the room followed by abraham bearing the link a single glance served to show the thieftaker how matters stood from the slight sounds that had reached him in his place of confinement he was aware that some persons had found their way to the scene of slaughter and in a state of the most intense anxiety awaited the result of their investigation prepared for the worst hearing the spring touched he dashed through on the instant and struck down the person who presented himself with his bludgeon on beholding the intruders his fears changed to exultation and he uttered a roar of satisfaction as he glared at them which could only be likened to the cry of some savage denizen of the plains on his appearance jack levelled a pistol at his head but his hand was withheld by thames dont fire cried the latter it is important not to slay him he shall expiate his offences on the gibbet you are my prisoner murderer your prisoner echoed jonathan derisively you mistakeyou are mine and so is your companionthe convict sheppard waste not another word with him thames cried jack upon him yield villain or die shouted thames drawing his sword and springing towards him theres my answer rejoined wild hurling the bludgeon at him with such fatal effect that striking him on the head it brought him instantly to the ground ah traitor cried jack pulling the trigger of his pistol anticipating this wild avoided the shot by suddenly ducking his head he had a narrow escape however for passing within an inch of him the bullet burried itself deeply in the wall before he could fire a second shot jack had to defend himself from the thieftaker who with his drawn hanger furiously assaulted him eluding the blow jack plucked his sword from the scabbard and a desperate conflict began pick up that blade nab vociferated wild finding himself hotly pressed and stab him i wont give him a chance cowardly villain cried jack as the jew obeying the orders of his principal snatched up the weapon of the murdered man and assailed him but ill yet disappoint you and springing backwards he darted suddenly through the door after him cried wild he mustnt escape dead or alive ill have him bring the link and followed by abraham he rushed out of the room just as jack got half way down the stairs and wild and the jew reached the upper landing the streetdoor was opened by langley and ireton the latter of whom carried a lantern stop him shouted jonathan from the stairhead stop him its jack sheppard give way cried jack fiercely ill cut down him who opposes me the head turnkey in all probability would have obeyed but being pushed forward by his subordinate officer he was compelled to make a stand youd better surrender quietly jack he cried youve no chance instead of regarding him jack glanced over the iron bannisters and measured the distance but the fall was too great and he abandoned the attempt we have him cried jonathan hurrying down the steps he cant escape as this was said jack turned with the swiftness of thought and shortening his sword prepared to plunge it into the thieftakers heart before he could make the thrust however he was seized behind by ireton who flung himself upon him caught shouted the headturnkey i give you joy of the capture mr wild he added as jonathan came up and assisted him to secure and disarm the prisoner i was coming to give you intelligence of a comical trick played by this rascal when i find him herethe last place i own where i should have expected to find him youve arrived in the very nick of time rejoined jonathan and ill take care your services are not overlooked mr ireton cried jack in accents of the most urgent entreaty before you take me hence i implore youif you would further the ends of justicesearch this house one of the most barbarous murders ever committed has just been perpetrated by the monster wild you will find proofs of the bloody deed in his room but go thither at once i beseech you before he has time to remove them mr ireton is welcome to search every room in my house if he pleases said jonathan in a tone of bravado as soon as weve conveyed you to newgate ill accompany him mr ireton will do no such thing replied the headturnkey bless your soul dye think im to be gammoned by such nonsense not i im not quite such a greenhorn as shotbolt jack whatever you may think for mercys sake go up stairs implored sheppard i have not told you half theres a man dyingcaptain darrell take me with you place a pistol at my ear and shoot me if ive told you false and what good would that do replied ireton sarcastically to shoot you would be to lose the reward you act your part capitally but it wont do wont you go cried jack passionately mr langley i appeal to you murder i say has been done another murder will be committed if you dont prevent it the blood will rest on your head do you hear me sir wont you stir not a step replied langley gruffly off with him to newgate cried jonathan ireton as you captured him the reward is yours but i request that a third may be given to langley it shall be sir replied ireton bowing now come along jack miscreants cried sheppard almost driven frantic by the violence of his emotions youre all in league with him away with him cried jonathan ill see him fettered myself remain at the door nab he added loitering for a moment behind the others and let no one in or out jack meanwhile was carried to newgate austin could scarcely credit his senses when he beheld him shotbolt who had in some degree recovered from the effects of his previous mortification was thrown into an ecstacy of delight and could not sufficiently exult over the prisoner mrs spurling had retired for the night jack appealed to the new auditors and again detailed his story but with no better success than heretofore his statement was treated with derision having seen him heavily ironed and placed in the condemned hold jonathan recrossed the street he found abraham on guard as he had left him has any one been here he asked no von replied the jew thats well replied wild entering the house and fastening the door and now to dispose of our dead why nab you shake as if youd got an ague he added turning to the jew whose teeth chattered audibly i havent quite recovered the fright i got in the vellhole replied abraham on returning to the audiencechamber jonathan found the inanimate body of thames darrell lying where he had left it but on examining it he remarked that the pockets were turned inside out and had evidently been rifled startled by this circumstance he looked around and perceived that the trapdoorwhich has been mentioned as communicating with a secret staircasewas open he next discovered that blueskin was gone and pursuing his scrutiny found that he had carried off all the banknotes gold and lettersincluding what jonathan himself was not aware ofthe two packets which he had abstracted from the person of thames uttering a terrible imprecation jonathan snatched up the link and hastily descended the stairs leaving the jew behind him after a careful search below he could detect no trace of blueskin but finding the cellardoor open concluded he had got out that way returning to the audiencechamber in a bynomeans enviable state of mind he commanded the jew to throw the body of thames into the well hole you musht do dat shob yourself mishter vild rejoined abraham shaking his head no prize shall indushe me to enter dat horrid plashe again fool cried wild taking up the body what are you afraid of after all he added pausing he may be of more use to me alive than dead adhering to this change of plan he ordered abraham to follow him and descending the secret stairs once more carried the wounded man into the lower part of the premises unlocking several doors he came to a dark vault that would have rivalled the gloomiest cell in newgate into which he thrust thames and fastened the door go to the pump nab he said when this was done and fill a pail with water we must wash out those stains up stairs and burn the cloth blood they say wont come out but i never found any truth in the saying when ive had an hours rest ill be after blueskin chapter xv how blueskin underwent the peine forte et dure as soon as it became known through the medium of the public prints on the following day that jack sheppard had broken out of prison and had been again captured during the night fresh curiosity was excited and larger crowds than ever flocked to newgate in the hope of obtaining admission to his cell but by the governors express commands wild having privately counselled the step no one was allowed to see him a question next arose whether the prisoner could be executed under the existing warrantsome inclining to one opinion some to another to settle the point the governor started to windsor delegating his trust in the interim to wild who took advantage of his brief rule to adopt the harshest measures towards the prisoner he had him removed from the condemned hold stripped of his fine apparel clothed in the most sordid rags loaded with additional fetters and thrust into the stone holdalready described as the most noisome cell in the whole prison here without a glimpse of daylight visited by no one except austin at stated intervals who neither answered a question nor addressed a word to him fed upon the worst diet literally mouldy bread and ditchwater surrounded by stone walls with a flagged floor for his pillow and without so much as a blanket to protect him from the deathlike cold that pierced his framejacks stout heart was subdued and he fell into the deepest dejection ardently longing for the time when even a violent death should terminate his sufferings but it was not so ordered mr pitt returned with intelligence that the warrant was delayed and on taking the opinion of two eminent lawyers of the day sir william thomson and mr serjeant raby it was decided that it must be proved in a regular and judicial manner that sheppard was the identical person who had been convicted and had escaped before a fresh order could be made for his execution and that the matter must therefore stand over until the next sessions to be held at the old bailey in october when it could be brought before the court the unfortunate prisoner meanwhile who was not informed of the respite languished in his horrible dungeon and at the expiration of three weeks became so seriously indisposed that it was feared he could not long survive he refused his foodand even when better provisions were offered him rejected them as his death was by no means what jonathan desired he resolved to remove him to a more airy ward and afford him such slight comforts as might tend to his restoration or at least keep him alive until the period of execution with this view jack was carriedfor he was no longer able to move without assistanceto a ward called the castle situated over the gateway on the western side in what was considered the strongest part of the jail the walls were of immense thickness the small windows doublegrated and unglazed the fireplace was without a grate and a barrackbed divided into two compartments occupied one corner it was about twelve feet high nine wide and fourteen long and was approached by double doors each six inches thick as jack appeared to be sinking fast his fetters were removed his own clothes were returned to him and he was allowed a mattress and a scanty supply of bedlinen mrs spurling attended him as his nurse and under her care he speedily revived as soon as he became convalescent and all fears of his premature dissolution were at an end wild recommenced his rigorous treatment the bedding was removed mrs spurling was no longer allowed to visit him he was again loaded with irons fastened by an enormous horsepadlock to a staple in the floor and only allowed to take repose in a chair a single blanket constituted his sole covering at night in spite of all this he grew daily better and stronger and his spirits revived hitherto no visitors had been permitted to see him as the time when his identity had to be proved approached this rigour was in a trifling degree relaxed and a few persons were occasionally admitted to the ward but only in the presence of austin from none of these could jack ascertain what had become of thames or learn any particulars concerning the family at dollis hill or of his mother austin who had been evidently schooled by wild maintained a profound silence on this head in this way more than a month passed over october arrived and in another week the court would be sitting at the old bailey one night about this time just as austin was about to lock the great gate jonathan wild and his two janizaries entered the lodge with a prisoner bound hand and foot it was blueskin on the cords being removed he made a desperate spring at wild bore him to the ground clutched at his throat and would infallibly have strangled him if the keepers had not all thrown themselves upon him and by main force torn him off his struggles were so violent that being a man of tremendous strength it was some time before they could master him and it required the combined efforts of all the four partners to put him into irons it appeared from what he said that he had been captured when asleepthat his liquor had been druggedotherwise he would never have allowed himself to be taken alive wild he asserted had robbed him of a large sum of money and till it was restored he would never plead well see that replied jonathan take him to the bilbowes put him in the stocks and there let him sleep off his drunken fit whether he pleads or not he shall swing with his confederate jack sheppard at this allusion to his leader a shudder passed through blueskins athletic frame where is he he cried let me see him let me have a word with him and you may take all the money jonathan made no answer but motioned the partners to take him away as soon as blueskin was removed wild intimated his intention of visiting the castle he was accompanied by ireton and austin the massive door was unlocked and they entered the cell what was their surprise to find it vacant and the prisoner gone jonathan could scarcely believe his eyes he looked fiercely and inquiringly from one to the other of his companions but though both of them were excessively frightened neither appeared guilty before a word could be said however a slight noise was heard in the chimney and jack with his irons on descended from it without betraying the slightest confusion or making a single remark he quietly resumed his seat amazement cried wild how has he unfastened his padlock austin it must be owing to your negligence my negligence mr wild said the turnkey trembling in every joint i assure you sir when i left him an hour ago it was locked i tried it myself sir im as much astonished as you but i cant account for it at all events you shall answer for it thundered wild with a bitter imprecation hes not to blame said jack rising i opened the padlock with this crooked nail which i found in the floor if you had arrived ten minutes later or if there hadnt been an iron bar in the chimney that hindered my progress i should have been beyond your reach you talk boldly replied wild go to the iron hold austin and tell two of the partners to bring another padlock of the largest size and the heaviest handcuffs they can find well try whether hell get loose again sheppard said nothing but a disdainful smile curled his lips austin departed and presently afterwards returned with the two subordinate officers each of whom wore a leathern apron round his waist and carried a large hammer as soon as the manacles were slipped over the prisoners wrists and the new padlock secured to the staple they withdrew leave me alone with him a moment said jonathan and the jailers also retired jack said wild with a glance of malignant triumph i will now tell you what i have done all my plans have succeeded before a month has elapsed your mother will be mine the trenchard estates will likewise be mine for sir rowland is no more and the youth thames will never again see daylight blueskin who had evaded me with the papers and the money is a prisoner here and will perish on the same gallows as yourself my vengeance is completely gratified without waiting for a reply but darting a malevolent look at the prisoner he quitted the cell the door of which was instantly doublelocked and bolted ive not quite done yet said jonathan as he joined the turnkeys i should like to see whether blueskin is a little more composed ive a question to ask him give me the keys and the light ill go alone so saying he descended a short spiral staircase and entering a long stone gallery from which several other passages branched took one of them and after various turningsfor he was familiar with all the intricacies of the prisonarrived at the cell of which he was in search selecting a key from the heavy bunch committed to him by austin he threw open the door and beheld blueskin seated at the back of the small chamber handcuffed and with his feet confined in a heavy pair of stocks he was asleep when jonathan entered and growled at being disturbed but as soon as he perceived who it was he roused himself and glared fiercely at the intruder from under his bent brows what do you want he asked in a gruff voice i want to know what youve done with the rest of the noteswith the goldand the papers you took away from my room rejoined wild then youll never know more than this retorted blueskin with a grin of satisfactiontheyre in a place of safety where youll never find em but where somebody else will and that before long hear me blueskin said jonathan restraining his choler if youll tell me where to look for these things and i do find them ill set you free and you shall have a share of the gold for yourself ill tell you what ill do rejoined the other set captain sheppard free and when i hear hes safenot beforeill put the money and papers into your possession and some other matters too that you know nothing about impracticable dolt exclaimed jonathan furiously do you think id part with the sweetest morsel of revenge on those terms no but ill have the secret out of you by other means so saying he violently shut and locked the door about ten days after this interview blueskin having been indicted by wild for several robberies and true bills found against him was placed at the bar of the old bailey to be arraigned when he declared that he would not plead to the indictment unless the sum of five hundred pounds taken from him by jonathan wild was first restored to him this sum claimed by wild under the statute th and th of william and mary entitled an act for encouraging the apprehending of highwaymen was granted to him by the court as blueskin still continued obstinate the judgment appointed to be executed upon such prisoners as stood mute was then read it was as follows and when uttered produced a strong effect upon all who heard it except the prisoner who in no respect altered his sullen and dogged demeanour prisoner at the bar thus ran the sentence you shall be taken to the prison from whence you came and put into a mean room stopped from the light and shall there be laid on the bare ground without any litter straw or other covering and without any garment you shall lie upon your back your head shall be covered and your feet shall be bare one of your arms shall be drawn to one side of the room and the other arm to the other side and your legs shall be served in the like manner then there shall be laid upon your body as much iron or stone as you can bear and more and the first day you shall have three morsels of barley bread without any drink and the second day you shall be allowed to drink as much as you can at three times of the water that is next to the prisondoor except runningwater without any bread and this shall be your diet till you die prisoner at the bar continued the clerk of the court he against whom this judgment is given forfeits his goods to the king an awful silence prevailed throughout the court every eye was fixed upon the prisoner but as he made no answer he was removed before the full sentence was carried into execution he was taken into a small room adjoining the court here marvel the executioner who was in attendance was commanded by wild to tie his thumbs together which he did with whipcord so tightly that the string cut to the bone but as this produced no effect and did not even elicit a groan the prisoner was carried back to newgate the press room to which blueskin was conveyed on his arrival at the jail was a small square chamber walled and paved with stone in each corner stood a stout square post reaching to the ceiling to these a heavy wooden apparatus was attached which could be raised or lowered at pleasure by pullies in the floor were set four ringbolts about nine feet apart when the prisoner was brought into this room he was again questioned but continuing contumacious preparations were made for inflicting the torture his great personal strength being so well known it was deemed prudent by marvel to have all the four partners together with caliban in attendance the prisoner however submitted more quietly than was anticipated he allowed his irons and clothes to be taken off without resistance but just as they were about to place him on the ground he burst from their hold and made a desperate spring at jonathan who was standing with his arms folded near the door watching the scene the attempt was unsuccessful he was instantly overpowered and stretched upon the ground the four men fell upon him holding his arms and legs while caliban forced back his head in this state he contrived to get the poor blacks hand into his mouth and nearly bit off one of his fingers before the sufferer could be rescued meanwhile the executioner had attached strong cords to his ankles and wrists and fastened them tightly to the iron rings this done he unloosed the pulley and the ponderous machine which resembled a trough slowly descended upon the prisoners breast marvel then took two iron weights each of a hundred pounds and placed them in the press as this seemed insufficient after a lapse of five minutes he added another hundred weight the prisoner breathed with difficulty still his robust frame enabled him to hold out after he had endured this torture for an hour at a sign from wild another hundred weight was added in a few minutes an appalling change was perceptible the veins in his throat and forehead swelled and blackened his eyes protruded from their sockets and stared wildly a thick damp gathered on his brow and blood gushed from his mouth nostrils and ears water he gasped the executioner shook his head do you submit interrogated wild blueskin answered by dashing his head violently against the flagged floor his efforts at selfdestruction were however prevented try fifty pounds more said jonathan stop groaned blueskin will you plead demanded wild harshly i will answered the prisoner release him said jonathan we have cured his obstinacy you perceive he added to marvel i will live cried blueskin with a look of the deadliest hatred at wild to be revenged on you and as the weights were removed he fainted chapter xvi how jack sheppards portrait was painted early in the morning of thursday the th of october the door of the castle was opened by austin who with a look of unusual importance announced to the prisoner that four gentlemen were shortly coming up with the governor to see himfour such gentlemen he added in a tone meant to impress his auditor with a due sense of the honour intended him as you dont meet every day is mr wood among them asked jack eagerly mr woodno replied the turnkey do you think id take the trouble to announce him these are persons of consequence i tell you who are they inquired sheppard why first rejoined austin theres sir james thornhill historical painter to his majesty and the greatest artist of the day those grand designs in the dome of st pauls are his work so is the roof of the stateroom at hampton court palace occupied by queen anne and the prince of denmark so is the chapel of all souls at oxford and the great hall at blenheim and i dont know how many halls and chapels besides hes now engaged on the hall at greenwich hospital ive heard of him replied jack impatiently who are the others let me see theres a friend of sir jamesa young man an engraver of masquerade tickets and caricatureshis name i believe is hogarth then theres mr gay the poet who wrote the captives which was lately acted at drury lane and was so much admired by the princess of wales and lastly theres mr figg the noted prizefighter from the new amphitheatre in marylebone fields figgs an old friend of mine rejoined jack he was my instructor in the small sword and back sword exercise im glad hes come to see me you dont inquire what brings sir james thornhill here said austin curiosity i suppose returned jack carelessly no such thing rejoined the jailer hes coming on business on what business in the name of wonder asked sheppard to paint your portrait answered the jailer my portrait echoed jack by desire of his majesty said the jailer consequentially he has heard of your wonderful escapes and wishes to see what youre like theres a feather in your cap no housebreaker was ever so highly honoured before and have my escapes really made so much noise as to reach the ear of royalty mused jack i have done nothingnothing to what i could doto what i will do youve done quite enough rejoined austin more than youll ever do again and then to be taken thus in these disgraceful bonds continued jack to be held up as a sight for ever why how else would you be taken exclaimed the jailer with a coarse laugh its very well mr wild allowed you to have your fine clothes again or you might have been taken in a still more disgraceful garb for my part i think those shackles extremely becoming but here they are voices being heard at the door austin flew to open it and admitted mr pitt the governor a tall pompous personage who in his turn ushered in four other individuals the first of these whom he addressed as mr gay was a stout goodlooking goodhumoured man about thirtysix with a dark complexion an oval face fine black eyes full of fire and sensibility and twinkling with roguish humouran expression fully borne out by the mouth which had a very shrewd and sarcastic curl the poets appearance altogether was highly prepossessing with a strong tendency to satire but without a particle of malice or illnature in its display gay by his strokes of pleasantry whether in his writings or conversation never lost a friend on the contrary he was a universal favourite and numbered amongst his intimate acquaintances the choicest spirits of the timepope swift arbuthnot and all the better brothers his demeanour was polished his manners singularly affable and gentle and he was remarkable for the generosity of his temper in worldly matters gay was not fortunate possessed at one time of a share in the south sea stock he conceived himself worth twenty thousand pounds but on the bursting of that bubble his hopes vanished with it neither did his interestwhich was by no means inconsiderablenor his general popularity procure him the preferment he desired a constant attendant at court he had the mortification to see every one promoted but himself and thus bewails his illluck places i found were daily given away and yet no friendly gazette mentioned gay the prodigious success of the beggars opera which was produced about four years after the date of this history rewarded him for all his previous disappointments though it did not fully justify the wellknown epigram alluding to himself and the manager and make gay rich and rich gay at the time of his present introduction his play of the captives had just been produced at drury lane and he was meditating his fables which were published two years afterwards behind the poet came sir james thornhill the eminent painter had handsome expressive features an aquiline nose and a good deal of dignity in his manner his age was not far from fifty he was accompanied by a young man of about sevenandtwenty who carried his easel set it in its place laid the canvass upon it opened the paint box took out the brushes and palette and in short paid him the most assiduous attention this young man whose features though rather plain and coarse bore the strongest impress of genius and who had a dark gray penetrating eye so quick in its glances that it seemed to survey twenty objects at once and yet only to fasten upon one bore the honoured name of william hogarth why he paid so much attention to sir james thornhill may be explained anon the rear of the party was brought up by a large powerfullybuilt man with a bluff honest but rugged countenance slashed with many a cut and scar and stamped with that surly sturdy bulldoglike look which an englishman always delights to contemplate because he conceives it to be characteristic of his countrymen this formidable person who was no other than the renowned figg the atlas of the sword as he is termed by captain godfrey had removed his hat and skull covering and was wiping the heat from his bepatched and closeshaven pate his shirt also was unbuttoned and disclosed a neck like that of an ox and a chest which might have served as a model for a hercules he had a flattish perhaps it should be called a flattened nose and a brown leathernlooking hide that seemed as if it had not unfrequently undergone the process of tanning under his arm he carried a thick knotted crabstick the above description of the great figg by the prizefighting swains sole monarch acknowledged of marybone plains may sound somewhat tame by the side of the glowing account given of him by his gallant biographer who asserts that there was a majesty shone in his countenance and blazed in his actions beyond all i ever saw but it may possibly convey a more accurate notion of his personal appearance james figg was the most perfect master of selfdefence of his day seconded by his strength and temper his skill rendered him invincible and he is reputed never to have lost a battle his imperturbable demeanour in the fight has been well portrayed by captain godfrey who here condescends to lay aside his stilts his right leg bold and firm and his left which could hardly ever be disturbed gave him a surprising advantage and struck his adversary with despair and panic he had a peculiar way of stepping in in a parry knew his arm and its just time of moving put a firm faith in that and never let his opponent escape he was just as much a greater master than any other i ever saw as he was a greater judge of time and measure figgs prowess in a combat with button has been celebrated by dr byroma poet of whom his native town manchester may be justly proud and his features and figure have been preserved by the most illustrious of his companions on the present occasionhogarthin the levee in the rakes progress and in southwark fair on the appearance of his visitors sheppard arosehis gyves clanking heavily as he made the movementand folding his arms so far as his manacles would permit him upon his breast steadily returned the glances fixed upon him this is the noted housebreaker and prisonbreaker gentlemen said mr pitt pointing to the prisoner odds life cried gay in astonishment is this slightmade stripling jack sheppard why i expected to see a man six foot high at the least and as broad across the shoulders as our friend figg this is a mere boy are you sure you havent mistaken the ward mr pitt there is no mistake sir rejoined the prisoner drawing himself up i am jack sheppard well i never was more surprised in my life said the poetnever hes just the man i expected to see observed hogarth who having arranged everything to thornhills satisfaction had turned to look at the prisoner and was now with his chin upon his wrist and his elbow supported by the other hand bending his keen gray eyes upon him just the man look at that light lithe figureall muscle and activity with not an ounce of superfluous flesh upon it in my search after strange characters mr gay ive been in many odd quarters of our cityhave visited haunts frequented only by thievesthe old mint the new mint the worst part of st giless and other placesbut ive nowhere seen any one who came up so completely to my notion of a firstrate housebreaker as the individual before us wherever i saw him i should pick him out as a man designed by nature to plan and accomplish the wonderful escapes he has effected as he spoke a smile crossed sheppards countenance he understands me you perceive said hogarth well i wont dispute your judgment in such matters mr hogarth replied gay but i appeal to you sir james whether it isnt extraordinary that so very slight a person should be such a desperate robber as he is representedso young too for such an old offender why he can scarcely be twenty i am oneandtwenty observed jack oneandtwenty ah repeated gay well im not far from the mark he is certainly extremely youthfullooking and very slightly made said thornhill who had been attentively studying sheppards countenance but i agree with hogarth that he is precisely the person to do what he has done like a thoroughbred racer he would sustain twice as much fatigue as a person of heavier mould can i be accommodated with a seat mr pitt certainly sir james certainly replied the governor get a chair austin while this order was obeyed figg who had been standing near the door made his way to the prisoner and offered him his huge hand which jack warmly grasped well jack said the prizefighter in a rough but friendly voice and with a cutandthrust abrupt manner peculiar to himself how are you lad eh sorry to see you here wouldnt take my advice told you how it would be one mistress enough to ruin a mantwo the devil laughed at me then laugh on the wrong side of your mouth now youre not come here to insult me mr figg said jack peevishly insult you not i returned figg heard of your escapes everybody talking of you wished to see you old pupil capital swordsman shortly to be executed come to take leave trifle useful he added slipping a few gold pieces into jacks hand you are very kind said jack returning the money but i dont require assistance too proud eh rejoined the prizefighter wont be under an obligation there youre wrong mr figg replied jack smiling for before im taken to tyburn i mean to borrow a shirt for the occasion from you have it and welcome rejoined figg always plenty to spare never bought a shirt in my life mr gay he added turning to the poet sold a good many though how do you manage that mr figg asked gay thus replied the prizefighter proclaim a public fight challenge accepted fifty pupils day before send round to each to borrow a shirt fifty sent home all superfine holland wear one on the stage on the following day cut to piecesslashedbloodied each of my scholars thinks it his own shirt offer to return it to each in private all make the same answerdn you keep it an ingenious device laughed gay sir james thornhills preparations being completed mr pitt desired to know if he wanted anything further and being answered in the negative he excused himself on the plea that his attendance was required in the court at the old bailey which was then sitting and withdrew do me the favour to seat yourself jack said sir james gentlemen a little further off if you please sheppard immediately complied with the painters request while gay and figg drew back on one side and hogarth on the other the latter took from his pocket a small notebook and pencil ill make a sketch too he said jack sheppards face is well worth preserving after narrowly examining the countenance of the sitter and motioning him with his pencil into a particular attitude sir james thornhill commenced operations and while he rapidly transferred his lineaments to the canvass engaged him in conversation in the course of which he artfully contrived to draw him into a recital of his adventures the ruse succeeded almost beyond his expectation during the narration jacks features lighted up and an expression which would have been in vain looked for in repose was instantly caught and depicted by the skilful artist all the party were greatly interested by sheppards historyespecially figg who laughed loud and long at the escape from the condemned hold when jack came to speak of jonathan wild his countenance fell we must change the subject remarked thornhill pausing in his task this will never do quite right sir james said austin we never suffer him to mention mr wilds name he never appears to so little advantage as when speaking of him i dont wonder at it rejoined gay here hogarth received a private signal from thornhill to attract sheppards attention and so youve given up all hope of escaping eh jack remarked hogarth thats scarcely a fair question mr hogarth before the jailer replied jack but i tell you frankly and mr austin may repeat it if he pleases to his master jonathan wildi have not well said jack cried figg never give in well observed hogarth if fettered as you are you contrive to break out of this dungeon youll do what no man ever did before a peculiar smile illuminated jacks features there it is cried sir james eagerly theres the exact expression i want for the love of heaven jack dont movedont alter a muscle if you can help it and with a few magical touches he stamped the fleeting expression on the canvass i have it too exclaimed hogarth busily plying his pencil gad its a devilish fine face when lit up as like as life sir observed austin peeping over thornhills shoulder at the portrait as like as life the very face exclaimed gay advancing to look at itwith all the escapes written in it you flatter me smiled sir james but i own i think it is like what do you think of my sketch jack said hogarth handing him the drawing its like enough i dare say rejoined sheppard but it wants something here and he pointed significantly to the hand i see rejoined hogarth rapidly sketching a file which he placed in the hands of the picture will that do he added returning it its better observed sheppard meaningly but youve given me what i dont possess hum said hogarth looking fixedly at him i dont see how i can improve it may i look at it sir said austin stepping towards him no replied hogarth hastily effacing the sketch im never satisfied with a first attempt egad jack said gay you should write your adventures they would be quite as entertaining as the histories of guzman dalfarache lazarillo de tormes estevanillo gonzalez meriton latroon or any of my favourite roguesand far more instructive you had better write them for me mr gay rejoined jack if youll write them ill illustrate them observed hogarth an idea has just occurred to me said gay which jacks narrative has suggested ill write an opera the scene of which shall be laid altogether in newgate and the principal character shall be a highmaywan ill not forget your two mistresses jack nor jonathan wild i hope interposed sheppard certainly not replied gay ill gibbet the rascal but i forget he added glancing at austin its high treason to speak disrespectfully of mr wild in his own domain i hear nothing sir laughed austin i was about to add continued gay that my opera shall have no music except the good old ballad tunes and well see whether it wont put the italian opera out of fashion with cutzoni senesino and the divine farinelli at its head youll do a national service then said hogarth the sums lavished upon those people are perfectly disgraceful and i should be enchanted to see them hooted from the stage but ive an idea as well as you grounded in some measure upon sheppards story ill take two apprentices and depict their career one by perseverance and industry shall obtain fortune credit and the highest honours while the other by an opposite course and dissolute habits shall eventually arrive at tyburn yours will be nearer the truth and have a deeper moral mr hogarth remarked jack dejectedly but if my career were truly exhibited it must be as one long struggle against destiny in the shape of jonathan wild interposed gay i knew it by the by mr hogarth didnt i see you last night at the ridotto with lady thornhill and her pretty daughter meno sir stammered hogarth colouring and he hazarded a wink at the poet over the paper on which he was sketching luckily sir james was so much engrossed by his own task that both the remark and gesture escaped him i suppose i was mistaken returned gay youve been quizzing my friend kent i perceive in your burlington gate a capital caricature that remarked thornhill laughing what does mr kent say to it he thinks so highly of it that he says if he had a daughter he would give her to the artist answered gay a little maliciously ah exclaimed sir james sdeath cried hogarth aside to the poet youve ruined my hopes advanced them rather replied gay in the same tone miss thornhills a charming girl i think a wife a needless incumbrance and mean to die a bachelor but if i were in your place i know what id do whatwhat would you do asked hogarth eagerly run away with her replied gay pish exclaimed hogarth but he afterwards acted upon the suggestion goodbye jack said figg putting on his hat rather in the way send you the shirt here turnkey couple of guineas to drink captain sheppards speedy escape thank him not me man give this fellow the slip if you can jack if not keep up your spirits die game never fear replied jack if i get free ill have a bout with you at all weapons if not ill take a cheerful glass with you at the city of oxford on my way to tyburn give you the best i have in either case replied figg goodbye and with a cordial shake of the hand he took his departure sir james thornhill then rose i wont trouble you further jack he remarked ive done all i can to the portrait here i must finish it at home permit me to see it sir james requested jack ah he exclaimed as the painting was turned towards him what would my poor mother say to it i was sorry to see that about your mother jack observed hogarth what of her exclaimed jack starting up is she dead nono answered hogarth dont alarm yourself i saw it this morning in the daily journalan advertisement offering a reward a reward echoed jack for what i had the paper with me sdeath what can i have done with it oh here it is cried hogarth picking it from the ground i must have dropped it when i took out my notebook theres the paragraph mrs sheppard left mr woods house at dollis hill on tuesdaythats two days agohasnt been heard of since let me see cried jack snatching the paper and eagerly perusing the advertisement ah he exclaimed in a tone of anguish she has fallen into the villains hands what villain cried hogarth jonathan wild ill be sworn said gay rightright cried jack striking his fettered hands against his breast she is in his power and i am here chained hand and foot unable to assist her i could make a fine sketch of him now whispered hogarth to gay i told you how it was sir james said austin addressing the knight who was preparing for his departure he attributes every misfortune that befals him to mr wild and with some justice replied thornhill drily allow me to assist you sir james said hogarth many thanks sir replied thornhill with freezing politeness but id not require assistance i tell you what jack said gay ive several urgent engagements this morning but ill return tomorrow and hear the rest of your story and if i can render you any service you may command me tomorrow will be too late said sheppard moodily the easel and palette having been packed up and the canvass carefully removed by austin the party took leave of the prisoner who was so much abstracted that he scarcely noticed their departure just as hogarth got to the door the turnkey stopped him you have forgotten your knife mr hogarth he observed significantly so i have replied hogarth glancing at sheppard i can do without it muttered jack the door was then locked and he was left alone at three oclock on the same day austin brought up jacks provisions and after carefully examining his fetters and finding all secure told him if he wanted anything further he must mention it as he should not be able to return in the evening his presence being required elsewhere jack replied in the negative and it required all his mastery over himself to prevent the satisfaction which this announcement afforded him from being noticed by the jailer with the usual precautions austin then departed and now cried jack leaping up for an achievement compared with which all i have yet done shall be as nothing chapter xvii the iron bar jack sheppards first object was to free himself from his handcuffs this he accomplished by holding the chain that connected them firmly between his teeth and squeezing his fingers as closely together as possible succeeded in drawing his wrists through the manacles he next twisted the heavy gyves round and round and partly by main strength partly by a dexterous and wellapplied jerk sapped asunder the central link by which they were attached to the padlock taking off his stockings he then drew up the basils as far as he was able and tied the fragments of the broken chain to his legs to prevent them from clanking and impeding his future exertions jacks former attempt to pass up the chimney it may be remembered was obstructed by an iron bar to remove this obstacle it was necessary make an extensive breach in the wall with the broken links of the chain which served him in lieu of more efficient implements he commenced operations just above the chimneypiece and soon contrived to pick a hole in the plaster he found the wall as he suspected solidly constructed of brick and stone and with the slight and inadequate tools which he possessed it was a work of infinite labour and skill to get out a single brick that done however he was well aware the rest would be comparatively easy and as he threw the brick to the ground he exclaimed triumphantly the first step is takenthe main difficulty is overcome animated by this trifling success he proceeded with fresh ardour and the rapidity of his progress was proclaimed by the heap of bricks stones and mortar which before long covered the floor at the expiration of an hour by dint of unremitting exertion he had made so large a breach in the chimney that he could stand upright in it he was now within a foot of the bar and introducing himself into the hole speedily worked his way to it regardless of the risk he incurred from some heavy stone dropping on his head or feetregardless also of the noise made by the falling rubbish and of the imminent danger which he consequently ran of being interrupted by some of the jailers should the sound reach their ears he continued to pull down large masses of the wall which he flung upon the floor of the cell having worked thus for another quarter of an hour without being sensible of fatigue though he was half stifled by the clouds of dust which his exertions raised he had made a hole about three feet wide and six high and uncovered the iron bar grasping it firmly with both hands he quickly wrenched if from the stones in which it was mortised and leapt to the ground on examination it proved to be a flat bar of iron nearly a yard in length and more than an inch square a capital instrument for my purpose thought jack shouldering it and worth all the trouble i have had in procuring it while he was thus musing he fancied he heard the lock tried a chill ran through his frame and grasping the heavy weapon with which chance had provided him prepared to strike down the first person who should enter the cell after listening attentively for a short time without drawing breath he became convinced that his apprehensions were groundless and greatly relieved sat down upon the chair to rest himself and prepare for further efforts acquainted with every part of the jail jack well knew that his only chance of effecting an escape must be by the roof to reach it would be a most difficult undertaking still it was possible and the difficulty was only a fresh incitement the mere enumeration of the obstacles that existed would have deterred any spirit less daring than sheppards from even hazarding the attempt independently of other risks and of the chance of breaking his neck in the descent he was aware that to reach the leads he should have to break open six of the strongest doors of the prison armed however with the implement he had so fortunately obtained he did not despair of success my name will only be remembered as that of a robber he mused but it shall be remembered as that of a bold one and this nights achievement if it does nothing else shall prevent me from being classed with the common herd of depredators roused by this reflection filled with the deepest anxiety for his mother and burning to be avenged upon jonathan wild he grasped the iron bar which when he sat down he had laid upon his knees and stepped quickly across the room in doing so he had to clamber up the immense heap of bricks and rubbish which now littered the floor amounting almost to a carload and reaching up nearly to the top of the chimneypiece austin will stare thought jack when he comes here in the morning it will cost them something to repair their stronghold and take them more time to build it up again than i have taken to pull it down before proceeding with his task he considered whether it would be possible to barricade the door but reflecting that the bar would be an indispensable assistant in his further efforts he abandoned the idea and determined to rely implicitly on that good fortune which had hitherto attended him on similar occasions having once more got into the chimney he climbed to a level with the ward above and recommenced operations as vigorously as before he was now aided with a powerful implement with which he soon contrived to make a hole in the wall every brick i take out cried jack as fresh rubbish clattered down the chimney brings me nearer my mother chapter xviii the red room the ward into which jack was endeavouring to break was called the red room from the circumstance of its walls having once been painted in that colour all traces of which had however long since disappeared like the castle which it resembled in all respects except that it was destitute even of a barrackbedstead the red room was reserved for stateprisoners and had not been occupied since the year when the jail as has before been mentioned was crowded by the preston rebels having made a hole in the wall sufficiently large to pass through jack first tossed the bar into the room and then crept after it as soon as he had gained his feet he glanced round the bare blank walls of the cell and oppressed by the musty close atmosphere exclaimed ill let a little fresh air into this dungeon they say it hasnt been opened for eight yearsbut i wont be eight years in getting out of it in stepping across the room some sharp point in the floor pierced his foot and stooping to examine it he found that the wound had been inflicted by a long rusty nail which projected from the boards totally disregarding the pain he picked up the nail and reserved it for future use nor was he long in making it available on examining the door he found it secured by a large rusty lock which he endeavoured to pick with the nail he had just acquired but all his efforts proving ineffectual he removed the plate that covered it with the bar and with his fingers contrived to draw back the bolt opening the door he then stepped into a dark narrow passage leading as he was well aware to the chapel on the left there were doors communicating with the kings bench ward and the stone ward two large holds on the master debtors side but jack was too well versed in the geography of the place to attempt either of them indeed if he had been ignorant of it the sound of voices which he could faintly distinguish would have served as a caution to him illustration hurrying on his progress was soon checked by a strong door several inches in thickness and nearly as wide as the passage running his hand carefully over it in search of the lock he perceived to his dismay that it was fastened on the other side after several vain attempts to burst it open he resolved as a last alternative to break through the wall in the part nearest to the lock this was a much more serious task than he anticipated the wall was of considerable thickness and built altogether of stone and the noise he was compelled to make in using the heavy bar which brought sparks with every splinter he struck off was so great that he feared it must be heard by the prisoners on the debtors side heedless however of the consequences he pursued his task half an hours labour during which he was obliged more than once to pause to regain breath sufficed to make a hole wide enough to allow a passage for his arm up to the elbow in this way he was able to force back a ponderous bolt from its socket and to his unspeakable joy found that the door instantly yielded once more cheered by daylight he hastened forward and entered the chapel chapter xix the chapel situated at the upper part of the southeast angle of the jail the chapel of old newgate was divided on the north side into three grated compartments or pens as they were termed allotted to the common debtors and felons in the northwest angle there was a small pen for female offenders and on the south a more commodious enclosure appropriated to the masterdebtors and strangers immediately beneath the pulpit stood a large circular pew where malefactors under sentence of death sat to hear the condemned sermon delivered to them and where they formed a public spectacle to the crowds which curiosity generally attracted on those occasions to return jack had got into one of the pens at the north side of the chapel the enclosure by which it was surrounded was about twelve feet high the under part being composed of taken planks the upper of a strong iron grating surmounted by sharp iron spikes in the middle there was a gate it was locked but jack speedily burst it open with the iron bar clearing the few impediments in his way he soon reached the condemned pew where it had once been his fate to sit and extending himself on the seat endeavoured to snatch a moments repose it was denied him for as he closed his eyesthough but for an instantthe whole scene of his former visit to the place rose before him there he sat as before with the heavy fetters on his limbs and beside him sat his three companions who had since expiated their offences on the gibbet the chapel was again crowded with visitors and every eyeeven that of jonathan wild who had come thither to deride himwas fixed upon him so perfect was the illusion that he could almost fancy he heard the solemn voice of the ordinary warning him that his race was nearly run and imploring him to prepare for eternity from this perturbed state he was roused by thoughts of his mother and fancying he heard her gentle voice urging him on to fresh exertion he started up on one side of the chapel there was a large grated window but as it looked upon the interior of the jail jack preferred following the course he had originally decided upon to making any attempt in this quarter accordingly he proceeded to a gate which stood upon the south and guarded the passage communicating with the leads it was grated and crested with spikes like that he had just burst open and thinking it a needless waste of time to force it he broke off one of the spikes which he carried with him for further purposes and then climbed over it a short flight of steps brought him to a dark passage into which he plunged here he found another strong door making the fifth he had encountered well aware that the doors in this passage were much stronger than those in the entry he had just quitted he was neither surprised nor dismayed to find it fastened by a lock of unusual size after repeatedly trying to remove the plate which was so firmly screwed down that it resisted all his efforts and vainly attempting to pick it with the spike and nail he at length after half an hours ineffectual labour wrenched off the box by means of the iron bar and the door as he laughingly expressed it became his humble servant but this difficulty was only overcome to be succeeded by one still greater hastening along the passage he came to the sixth door for this he was prepared but he was not prepared for the almost insurmountable obstacles which it presented running his hand hastily over it he was startled to find it one complicated mass of bolts and bars it seemed as if all the precautions previously taken were here accumulated any one less courageous than himself would have abandoned the attempt from a conviction of its utter hopelessness but though it might for a moment damp his ardour it could not deter him once again he passed his hand over the surface and carefully noted all the obstacles there was a lock apparently more than a foot wide strongly plated and girded to the door with thick iron hoops below it a prodigiously large bolt was shot into the socket and in order to keep it there was fastened by a hasp and further protected by an immense padlock besides this the door was crossed and recrossed by iron bars clenched by broadheaded nails an iron fillet secured the socket of the bolt and the box of the lock to the main post of the doorway nothing disheartened by this survey jack set to work upon the lock which he attacked with all his implementsnow attempting to pick it with the nailnow to wrench it off with the bar but all without effect he not only failed in making any impression but seemed to increase the difficulties for after an hours toil he had broken the nail and slightly bent the iron bar completely overcome by fatigue with strained muscles and bruised hands streaming with perspiration and with lips so parched that he would gladly have parted with a treasure if he had possessed it for a draught of water he sank against the wall and while in this state was seized with a sudden and strange alarm he fancied that the turnkeys had discovered his flight and were in pursuit of himthat they had climbed up the chimneyentered the red roomtracked him from door to door and were now only detained by the gate which he had left unbroken in the chapel he even thought he could detect the voice of jonathan urging and directing them illustration so strongly was he impressed with this idea that grasping the iron bar with both hands he dashed it furiously against the door making the passage echo with the blows by degrees his fears vanished and hearing nothing he grew calmer his spirits revived and encouraging himself with the idea that the present impediment though the greatest was the last he set himself seriously to consider how it might best be overcome on reflection it occurred to him that he might perhaps be able to loosen the iron fillet a notion no sooner conceived than executed with incredible labour and by the aid of both spike and nail he succeeded in getting the point of the bar beneath the fillet exerting all his energies and using the bar as a lever he forced off the iron band which was full seven feet high seven inches wide and two thick and which brought with it in its fall the box of the lock and the socket of the bolt leaving no further hinderance overjoyed beyond measure at having vanquished this apparentlyinsurmountable obstacle jack darted through the door chapter xx the leads ascending a short flight of steps jack found at the summit a door which being bolted in the inside he speedily opened the fresh air which blew in his face greatly revived him he had now reached what was called the lower leadsa flat covering a part of the prison contiguous to the gateway and surrounded on all sides by walls about fourteen feet high on the north stood the battlements of one of the towers of the gate on this side a flight of wooden steps protected by a handrail led to a door opening upon the summit of the prison this door was crested with spikes and guarded on the right by a bristling semicircle of spikes hastily ascending these steps jack found the door as he anticipated locked he could have easily forced it but preferred a more expeditious mode of reaching the roof which suggested itself to him mounting the door he had last opened he placed his hands on the wall above and quickly drew himself up just as he got on the roof of the prison st sepulchres clock struck eight it was instantly answered by the deep note of st pauls and the concert was prolonged by other neighbouring churches jack had thus been six hours in accomplishing his arduous task though nearly dark there was still light enough left to enable him to discern surrounding objects through the gloom he distinctly perceived the dome of st pauls hanging like a black cloud in the air and nearer to him he remarked the golden ball on the summit of the college of physicians compared by garth to a gilded pill other towers and spiresst martins on ludgatehill and christchurch in newgate street were also distinguishable as he gazed down into the courts of the prison he could not help shuddering lest a false step might precipitate him below to prevent the recurrence of any such escape as that just described it was deemed expedient in more recent times to keep a watchman at the top of newgate not many years ago two men employed on this duty quarrelled during the night and in the morning their bodies were found stretched upon the pavement of the yard beneath proceeding along the wall jack reached the southern tower over the battlements of which he clambered and crossing it dropped upon the roof of the gate he then scaled the northern tower and made his way to the summit of that part of the prison which fronted giltspur street arrived at the extremity of the building he found that it overlooked the flatroof of a house which as far as he could judge in the darkness lay at a depth of about twenty feet below not choosing to hazard so great a fall jack turned to examine the building to see whether any more favourable point of descent presented itself but could discover nothing but steep walls without a single available projection as he looked around he beheld an incessant stream of passengers hurrying on below lights glimmered in the windows of the different houses and a lamplighter was running from post to post on his way to snow hill finding it impossible to descend on any side without incurring serious risk jack resolved to return for his blanket by the help of which he felt certain of accomplishing a safe landing on the roof of the house in giltspur street accordingly he began to retrace his steps and pursuing the course he had recently taken scaling the two towers and passing along the wall of the prison he descended by means of the door upon the lower leads before he reentered the prison he hesitated from a doubt whether he was not fearfully increasing his risk of capture but convinced that he had no other alternative he went on during all this time he had never quitted the iron bar and he now grasped it with the firm determination of selling his life dearly if he met with any opposition a few seconds sufficed to clear the passage through which it had previously cost him more than two hours to force his way the floor was strewn with screws nails fragments of wood and stone and across the passage lay the heavy iron fillet he did not disturb any of this litter but left it as a mark of his prowess he was now at the entrance of the chapel and striking the door over which he had previously climbed a violent blow with the bar it flew open to vault over the pews was the work of a moment and having gained the entry leading to the red room he passed through the first door his progress being only impeded by the pile of broken stones which he himself had raised listening at one of the doors leading to the master debtors side he heard a loud voice chanting a bacchanalian melody and the boisterous laughter that accompanied the song convinced him that no suspicion was entertained in this quarter entering the red room he crept through the hole in the wall descended the chimney and arrived once more in his old place of captivity how different were his present feelings compared with those he had experienced on quitting it then though full of confidence he half doubted his power of accomplishing his designs now he had achieved them and felt assured of success the vast heap of rubbish on the floor had been so materially increased by the bricks and plaster thrown down in his attack upon the wall of the red room that it was with some difficulty he could find the blanket which was almost buried beneath the pile he next searched for his stockings and shoes and when found put them on while he was thus employed his nerves underwent a severe shock a few bricks dislodged probably by his last descent came clattering down the chimney and as it was perfectly dark gave him the notion that some one was endeavouring to force an entrance into the room but these fears like those he had recently experienced speedily vanished and he prepared to return to the roof congratulating himself that owing to the opportune falling of the bricks he had in all probability escaped serious injury throwing the blanket over his left arm and shouldering the iron bar he again clambered up the chimney regained the red room hurried along the first passage crossed the chapel threaded the entry to the lower leads and in less than ten minutes after quitting the castle had reached the northern extremity of the prison illustration previously to his descent he had left the nail and spike on the wall and with these he fastened the blanket to the stone coping this done he let himself carefully down by it and having only a few feet to drop alighted in safety having now fairly got out of newgate for the second time with a heart throbbing with exultation he hastened to make good his escape to his great joy he found a small garretdoor in the roof of the opposite house open he entered it crossed the room in which there was only a small trucklebed over which he stumbled opened another door and gained the stairhead as he was about to descend his chains slightly rattled oh lud whats that exclaimed a female voice from an adjoining room only the dog replied the rough tones of a man securing the chain in the best way he could jack then hurried down two pair of stairs and had nearly reached the lobby when a door suddenly opened and two persons appeared one of whom held a light retreating as quickly as he could jack opened the first door he came to entered a room and searching in the dark for some place of concealment fortunately discovered a skreen behind which he crept chapter xxi what befell jack sheppard in the turners house jack was scarcely concealed when the door opened and the two persons of whom he had caught a glimpse below entered the room what was his astonishment to recognise in the few words they uttered the voices of kneebone and winifred the latter was apparently in great distress and the former seemed to be using his best efforts to relieve her anxiety how very fortunate it is he observed that i happened to call upon mr bird the turner to give him an order this evening it was quite an unexpected pleasure to meet you and your worthy father pray cease these compliments returned winifred and if you have any communication to make do not delay it you told me just now that you wished to speak a few words to me in private concerning thames darrell and for that purpose i have left my father below with mr bird and have come hither what have you got to say too much replied kneebone shaking his head sadly too much do not needlessly alarm me i beseech you replied winifred whatever your intelligence may be i will strive to bear it but do not awaken my apprehension unless you have good cause for so doingwhat do you know of thameswhere is he dont agitate yourself dearest girl rejoined the woollendraper or i shall never be able to commence my relation i am calmperfectly calm replied winifred pray make no further mystery but tell me all without reserve since you require it i must obey replied kneebone but prepare yourself for a terrible shock for mercys sake go on cried winifred at all hazards then then you shall know the truth replied the woollendraper in a tone of affected solicitudebut are you really prepared quitequite replied winifred this suspense is worse than torture i am almost afraid to utter it said kneebone but thames darrell is murdered murdered ejaculated winifred basely and inhumanly murdered by jack sheppard and blueskin continued kneebone oh nonono cried winifred i cannot believe it you must be misinformed mr kneebone jack may be capable of much that is wicked but he would never lift his hand against his friendof that i am assured generous girl cried jack from behind the skreen i have proofs to the contrary replied kneebone the murder was committed after the robbery of my house by sheppard and his accomplices i did not choose to mention my knowledge of this fact to your worthy father but you may rely on its correctness you were right not to mention it to him rejoined winifred for he is in such a state of distress at the mysterious disappearance of mrs sheppard that i fear any further anxiety might prove fatal to him and yet i know notfor the object of his visit here tonight was to serve jack who if your statement is correct which i cannot however for a moment believe does not deserve his assistance you may rest assured he does not rejoined kneebone emphatically but i am at a loss to understand in what way your father proposes to assist him mr bird the turner who is an old friend of ours has some acquaintance with the turnkeys of newgate replied winifred and by his means my father hoped to convey some implements to jack by which he might effect another escape i see remarked kneebone this must be prevented he added to himself heaven grant you may have been wrongly informed with respect to thames exclaimed winifred but i beseech you on no account to mention what you have told me to my poor father he is not in a state of mind to bear it rely on me rejoined kneebone one word before we part adorable girlonly one he continued detaining her i would not venture to renew my suit while thames lived because i well knew your affections were fixed upon him but now that this bar is removed i trust i may without impropriety urge it no more of this said winifred angrily is this a season to speak on such a subject perhaps not rejoined the woollendraper but the uncontrollable violence of my passion must plead my excuse my whole life shall be devoted to you beloved girl and when you reflect how much at heart your poor mother whose loss we must ever deplore had our union you will i am persuaded no longer refuse me sir exclaimed winifred you will make me the happiest of mankind cried the woollendraper falling on his knees and seizing her hand which he devoured with kisses let me go cried winifred i disbelieve the whole story you have told me by heaven cried kneebone with increasing fervour it is trueas true as my affection for you i do not doubt it retorted winifred scornfully because i attach credit neither to one nor the other if thames is murdered you are his assassin let me go sir the woollendraper made no answer but hastily starting up bolted the door what do you mean cried winifred in alarm nothing more than to obtain a favourable answer to my suit replied kneebone this is not the way to obtain it said winifred endeavouring to reach the door you shall not go adorable girl cried kneebone catching her in his arms till you have answered me you mustyou shall be mine never replied winifred release me instantly or i will call my father do so replied kneebone but remember the door is locked monster cried winifred help help you call in vain returned kneebone not so replied jack throwing down the skreen release her instantly villain both winifred and her suitor started at this sudden apparition jack whose clothes were covered with dust and whose face was deathly pale from his recent exertion looked more like a phantom than a living person in the devils name is that you jack ejaculated kneebone it is replied sheppard you have uttered a wilful and deliberate falsehood in asserting that i have murdered thames for whom you well know i would lay down my life retract your words instantly or take the consequences what should i retract villain cried the woollendraper who at the sound of jacks voice had regained his confidence to the best of my belief thames darrell has been murdered by you a lie exclaimed jack in a terrible tone and before kneebone could draw his sword he felled him to the ground with the iron bar you have killed him cried winifred in alarm no answered jack approaching her though if i had done so he would have merited his fate you do not believe his statement i do not replied winifred i could not believe you capable of so foul a deed but oh by what wonderful chance have you come hither so seasonably i have just escaped from newgate replied jack and am more than repaid for the severe toil i have undergone in being able to save you but tell me he added with much anxiety has nothing been heard of thames since the night of my former escape nothing whatever answered winifred he left dollis hill at ten oclock on that night and has not since returned my father has made every possible inquiry and offered large rewards but has not been able to discover the slightest trace of him his suspicions at first fell upon you but he has since acquitted you of any share in it oh heaven exclaimed jack he has been indefatigable in his search continued winifred and has even journeyed to manchester but though he visited sir rowland trenchards seat ashton hall he could gain no tidings of him or of his uncle sir rowland who it seems has left the country never to return remarked jack gloomily before tomorrow morning i will ascertain what has become of thames or perish in the attempt and now tell me what has happened to my poor mother ever since your last capture and thamess mysterious disappearance she has been dreadfully ill replied winifred so ill that each day was expected to be her last she has also been afflicted with occasional returns of her terrible malady on tuesday night she was rather better and i had left her for a short time as i thought asleep on the sofa in the little parlour of which she is so fond well exclaimed jack on my return i found the window open and the room vacant she was gone did you discover any trace of footsteps inquired jack eagerly there were some marks near the window but whether recently made or not could not be ascertained replied winifred oh god exclaimed jack in a tone of the bitterest anguish my worst fears are realized she is in wilds power i ought to add continued winifred that one of her shoes was picked up in the garden and that prints of her feet were discovered along the soft mould whether made in flying from any one or from rushing forth in distracted terror it is impossible to say my father thought the latter he has had the whole country searched but hitherto without success i know where she will be found and how rejoined jack with a shudder i have something further to tell you pursued winifred shortly after your last visit to dollis hill my father was one evening waylaid by a man who informed him that he had something to communicate respecting thames and had a large sum of money and some important documents to deliver to him which would be given up provided he would undertake to procure your liberation it was blueskin observed jack so my father thought replied winifred and he therefore instantly fired upon him but though the shot took effect as was evident from the stains on the ground the villain escaped your father did right replied jack with some bitterness but if he had not fired that shot he might have saved thames and possessed himself of papers which would have established his birth and his right to the estates of the trenchard family would you have had him spare my mothers murderer cried winifred ho no replied jack and yetbut it is only part of the chain of illluck that seems wound around me listen to me winifred and he hastily related the occurrences in jonathan wilds house the account of the discovery of sir rowlands murder filled winifred with alarm but when she learnt what had befallen thameshow he had been stricken down by the thieftakers bludgeon and left for dead she uttered a piercing scream fainted and would have fallen if jack had not caught her in his arms jack had wellnigh fallen too the idea that he held in his arms the girl whom he had once so passionately loved and for whom he still retained an ardent but hopeless attachment almost overcame him gazing at her with eyes blinded with tears he imprinted one brotherly kiss upon her lips it was the firstand the last at this juncture the handle of the door was tried and the voice of mr wood was heard without angrily demanding admittance whats the matter he cried i thought i heard a scream why is the door fastened open it directly are you alone asked jack mimicking the voice of kneebone what for demanded wood open the door i say or ill burst it open carefully depositing winifred on a sofa jack then extinguished the light and as he unfastened the door crept behind it in rushed mr wood with a candle in his hand which jack instantly blew out and darted down stairs he upset some oneprobably mr birdwho was rushing up stairs alarmed by mr woods cries but regardless of this he darted along a passage gained the shop and passed through an open door into the street and thus he was once more free having effected one of the most wonderful escapes ever planned or accomplished chapter xxii fast and loose about seven oclock on the same night jonathan wilds two janizaries who had been for some time in attendance in the hall of his dwelling at the old bailey were summoned to the audiencechamber a long and secret conference then took place between the thieftaker and his myrmidons after which they were severally dismissed left alone jonathan lighted a lamp and opening the trapdoor descended the secret stairs taking the opposite course from that which he had hitherto pursued when it has been necessary to attend him in his visits to the lower part of his premises he struck into a narrow passage on the right which he tracked till he came to a small door like the approach to a vault unlocking it he entered the chamber which by no means belied its external appearance on a pallet in one corner lay a pale emaciated female holding the lamp over her rigid but beautiful features jonathan with some anxiety placed his hand upon her breast to ascertain whether the heart still beat satisfied with his scrutiny he produced a pocketflask and taking off the silver cup with which it was mounted filled it with the contents of the flask and then seizing the thin arm of the sleeper rudely shook it opening her large black eyes she fixed them upon him for a moment with a mixture of terror and loathing and then averted her gaze drink this cried jonathan handing her the cup youll feel better after it mechanically raising the potion to her lips the poor creature swallowed it without hesitation is it poison she asked no replied jonathan with a brutal laugh im not going to get rid of you just yet its gina liquor you used to like youll find the benefit of it by and by youve a good deal to go through tonight ah exclaimed mrs sheppard are you come to renew your terrible proposals im come to execute my threats replied wild tonight you shall be my wedded wife i will die first replied mrs sheppard you may die afterwards as soon as you please retorted jonathan but live till then you shall ive sent for the priest mercy cried mrs sheppard vainly trying to discover a gleam of compassion in the thieftakers inexorable countenancemercy mercy pshaw rejoined jonathan you should be glad to be made an honest woman oh let me die groaned the widow i have not many daysperhaps not many hours to live but kill me rather than commit this outrage that wouldnt answer my purpose replied jonathan savagely i didnt carry you off from old wood to kill you but to wed you what motive can you have for so vile a deed asked mrs sheppard you know my motive well enough answered jonathan however ill refresh your memory i once might have married you for your beautynow i marry you for your wealth my wealth replied mrs sheppard i have nothing you are heiress to the trenchard property rejoined jonathan one of the largest estates in lancashire not while thames darrell and sir rowland live sir rowland is dead replied jonathan gloomily thames darrell only waits my mandate to follow him before our marriage there will be no life between you and the estates ah exclaimed mrs sheppard look here cried jonathan stooping down and taking hold of a ring in the floor with which by a great effort he raised up a flag in this pit he added pointing to the chasm below your brother is buried here your nephew will speedily be thrown horrible cried mrs sheppard shuddering violently but your dreadful projects will recoil on your own head heaven will not permit the continuance of such wickedness as you practise ill take my chance replied jonathan with a sinister smile my schemes have succeeded tolerably well hitherto a day of retribution will assuredly arrive rejoined mrs sheppard till then i shall remain content returned wild and now mrs sheppard attend to what im about to say to you years ago when you were a girl and in the bloom of your beauty i loved you loved me you i loved you continued jonathan and struck by your appearance which seemed above your station inquired your history and found you had been stolen by a gipsy in lancashire i proceeded to manchester to investigate the matter further and when there ascertained beyond a doubt that you were the eldest daughter of sir montacute trenchard this discovery made i hastened back to london to offer you my hand but found you had married in the mean time a smockfaced smoothtongued carpenter named sheppard the important secret remained locked in my breast but i resolved to be avenged i swore i would bring your husband to the gallowswould plunge you in such want such distress that you should have no alternative but the last frightful resource of miseryand i also swore that if you had a son he should share the same fate as his father and terribly you have kept your vow replied mrs sheppard i have replied jonathan but i am now coming to the point which most concerns you consent to become my wife and do not compel me to have recourse to violence to effect my purpose and i will spare your son mrs sheppard looked fixedly at him as if she would penetrate the gloomy depth of his soul swear that you will do this she cried i swear it rejoined jonathan readily but what is an oath to you cried the widow distrustfully you will not hesitate to break it if it suits your purpose i have suffered too much from your treachery i will not trust you as you please replied jonathan sternly recollect you are in my power jacks life hangs on your determination what shall i do cried mrs sheppard in a voice of agony save him replied jonathan you can do so bring him herelet me see himlet me embrace himlet me be assured that he is safe and i am yours i swear it hum exclaimed jonathan you hesitateyou are deceiving me by my soul no replied jonathan with affected sincerity you shall see him tomorrow delay the marriage till then i will never consent till i see him you ask impossibilities replied jonathan sullenly all is prepared the marriage cannotshall not be delayed you must be mine tonight force shall not make me yours till jack is free replied the widow resolutely an hour hence i shall return with the priest replied jonathan striding towards the door and with a glance of malignant exultation he quitted the vault and locked the door an hour hence i shall be beyond your malice said mrs sheppard sinking backwards upon the pallet chapter xxiii the last meeting between jack sheppard and his mother after escaping from the turners house jack sheppard skirted st sepulchres church and hurrying down snow hill darted into the first turning on the left traversing angel court and green arbour courtcelebrated as one of goldsmiths retreatshe speedily reached seacoal lane and pursuing the same course which he and thames had formerly taken arrived at the yard at the back of jonathans habitation a door it may be remembered opened from wilds dwelling into this yard before he forced an entrance jack tried it and to his great surprise and delight found it unfastened entering the house he found himself in a narrow passage leading to the back stairs he had not taken many steps when he perceived quilt arnold in the upper gallery with a lamp in his hand hearing a noise below quilt called out supposing it occasioned by the jew jack hastily retreated and taking the first means of concealment that occurred to him descended the cellar steps quilt meanwhile came down examined the door and finding it unfastened locked it with a bitter imprecation on his brotherjanizarys carelessness this done he followed the course which jack had just taken as he crossed the cellar he passed so near to jack who had concealed himself behind a piece of furniture that he almost touched him it was jacks intention to have knocked him down with the iron bar but he was so struck with the janizarys looks that he determined to spare him till he had ascertained his purpose with this view he suffered him to pass on quilts manner indeed was that of a man endeavouring to muster up sufficient resolution for the commission of some desperate crime he haltedlooked fearfully aroundstopped again and exclaimed aloud i dont like the job and yet it must be done or mr wild will hang me with this he appeared to pluck up his courage and stepped forward more boldly some dreadful deed is about to be committed which i may perhaps prevent muttered jack to himself heaven grant i may not be too late followed by jack sheppard who kept sufficiently near him to watch his proceedings and yet not expose himself quilt unlocked one or two doors which he left open and after winding his way along a gloomy passage arrived at the door of a vault here he set down the lamp and took out a key and as he did so the expression of his countenance was so atrocious that jack felt assured he was not wrong in his suspicions by this time the door was unlocked and drawing his sword quilt entered the cell the next moment an exclamation was heard in the voice of thames darting forward at this sound jack threw open the door and beheld quilt kneeling over thames whose hands and feet were bound with cords and about to plunge his sword into his breast a blow from the iron bar instantly stretched the ruffian on the floor jack then proceeded to liberate the captive from his bondage jack exclaimed thames is it you it is replied sheppard as he untied the cords i might return the question were it not for your voice i dont think i should know you you are greatly altered captivity had indeed produced a striking alteration in thames he looked like the shadow of himselfthin feeble holloweyedhis beard unshornnothing could be more miserable i have never been out of this horrible dungeon since we last met he said though how long ago that is i scarcely know night and day have been alike to me six weeks have elapsed since that fatal night replied jack during the whole of that time i have been a close prisoner in newgate whence i have only just escaped six weeks exclaimed thames in a melancholy tone it seems like six long months to me i do not doubt it returned jack none but those who have experienced it can understand the miseries of imprisonment do not speak of it rejoined thames with a look of horror let us fly from this frightful place i will conduct you to the outlet replied jack but i cannot leave it till i have ascertained whether my mother also is a prisoner here i can answer that replied thames she is the monster wild when he visited my dungeon last night told me to add to my misery that she occupied a cell near me arm yourself with that ruffians weapons replied jack and let us search for her thames complied but he was so feeble that it seemed scarcely possible he could offer any effectual resistance in case of an attack lean on me said jack taking the light they then proceeded along the passage there was no other door in it and jack therefore struck into another entry which branched off to the right they had not proceeded far when a low moan was heard she is here cried jack darting forward a few steps brought him to the door of the vault in which his mother was immured it was locked jack had brought away the bunch of keys which he had taken from quilt arnold but none of them would open it he was therefore obliged to use the iron bar which he did with as much caution as circumstances would permit at the first blow mrs sheppard uttered a piercing scream wretch she cried you shall not force me to your hateful purpose i will never wed you i have a weapona knifeand if you attempt to open the door will plunge it to my heart oh god exclaimed jack paralysed by her cries what shall i do if i persist i shall destroy her get hence continued mrs sheppard with a frenzied laugh you shall never behold me alive mother cried jack in a broken voice it is your son it is false cried mrs sheppard think not to deceive me monster i know my sons voice too well he is in newgate hence mother dear mother cried jack in a voice the tones of which were altered by his very anxiety to make them distinct listen to me i have broken from prison and am come to save you it is not jacks voice rejoined mrs sheppard i am not to be deceived the knife is at my breast stir a foot and i strike oh heavens cried jack driven to his wits end motherdear mother once again i beseech you to listen to me i am come to rescue you from wilds violence i must break open the door hold your hand for a moment you have heard my fixed determination villain cried mrs sheppard i know my life is valuable to you or you would not spare it but i will disappoint you get you gone your purposes are defeated footsteps are approaching cried thames heed her not it is but a wild threat i know not how to act exclaimed jack almost driven to desperation i hear you plotting with your wicked associates cried mrs sheppard i have baffled you force the door said thames or you will be too late better she die by her own hand than by that monsters cried jack brandishing the bar mother i come to you with this he struck the door a heavy blow he listened there was a deep groan and the sound of a fall within i have killed her exclaimed jack dropping the barby your advice thames oh god pardon me do not delay cried thames she may yet be saved i am too weak to aid you jack again seized the bar and dashing it furiously against the door speedily burst it open the unfortunate woman was stretched upon the floor with a bloody knife in her hand mother cried jack springing towards her jack she cried raising her head is it you it is replied her son oh why would you not listen to me i was distracted replied mrs sheppard faintly i have killed you cried jack endeavouring to staunch the effusion of blood from her breast forgiveforgive me i have nothing to forgive replied mrs sheppard i alone am to blame can i not carry you where you can obtain help cried jack in a agony of distress it is useless replied mrs sheppard nothing can save me i die happyquite happy in beholding you do not remain with me you may fall into the hands of your enemy fly fly do not think of me mother but of yourself cried jack in an agony of tears you have always been far dearer to me than myself replied mrs sheppard but i have one last request to make let me lie in willesden churchyard you shallyou shall answered jack we shall meet again ere long my son cried mrs sheppard fixing her glazing eyes upon him oh god she is dying exclaimed jack in a voice suffocated by emotion forgive meoh forgive me forgive youbless you she gasped a cold shiver ran through her frame and her gentle spirit passed away for ever oh god that i might die too cried jack falling on his knees beside her after the first violent outbreak of grief had in some degree subsided thames addressed him you must not remain here he said you can render no further service to your poor mother i can avenge her cried jack in a terrible tone be ruled by me returned thames you will act most in accordance with her wishes could she dictate them by compliance do not waste time in vain regrets but let us remove the body that we may fulfil her last injunctions after some further arguments jack assented to this proposal go on first with the light he said i will bear the body and he raised it in his arms just as they reached the end of the passage they heard the voices of jonathan and the jew in thamess late place of confinement wild had evidently discovered the body of quilt arnold and was loudly expressing his anger and astonishment extinguish the light cried jack turn to the left quick quick the order was only just given in time they had scarcely gained the adjoining cellar when jonathan and the jew rushed past in the direction of the vault not a moment is to be lost cried jack follow me so saying he hurried up stairs opened the back door and was quickly in the yard having ascertained that thames was at his heels he hurried with his ghastly burthen down seacoal lane where are you going cried thames who though wholly disencumbered was scarcely able to keep up with him i know notand care not replied jack at this moment a coach passed them and was instantly hailed by thames you had better let me convey her to dollis hill he said be it so replied jack luckily it was so dark and there was no lamp near that the man did not notice the condition of the body which was placed in the vehicle by the two young men what will you do asked thames leave me to my fate rejoined jack take care of your charge doubt me not replied thames bury her in willesden churchyard as she requested on sunday said jack i will be there at the time so saying he closed the door the coachman having received his order and being offered an extra fare if he drove quickly set off at full speed as jack departed a dark figure emerging from behind a wall rushed after him chapter xxiv the pursuit after running to some distance down seacoal lane jack stopped to give a last look at the vehicle which was bearing away the remains of his beloved and illfated mother it was scarcely out of sight when two persons whom he instantly recognised as jonathan and abraham mendez turned the corner of the street and made it evident from their shouts that they likewise perceived him starting off at a rapid pace jack dashed down turnagainlane skirted the eastern bank of fleetditch crossed holborn bridge and began to ascend the neighbouring hill by the time he had reached st andrews church his pursuers had gained the bridge and the attention of such passengers as crowded the streets was attracted towards him by their vociferations amongst others the watchman whose box was placed against the churchyard wall near the entrance to shoelane rushed out and sprung his rattle which was immediately answered by another rattle from holbornbars darting down fieldlane jack struck into a labyrinth of streets on the left but though he ran as swiftly as he could he was not unperceived his course had been observed by the watchman who directed wild which way to take it is jack sheppard the noted housebreaker cried jonathan at the top of his sonorous voice he has just broken out of newgate after him a hundred pounds to the man who takes him sheppards name operated like magic on the crowd the cry was echoed by twenty different voices people ran out of their shops to join the pursuit and by the time wild had got into fieldlane he had a troop of fifty persons at his heelsall eager to assist in the capture stop thief roared jonathan who perceived the fugitive hurrying along a street towards hatton garden it is sheppardjack sheppardstop him and his shouts were reiterated by the pack of bloodhounds at his heels jack meanwhile heard the shouts and though alarmed by them held on a steady course by various twistings and turnings during all which time his pursuers who were greatly increased in numbers kept him in view he reached graysinnlane here he was hotly pursued fatigued by his previous exertions and incumbered by his fetters he was by no meansthough ordinarily remarkably swift of foota match for his foes who were fast gaining upon him at the corner of liquorpond street stood the old hampstead coachoffice and on the night in question a knot of hostlers waggoners drivers and stableboys was collected in the yard hearing the distant shouts these fellows rushed down to the entrance of the court and arrived there just as jack passed it stop thief roared jonathan stop thief clamoured the rabble behind at no loss to comprehend that jack was the individual pointed out by these outcries two of the nearest of the group made a dash at him but jack eluded their grasp a large dog was then set at him by a stableboy but striking the animal with his faithful ironbar he speedily sent him yelping back the two hostlers however kept close at his heels and jack whose strength began to flag feared he could not hold much longer determined however not be taken with life he held on still keeping ahead of his pursuers he ran along the direct road till the houses disappeared and he got into the open country here he was preparing to leap over the hedge into the fields on the left when he was intercepted by two horsemen who hearing the shouts rode up and struck at him with the buttends of their heavy ridingwhips warding off the blows as well as he could with the bar jack struck both the horses on the head and the animals plunged so violently that they not only prevented their riders from assailing him but also kept off the hostlers and in the confusion that ensued jack managed to spring over the fence and shaped his course across the field in the direction of sir john oldcastles the stoppage had materially lessened the distance between him and his pursuers who now amounted to more than a hundred persons many of whom carried lanterns and links ascertaining that it was sheppard of whom this concourse was in pursuit the two horsemen leapt the hedge and were presently close upon him like a hare closely pressed jack attempted to double but the device only brought him nearer his foes who were crossing the field in every direction and rending the air with their shouts the uproar was tremendousmen yellingdogs barkingbut above all was heard the stentorian voice of jonathan urging them on jack was so harrassed that he felt half inclined to stand at bay while he was straining every sinew his foot slipped and he fell head foremost into a deep trench which he had not observed in the dark this fall saved him for the horsemen passed over him creeping along quickly on his hands and knees he found the entrance to a covered drain into which he crept he was scarcely concealed when he heard the horsemen who perceived they had overshot their mark ride back by this time jonathan and the vast mob attending him had come up and the place was rendered almost as light as day by the links he must be somewhere hereabouts cried one of the horsemen dismounting we were close upon him when he suddenly disappeared jonathan made no answer but snatching a torch from a bystander jumped into the trench and commenced a diligent search just as he had arrived at the mouth of the drain and jack felt certain he must be discovered a loud shout was raised from the further end of the field that the fugitive was caught all the assemblage accompanied by jonathan set off in this direction when it turned out that the supposed housebreaker was a harmless beggar who had been found asleep under a hedge jonathans vexation at the disappointment was expressed in the bitterest imprecations and he returned as speedily as he could to the trench but he had now lost the precise spot and thinking he had examined the drain turned his attention to another quarter meanwhile the excitement of the chase had in some degree subsided the crowd dispersed in different directions and most fortunately a heavy shower coming on put them altogether to flight jonathan however still lingered he seemed wholly insensible to the rain though it presently descended in torrents and continued his search as ardently as before after occupying himself thus for the best part of an hour he thought jack must have given him the slip still his suspicions were so strong that he ordered mendez to remain on guard near the spot all night and by the promise of a large reward induced two other men to keep him company as he took his departure he whispered to the jew take him dead or alive but if we fail now and you heard him aright in seacoal lane we are sure of him at his mothers funeral on sunday chapter xxv how jack sheppard got rid of his irons about an hour after this jack ventured to emerge from his place of concealment it was still raining heavily and profoundly dark drenched to the skinin fact he had been lying in a bed of muddy waterand chilled to the very bone he felt so stiff that he could scarcely move listening attentively he fancied he heard the breathing of some one near him and moved cautiously in the opposite direction in spite of his care he came in contact with a man who endeavouring to grasp him cried in the voice of mendez who goes dere shpeak or i fire no answer being returned the jew instantly discharged his pistol and though the shot did no damage the flash discovered sheppard but as the next moment all was profound darkness jack easily managed to break away from them without an idea where he was going jack pursued his way through the fields and as he proceeded the numbness of his limbs in some degree wore off and his confidence returned he had need of all the inexhaustible energy of his character to support him through his toilsome walk over the wet grass or along the slippery ploughed land at last he got into a lane but had not proceeded far when he was again alarmed by the sound of a horses tread once more breaking through the hedge he took to the fields he was now almost driven to despair wet as he was he felt if he lay down in the grass he should perish with cold while if he sought a nights lodging in any asylum his dress stained with blood and covered with dirt would infallibly cause him to be secured and delivered into the hands of justice and then the fetters which were still upon his legshow was he to get rid of them tired and dispirited he still wandered on again returning to the main road he passed through clapton and turning off on the left arrived at the foot of stamford hill he walked on for an hour longer till he could scarcely drag one leg after another at length he fell down on the road fully expecting each moment would prove his last how long he continued thus he scarcely knew but just before dawn he managed to regain his legs and crawling up a bank perceived he was within a quarter of a mile of tottenham a short way off in the fields he descried a sort of shed or cowhouse and thither he contrived to drag his weary limbs opening the door he found it littered with straw on which he threw himself and instantly fell asleep when he awoke it was late in the day and raining heavily for some time he could not stir but felt sick and exhausted his legs were dreadfully swelled his hands bruised and his fetters occasioned him intolerable pain his bodily suffering however was nothing compared with his mental anguish all the events of the previous day rushed to his recollection and though he had been unintentionally the cause of his mothers death he reproached himself as severely as if he had been her actual murderer had i not been the guilty wretch i am he cried bursting into an agony of tears she would never have died thus this strong feeling of remorse having found a natural vent in some degree subsided and he addressed himself to his present situation rousing himself he went to the door it had ceased raining but the atmosphere was moist and chill and the ground deluged by the recent showers taking up a couple of large stones which lay near jack tried to beat the round basils of the fetters into an oval form so as to enable him to slip his heels through them while he was thus employed a farming man came into the barn jack instantly started to his feet and the man alarmed at his appearance ran off to a neighbouring house before he could return jack had made good his retreat and wandering about the lanes and hedges kept out of sight as much as possible on examining his pockets he found about twenty guineas in gold and some silver but how to avail himself of it was the question for in his present garb he was sure to be recognised when night fell he crept into the town of tottenham as he passed along the main thoroughfare he heard his own name pronounced and found that it was a hawker crying a penny history of his escapes a crowd was collected round the fellow who was rapidly disposing of his stock heres the full true and particular account of jack sheppards last astonishing and nevertobeforgotten escape from the castle of newgate bawled the hawker with a print of him taken from the life showing the manner how he was shackled and handcuffed only one pennytwo copiestwo pencethank you sir heres the let me have one cried a servant maid running across the street and in her haste forgetting to shut the doorheres the money master and missis have been talking all day long about jack sheppard and im dying to read his life here you have it my dear returned the hawker sold again if you dont get back quickly lucy observed a bystander jack sheppard will be in the house before you this sally occasioned a general laugh if jack would come to my house id contrive to hide him remarked a buxom dame poor fellow im glad he has escaped jack seems to be a great favourite with the fair sex observed a smirking grocers apprentice of course rejoined the bystander who had just spoken and who was of a cynical turnthe greater the rascal the better they like him heres a particular account of jacks many robberies and escapes roared the hawkerhow he broke into the house of his master mr wood at dollis hill let me have one said a carpenter who was passing by at the momentmr wood was an old friend of mineand i recollect seeing jack when he was bound prentice to him a penny if you please sir said the hawkersold again here you have the full true and particular account of the barbarous murder committed by jack sheppard and his associate joseph blake alias blueskin upon the body of mrs wood thats false cried a voice behind him the man turned at the exclamation and so did several of the bystanders but they could not make out who had uttered it jack who had been lingering near the group now walked on in the middle of the little town stood the shop of a jew dealer in old clothes the owner was at the door unhooking a few articles of wearing apparel which he had exposed outside for sale amongst other things he had just brought down an old laced bavaroy a species of surtout much worn at the period what do you want for that coat friend asked jack as he came up more than youll pay for it friend snuffled the jew how do you know that rejoined jack will you take a guinea for it double that sum might tempt me replied the jew its a noblemans coat upon my shoul heres the money replied jack taking the coat shall i help you on with it sir replied the jew becoming suddenly respectful no replied jack i half suspect this is a highwayman thought the jew hes so ready with his cash ive some other things inside sir which you might wish to buysome pistols jack was about to comply but not liking the mans manner he walked on further on there was a small chandlers shop where jack observed an old woman seated at the counter attended by a little girl seeing provisions in the window jack ventured in and bought a loaf having secured thisfor he was almost famishedhe said that he had lost a hammer and wished to purchase one the old woman told him she had no such article to dispose of but recommended him to a neighbouring blacksmith guided by the glare of the forge which threw a stream of ruddy light across the road jack soon found the place of which he was in search entering the workshop he found the blacksmith occupied in heating the tire of a cart wheel suspending his labour on jacks appearance the man demanded his business making up a similar story to that which he had told the old woman he said he wanted to purchase a hammer and a file the man looked hard at him answer me one question first he said i half suspect youre jack sheppard i am replied jack without hesitation for he felt assured from the mans manner that he might confide in him youre a bold fellow jack rejoined the blacksmith but youve done well to trust me ill take off your ironsfor i guess thats the reason why you want the hammer and fileon one condition what is it that you give em to me readily taking jack into a shed behind the workshop the smith in a short time freed him from his fetters he not only did this but supplied him with an ointment which allayed the swelling of his limbs and crowned all by furnishing him with a jug of excellent ale im afraid jack youll come to the gallows observed the smith buth if you do ill go to tyburn to see you but ill never part with your irons noticing the draggled condition jack was in he then fetched him a bucket of water with which jack cleansed himself as well as he could and thanking the honest smith who would take nothing for his trouble left the shop having made a tolerably good meal upon the loaf overcome by fatigue jack turned into a barn in stoke newington and slept till late in the day when he awakened much refreshed the swelling in his limbs had also subsided it rained heavily all day so he did not stir forth towards night however he ventured out and walked on towards london when he arrived at hoxton he found the walls covered with placards offering a reward for his apprehension and he everywhere appeared to be the general subject of conversation prom a knot of idlers at a publichouse he learnt that jonathan wild had just ridden past and that his setters were scouring the country in every direction entering london he bent his way towards the westend and having some knowledge of a secondhand tailors shop in rupert street proceeded thither and looked out a handsome suit of mourning with a sword cloak and hat and demanded the price the man asked twelve guineas but after a little bargaining he came down to ten taking his new purchase under his arm jack proceeded to a small tavern in the same street where having ordered dinner he went to a bedroom to attire himself he had scarcely completed his toilet when he was startled by a noise at the door and heard his own name pronounced in no friendly accents fortunately the window was not far from the ground so opening it gently he dropped into a backyard and from thence got into the street hurrying down the haymarket he was arrested by a crowd who were collected round a streetsinger jack paused for a moment and found that his own adventures formed the subject of the ballad not daring however to listen to it he ran on chapter xxvi how jack sheppard attended his mothers funeral that night jack walked to paddington and took up his quarters at a small tavern called the wheatsheaf near the green on the next morningsundaythe day on which he expected his mothers funeral to take place he set out along the harrow road it was a clear lovely october morning the air was sharp and bracing and the leaves which had taken their autumnal tints were falling from the trees the road which wound by westbourne green gave him a full view of the hill of hampstead with its church its crest of houses and its villas peeping from out the trees jacks heart was too full to allow him to derive any pleasure from this scene so he strolled on without raising his eyes till he arrived at kensal green here he obtained some breakfast and mounting the hill turned off into the fields on the right crossing them he ascended an eminence which from its singular shape seems to have been the site of a roman encampment and which commands a magnificent prospect leaning upon a gate he looked down into the valley it was the very spot from which his poor mother had gazed after her vain attempt to rescue him at the mint but though he was ignorant of this her image was alone present to him he beheld the grey tower of willesden church embosomed in its grove of trees now clothed in all the glowing livery of autumn there was the cottage she had inhabited for so many yearsin those fields she had rambledat that church she had prayed and he had destroyed all this but for him she might have been alive and happy the recollection was too painful and he burst into an agony of tears aroused by the sound of the church bells he resolved at whatever risk to attend divine service with this view he descended the hill and presently found a footpath leading to the church but he was destined to have every tide of feeling awakenedevery wound opened the path he had selected conducted him to his mothers humble dwelling when she occupied it it was neatness itself the little porch was overrun with creepersthe garden trim and exquisitely kept now it was a wilderness of weeds the glass in the windows was brokenthe roof unthatchedthe walls dilapidated jack turned away with an aching heart it seemed an emblem of the ruin he had caused as he proceeded other painful reminiscences were aroused at every step he seemed to be haunted by the ghost of the past there was the stile on which jonathan had sat and he recollected distinctly the effect of his mocking glancehow it had hardened his heart against his mothers prayer o god he exclaimed i am severely punished he had now gained the high road the villagers were thronging to church bounding the corner of a garden wall he came upon his former place of imprisonment some rustic hand had written upon the door jack sheppards cage and upon the wall was affixed a large placard describing his person and offering a reward for his capture muffling up his face jack turned away but he had not proceeded many steps when he heard a man reading aloud an account of his escapes from a newspaper hastening to the church he entered it by the very door near which his first crime had been committed his mothers scream seemed again to ring in his ears and he was so deeply affected that fearful of exciting attention he was about to quit the sacred edifice when he was stopped by the entrance of thames who looked pale as death with winifred leaning on his arm they were followed by mr wood in the deepest mourning shrinking involuntarily back into the farthest corner of the seat jack buried his face in his hands the service began jack who had not been in a place of worship for many years was powerfully affected accidentally raising his eyes he saw that he was perceived by the family from dollis hill and that he was an object of the deepest interest to them as soon as the service was over thames contrived to approach him and whispered be cautiousthe funeral will take place after evening service jack would not hazard a glance at winifred but quitting the church got into an adjoining meadow and watched the party slowly ascending the road leading to dollis hill at a turn in the road he perceived winifred looking anxiously towards him and when she discovered him she waved her hand returning to the churchyard he walked round it and on the western side near a small yewtree discovered a newmade grave whose grave is this he inquired of a man who was standing near it i cant say answered the fellow but ill inquire from the sexton william morgan here peter he added to a curlyheaded lad who was playing on one of the grassy tombs ask your father to step this way the little urchin set off and presently returned with the sexton its mrs sheppards gravethe mother of the famous housebreaker said morgan in answer to jacks inquiryand its well they let her have christian burial after allfor they say she destroyed herself for her son the crowners quest sat on her yesterdayand if she hadnt been proved out of her mind she would have been buried at four laneends jack could stand no more placing a piece of money in morgans hands he hurried out of the churchyard by my soul said the sexton thats as like jack sheppard as any one i ever seed i my born days hastening to the six bells jack ordered some refreshment and engaged a private room where he remained till the afternoon absorbed in grief meantime a change had taken place in the weather the day had become suddenly overcast the wind blew in fitful gusts and scattered the yellow leaves from the elms and horsechestnuts roused by the bell tolling for evening service jack left the house on reaching the churchyard he perceived the melancholy procession descending the hill just then a carriage drawn by four horses drove furiously up to the six bells but jack was too much absorbed to take any notice of it at this moment the bell began to toll in a peculiar manner announcing the approach of the corpse the gate was opened the coffin brought into the churchyard and jack whose eyes were filled with tears saw mr wood and thames pass him and followed at a foots pace behind them meanwhile the clergyman bareheaded and in his surplice advanced to meet them having read the three first verses of the impressive service appointed for the burial of the dead he returned to the church whither the coffin was carried through the southwestern door and placed in the centre of the aislemr wood and thames taking their places on either side of it and jack at a little distance behind jack had been touched in the morning but he was now completely prostrated in the midst of the holy place which he had formerly profaned lay the body of his unfortunate mother and he could not help looking upon her untimely end as the retributive vengeance of heaven for the crime he had committed his grief was so audible that it attracted the notice of some of the bystanders and thames was obliged to beg him to control it in doing this he chanced to raise his eyes and half fancied he beheld shaded by a pillar at the extremity of the western aisle the horrible countenance of the thieftaker before the congregation separated the clergyman descended from the pulpit and followed by the coffinbearers and mourners and by jack at a respectful distance entered the churchyard the carriage which it has been mentioned drove up to the six bells contained four personsjonathan wild his two janizaries and his porter obadiah lemon as soon as they had got out the vehicle was drawn up at the back of a tree near the cage having watched the funeral at some distance jonathan fancied he could discern the figure of jack but not being quite sure he entered the church he was daring enough to have seized and carried him off before the whole congregation but he preferred waiting satisfied with his scrutiny he returned despatched abraham and obadiah to the northwest corner of the church placed quilt behind a buttress near the porch and sheltered himself behind one of the mighty elms the funeral procession had now approached the grave around which many of the congregation who were deeply interested by the sad ceremonial had gathered a slight rain fell at the time and a few leaves caught by the eddies whirled around jonathan mixed with the group and sure of his prey abided his time the clergyman meanwhile proceeded with the service while the coffin was deposited at the brink of the grave just as the attendants were preparing to lower the corpse into the earth jack fell on his knees beside the coffin uttering the wildest exclamations of grief reproaching himself with the murder of his mother and invoking the vengeance of heaven on his own head a murmur ran through the assemblage by several of whom jack was recognised but such was the violence of his griefsuch the compunction he exhibited that all but one looked on with an eye of compassion that person advanced towards him i have killed her cried jack you have rejoined jonathan laying a forcible grasp on his shoulder you are my prisoner illustration jack started to his feet but before he could defend himself his right arm was grasped by the jew who had silently approached him hellhounds he cried release me at the same moment quilt arnold rushed forward with such haste that stumbling over william morgan he precipitated him into the grave wretch cried jack are you not content with the crimes you have committedbut you must carry your villany to this point look at the poor victim at your feet jonathan made no reply but ordered his myrmidons to drag the prisoner along thames meanwhile had drawn his sword and was about to rush upon jonathan but he was withheld by wood do not shed more blood cried the carpenter groans and hoots were now raised by the crowd and there was an evident disposition to rescue a small brickbat was thrown which struck jonathan in the face you shall not pass cried several of the crowd i knew his poor mother and for her sake ill not see this done cried john dump slip on the handcuffs cried the thieftaker and now lets see wholl dare to oppose me i am jonathan wild i have arrested him in the kings name a deep indignant groan followed let me see the earth thrown over her implored jack and take me where you please no thundered wild allow him that small grace cried wood no i tell you rejoined jonathan shouldering his way out of the crowd my mothermy poor mother exclaimed jack but in spite of his outcries and resistance he was dragged along by jonathan and his janizaries at the eastern gate of the churchyard stood the carriage with the steps lowered the mob pursued the thieftaker and his party all the way and such missiles as could be collected were hurled at them they even threatened to cut the traces and take off the wheels from the carriage the jew got in first the prisoner was then thrust in by quilt before jonathan followed he turned to face his assailants back he cried fiercely i am an officer in the execution of my duty and he who opposes me in it shall feel the weight of my hand he then sprung into the coach the door of which was closed by obadiah who mounted the box to newgate cried jonathan putting his head out of the window a deep roar followed this order and several missiles were launched at the vehicle which was driven off at a furious pace and while her son was reconveyed to prison the body of the unfortunate mrs sheppard was committed to the earth chapter xxvii how jack sheppard was brought back to newgate jack sheppards escape from newgate on the night of the th of october was not discovered till the following morning for although the intelligence was brought by several parties to the lodge in the course of the night austin who was the officer in attendance paid no attention to them after pursuing the fugitive as before related jonathan wild returned to his own habitation where he was occupied during the remainder of the night with quilt arnold and obadiah lemon in removing everything which in case of a search might tend to criminate him satisfied in this respect he flung himself into a chair for his iron frame seldom required the indulgence of a bed and sought an hours repose before he began the villanies of another day he was aroused from his slumber about six oclock by the return of abraham mendez who not choosing to confess that jack had eluded his vigilance contended himself with stating that he had kept watch till daybreak when he had carefully searched the field and finding no trace of him had thought it better to return this information was received by jonathan with a lowering brow he comforted himself however with the certainty which he felt of capturing his prey on the sunday his breakfast despatched which he ate with a wolfish appetite he walked over to newgate chuckling as he went at the consternation which his appearance would create amongst the turnkeys entering the lodge the first person he beheld was austin who was only just up and whose toilette appeared scarcely completed a glance satisfied jonathan that the turnkey was not aware of the prisoners escape and he resolved not to destroy what he considered a good jest by a premature disclosure of it you are out betimes this morning mr wild observed austin as he put on his coat and adjusted his minor bob something fresh on hand i suppose im come to inquire after jack sheppard returned jonathan dont alarm yourself about him sir replied austin hes safe enough i assure you i should like to satisfy myself on that score rejoined wild drily so you shall sir replied austin who at this moment recollected with some uneasiness the applications at the lodgedoor during the night i hope you dont imagine anything has gone wrong sir it matters not what i think replied wild come with me to the castle instantly sir replied austin instantly here caliban attend to the door and keep the wicket locked till i return dye hear now sir taking the keys he led the way followed by jonathan who chuckled internally at the shock that awaited the poor fellow the door was opened and austin entered the cell when he absolutely recoiled before the spectacle he beheld and could scarcely have looked more alarmed if the prison had tumbled about his ears petrified and speechless he turned an imploring look at wild who was himself filled with astonishment at the pile of rubbish lying before him sdeath cried jonathan staring at the breach in the wall some one must have assisted him unless he has dealings with the devil he could never have done this alone i firmly believe he has dealings with the devil replied austin trembling from head to foot but perhaps he has not got beyond the room above its as strong if not stronger than this ill see so saying he scrambled over the rubbish and got into the chimney but though the breach was large enough to admit him below he could not squeeze his bulky person through the aperture into the red room i believe hes gone he said returning to jonathan the doors open and the room empty you believeyou know it replied jonathan fixing one of his sternest and most searching glances upon him nothing you can say to the contrary will convince me that you have not been accessory to his flight i siri swear tush interrupted jonathan harshly i shall state my suspicions to the governor come down with me to the lodge directly all further examinations must be conducted in the presence of proper witnesses with these words he strode out of the room darted down the stone stairs and on his arrival at the lodge seized the rope of the great bell communicating with the interior of the prison which he rang violently as this was never done except in some case of great emergency the application was instantly answered by all the other turnkeys by marvel the four partners and mrs spurling nothing could exceed the dismay of these personages when they learnt why they had been summoned all seemed infected with austins terrors except mrs spurling who did not dare to exhibit her satisfaction otherwise than by privately pinching the arm of her expected husband headed by jonathan all the turnkeys then repaired to the upper part of the jail and approaching the red room by a circuitous route several doors were unlocked and they came upon the scene of jacks exploits stopping before each door they took up the plates of the locks examined the ponderous bolts and were struck with the utmost astonishment at what they beheld arriving at the chapel their wonder increased all the jailers declared it utterly impossible he could have accomplished his astonishing task unaided but who had lent him assistance was a question they were unable to answer proceeding to the entry to the lower leads they came to the two strong doors and their surprise was so great at jacks marvellous performance that they could scarcely persuade themselves that human ingenuity could have accomplished it heres a door remarked ireton when he got to that nearest the leads which i could have sworn would have resisted anything i shall have no faith in future in bolts and bars mounting the roof of the prison they traced the fugitives course to the further extremity of the building where they found his blanket attached to the spike proving that he escaped in that direction after severely examining austin and finding it proved on the testimony of his fellowjailers that he could not have aided jack in his flight jonathan retracted his harsh sentence and even went so far as to say that he would act as mediator between him and the governor this was some satisfaction to the poor fellow who was dreadfully frightened as indeed he might well be it being the opinion of the jailers and others who afterwards examined the place that jack had accomplished singlehanded in a few hours and as far as it could be ascertained with imperfect implements what it would have taken half a dozen men several days provided with proper tools to effect in their opinion a hundred pounds would not repair the damage done to the prison as soon as jacks escape became known thousands of persons flocked to newgate to behold his workmanship and the jailers reaped am abundant harvest from their curiosity jonathan meanwhile maintained profound secrecy as to his hopes of capturing the fugitive and when jack was brought back to newgate on the sunday evening his arrival was wholly unexpected at a little after five on that day four horses dashed round the corner of the old bailey and drew up before the door of the lodge hearing the stoppage austin rushed out and could scarcely believe his eyes when he beheld jack sheppard in the custody of quilt arnold and abraham mendez jacks recapture was speedily made known to all the officers of the jail and the lodge was instantly crowded the delight of the turnkeys was beyond all bounds but poor mrs spurling was in a state of distraction and began to abuse jonathan so violently that her future husband was obliged to lay forcible hands upon her and drag her away by wilds command the prisoner was taken to the condemned hold whither he was followed by the whole posse of officers and by the partners two of whom carried large hammers and two the fetters there was only one prisoner in the ward he was chained to the ground but started up at their approach it was blueskin when he beheld jack he uttered a deep groan captain he cried in a voice of the bitterest anguish have these dogs again hunted you down if you hadnt been so unlucky i should have been with you before tomorrow night jack made no answer nor did he even cast his eyes upon his follower but jonathan fixing a terrible look upon him cried ha say you so you must be looked to my lads he continued addressing the partners when youve finished this job give that fellow a fresh set of darbies i suspect he has been at work upon those he has on the link of the chain next the staple is sawn through said ireton stooping to examine blueskins fetters search him and iron him afresh commanded jonathan but first let us secure sheppard well then remove them both to the middle stone hold where a watch shall be kept over them night and day till theyre taken to tyburn as theyre so fond of each others society they shant part company even on that occasion but shall swing from the same tree youll never live to see that day cried blueskin fixing a menacing look upon him what weight are these irons asked jonathan coolly addressing one of the partners more than three hundred weight sir replied the man theyre the heaviest set we haveand were forged expressly for captain sheppard theyre not half heavy enough replied wild let him be handcuffed and doubly ironed on both legs and when we get him into the stone ward he shall not only be chained down to the ground but shall have two additional fetters running through the main links fastened on each side of him well see whether hell get rid of his new bonds he added with a brutal laugh which was echoed by the bystanders mark me said jack sternly i have twice broken out of this prison in spite of all your precautions and were you to load me with thrice the weight of iron you have ordered you should not prevent my escaping a third time thats right captain cried blueskin well give them the slip yet and hang that butcherly thieftaker upon his own gibbet be silent dog cried jonathan and with his clenched hand he struck him a violent blow in the face for the first time perhaps in his life he repented of his brutality the blow was scarcely dealt when with a bound like that of a tiger blueskin sprang upon him the chain which had been partially cut through snapped near the staple before any assistance could be rendered by the jailers who stood astounded blueskin had got wild in his clutches his strength has been described as prodigious but now heightened by his desire for vengeance it was irresistible jonathan though a very powerful man was like an infant in his gripe catching hold of his chin he bent back the neck while with his left hand he pulled out a clasp knife which he opened with his teeth and grasping wilds head with his arm notwithstanding his resistance cut deeply into his throat the folds of a thick muslin neckcloth in some degree protected him but the gash was desperate blueskin drew the knife across his throat a second time widening and deepening the wound and wrenching back the head to get it into a more favourable position would infallibly have severed it from the trunk if the officers who by this time had recovered from their terror had not thrown themselves upon him and withheld him nows your time cried blueskin struggling desperately with his assailants and inflicting severe cuts with his knife fly captainfly aroused to a sense of the possibility of escape jack who had viewed the deadly assault with savage satisfaction burst from his captors and made for the door blueskin fought his way towards it and exerting all his strength cutting right and left as he proceeded reached it at the same time jack in all probability would have escaped if langley who was left in the lodge had not been alarmed at the noise and rushed thither seeing jack at liberty he instantly seized him and a struggle commenced at this moment blueskin came up and kept off the officers with his knife he used his utmost efforts to liberate jack from langley but closely pressed on all sides he was not able to render any effectual assistance fly cried jack escape if you can dont mind me casting one look of anguish at his leader blueskin then darted down the passage the only persons in the lodge were mrs spurling and marvel hearing the noise of the scuffle the tapstress fancying it was jack making an effort to escape in spite of the remonstrances of the executioner threw open the wicket blueskin therefore had nothing to stop him dashing through the open door he crossed the old bailey plunged into a narrow court on the opposite side of the way and was out of sight in a minute baffling all pursuit on their return the jailers raised up jonathan who was weltering in his blood and who appeared to be dying efforts were made to staunch his wounds and surgical assistance sent for has he escaped asked the thieftaker faintly blueskin said ireton nosheppard rejoined wild no no sir replied ireton hes here thats right replied wild with a ghastly smile remove him to the middle stone holdwatch over him night and day do you mind i do sir ironsheavy ironsnight and day depend upon it sir go with him to tyburnnever lose sight of him till the noose is tied wheres marvel here sir replied the executioner a hundred guineas if you hang jack sheppard i have it about me take it if i die never fear sir replied marvel oh that i could live to see it gasped jonathan and with a hideous expression of pain he fainted hes dead exclaimed austin i am content said jack my mother is avenged take me to the stone room blueskin you are a true friend the body of jonathan was then conveyed to his own habitation while jack was taken to the middle stone room and ironed in the manner wild had directed chapter xxviii what happened at dollis hill at length this tragedy is at an end said mr wood as having seen the earth thrown over the remains of the unfortunate mrs sheppard he turned to quit the churchyard let us hope that like her who loved much her sins are forgiven her without another word and accompanied by thames he then took his way to dollis hill in a state of the deepest depression thames did not attempt to offer him any consolation for he was almost as much dejected the weather harmonized with their feelings it rained slightly and a thick mist gathered in the air and obscured the beautiful prospect on his arrival at dollis hill mr wood was so much exhausted that he was obliged to retire to his own room where he continued for some hours overpowered by grief the two lovers sat together and their sole discourse turned upon jack and his illfated mother as the night advanced mr wood again made his appearance in a more composed frame of mind and at his daughters earnest solicitation was induced to partake of some refreshment an hour was then passed in conversation as to the possibility of rendering any assistance to jack in deploring his unhappy destiny and in the consideration of the course to be pursued in reference to jonathan wild while they were thus occupied a maidservant entered the room and stated that a person was without who had a packet for captain darrell which must be delivered into his own hands notwithstanding the remonstrances of wood and winifred thames instantly followed the domestic and found a man with his face muffled up at the door as she had described somewhat alarmed at his appearance thames laid his hand upon his sword fear nothing sir said the man in a voice which thames instantly recognised as that of blueskin i am come to render you a service there are the packets which my captain hazarded his life to procure for you and which he said would establish your right to the estates of the trenchard family there are also the letters which were scattered about wilds room after the murder of sir rowland and there he added placing in his hands a heavy bag of money and a pocketbook is a sum little short of fifteen thousand pounds how have you procured these things asked thames in the utmost astonishment i carried them off on the fatal night when we got into wilds house and you were struck down replied blueskin they have ever since been deposited in a place of safety you have nothing more to fear from wild how so asked thames i have saved the executioner a labour by cutting his throat replied blueskin and may i be cursed if i ever did anything in my whole life which gave me so much satisfaction almighty god is this possible exclaimed thames you will find it true replied blueskin all i regret is that i failed in liberating the captain if he had got off they might have hanged me and welcome what can be done for him cried thames thats not an easy question to answer rejoined blueskin but i shall watch night and day about newgate in the hope of getting him out he wouldnt require my aid but before i stopped jonathans mouth he had ordered him to be doublyironed and constantly watched and though the villain cant see his orders executed ive no doubt some one else will poor jack exclaimed thames i would sacrifice all my fortuneall my hopesto liberate him if youre in earnest rejoined blueskin give me that bag of gold it contains a thousand pounds and if all other schemes fail ill engage to free him on the way to tyburn may i trust you hesitated thames why did i not keep the money when i had it returned blueskin angrily not a farthing of it shall be expended except in the captains service take it replied thames you have saved his life replied blueskin and now mark me you owe what i have done for you to him not to me had i not known that you and your affianced bride are dearer to him than life i should have used this money to secure my own safety take it and take the estates in captain sheppards name promise me one thing before i leave you what is it asked thames if the captain is taken to tyburn be near the place of executionat the end of the edgeware road i will in case of need you will lend a helping hand yesyes swear it i do enough rejoined blueskin and he departed just as wood who had become alarmed by thamess long absence made his appearance with a blunderbuss in his hand hastily acquainting him with the treasures he had unexpectedly obtained thames returned to the room to apprize winifred of his good fortune the packets were hastily broken open and while wood was absorbed in the perusal of the despatch addressed to him by sir rowland thames sought out and found the letter which he had been prevented from finishing on the fatal night at jonathan wilds as soon as he had read it he let it fall from his grasp winifred instantly picked it up you are no longer thames darrell she said casting her eyes rapidly over it but the marquis de chatillon my father was of the bloodroyal of france exclaimed thames ehday whats this cried wood looking up from beneath his spectacles whowho is the marquis de chatillon your adopted son thames darrell answered winifred and the marchioness is your daughter added thames o lord ejaculated wood my head fairly turns round so many distressesso many joys coming at the same time are too much for me read that letter thamesmy lord marquis i mean read it and youll find that your unfortunate uncle sir rowland surrenders to you all the estates in lancashire youve nothing to do but to take possession what a strange history is mine said thames kidnapped and sent to france by one uncle it was my lot to fall into the hands of anothermy fathers own brother the marshal gaucher de chatillon to whom and to the cardinal dubois i owed all my good fortune the ways of providence are inscrutable observed wood when in france i heard from the marshal that his brother had perished in london on the night of the great storm it was supposed he was drowned in crossing the river as his body had never been found little did i imagine at the time that it was my own father to whom he referred i think i remember reading something about your father in the papers observed wood wasnt he in some way connected with the jacobite plots he was replied thames he had been many years in this country before his assassination took place in this letter which is addressed to my illfated mother he speaks of his friendship for sir rowland whom it seems he had known abroad but entreats her to keep the marriage secret for a time for reasons which are not fully developed and so sir rowland murdered his friend remarked wood crime upon crime unconsciously perhaps replied thames but be it as it may he is now beyond the reach of earthly punishment but wild still lives cried wood he also has paid the penalty of his offences returned thames he has fallen by the hand of blueskin who brought me these packets thank god for that cried wood heartily i could almost forgive the wretch the injury he did me in depriving me of my poor dear wifeno not quite that he added a little confused and now said thames for we must still preserve the name you will no longer defer my happiness hold interposed winifred gravely i release you from your promise a carpenters daughter is no fit match for a peer of france if my dignity must be purchased by the loss of you i renounce it cried thames you will not make it valueless in my eyes he added catching her in his arms and pressing her to his breast be it as you please replied winifred my lips would belie my heart were i to refuse you and now father your blessingyour consent cried thames you have both replied wood fervently i am too much honouredtoo happy in the union oh that i should live to be fatherinlaw to a peer of france what would my poor wife say to it if she could come to life again oh thamesmy lord marquis i meanyou have made me the happiestthe proudest of mankind not many days after this event on a bright october morning the bells rang a merry peal from the old gray tower of willesden church all the village was assembled in the churchyard young and old were dressed in their gayest apparel and it was evident from the smiles that lighted up every countenance from the roguish looks of the younger swains and the demure expression of several pretty rustic maidens that a ceremony which never fails to interest all classesa weddingwas about to take place at the gate opening upon the road leading to dollis hill were stationed william morgan and john dump presently two carriages dashed down the hill and drew up before it from the first of these alighted thames or as he must now be styled the marquis de chatillon from the second descended mr woodand after him came his daughter the sun never shone upon a lovelier couple than now approached the altar the church was crowded to excess by the numbers eager to witness the ceremony and as soon as it was over the wedded pair were followed to the carriage and the loudest benedictions uttered for their happiness in spite of the tumultuous joy which agitated him the bridegroom could not prevent the intrusion of some saddening thoughts as he reflected upon the melancholy scene which he had so recently witnessed in the same place the youthful couple had been seated in the carriage a few minutes when they were joined by mr wood who had merely absented himself to see that a public breakfast which he had ordered at the six bells for all who chose to partake of it was in readiness he likewise gave directions that in the after part of the day a whole bullock should be roasted on the green and distributed together with a barrel of the strongest ale in the evening a band of village musicians accompanied by most of the young inhabitants of willesden strolled out to dollis hill where they formed a rustic concert under the great elm before the door here they were regaled with another plentiful meal by the hospitable carpenter who personally superintended the repast these festivities however were not witnessed by the newlymarried pair who had departed immediately after the ceremony for manchester chapter xxix how jack sheppard was taken to westminster hall loaded with the heaviest fetters and constantly watched by two of the jailers assistants who neither quitted him for a single moment nor suffered any visitor to approach him jack sheppard found all attempts to escape impracticable he was confined in the middle stone ward a spacious apartment with good light and air situated over the gateway on the western side and allotted to him not for his own convenience but for that of the keepers who if he had been placed in a gloomier or more incommodious dungeon would have necessarily had to share it with him through this his last trial jacks spirits never deserted him he seemed resigned but cheerful and held frequent and serious discourses with the ordinary who felt satisfied of his sincere penitence the only circumstance which served to awaken a darker feeling in his breast was that his implacable foe jonathan wild had survived the wound inflicted by blueskin and was slowly recovering as soon as he could be moved with safety jonathan had himself transported to newgate where he was carried into the middle ward that he might feast his eyes upon his victim having seen every precaution taken to ensure his safe custody he departed muttering to himself i shall yet live to see him hangedi shall live to see him hanged animated by his insatiate desire of vengeance he seemed to gain strength dailyso much so that within a fortnight after receiving his wound he was able to stir abroad on thursday the th of november after having endured nearly a months imprisonment jack sheppard was conveyed from newgate to westminster hall he was placed in a coach handcuffed and heavily fettered and guarded by a vast posse of officers to temple bar where a fresh relay of constables escorted him to westminster by this time jacks reputation had risen to such a height with the populacehis exploits having become the universal theme of discourse that the streets were almost impassable for the crowds collected to obtain a view of him the vast area in front of westminster hall was thronged with people and it was only by a vigorous application of their staves that the constables could force a passage for the vehicle at length however the prisoner was got out when such was the rush of the multitude that several persons were trampled down and received severe injuries arrived in the hall the prisoners handcuffs were removed and he was taken before the court of kings bench the record of his conviction at the old bailey sessions was then read and as no objection was offered to it the attorneygeneral moved that his execution might take place on monday next upon this jack earnestly and eloquently addressed himself to the bench and besought that a petition which he had prepared to be laid before the king might be read this request however was refused and he was told that the only way in which he could entitle himself to his majestys clemency would be by discovering who had abetted him in his last escape the strongest suspicions being entertained that he had not affected it alone sheppard replied by a solemn assertion that he had received no assistance except from heavenan answer for which he was immediately reprimanded by the court it having been stated that it was wholly impossible he could have removed his irons in the way he represented he offered if his handcuffs were replaced to take them off in the presence of the court the proposal however was not acceded to and the chief justice powis after enumerating his various offences and commenting upon their heinousness awarded sentence of death against him for the following monday as jack was removed he noticed jonathan wild at a little distance from him eyeing him with a look of the most savage satisfaction the thieftakers throat was bound up with thick folds of linen and his face had a ghastly and cadaverous look which communicated an undefinable and horrible expression to his glances meanwhile the mob outside had prodigiously increased and had begun to exhibit some disposition to riot the coach in which the prisoner had been conveyed was already broken to pieces and the driver was glad to escape with life terrific shouts were raised by the rabble who threatened to tear wild in pieces if he showed himself amid this tumult several men armed with tremendous bludgeons with their faces besmeared with grease and soot and otherwise disguised were observed to be urging the populace to attempt a rescue they were headed by an athleticlooking swarthyfeatured man who was armed with a cutlass which he waved over his head to cheer on his companions these desperadoes had been the most active in demolishing the coach and now being supported by the rabble they audaciously approached the very portals of the ancient hall the shouts yells and groans which they uttered and which were echoed by the concourse in the rear were perfectly frightful jonathan who with the other constables had reconnoitred this band and recognised in its ringleader blueskin commanded the constables to follow him and made a sally for the purpose of seizing him enfeebled by his wound wild had lost much of his strength though nothing of his ferocity and energyand fiercely assailing blueskin he made a desperate but unsuccessful attempt to apprehend him he was however instantly beaten back and the fury of the mob was so great that it was with difficulty he could effect a retreat the whole force of the constables jailers and others was required to keep the crowd out of the hall the doors were closed and barricaded and the mob threatened to burst them open if jack was not delivered to them things now began to wear so serious a aspect that a messenger was secretly despatched to the savoy for troops and in half an hour a regiment of the guards arrived who by dint of great exertion succeeded in partially dispersing the tumultuous assemblage another coach was then procured in which the prisoner was placed jacks appearance was hailed with the loudest cheers but when jonathan followed and took a place beside him in the vehicle determined he said never to lose sight of him the abhorrence of the multitude was expressed by execrations hoots and yells of the most terrific kind so dreadful were these shouts as to produce an effect upon the hardened feelings of jonathan who shrank out of sight it was well for him that he had taken his place by sheppard as regard for the latter alone prevented the deadliest missiles being hurled at him as it was the mob went on alternately hooting and huzzaing as the names of wild and sheppard were pronounced while some individuals bolder than the rest thrust their faces into the coachwindow and assured jack that he should never be taken to tyburn well see that you yelping hounds rejoined jonathan glaring fiercely at them in this way jack was brought back to newgate and again chained down in the middle ward it was late before jonathan ventured to his own house where he remained up all night and kept his janizaries and other assistants well armed chapter xxx how jonathan wilds house was burnt down the day appointed for the execution was now close at hand and the prisoner who seemed to have abandoned all hopes of escape turned his thoughts entirely from worldly considerations on sunday he was conveyed to the chapel through which he had passed on the occasion of his great escape and once more took his seat in the condemned pew the rev mr purney the ordinary who had latterly conceived a great regard for jack addressed him in a discourse which while it tended to keep alive his feelings of penitence was calculated to afford him much consolation the chapel was crowded to excess but hereeven here the demon was suffered to intrude and jacks thoughts were distracted by jonathan wild who stood at a little distance from him and kept his bloodthirsty eyes fixed on him during the whole of the service on that night an extraordinary event occurred which convinced the authorities that every precaution must be taken in conducting jack to tyburna fact of which they had been previously made aware though scarcely to the same extent by the riotous proceedings near westminster hall about nine oclock an immense mob collected before the lodge at newgate it was quite dark but as some of the assemblage carried links it was soon ascertained to be headed by the same party who had mainly incited the former disturbance amongst the ringleaders was blueskin whose swarthy features and athletic figure were easily distinguished another was baptist kettleby and a third in a dutch dress was recognised by his grizzled beard as the skipper van galgebrok before an hour had elapsed the concourse was fearfully increased the area in front of the jail was completely filled attempts were made upon the door of the lodge but it was too strong to be forced a cry was then raised by the leaders to attack wilds house and the fury of the mob was instantly directed to that quarter wrenched from their holds the iron palisades in front of the thieftakers dwelling were used as weapons to burst open the door while this was passing jonathan opened one of the upper windows and fired several shots upon the assailants but though he made blueskin and kettleby his chief marks he missed both the sight of the thieftaker increased the fury of the mob to a fearful degree terrific yells rent the air the heavy weapon thundered against the door and it speedily yielded to their efforts come on my lads vociferated blueskin well unkennel the old fox as he spoke several shots were fired from the upper part of the house and two men fell mortally wounded but this only incensed the assailing party the more with a drawn cutlass in one hand and a cocked pistol in the other blueskin rushed up stairs the landing was defended by quilt arnold and the jew the former was shot by blueskin through the head and his body fell over the bannisters the jew who was paralysed by his companions fate offered no resistance and was instantly seized where is your accursed master demanded blueskin holding the sword to his throat the jew did not speak but pointed to the audiencechamber committing him to the custody of the others blueskin followed by a numerous band darted in that direction the door was locked but with the bars of iron it was speedily burst open several of the assailants carried links so that the room was a blaze of light jonathan however was nowhere to be seen rushing towards the entrance of the wellhole blueskin touched the secret spring he was not there opening the trapdoor he then descended to the vaultssearched each cell and every nook and corner separately wild had escaped robbed of their prey the fury of the mob became ungovernable at length at the end of a passage next to the cell where mrs sheppard had been confined blueskin discovered a trapdoor which he had not previously noticed it was instantly burst open when the horrible stench that issued from it convinced them that it must be a receptacle for the murdered victims of the thieftaker holding a link into the place which had the appearance of a deep pit blueskin noticed a body richly dressed he dragged it out and perceiving in spite of the decayed frame that it was the body of sir rowland trenchard commanded his attendants to convey it up stairsan order which was promptly obeyed returning to the audiencechamber blueskin had the jew brought before him the body of sir rowland was then laid on the large table opposite to it was placed the jew seeing from the threatening looks of his captors that they were about to wreak their vengeance upon him the miserable wretch besought mercy in abject terms and charged his master with the most atrocious crimes his relation of the murder of sir rowland petrified even his fierce auditors one of the cases in jonathans museum was now burst open and a rope taken from it in spite of his shrieks the miserable jew was then dragged into the wellhole and the rope being tied round his neck he was launched from the bridge the vengeance of the assailants did not stop here they broke open the entrance into jonathans storeroomplundered it of everything valuableransacked every closet drawer and secret hidingplace and stripped them of their contents large hoards of money were discovered gold and silver plate cases of watches and various precious articles nothing in short portable or valuable was left old implements of housebreaking were discovered and the thieftakers most hidden depositories were laid bare the work of plunder over that of destruction commenced straw and other combustibles being collected were placed in the middle of the audiencechamber on these were thrown all the horrible contents of jonathans museum together with the body of sir rowland trenchard the whole was then fired and in a few minutes the room was a blaze not content with this the assailants set fire to the house in halfadozen other places and the progress of the flames was rapid and destructive meanwhile the object of all this fearful disturbance had made his escape to newgate from the roof of which he witnessed the destruction of his premises he saw the flames burst from the windows and perhaps in that maddening spectacle suffered torture equivalent to some of the crimes he had committed while he was thus standing the flames of his house which made the whole street as light as day and ruddily illumined the faces of the mob below betrayed him to them and he was speedily driven from his position by a shower of stones and other missiles the mob now directed their attention to newgate and from their threats appeared determined to fire it ladders paviours rams sledgehammers and other destructive implements were procured and in all probability their purpose would have been effected but for the opportune arrival of a detachment of the guards who dispersed them not without some loss of life several prisoners were taken but the ringleaders escaped engines were brought to play upon wilds premises and upon the adjoining houses the latter were saved but of the former nothing but the blackened stone walls were found standing on the morrow chapter xxxi the procession to tyburn the noise of this disturbance did not fail to reach the interior of the prison in fact the reflection of the flames lighted up the ward in which jack sheppard was confined the night his execution was therefore passed in a most anxious state of mind nor was his uneasiness allayed by the appearance of jonathan wild who after he had been driven from the roof of the jail repaired to the middle stone ward in a fit of ungovernable passion to vent his rage upon the prisoner whom he looked upon as the cause of the present calamity such was his fury that if he had not been restrained by the presence of the two turnkeys he might perhaps have anticipated the course of justice by laying violent hands upon his victim after venting his wrath in the wildest manner and uttering the most dreadful execrations jonathan retired to another part of the prison where he passed the night in consultation with the governor as to the best means of conveying the prisoner securely to tyburn mr pitt endeavoured to dissuade him from attending in person representing the great risk he would incur from the mob which was certain to be assembled but jonathan was not to be deterred i have sworn to see him hanged he said and nothing shall keep me awaynothing by by wilds advice the usual constabulary force was greatly augmented messengers were despatched to all the constables and headboroughs to be in attendanceto the sheriffs to have an extraordinary number of their officers in attendanceand to the savoy to obtain the escort of a troop of grenadierguards in short more preparations were made than if a state criminal was about to be executed the morning of monday the th of november at length dawned it was a dull foggy day and the atmosphere was so thick and heavy that at eight oclock the curious who arrived near the prison could scarcely discern the tower of st sepulchres church by and by the tramp of horses feet was heard slowly ascending snow hill and presently a troop of grenadier guards rode into the area facing newgate these were presently joined by a regiment of foot a large body of the constables of westminster next made their appearance the chief of whom entered the lodge where they were speedily joined by the civic authorities at nine oclock the sheriffs arrived followed by their officers and javelinmen meantime the stone hall was crowded by all the inmates of the jail debtors felons turnkeys and officers who could obtain permission to witness the ceremony of the prisoners irons being struck off caliban who through the interest of mr ireton was appointed to the office stood with a hammer in one hand and a punch in the other near the great stone block ready to fulfil his duty close behind him stood the tall gaunt figure of marvel with his large bony hands his scraggy neck and illfavoured countenance next to the executioner stood his wifethe former mrs spurling mrs marvel held her handkerchief to her eyes and appeared in great distress but her husband whose deportment to her was considerably changed since the fatal knot had been tied paid no attention whatever to her grief at this moment the bell of newgate began to toll and was answered by another bell from st sepulchres the great door of the stone hall was thrown open and the sheriffs preceded by the javelinmen entered the room they were followed by jonathan who carried a stout stick under his arm and planted himself near the stone not a word was uttered by the assemblage but a hush of expectation reigned throughout another door was next opened and preceded by the ordinary with the sacred volume in his hand the prisoner entered the room though encumbered by his irons his step was firm and his demeanour dignified his countenance was pale as death but not a muscle quivered nor did he betray the slightest appearance of fear on the contrary it was impossible to look at him without perceiving that his resolution was unshaken advancing with a slow firm step to the stoneblock he placed his left foot upon it drew himself up to his full height and fixed a look so stern upon jonathan that the thieftaker quailed before it illustration the black meantime began to ply his hammer and speedily unriveted the chains the first stroke appeared to arouse all the vindictive passions of jonathan fixing a ferocious and exulting look upon jack sheppard he exclaimed at length my vengeance is complete wretch cried jack raising his hand in a menacing manner your triumph will be shortlived before a year has expired you will share the same fate if i do i care not rejoined wild i shall have lived to see you hanged o jack dear dear jack cried mrs marvel who was now quite dissolved in tears i shall never survive this scene hold your tongue hussy cried her husband gruffly women ought never to show themselves on these occasions unless they can behave themselves properly farewell jack cried twenty voices sheppard looked round and exchanged kindly glances with several of those who addressed him my limbs feel so light now that my irons are removed he observed with a smile that i am half inclined to dance youll dance upon nothing presently rejoined jonathan brutally farewell for ever said jack extending his hand to mrs marvel farewell blubbered the executioners wife pressing his hand to her lips here are a pair of gloves and a nosegay for you oh dearoh dear be careful of him she added to her husband and get it over quickly or never expect to see me again peace fool cried marvel angrily do you think i dont know my own business austin and langley then advanced to the prisoner and twinning their arms round his led him down to the lodge whither he was followed by the sheriffs the ordinary wild and the other officials meantime every preparation had been made outside for his departure at the end of two long lines of footguards stood the cart with a powerful black horse harnessed to it at the head of the cart was placed the coffin on the right were several mounted grenadiers on the left some half dozen javelinmen soldiers were stationed at different points of the street to keep off the mob and others were riding backwards and forwards to maintain an open space for the passage of the procession the assemblage which was gathered together was almost countless every housetop every window every wall every projection had its occupants the wall of st sepulchres church was coveredso was the tower the concourse extended along giltspur street as far as smithfield no one was allowed to pass along newgate street which was barricaded and protected by a strong constabulary force the first person who issued from the lodge was mr marvel who proceeded to the cart and took his seat upon the coffin the hangman is always an object of peculiar detestation to the mob a tremendous hooting hailed his appearance and both staves and swords were required to preserve order a deep silence however now prevailed broken only by the tolling of the bells of newgate and st sepulchres the mighty concourse became for a moment still suddenly such a shout as has seldom smitten human ears rent the air he comes cried a thousand voices and the shout ascended to smithfield descended to snow hill and told those who were assembled on holborn hill that sheppard had left the prison between the two officers with their arms linked in his jack sheppard was conducted to the cart he looked around and as he heard that deafening shoutas he felt the influence of those thousand eyes fixed upon himas he listened to the cheers all his misgivingsif he had anyvanished and he felt more as if he were marching to a triumph than proceeding to a shameful death jack had no sooner taken his place in the cart than he was followed by the ordinary who seated himself beside him and opening the book of prayer began to read aloud excited by the scene jack however could pay little attention to the good mans discourse and was lost in a whirl of tumultuous emotions the calvacade was now put slowly in motion the horsesoldiers wheeled round and cleared a path the foot closed in upon the cart then came the javelinmen walking four abreast and lastly a long line of constables marching in the same order the procession had just got into line of march when a dreadful groan mixed with yells hootings and execrations was heard this was occasioned by jonathan wild who was seen to mount his horse and join the train jonathan however paid no sort of attention to this demonstration of hatred he had buckled on his hanger and had two brace of pistols in his belt as well as others in this holsters by this time the procession had reached the west end of the wall of st sepulchres church where in compliance with an old custom it halted by the will of mr robert dow merchant tailor it was appointed that the sexton of st sepulchres should pronounce a solemn exhortation upon every criminal on his way to tyburn for which office he was to receive a small stipend as soon as the cavalcade stopped the sexton advanced and ringing a handbell pronounced the following admonition all good people pray heartily unto god for this poor sinner who is now going to take his death for whom this great bell doth toll you who are condemned to die repent with lamentable tears ask mercy of the lord for the salvation of your own soul through the merits of the death and passion of jesus christ who now sits at the right hand of god to make intercession for you if you penitently return to him the lord have mercy upon you this ceremony concluded the calvacade was again put in motion slowly descending snow hill the train passed on its way attended by the same stunning vociferations cheers yells and outcries which had accompanied it on starting from newgate the guards had great difficulty in preserving a clear passage without resorting to severe measures for the tide which poured upon them behind around in front and at all sides was almost irresistible the houses on snow hill were thronged like those in old bailey every window from the groundfloor to the garret had its occupant and the roofs were covered with spectators words of encouragement and sympathy were addressed to jack who as he looked around beheld many a friendly glance fixed upon him in this way they reached holborn bridge here a little delay occurred the passage was so narrow that there was only sufficient room for the cart to pass with a single line of footsoldiers on one side and as the walls of the bridge were covered with spectators it was not deemed prudent to cross it till these persons were dislodged while this was effected intelligence was brought that a formidable mob was pouring down field lane the end of which was barricaded the advanced guard rode on to drive away any opposition while the main body of the procession crossed the bridge and slowly toiled up holborn hill the entrance of shoe lane and the whole line of the wall of st andrews church the bell of which was tolling was covered with spectators upon the steps leading to the gates of the church stood two persons whom jack instantly recognised these were his mistresses poll maggot and edgeworth bess as soon as the latter beheld him she uttered a loud scream and fainted she was caught by some of the bystanders who offered by her every assistance in their power as to mrs maggot whose nerves were more firmly strung she contented herself with waving her hand affectionately to her lover and encouraging him by her gestures while this was taking place another and more serious interruption occurred the advanced guard had endeavoured to disperse the mob in field lane but were not prepared to meet with the resistance they encountered the pavement had been hastily picked up and heaped across the end of the street upon which planks barrels and other barricades were laid most of the mob were armed with pikes staves swords muskets and other weapons and offered a most desperate resistance to the soldiery whom they drove back with a shower of pavingstones the arrival of the cart at the end of field lane appeared the signal for an attempt at rescue with a loud shout and headed by a powerfullybuilt man with a face as black as that of a mulatto and armed with a cutlass the rabble leapt over the barricades and rushed towards the vehicle an immediate halt took place the soldiers surrounded the cart drew their swords and by striking the rioters first with the blunt edge of their blades and afterwards with the sharp points succeeded in driving them back amid this skirmish jonathan greatly distinguished himself drawing his hanger he rode amongst the crowd trampled upon those most in advance and made an attempt to seize their leader in whom he recognised blueskin baffled in their attempt the mob uttered a roar such as only a thousand angry voices can utter and discharged a volley of missiles at the soldiery stones and brickbats were showered on all sides and mr marvel was almost dislodged from his seat on the coffin by a dead dog which was hurled against him and struck him in the face at length however by dealing blows right and left with their swords and even inflicting severe cuts on the foremost of the rabble the soldiers managed to gain a clear course and to drive back the assailants who as they retreated behind the barricades shouted in tones of defiance to tyburn to tyburn the object of all this tumult meanwhile never altered his position but sat back in the cart as if resolved not to make even a struggle to regain his liberty the procession now wound its way without further interruption along holborn like a river swollen by many currents it gathered force from the various avenues that poured their streams into it fetter lane on the left grays inn on the right added their supplies on all hands jack was cheered and jonathan hooted illustration at length the train approached st giless here according to another old custom already alluded to a criminal taken to execution was allowed to halt at a tavern called the crown and take a draught from st giless bowl as his last refreshment on earth at the door of this tavern which was situated on the left of the street not more than a hundred yards distant from the church the bell of which began to toll as soon as the procession came in sight the cart drew up and the whole cavalcade halted a wooden balcony in one of the adjoining houses was thronged with ladies all of whom appeared to take a lively interest in the scene and to be full of commiseration for the criminal not perhaps unmixed with admiration of his appearance every window in the public house was filled with guests and as in the case of st andrews the churchyard wall of st giless was lined with spectators a scene now ensued highly characteristic of the age and the occasion the doleful procession at once assumed a festive character many of the soldiers dismounted and called for drink their example was immediately imitated by the officers constables javelin men and other attendants and nothing was to be heard but shouts of laughter and jestingnothing seen but the passing of glasses and the emptying of foaming jugs mr marvel who had been a little discomposed by the treatment he had experienced on holborn hill very composedly filled and lighted his pipe one group at the door attracted jacks attention inasmuch as it was composed of several of his old acquaintancesmr kneebone van galgebrok and baptist kettlebyall of whom greeted him cordially besides these there was a sturdylooking fellow whom he instantly recognised as the honest blacksmith who had freed him from his irons at tottenham i am here you see said the smith so i perceive replied jack at this moment the landlord of the crown a joviallooking stout personage with a white apron round his waist issued from the house bearing a large wooden bowl filled with ale which he offered to jack who instantly rose to receive it raising the bowl in his right hand jack glanced towards the balcony in which the group of ladies were seated and begged to drink their healths he then turned to kneebone and the others who extended their hands towards him and raised it to his lips just as he was about to drain it he encountered the basilisk glance of jonathan wild and paused i leave this bowl for you he cried returning it to the landlord untasted your father said so before you replied jonathan malignantly and yet it has tarried thus long you will call for it before six months are passed rejoined jack sternly once again the cavalcade was in motion and winding its way by st giless church the bell of which continued tolling all the time passed the pound and entered oxford road or as it was then not unfrequently termed tyburn road after passing tottenham court road very few houses were to be seen on the right hand opposite wardour street it was open country the crowd now dispersed amongst the fields and thousands of persons were seen hurrying towards tyburn as fast as their legs could carry them leaping over hedges and breaking down every impediment in their course besides those who conducted themselves more peaceably the conductors of the procession noticed with considerable uneasiness large bands of men armed with staves bludgeons and other weapons who were flying across the field in the same direction as it was feared that some mischief would ensue wild volunteered if he were allowed a small body of men to ride forward to tyburn and keep the ground clear until the arrival of the prisoner this suggestion being approved was instantly acted upon and the thieftaker accompanied by a body of the grenadiers rode forward the train meantime had passed marylebone lane when it again paused for a moment at jacks request near the door of a publichouse called the city of oxford scarcely had it come to a halt when a stalwart man shouldered his way in spite of their opposition through the lines of soldiery to the cart and offered his large horny hand to the prisoner i told you i would call to bid you farewell mr figg said jack so you did replied the prizefighter sorry youre obliged to keep your word heard of your last escape hoped youd not be retaken never sent for the shirt i didnt want it replied jack but who are those gentlemen friends of yours replied figg come to see yousir james thornhill mr hogarth and mr gay they send you every good wish offer them my hearty thanks replied jack waving his hand to the group all of whom returned the salutation and now farewell mr figg in a few minutes all will be over figg turned aside to hide the tears that started to his eyesfor the stout prizefighter with a mans courage had a womans heartand the procession again set forward chapter xxxii the closing scene tyburn was now at hand over the sea of heads arose a black and dismal object it was the gallows jack whose back was towards it did not see it but he heard from the pitying exclamations of the crowd that it was in view this circumstance produced no further alteration in his demeanour except that he endeavoured to abstract himself from the surrounding scene and bend his attention to the prayers which the ordinary was reciting just as he had succeeded in fixing his attention it was again shaken and he was almost unnerved by the sight of mr wood who was standing at the edge of a raised platform anxiously waving his hand to him jack instantly sprang to his feet and as his guards construed the motion into an attempt to escape several of them drew their swords and motioned to him to sit down but jack did not heed them his looks were fixed on his old benefactor god in heaven bless you unhappy boy cried wood bursting into tears god bless you jack extended his hand towards him and looked anxiously for thames but he was nowhere to be seen a severe pang shot through jacks heart and he would have given worlds if he possessed them to have seen his friend once more the wish was vain and endeavouring to banish every earthly thought he addressed himself deeply and sincerely to prayer while this was passing jonathan had ridden back to marvel to tell him that all was ready and to give him his last instructions youll lose no time said the thieftaker a hundred pounds if you do it quickly rely on me rejoined the executioner throwing away his pipe which was just finished a deep dread calm like that which precedes a thunderstorm now prevailed amongst the assemblage the thousand voices which a few moments before had been so clamorous were now hushed not a breath was drawn the troops had kept a large space clear around the gallows the galleries adjoining it were crowded with spectatorsso was the roof of a large tavern then the only house standing at the end of the edgeware roadso were the treesthe walls of hyde parka neighbouring barn a shedin short every available position the cart meantime had approached the fatal tree the guards horse and foot and constables formed a wide circle round it to keep off the mob it was an awful momentso awful that every other feeling except deep interest in the scene seemed suspended at this terrible juncture jack maintained his composurea smile played upon his face before the cap was drawn over itand the last words he uttered were my poor mother i shall soon join her the rope was then adjusted and the cart began to move illustration the next instant he was launched into eternity scarcely had he been turned off a moment when a man with swarthy features leapt into the cart with an open claspknife in his hand and before he could be prevented severed the rope and cut down the body it was blueskin his assistance came too late a ball from wilds pistol passed through his heart and a volley of musketry poured from the guards lodged several balls in the yet breathing body of his leader blueskin however was not unattended a thousand eager assistants pressed behind him jacks body was caught and passed from hand to hand over a thousand heads till it was far from the fatal tree the shouts of indignationthe frightful yells now raised baffle description a furious attack was made on jonathan who though he defended himself like a lion was desperately wounded and would inevitably have perished if he had not been protected by the guards who were obliged to use both swords and firearms upon the mob in his defence he was at length rescued from his assailantsrescued to perish seven months afterwards with every ignominy at the very gibbet to which he had brought his victim the body of jack sheppard meanwhile was borne along by that tremendous host which rose and fell like the waves of the ocean until it approached the termination of the edgeware road at this point a carriage with servants in sumptuous liveries was stationed at the open door stood a young man in a rich garb with a mask on his face who was encouraging the mob by words and gestures at length the body was brought towards him instantly seizing it the young man placed it in the carriage shut the door and commanded his servants to drive off the order was promptly obeyed and the horses proceeded at a furious pace along the edgeware road half an hour afterwards the body of jack was carefully examined it had been cut down before life was extinct but a ball from one of the soldiers had pierced his heart thus died jack sheppard that night a grave was dug in willesden churchyard next to that in which mrs sheppard had been interred two persons besides the clergyman and sexton alone attended the ceremony they were a young man and an old one and both appeared deeply affected the coffin was lowered into the grave and the mourners departed a simple wooden monument was placed over the grave but without any name or date in after years some pitying hand supplied the inscription which ran thus illustration the end
