adjoining the vintry wharf and at the corner of a narrow lane communicating with thames street there stood in the early part of the seventeenth century a tavern called the three cranes this old and renowned place of entertainment had then been in existence more than two hundred years though under other designations in the reign of richard ii when it was first established it was styled the painted tavern from the circumstance of its outer walls being fancifully coloured and adorned with bacchanalian devices but these decorations went out of fashion in time and the tavern somewhat changing its external features though preserving all its internal comforts and accommodation assumed the name of the three crowns under which title it continued until the accession of elizabeth when it became by a slight modification the three cranes and so remained in the days of her successor and indeed long afterwards not that the lastadopted denomination had any reference as might be supposed to the three huge wooden instruments on the wharf employed with ropes and pulleys to unload the lighters and other vessels that brought up butts and hogsheads of wine from the larger craft below bridge and constantly thronged the banks though no doubt they indirectly suggested it the three cranes depicted on the large signboard suspended in front of the tavern were longnecked longbeaked birds each with a golden fish in its bill but under whatever designation it might be knowncrown or cranethe tavern had always maintained a high reputation for excellence of wine and this is the less surprising when we take into account its close proximity to the vast vaults and cellars of the vintry where the choicest produce of gascony bordeaux and other winegrowing districts was deposited some of which we may reasonably conclude would find its way to its tables good wine it may be incidentally remarked was cheap enough when the three cranes was first opened the delicate juice of the gascoign grape being then vended at fourpence the gallon and rhenish at sixpence prices however had risen considerably at the period of which we propose to treat but the tavern was as wellreputed and wellfrequented as ever even more so for it had considerably advanced in estimation since it came into the hands of a certain enterprising french skipper prosper bonaventure by name who intrusted its management to his active and pretty little wife dameris while he himself prosecuted his trading voyages between the garonne and the thames and very well madame bonaventure fulfilled the duties of hostess as will be seen now as the skipper was a very sharp fellow and perfectly understood his businesspractically anticipating the transatlantic axiom of buying at the cheapest market and selling at the dearesthe soon contrived to grow rich he did more he pleased his customers at the three cranes taking care to select his wines judiciously and having good opportunities he managed to obtain possession of some delicious vintages which could not be matched elsewhere and with this nectar at his command the fortune of his house was made all the town gallants flocked to the three cranes to dine at the admirable french ordinary newly established there and crush a flask or so of the exquisite bordeaux about which and its delicate flavour and bouquet all the connoisseurs in claret were raving from midday therefore till late in the afternoon there were nearly as many gay barges and wherries as lighters lying off the vintry wharf and sometimes when accommodation was wanting the little craft were moored along the shore all the way from queenhithe to the steelyard at which latter place the catherine wheel was almost as much noted for racy rhenish and highdried neats tongues as our tavern was for fine bordeaux and wellseasoned pates not the least however of the attractions of the three cranes was the hostess herself a lively little brunette was madame bonaventure still young or at all events very far from being old with extremely fine teeth which she was fond of displaying and a remarkably neat ankle which she felt no inclination to hide beneath the sweep of her round circling farthingale her figure was quite that of a miniature venus and as like most of her countrywomen she understood the art of dress to admiration she set off her person to the best advantage always attiring herself in a style and in colours that suited her and never indulging in an unwarrantable extravagance of ruff or absurd and unbecoming length of peaked boddice as to the stuffs she wore they were certainly above her station for no court dame could boast of richer silks than those in which the pretty dameris appeared on fete days and this was accounted for by reason that the good skipper seldom returned from a trip to france without bringing his wife a piece of silk brocade or velvet from lyons or some little matter from paris such as a ruff cuff partlet bandlet or fillet thus the last french mode might be seen at the three crowns displayed by the hostess as well as the last french entremet at its table since among other important accessories to the welldoing of the house madame bonaventure kept a chef de cuisineone of her compatriotsof such superlative skill that in later times he must infallibly have been distinguished as a cordon bleu but not having yet completed our description of the charming bordelaise we must add that she possessed a rich southern complexion fine sparkling black eyes shaded by long dark eyelashes and overarched by jetty brows and that her raven hair was combed back and gathered in a large roll over her smooth forehead which had the five points of beauty complete over this she wore a prettilyconceived coif with a frontlet a wellstarched wellplaited ruff encompossed her throat her upper lip was darkened but in the slightest degree by down like the softest silk and this peculiarity a peculiarity it would be in an englishwoman though frequently observable in the beauties of the south of france lent additional piquancy and zest to her charms in the eyes of her numerous adorers her ankles we have said were trim and it may be added that they were oftener displayed in an embroidered french velvet shoe than in one of spanish leather while in walking out she increased her stature by the altitude of a chopine captain bonaventure was by no means jealous and even if he had been it would have mattered little since he was so constantly away fancying therefore she had some of the privileges of a widow our lively dameris flirted a good deal with the gayest and handsomest of the galliards frequenting her house but she knew where to stop no licence or indecorum was ever permitted at the three cranes and that is saying a great deal in favour of the hostess when the dissolute character of the age is taken into consideration besides this cyprien a stout wellfavoured young gascon who filled the posts of drawer and chamberlain together with two or three other trencherscrapers who served at table and waited on the guests were generally sufficient to clear the house of any troublesome roysterers thus the reputation of the three cranes was unblemished in spite of the liveliness and coquetry of its mistress and in spite also of the malicious tongues of rival tavernkeepers which were loud against it a pretty woman is sure to have enemies and calumniators and madame bonaventure had more than enow but she thought very little about them there was one point however on which it behoved her to be careful and extremely careful she wasnot leaving a single loophole for censure or attack this was the question of religion on first taking the house madame bonaventure gave it out that she and the skipper were huguenots descended from families who had suffered much persecution during the time of the league for staunch adherence to their faith and the statement was generally credited though there were some who professed to doubt it certain it was our hostess did not wear any cross beads or other outward symbol of papacy and though this might count for little it was never discovered that she attended mass in secret her movements were watched but without anything coming to light that had reference to religious observances of any kind those who tried to trace her found that her visits were mostly paid to paris garden the rose and the globe where our immortal bards plays were then being performed or some other place of amusement and if she did go on the river at times it was merely upon a party of pleasure accompanied by gay gallants in velvet cloaks and silken doublets and by lighthearted dames like herself and not by notorious plotters or sour priests still as many bordeaux merchants frequented the house as well as traders from the hanse towns and other foreigners it was looked upon by the suspicious as a hotbed of romish heresy and treason moreover these maligners affirmed that english recusants as well as seminary priests from abroad had been harboured there and clandestinely spirited away from the pursuit of justice by the skipper but the charges were never substantiated and could therefore only proceed from envy and malice whatever madame bonaventures religious opinions might be she kept her own council so well that no one ever found them out but evil days were at hand hitherto all had been smiling and prosperous the prospect now began to darken within the last twelve months a strange and unlooked for interference had taken place with our hostesss profits which she had viewed at first without much anxiety because she did not clearly comprehend its scope but latterly as its formidable character became revealed it began to fill her with uneasiness the calamity as she naturally enough regarded it arose in the following manner the present was an age of monopolies and patents granted by a crown ever eager to obtain money under any pretext however unjustifiable and iniquitous provided it was plausibly coloured and these vexatious privileges were purchased by greedy and unscrupulous persons for the purpose of turning them into instruments of extortion and wrong though various branches of trade and industry groaned under the oppression inflicted upon them there were no means of redress the patentees enjoyed perfect immunity grinding them down as they pleased farming out whole districts and dividing the spoil their miserable victims dared scarcely murmur having ever the terrible court of starchamber before them which their persecutors could command and which punished libellersas they would be accounted if they gave utterance to their wrongs and charged their oppressors with misdoingwith fine branding and the pillory many were handled in this sort and held up in terrorem to the others hence it came to pass that the starchamber from the fearful nature of its machinery its extraordinary powers the notorious corruption and venality of its officers the peculiarity of its practice which always favoured the plaintiff and the severity with which it punished any libelling or slanderous words uttered against the kings representative as the patentees were considered or any conspiracy or false accusation brought against them it came to pass we say that this terrible court became as much dreaded in protestant england as the inquisition in catholic spain the punishments inflicted by the starchamber were as we learn from a legal authority and a counsel in the court fine imprisonment loss of ears or nailing to the pillory slitting the nose branding the forehead whipping of late days wearing of papers in public places or any punishment but death and john chamberlain esq writing to sir dudley carlton about the same period observes that the world is now much terrified with the starchamber there being not so little an offence against any proclamation but is liable and subject to the censure of that court and for proclamations and patents they are become so ordinary that there is no end every day bringing forth some new project or other as within these two days here is one come forth for tobacco wholly engrossed by sir thomas roe and his partners which if they can keep and maintain against the general clamour will be a great commodity unless peradventure indignation rather than all other reasons may bring that filthy weed out of use what would be the effect of such a patent nowadays would it at all restrict the use of the filthy weed in truth proceeds chamberlain the world doth even groan under the burthen of these perpetual patents which are become so frequent that whereas at the kings coming in there were complaints of some eight or nine monopolies then in being they are now said to be multiplied to as many scores from the foregoing citation from a private letter of the time the state of public feeling may be gathered and the alarm occasioned in all classes by these oppressions perfectly understood amongst those who had obtained the largest share of spoil were two persons destined to occupy a prominent position in our history they were sir giles mompesson and sir francis mitchellboth names held in general dread and detestation though no man ventured to speak ill of them openly since they were as implacable in their animosities as usurious and griping in their demands and many an ear had been lost many a nose slit many a back scourged at the carts tail because the unfortunate owners had stigmatized them according to their deserts thus they enjoyed a complete immunity of wrong and with the terrible court of starchamber to defend them and to punish their enemies they set all opposition at defiance insatiable as unscrupulous this avaricious pair were ever on the alert to devise new means of exaction and plunder and amongst the latest and most productive of their inventions were three patents which they had obtained through the instrumentality of sir edward villiers halfbrother of the ruling favourite the marquess of buckinghamand for due considerationmoney of coursefor the licensing of alehouses the inspection of inns and hostelries and the exclusive manufacture of gold and silver thread it is with the two former of these that we have now to deal inasmuch as it was their mischievous operation that affected madame bonaventure so prejudicially and this we shall more fully explain as it will serve to show the working of a frightful system of extortion and injustice happily no longer in existence by the sweeping powers conferred upon them by their patents the whole of the inns of the metropolis were brought under the control of the two extortioners who levied such imposts as they pleased the withdrawal of a license or the total suppression of a tavern on the plea of its being a riotous and disorderly house immediately followed the refusal of any demand however excessive and most persons preferred the remote possibility of ruin with the chance of averting it by ready submission to the positive certainty of losing both substance and liberty by resistance fearful was the havoc occasioned by these licensed depredators yet no one dared to check themno one ventured to repine they had the name of law to justify their proceedings and all its authority to uphold them compromises were attempted in some instances but they were found unavailing easily evaded by persons who never intended to be bound by them they only added keenness to the original provocation without offering a remedy for it the two bloodsuckers it was clear would not desist from draining the lifecurrent from the veins of their victims while a drop remained and they were well served in their iniquitous taskfor the plain reason that they paid their agents well partners they had none none at least who cared to acknowledge themselves as such but the subordinate officers of the law and indeed some high in office it was hinted the sheriffs followers bailiffs tipstaves and others were all in their pay besides a host of myrmidonsbase sordid knaves who scrupled not at falseswearing cozenage or any sort of rascality even forgery of legal documents if required no wonder poor madame bonaventure finding she had got into the clutches of these harpies began to tremble for the result chapter ii sir giles mompesson and his partner madame bonaventure had already paid considerable sums to the two extortioners but she resisted their last application in consequence of which she received a monition from sir giles mompesson to the effect that in a months time her license would be withdrawn and her house shut up unless in the interim she consented to make amends to himself and his copatentee sir francis mitchell by payment of the sum in question together with a further sum equal to it in amount by way of forfeit thus doubling the original demand our pretty hostess it would seem had placed herself in an awkward predicament by her temerity sir giles was not a man to threaten idly as all who had incurred his displeasure experienced to their cost his plan was to make himself feared and he was inexorable as fate itself to a creditor he ever exacted the full penalty of his bond in this instance according to his own notion he had acted with great leniency and certainly judged by his customary mode of proceeding in such cases he had shown some little indulgence in this line of conduct he had been mainly influenced by his partner who not being insensible to the attractions of the fair hostess hoped to win her favour by a show of consideration but though madame bonaventure was willing enough for her own purposes to encourage sir francis mitchells attentions she detested him in her secret heart she by no means relied upon him for security a more powerful friend was held in reserve whom she meant to produce at the last moment and consequently she was not so ill at ease as she otherwise would have been though by no means free from misgiving sir giles mompesson was a terrible enemy and seldom thwarted in his purpose that she knew but no man was more keenly alive to his own interest than he and she persuaded herself he would find it to his advantage not to molest her in which case she was safe of sir francis mitchell she had less apprehension for though equally mischievous and malevolent with his partner he was far feebler of purpose and for the most part governed by him besides she felt she had the amorous knight in her toils and could easily manage him if he were alone so the case stood with respect to our pretty hostess but before proceeding further it may be well to give a more complete description of the two birds of prey by whom she was threatened with beak and talon the masterspirit of the twain was undoubtedly sir giles mompesson quick in conception of villainy he was equally daring in execution how he had risen to his present bad eminence no one precisely knew because with the craft and subtlety that distinguished him he laid his schemes so deeply and covered his proceedings with so thick a veil that they had been rarely detected report however spoke of him as a usurer of the vilest kind who wrung exorbitant interest from needy borrowerswho advanced money to expectant heirs with the intention of plundering them of their inheritanceand who resorted to every trick and malpractice permitted by the law to benefit himself at his neighbours expense these were bad enough but even graver accusations were made against him it was whispered that he had obtained fraudulent possession of deeds and family papers which had enabled him to wrest estates from their rightful owners and some did not scruple to add to these charges that he had forged documents to carry out his nefarious designs be this as it may from comparative poverty he speedily rose to wealth and as his means increased so his avaricious schemes were multiplied and extended his earlier days were passed in complete obscurity none but the neediest spendthrift or the most desperate gambler knowing where he dwelt and every one who found him out in his wretched abode near the marshalsea had reason to regret his visit now he was well enough known by many a courtly prodigal and his large mansion near fleet bridge it was said of him that he always chose the neigbourhood of a prison for his dwelling was resorted to by the town gallants whose necessities or extravagance compelled them to obtain supplies at exorbitant interest lavish in his expenditure on occasions sir giles was habitually so greedy and penurious that he begrudged every tester he expended he wished to keep up a show of hospitality without cost and secretly pleased himself by thinking that he made his guests pay for his entertainments and even for his establishment his servants complained of being halfstarved though he was constantly at war with them for their wastefulness and riot he made however a great display of attendants inasmuch as he had a whole retinue of myrmidons at his beck and call and these as before observed were well paid they were the crows that followed the vultures and picked the bones of the spoil when their ravening masters had been fully glutted in the court of starchamber as already remarked sir giles mompesson found an instrument in every way fitted to his purposes and he worked it with terrible effect as will be shown hereafter with him it was at once a weapon to destroy and a shield to protect this court claimed a superlative power not only to take causes from other courts and punish them there but also to punish offences secondarily when other courts have punished them taking advantage of this privilege when a suit was commenced against him elsewhere sir giles contrived to remove it to the starchamber where being omnipotent with clerks and counsel he was sure of successthe complaints being so warily contrived the examinations so adroitly framed and the interrogatories so numerous and perplexing that the defendant or delinquent as he was indifferently styled was certain to be baffled and defeated the sentences of this court it has been said by one intimately acquainted with its practice and very favourably inclined to it strike to the root of mens reputations and many times of their estates and again it was a rule with it that the prosecutor was ever intended to be favoured knowing this as well as the high legal authority from whom we have quoted sir giles ever placed himself in the favoured position and with the aid of this iniquitous tribunal blasted many a fair reputation and consigned many a victim of its injustice to the fleet there to rot till he paid him the utmost of his demands or paid the debt of nature in an age less corrupt and venal than that under consideration such a career could not have long continued without check but in the time of james the first from the neediness of the monarch himself and the rapacity of his minions and courtiers and their satelliteseach striving to enrich himself no matter howa thousand abuses both of right and justice were tolerated or connived at crime stalking abroad unpunished the starchamber itself served the king as in a less degree it served sir giles mompesson and others of the same stamp as a means of increasing his revenue half the fines mulcted from those who incurred its censure or its punishments being awarded to the crown thus nice inquiries were rarely made unless a public example was needed when the wrongdoer was compelled to disgorge his plunder but this was never done till the pear was fully ripe sir giles however had no apprehensions of any such result in his case like a sly fox or rather like a crafty wolf he was too confident in his own cunning and resources to fear being caught in such a trap his title was purchased and he reaped his reward in the consequence it gave him sir francis mitchell acted likewise and it was about this time that the connection between the worthy pair commenced hitherto they had been in opposition and though very different in temperament and in modes of proceeding they had one aim in common and recognizing great merit in each other coupled with a power of mutual assistance they agreed to act in concert sir francis was as cautious and timid as sir giles was daring and inflexible the one being the best contriver of a scheme and the other the fittest to carry it out sir francis trembled at his own devices and their possible consequences sir giles adopted his schemes if promising and laughed at the difficulties and dangers that beset them the one was the head the other the arm not that sir giles lacked the ability to weave as subtle a web of deceit as his partner but each took his line it saved time the plan of licensing and inspecting taverns and hotels had originated with sir francis and very profitable it proved but sir giles carried it out much further than his partner had proposed or thought prudent and they were as different in personal appearance as in mental qualities and disposition mompesson was the dashing eagle mitchell the sorry kite sir francis was weakly emaciated in frame much given to sensual indulgence and his body conformed to his timorous organization his shrunken shanks scarcely sufficed to support him his back was bent his eyes blear his head bald and his chin which was continually wagging clothed with a scanty yellow beard shaped like a stiletto while his sandy moustachios were curled upward he was dressed in the extremity of the fashion and affected the air of a young court gallant his doublet hose and mantle were ever of the gayest and most fanciful hues and of the richest stuffs he wore a diamond brooch in his beaver and sashes tied like garters round his thin legs which were utterly destitute of calf preposterously large roses covered his shoes his ruff was a treblequadruplededalion his gloves richly embroidered a large crimson satin purse hung from his girdle and he was scented with powders and pulvilios this withered coxcomb affected the mincing gait of a young man and though rather an object of derision than admiration with the fair sex persuaded himself they were all captivated by him the vast sums he so unjustly acquired did not long remain in his possession but were dispersed in ministering to his follies and depravity timorous he was by nature as we have said but cruel and unrelenting in proportion to his cowardice and where an injury could be securely inflicted or a prostrate foe struck with impunity he never hesitated for a moment sir giles himself was scarcely so malignant and implacable a strong contrast to this dastardly debauchee was offered by the bolder villain sir giles mompesson was a very handsome man with a striking physiognomy but dark and sinister in expression his eyes were black singularly piercing and flashed with the fiercest fire when kindled by passion a finelyformed aquiline nose gave a hawklike character to his face his hair was coalblack though he was no longer young and hung in long ringlets over his neck and shoulders he wore the handsomely cut beard and moustache subsequently depicted in the portraits of vandyke which suited the stern gravity of his countenance rich though sober in his attire he always affected a dark colour being generally habited in a doublet of black quilted silk venetian hose and a murreycoloured velvet mantle his conical hat was ornamented with a single black ostrich feather and he carried a long rapier by his side in the use of which he was singularly skilful being one of vincentio saviolos best pupils sir giles was a little above the middle height with a well proportioned athletic figure and his strength and address were such that there seemed good reason for his boast when he declared as he often did that he feared no man living in fair fight no nor any two men sir giles had none of the weaknesses of his partner temperate in his living he had never been known to commit an excess at table nor were the blandishments or lures of the fair sex ever successfully spread for him if his arm was of iron his heart seemed of adamant utterly impenetrable by any gentle emotion it was affirmed and believed that he had never shed a tear his sole passion appeared to be the accumulation of wealth unattended by the desire to spend it he bestowed no gifts he had no family no kinsmen whom he cared to acknowledge he stood alonea hard grasping man a bondslave of mammon when it pleased him sir giles mompesson could play the courtier and fawn and gloze like the rest a consummate hypocrite he easily assumed any part he might be called upon to enact but the tone natural to him was one of insolent domination and bitter raillery he sneered at all things human and divine and there was mockery in his laughter as well as venom in his jests his manner however was not without a certain cold and grave dignity and he clothed himself like his purposes in inscrutable reserve on occasions requiring it so ominous was his presence that many persons got out of his way fearing to come in contact with him or give him offence and the broad walk at pauls was sometimes cleared as he took his way along it followed by his band of tipstaves if this were the case with persons who had no immediate ground of apprehension from him how much terror his sombre figure must have inspired when presented as it was to madame bonaventure with the aspect of a merciless creditor armed with full power to enforce his claims and resolved not to abate a jot of them will be revealed to the reader in our next chapter chapter iii the french ordinary the month allowed by the notice expired and madame bonaventures day of reckoning arrived no arrangement had been attempted in the interim though abundant opportunities of doing so were afforded her as sir francis mitchell visited the three cranes almost daily she appeared to treat the matter very lightly always putting it off when mentioned and even towards the last seemed quite unconcerned as if entertaining no fear of the result apparently everything went on just as usual and no one would have supposed from madame bonaventures manner that she was aware of the possibility of a mine being sprung beneath her feet perhaps she fancied she had countermined her opponents and so felt secure her indifference puzzled sir francis who knew not whether to attribute it to insensibility or overconfidence he was curious to see how she would conduct herself when the crisis came and for that purpose repaired to the tavern about dinnertime on the appointed day the hostess received him very graciously trifled and jested with him as was her custom and looked all blandishments and smiles to him and everybody else as if nothing could possibly happen to disturb her serenity sir francis was more perplexed than ever with the levity and heedlessness of a frenchwoman she must have forgotten all about the claim what if he should venture to remind her of it better not the application would come soon enough he was glad it devolved upon his partner and not on himself to proceed to extremities with so charming a person he really could not do it and yet all the while he chuckled internally as he thought of the terrible dilemma in which she would be speedily caught and how completely it would place her at his mercy she must come to terms then and sir francis rubbed his skinny hands gleefully at the thought on her part madame bonaventure guessed what was passing in his breast and secretly enjoyed the idea of checkmating him with a captivating smile she left him to attend to her numerous guests and very numerous they were on that day more so than usual sir francis who had brought a boat from westminster where he dwelt experienced some difficulty in landing at the stairs invested as they were with barges wherries and watermen all of whom had evidently brought customers to the three cranes besides these there were two or three gilded pinnaces lying off the wharf with oarsmen in rich liveries evidently belonging to persons of rank the benches and little tables in front of the tavern were occupied by foreign merchants and traders discussing their affairs over a stoop of bordeaux others similarly employed sat at the open casements in the rooms above each story projecting so much beyond the other that the old building crowned with its fanciful gables and heavy chimnies looked topheavy and as if it would roll over into the thames some day others again were seated over their wine in the pleasant little chamber built over the porch which advancing considerably beyond the door afforded a delightful prospect from its lanternlike windows of the river now sparkling with sunshine it was a bright may day and covered with craft extending on the one hand to baynards castle and on the other to the most picturesque object to be found then or since in londonthe ancient bridge with its towers gateways lofty superstructures and narrow arches through which the current dashed swiftly and of course commanding a complete view of the opposite bank beginning with saint saviours fine old church winchester house the walks gardens and playhouses and ending with the fine groves of timber skirting lambeth marshes others repaired to the smooth and wellkept bowling alley in the narrow court at the back of the house where there was a mulberry tree two centuries older than the tavern itselfto recreate themselves with the healthful pastime there afforded and indulge at the same time in a few whiffs of tobacco which notwithstanding the kings fulminations against it had already made its way among the people the ordinary was held in the principal room in the house which was well enough adapted for the purpose being lofty and spacious and lighted by an oriel window at the upper end over the high carved chimneypiece were the arms of the vintners company with a bacchus for the crest the ceiling was moulded and the wainscots of oak against the latter several paintings were hung one of these represented the massacre of st bartholomew and another the triumphal entry of henri iv into rebellious paris besides these there were portraits of the reigning monarch james the first the marquis of buckingham his favourite and the youthful louis xiii king of france a long table generally ran down the centre of the room but on this occasion there was a raised crosstable at the upper end with a traverse or curtain partially drawn before it proclaiming the presence of important guests here the napery was finer and the drinkingvessels handsomer than those used at the lower board a grand banquet seemed taking place longnecked flasks were placed in coolers and the buffets were covered with flagons and glasses the table groaned beneath the number and variety of dishes set upon it in addition to the customary yeomenwaiters there were a host of servingmen in rich and varied liveries but these attended exclusively on their lords at the raised table behind the traverse as sir francis was ushered into the eatingroom he was quite taken aback by the unusually magnificent display and felt greatly surprised that no hint of the banquet had been given him on his arrival by the hostess the feast had already commenced and all the yeomenwaiters and trencherscrapers were too busily occupied to attend to him cyprien who marshalled the dishes at the lower table did not deign to notice him and was deaf to his demand for a place it seemed probable he would not obtain one at all and he was about to retire much disconcerted when a young man somewhat plainly habited and who seemed a stranger to all present very goodnaturedly made room for him in this way he was squeezed in sir francis then cast a look round to ascertain who were present but he was so inconveniently situated and the crowd of servingmen was so great at the upper table that he could only imperfectly distinguish those seated at it besides which most of the guests were hidden by the traverse such however as he could make out were richly attired in doublets of silk and satin while their rich velvet mantles plumed and jewelled caps and long rapiers were carried by their servants two or three turned round to look at him as he sat down and amongst these he remarked sir edward villiers whose presence was far from agreeable to himfor though sir edward was secretly connected with him and sir giles and took tithe of their spoliations he disowned them in public and would assuredly not countenance any open display of their rapacious proceedings another personage whom he recognised from his obesity the peculiarity of his long flowing periwig and his black velvet parisian pourpoint which contrasted forcibly with the glittering habiliments of his companions was doctor mayerneturquet the celebrated french professor of medicine then so high in favour with james that having been loaded with honours and dignities he had been recently named the kings first physician doctor mayernes abilities were so distinguished that his protestant faith alone prevented him from occupying the same eminent position in the court of france that he did in that of england the doctors presence at the banquet was unpropitious it was natural he should befriend a countrywoman and a huguenot like himself and possessing the royal ear he might make such representations as he pleased to the king of what should occur sir francis hoped he would be gone before sir giles appeared but there was yet a third person who gave the usurious knight more uneasiness than the other two this was a handsome young man with fair hair and delicate features whose slight elegant figure was arrayed in a crimsonsatin doublet slashed with white and hose of the same colours and fabric the young nobleman in question whose handsome features and prematurelywasted frame bore the impress of cynicism and debauchery was lord roos then recently entrapped into marriage with the daughter of sir thomas lake secretary of state a marriage productive of the usual consequences of such imprudent arrangementsneglect on the one side unhappiness on the other lord roos was sir franciss sworn enemy like many other such gay moths he had been severely singed by fluttering into the dazzling lights held up to him when he wanted money by the two usurers and he had often vowed revenge against them for the manner in which they had fleeced him sir francis did not usually give any great heed to his threats being too much accustomed to reproaches and menaces from his victims to feel alarm or compunction but just now the case was different and he could not help fearing the vindictive young lord might seize the opportunity of serving him an ill turnif indeed he had not come there expressly for the purpose which seemed probable from the fierce and disdainful glances he cast at him an angry murmur pervaded the upper table on sir franciss appearance and something was said which though he could not gather its precise import did not sound agreeably to his ears he felt he had unwittingly brought his head near a hornets nest and might esteem himself lucky if he escaped without stinging however there was no retreating now for though his fear counselled flight very shame restrained him the repast was varied and abundant consisting of all kinds of fricassees collops and rashers boiled salmon from the thames trout and pike from the same river boiled peachickens and turkeypoults and florentines of puff paste calvesfoot pies and set custards between each guest a boiled salad was placed which was nothing more than what we should term a dish of vegetables except that the vegetables were somewhat differently prepared cinnamon ginger and sugar being added to the pulped carrots besides a handful of currants vinegar and butter a similar plan was adopted with the salads of burrage chicory marigold leaves bugloss asparagus rocket and alexanders and many other plants discontinued in modern cookery but then much esteemed oil and vinegar being used with some and spices with all while each dish was garnished with slices of hardboiled eggs a jowl of sturgeon was carried to the upper table where there was also a baked swan and a roasted bustard flanked by two stately venison pasties this was only the first service and two others followed consisting of a fawn with a pudding inside it a grand salad hot olive pies baked neats tongues fried calves tongues baked italian puddings a farced leg of lamb in the french fashion orangeado pie buttered crabs anchovies and a plentiful supply of little made dishes and quelquechoses scattered over the table with such a profusion of good things it may appear surprising that sir francis should find very little to eat but the attendants all seemed in league against him and whenever he set his eye upon a dish it was sure to be placed out of reach sir francis was a great epicure and the thames salmon looked delicious but he would have failed in obtaining a slice of it if his neighbour the young man who had made room for him had not given him the wellfilled trencher intended for himself in the same way he secured the wing of a boiled capon larded with preserved lemons the sauce of which was exquisite as he well knew from experience cyprien however took care he should get none of the turkey poults or the florentines but whipped off both dishes from under his very nose and a like fate would have attended a lumbar pie but for the interference of his goodnatured neighbour who again came to his aid and rescued it from the clutches of the saucy gascon just as it was being borne away chapter iv a starchamber victim his hunger being somewhat stayed sir francis now found leisure to consider the young man who had so greatly befriended him and as a means of promoting conversation between them began by filling his glass from a flask of excellent bordeaux of which in spite of cypriens efforts to prevent him he had contrived to gain possession the young man acknowledged his courtesy with a smile praised the wine and expressed his astonishment at the wonderful variety and excellence of the repast for which he said he was quite unprepared it was not sir franciss way to feel or express much interest in strangers and he disliked young men especially when they were handsome as was the case with his new acquaintance but there was something in the youth that riveted his attention from the plainness of his attire and a certain not unpleasing rusticity of air sir francis comprehended at once that he was fresh from the country but he also felt satisfied from his bearing and deportment that he was a gentleman a term not quite so vaguely applied then as it is nowadays the youth had a fine frank countenance remarkable for manly beauty and intelligence and a figure perfectly proportioned and athletic sir francis set him down as well skilled in all exercises vaulting leaping riding and tossing the pike nor was he mistaken he also concluded him to be fond of country sports and he was right in the supposition he further imagined the young man had come to town to better his fortune and seek a place at court and he was not far wrong in the notion as the wily knight scanned the handsome features of his companion his cleanmade limbs and symmetrical figure he thought that success must infallibly attend the production of such a fair youth at a court where personal advantages were the first consideration a likely gallant he reflected to take the fancy of the king and if i aid him with means to purchase rich attire and procure him a presentation he may not prove ungrateful but of that i shall take good security i know what gratitude is he must be introduced to my lady suffolk she will know how to treat him in the first place he must cast his country slough that illmade doublet of green cloth must be exchanged for one of velvet slashed in the venetian style like mine own with hose stuffed and bombasted according to the mode a silk stocking will bring out the nice proportions of his leg though as i am a true gentleman the youth has so well formed a limb that even his own villainous yarn coverings cannot disfigure it his hair is of a good brown colour which the king affects much and seems to curl naturally but it wants trimming to the mode for he is rough as a young colt fresh from pasture and though he hath not much beard on his chin or upper lip yet what he hath becomes him well and will become him better when properly clipped and twisted altogether he is as goodly a youth as one would desire to see what if he should supplant buckingham as buckingham supplanted somerset let the proud marquis look to himself we may work his overthrow yet and now to question him after replenishing his glass sir francis addressed himself in his blandest accents and with his most insidious manner to his youthful neighbour for a stranger to town as i conclude you to be young sir he said you have made rather a lucky hit in coming hither today since you have not only got a better dinner than i a constant frequenter of this french ordinary ever saw served herethough the attendance is abominable as you must have remarkedthat rascally cyprien deserves the bastinado but your civility and good manners have introduced you to one who may without presumption affirm that he hath the will and it may be the ability to serve you if you will only point out to him the way nay worthy sir you are too kind the young man modestly replied i have done nothing to merit your good opinion though i am happy to have gained it i rejoice that accident has so far befriended me as to bring me here on this festive occasion and i rejoice yet more that it has brought me acquainted with a worthy gentleman like yourself to whom my rustic manners prove not to be displeasing i have too few friends to neglect any that chance may offer and as i must carve my own way in the world and fight for a position in it i gladly accept any hand that may be stretched out to help me in the struggle just as i would have it sir francis thought the very man i took him for as i am a true gentleman mine shall not be wanting my good youth he added aloud with apparent cordiality and affecting to regard the other with great interest and when i learn the particular direction in which you intend to shape your course i shall be the better able to advise and guide you there are many ways to fortune mine should be the shortest if i had any choice the young man rejoined with a smile right quite right the crafty knight returned all men would take that road if they could find it but with some the shortest road would not be the safest in your case i think it might be different you have a sufficiently good mien and a sufficiently good figure to serve you in lieu of other advantages your fair speech would put me in conceit with myself worthy sir the young man rejoined with a wellpleased air were i not too conscious of my own demerits not to impute what you say of me to good nature or to flattery there you wrong me my good young friendon my credit you do were i to resort to adulation i must strain the points of compliment to find phrases that should come up to my opinion of your good looks and as to my friendly disposition towards you i have already said that your attentions have won it so that mere good nature does not prompt my words i speak of you as i think may i without appearing too inquisitive ask from what part of the country you come i am from norfolk worthy sir the young man answered where my life has been spent among a set of men wild and uncouth and fond of the chase as the sherwood archers we read of in the ballads i am the son of a broken gentleman the lord of a ruined house with one old servant left me out of fifty kept by my father and with scarce a hundred acres that i can still call my own out of the thousands swept away from me still i hunt in my fathers woods kill my fathers deer and fish in my fathers lakes since no one molests me and i keep up the little church near the old tumbledown hall in which are the tombs of my ancestors and where my father lies buried and the tenantry come there yet on sundays though i am no longer their master and my fathers old chaplain sir oliver still preaches there though my fathers son can no longer maintain him a sad change truly sir francis said in a tone of sympathy and with a look of wellfeigned concern and attributable i much fear to riot and profusion on the part of your father who so beggared his son not so sir the young man gravely replied my father was a most honourable man and would have injured no one much less the son on whom he doated neither was he profuse but lived bountifully and well as a country gentleman with a large estate should live the cause of his ruin was that he came within the clutches of that devouring monster which like the insatiate dragon of rhodes has swallowed up the substance of so many families that our land is threatened with desolation my father was ruined by that court which with a mockery of justice robs men of their name their fame their lands and goods which perverts the course of law and saps the principles of equity which favours the knave and oppresses the honest man which promotes and supports extortion and plunder which reverses righteous judgments and asserts its own unrighteous supremacy which by means of its commissioners spreads its hundred arms over the whole realm to pillage and destroyso that no one however distant can keep out of its reach or escape its supervision and which if it be not uprooted will in the end overthrow the kingdom need i say my father was ruined by the starchamber hush hush my good young sir sir francis cried having vainly endeavoured to interrupt his companions angry denunciation pray heaven your words have reached no other ears than mine to speak of the starchamber as you have spoken is worse than treason many a man has lost his ears and been branded on the brow for half you have uttered is free speech denied in this free country the young man cried in astonishment must one suffer grievous wrong and not complain certes you must not contemn the starchamber or you will incur its censure sir francis replied in a low tone no court in england is so jealous of its prerogatives nor so severe in punishment of its maligners it will not have its proceedings canvassed or its judgments questioned for the plain reason that it knows they will not bear investigation or discussion such is the practice of all arbitrary and despotic rule but will englishmen submit to such tyranny again let me counsel you to put a bridle on your tongue young sir such matters are not to be talked of at public tablesscarcely in private it is well you have addressed yourself to one who will not betray you the starchamber hath its spies everywhere meddle not with it as you value liberty light provocation arouses its anger and once aroused its wrath is allconsuming chapter v jocelyn mounchensey notwithstanding the risk incurred the young man whose feelings were evidently deeply interested seemed disposed to pursue the dangerous theme but perceiving one of their opposite neighbours glancing at them sir francis checked him and filling his glass essayed to change the conversation by inquiring how long he had been in town and where he lodged i only arrived in london yesterday was the reply yet i have been here long enough to make me loth to return to the woods and moors of norfolk as to my lodging it is without the city walls near st botolphs church and within a bow shot of aldgate a pleasant situation enough looking towards the spital fields and the open country i would fain have got me others in the strand or near charing cross if my scanty means would have allowed me chance as i have said brought me here today strolling forth early to view the sights of town i crossed london bridge the magnificence of which amazed me and proceeding along the bankside entered paris garden of which i had heard much and where i was greatly pleased both with the mastiffs kept there and the formidable animals they have to encounter and methought i should like to bait mine enemies with those savage dogs instead of the bear returning to the opposite shore in a wherry the waterman landed me at this wharf and so highly commended the three cranes as affording the best french ordinary and the best french wine in london that seeing many gentlefolk flocking towards it which seemed to confirm his statement i came in with them and have reason to be satisfied with my entertainment never having dined so sumptuously before and certes never having tasted wine so delicious let me fill your glass again as i am a true gentleman it will not hurt you a singular merit of pure bordeaux being that you may drink it with impunity and the like cannot be said of your sophisticated sack we will crush another flask ho drawercyprien i say more wineand of the best bordeaux the best i say and for a wonder the order was obeyed and the flask set before him you have been at the bankside you say young sir on my credit you must cross the river again and visit the theatresthe globe or the rose our great actor dick burbadge plays othello today and i warrant me he will delight you a little man is dick but he hath a mighty soul there is none other like him whether it be nat field or ned alleyn our famous shakespeare is fortunate i trow in having him to play his great characters you must see burbadge likewise in the mad prince of denmarkthe part was written for him and fits him exactly see him also in gentle and lovesick romeo in tyrannous and murderous macbeth and in crookback richard in all of which though different our dick is equally good he hath some other parts of almost equal meritas malevole in the malcontent frankford in the woman killed with kindness brachiano in websters white devil and vendice in cyril tournours revengers tragedy i know not what may be the nature of that lastnamed play the young man rather sternly remarked but if the character of vendice at all bears out its name it would suit me i am an avenger forbear your wrongs awhile i pray you and drown your resentment in a cup of wine as i am a true gentleman a better bottle than the first nay taste it on my credit it is perfect nectar i pledge you in a brimmer wishing success may attend you and confusion await your enemies may you speedily regain your rights i drink that toast most heartily worthy sir the young man exclaimed raising his beaded flagon on high confusion to my enemiesrestoration to my rights and he drained the goblet to its last drop by this time he must be in a fit mood for my purpose sir francis thought as he watched him narrowly harkye my good young friend he said lowering his tone i would not be overheard in what i have to say you were speaking just now of the shortest way to fortune i will point it out to you to him who is bold enough to take it and who hath the requisites for the venture the shortest way is to be found at court where think you most of those gallants of whom you may catch a glimpse through the traverse derive their revenuesas i am a true gentlemanfrom the royal coffers not many years ago with all of them not many months ago with some those brilliant and titled coxcombs were adventurers like yourself having barely a jacobus in their purses and scarce credit for board and lodging with their respective landladies now you see how nobly they feast and how richly they bedeck themselves on my credit the like good fortune may attend you and haply when i dine at an ordinary a year hence i may perceive you at the upper table with a curtain before you to keep off the meaner company and your servingman at your back holding your velvet mantle and cap like the best of your fellow nobles heaven grant it may be so the young man exclaimed with a sigh you hold a dazzling picture before me but i have little expectation of realizing it it will be your own fault if you do not the tempter rejoined you are equally wellfavoured with the handsomest of them and it was by good looks alone that the whole party rose to their present eminence why not pursue the same course with the same certainty of success you have courage enough to undertake it i presume if courage alone were wanting i have that the young man repliedbut i am wholly unknown in town how then shall i accomplish an introduction at court when i know not even its humblest attendant i have already said you were lucky in meeting with me sir francis replied and i find you were luckier than i supposed when i told you so for i knew not then towards what bent your desires tended nor in what way i could help you but now finding out the boldness of your flight and the high game you aim at i am able to offer you effectual assistance and give you an earnest of a prosperous issue through my means you shall be presented to the king and in such sort that the presentation shall not be idly made it will rest then with yourself to play your cards dexterously and to follow up a winning game doubtless you will have many adversaries who will trip up your heels if they can and throw every obstacle in your way but if you possess the strong arm i fancy you do and daring to second it you have nothing to fear as i am a true gentleman you shall have good counsel and a friend in secret to back you to whom am i indebted for this most gracious and unlookedfor offer the young man asked his breast heaving and his eye flashing with excitement to one you may perchance have heard of the knight answered as the subject of some misrepresentation how justly applied you yourself will be able to determine from my present conduct i am sir francis mitchell at the mention of this name the young man started and a deep angry flush overspread his face and brow perceiving the effect produced the wily knight hastened to remove it my name i see awakens unpleasant associations in your breast he said and your look shows you have been influenced by the calumnies of my enemies i do not blame you men can only be judged of by report and those i have had dealings with have reported ill enough of me but they have spoken falsely i have done no more than any other person would do i have obtained the best interest i could for my money and my losses have been almost equal to my gains folks are ready enough to tell all they can against you but slow to mention aught they conceive to be in your favour they stigmatize me as a usurer but they forget to add i am ever the friend of those in need they use me and abuse me that is the way of the world wherefore then should i complain i am no worse off than my neighbours and the proof that i can be disinterested is the way in which i have acted towards you a perfect stranger and who have no other recommendation to my good offices than your gracious mien and gentle manners i cannot accept your proffered aid sir francis the young man replied in an altered tone and with great sternness and you will understand why i cannot when i announce myself to you as jocelyn mounchensey it was now the knights turn to start change colour and tremble chapter vi provocation a momentary pause ensued during which mounchensey regarded the knight so fiercely that the latter began to entertain apprehensions for his personal safety and meditated a precipitate retreat yet he did not dare to move lest the action should bring upon him the hurt he wished to avoid thus he remained like a bird fascinated by the rattlesnake until the young man whose power of speech seemed taken from him by passion went on in a tone of deep and concentrated rage that communicated a hissing sound to his words yes i am jocelyn mounchensey he said the son of him whom your arts and those of your partner in iniquity sir giles mompesson brought to destruction the son of him whom you despoiled of a good name and large estates and cast into a loathsome prison to languish and to die i am the son of that murdered man i am he whom you have robbed of his inheritance whose proud escutcheon you have tarnished whose family you have reduced to beggary and utter ruin but sir jocelyn my worthy friend the knight faltered have patience i pray of you if you consider yourself aggrieved i am willing to make reparationample reparation you know what were my intentions towards you before i had the slightest notion who you might be if i had but been aware of it he thought i would have taken care to keep at a respectful distance from him i will do more than i promised i will lend you any sums of money you may require and on your personal security your bare word shall suffice no bondsno written obligations of any kind does that sound like usury as i am a true gentleman i am most unfairly judged i am not the extortioner men describe me you shall find me your friend he added in a low earnest tone i will reestablish your fortune give you a new title higher and prouder than that which you have lost and if you will follow my counsel you shall supplant the haughty favourite himself you shall stand where buckingham now stands hear reason good sir jocelyn hear reason i entreat you i will hear nothing further jocelyn rejoined were you to talk till doomsday you could not alter my feelings towards you a jot my chief errand in coming to london was to call you and sir giles mompesson to strict account and we will answer any charges you may bring against us readilymost readily sir jocelyn all was done in fairnessaccording to law the starchamber will uphold us tut you think to terrify me with that bugbear but i am not so easily frightened we have met for the first time by chance but our next meeting shall be by appointment when and where you please sir jocelyn the knight replied but recollect the duello is forbidden and though i would not willingly disappoint you in your desire to cut my throat i should be sorry to think you might be hanged for it afterwards come sir jocelyn lay aside this idle passion and look to your true interests which lie not in quarrelling with me but in our reconciliation i can help you effectually as i have shown and as i am a true gentleman i will help you give me your hand and let us be friends never jocelyn exclaimed withdrawing from him never shall the hand of a mounchensey grasp yours in friendship i would sooner mine rotted off i am your mortal foe my fathers death has to be avenged provoke him not my good young sir interposed an elderly man next him in a long furred gown with hanging sleeves and a flat cap on his head who had heard what was now passing you know not the mischief he may do you i laugh at his malice and defy him jocelyn criedhe shall not sit one moment longer beside me out knave out he added seizing sir francis by the wing of his doublet and forcibly thrusting him from his seat you are not fit company for honest men ho varlets to the door with him throw him into the kennel you shall rue this villainyou shall rue it bitterly sir francis cried shaking his clenched hands at him your father perished like a dog in the fleet and you shall perish there likewise you have put yourself wholly in my power and i will make a fearful example of you you have dared to utter scandalous and contemptuous language against the great and high court of starchamber before the decrees of which all men bow impugning its justice and denying its authority and you shall feel the full weight of its displeasure i call upon these worthy gentlemen to testify against you we have heard nothing and can testify nothing several voices cried but you sir who were next him you must have heard him sir francis said addressing the elderly man in the furred gown not i rejoined the person appealed to i gave no heed to what was said but i did sir francis squeaked a little wheyfaced man in a large ruff and tightlaced yellow doublet from the opposite side of the table i heard him most audaciously vilipend the high court of starchamber and its councils and i will bear testimony against him when called upon your name good sir your name sir francis demanded taking out his tablets set me down as thopas trednock tailor at the sign of the pressing iron in cornhill the wheyfaced man replied in his shrill tones amid the derisive laughter of the assemblage thopas trednock tailorgood the knight repeated as he wrote the name down you will be an excellent witness master trednock fare you well for the present master jocelyn mounchensey for i now mind well your father was degraded from the honour of knighthood as i am a true gentleman you may be sure of committal to the fleet as may be supposed the scuffle which had taken place attracted the attention of those in its immediate vicinity and when the cause of it became known as it presently did throughout both tables great indignation was expressed against sir francis who was censured on all hands jeered and flouted as he moved to the door so great was the clamour and so opprobrious were the epithets and terms applied to him that the knight was eager to make his escape but he met cyprien in his way and the droll young gascon holding a dishcover in one hand by way of buckler and a long carvingknife in the other in place of a sword opposed his egress let me pass knave sir francis cried in alarm by your leave no returned cyprien encouraged by the laughter and plaudits of the company you have come hither uninvited and must stay till you have permission to depart having partaken of the banquet you must perforce tarry for the rerebanquet the sweets and cates have yet to come sir francis what mean you sirrah the knight demanded in increased trepidation your presence is necessary at a little entertainment i have provided to follow the dinner sweet sir francis madame bonaventure cried advancing towards him and as you have a principal part in it i can by no means spare you no one can spare you sweet sir francis several voices chimed in derisively you must remain with us a little longer but i will not stay i will not be detained there is some conspiracy afoot against me i will indict you all for it if you hinder me in going forth the knight vociferated in accents of mingled rage and terror stop me at your peril thou saucy gascon knave cornes du diableno more a knave than yourself gros usurier cyprien cried laissezlui cyprien madame bonaventure interposedthe courteous knight will yield to my entreaties and stay of his own free will i have business that calls me hence i must go sir francis said endeavouring to push by them let the door be closed an authoritative voice cried from the head of the table the order was instantly obeyed two servingmen stationed themselves before the place of exit and sir francis found himself a prisoner the roof rang with the laughter and gibes of the guests this is a frolic gentleman i perceive you are resolved to make me your sportha ha sir francis said trying to disguise his uneasiness under an appearance of levitybut you will not carry the jest too far you will not maltreat me my partner sir giles mompesson will be here anon and will requite any outrage committed upon me sir giles is impatiently expected by us a spruce coxcomb near him replied madame bonaventure had prepared us for his coming we will give him the welcome he deserves ah traitress then it was all planned sir francis thoughtand blind owl that i am i have fallen into the snare but the poor knight was nearly at his wits end with fright when he saw lord roos quit his place at the upper table and approach him chapter vii how lord roos obtained sir francis mitchells signature what my prince of usurers exclaimed lord roos in a mocking tone my worthy moneylender who never takes more than cent per cent and art ill content with less who never exacts more than the penalty of thy bondunless more may be got who never drives a hard bargain with a needy manby thine own account who never persecutes a debtoras the prisons shall vouch for thee who art just in all thy transactionsas every man who hath had dealings with thee will affirm and who knows not how to lie to cheat to cozenas some usurers do you are pleasant my lord sir francis replied i mean to be so lord roos said for i esteem thee for thy rare qualities i know not thy peer for cunning and knavery thy mischievous schemes are so wellconceived that they prove thee to have an absolute genius for villany scruples thou hast none and considerations and feelings which might move men less obdurate than thyself have no influence over thee to ruin a man is with thee mere pastime and groans of the oppressed are music in thine ears aha a good jest you were always merry with me my lord yes when i borrowed money from theebut not when i had to repay it twice over i laughed not then but was foolish enough to threaten to take thy life my anger is past now but we must drink togethera rousing toast at your lordships pleasure sir francis replied cyprien a flask of wine and thy largest goblet lord roos cried tis well now pour the whole into the flagon do me reason in this cup sir francis what in this mighty cup my lord the knight replied nay tis too much i swear if i become drunken the sin will lie at your door off with it without more ado and let the toast be what thou practisestpillage and extortion i cannot drink that toast my lord twill choke me sdeath villain but thou shalt or thou shalt never taste wine more down with it man and now your signature to this paper my signature sir francis cried reeling from the effect of the wine he had swallowed nay my good lord i can sign nothing that i have not read what is it a blank sheet lord roos rejoined i will fill it up afterwards then my lord i refusethat is i declinethat is i had rather not if your lordship pleases but my lordship pleases otherwise give him pen and ink and set him near the table this was done and sir francis regarded the paper with swimming eyes now your namewritten near the bottom of the sheet lord roos cried tis done under comcompulsion and i proprotest against it sign i say the young nobleman exclaimed rapping the table peremptorily on this sir francis wrote his name in the place indicated enough lord roos cried snatching up the paper this is all i want now set him on the table that his partner may have him in full view when he arrives twill give him a foretaste of what he may himself expect what mean you ruffruffians tis an indignity to which i shall not submit cried sir francis who was now however too far gone to offer any resistance a leathern girdle was found with which he was fastened to the chair so as to prevent him slipping from it and in this state he was hoisted upon the table and set with his face to the door looking the very picture of inebriety with his head drooping on one side his arms dangling uselessly down and his thin legs stretched idly out after making some incoherent objections to this treatment he became altogether silent and seemed to fall asleep his elevation was received with shouts of laughter from the whole company the incident had not taken place many minutes and a round had scarcely been drunk by the guests when a loud and peremptory summons was heard at the door the noise roused even the poor drunkard in the chair who lifting up his head stared about him with vacant eyes let the door be opened the same authoritative voice exclaimed which had before ordered its closure the mandate was obeyed and amidst profound silence which suddenly succeeded the clashing of glasses and expressions of hilarity sir giles mompesson entered with his bodyguard of myrmidons behind him habited in black as was his custom with a velvet mantle on his shoulder and a long rapier by his side he came forward with a measured step and assured demeanour though he must necessarily have been surprised by the assemblage he foundso much more numerous and splendid than he could have anticipatedhe betrayed no signs whatever of embarrassment nor though his quick eye instantly detected sir francis and he guessed at once why the poor knight had been so scandalously treated did he exhibit any signs of displeasure or take the slightest notice of the circumstance reserving this point for consideration when his first business should be settled an additional frown might have darkened his countenance but it was so stern and sombre without it that no perceptible change could be discerned unless it might be in the lightning glances he cast around as if seeking some one he might call to account presently for the insult but no one seemed willing to reply to the challenge though bold enough before he came and boastful of what they would do they all looked awed by his presence and averted their gaze from him there was indeed something so formidable in the man that to shun a quarrel with him was more a matter of prudence than an act of cowardice and on the present occasion no one liked to be first to provoke him trusting to his neighbour to commence the attack or awaiting the general outbreak there was one exception however and that was jocelyn mounchensey who so far from desiring to shun sir giless searching regards courted them and as the knights eagle eye ranged round the table and fell upon him the young man notwithstanding the efforts of his pacific neighbour in the furred cloak to restrain him suddenly rose up and throwing all the scorn and defiance he could muster into his countenance returned mompessons glance with one equally fierce and menacing a bitter smile curled sir giless lip at this reply to his challenge and he regarded the young man fixedly as if to grave his features upon his memory perhaps they brought mounchenseys father to mind for sir giles withdrew his gaze for a moment to reflect and then looked again at jocelyn with fresh curiosity if he had any doubts as to whom he beheld they were removed by sir francis who managed to hiccup forth tis he sir gilestis jocelyn mounchensey i thought as much sir giles muttered a moment young man he cried waving his hand imperiously to his antagonist your turn will come presently and without bestowing further notice on jocelyn who resisted all his neighbours entreaties to him to sit down sir giles advanced towards the middle chamber where he paused and took off his cap having hitherto remained covered in this position he looked like a grand inquisitor attended by his familiars chapter viii of lupo vulp captain bludder clement lanyere and sir giless other myrmidons close behind sir giles and a little in advance of the rest of the myrmidons stood lupo vulp the scrivener lupo vulp was the confidential adviser of our two extortioners to whom they referred all their nefarious projects he it was who prepared their bonds and contracts and placed out their illgotten gains at exorbitant usance lupo vulp was in all respects worthy of his employers being just as wily and unscrupulous as they were while at the same time he was rather better versed in legal tricks and stratagems so that he could give them apt counsel in any emergency a countenance more replete with cunning and knavery than that of lupo vulp it would be difficult to discover a sardonic smile hovered perpetually about his mouth which was garnished with ranges of the keenest and whitest teeth his features were sharp his eyes small set wide apart of a light gray colour and with all the slyness of a fox lurking within their furtive glances indeed his general resemblance to that astute animal must have struck a physiognomist his head was shaped like that of a fox and his hair and beard were of a reddishtawny hue his manner was stealthy cowering suspicious as if he feared a blow from every hand yet lupo vulp could show his teeth and snap on occasions he was attired in a closefitting doublet of russetybrown round yellow hose and long stockings of the same hue a short brown mantle and a foxskin cap completed his costume the leader of the troop was captain bludder a huge alsatian bully with fiercelytwisted moustachios and fieryred beard cut like a spade he wore a steeplecrowned hat with a brooch in it a buff jerkin and boots and a sword and buckler dangled from his waist besides these he had a couple of petronels stuck in his girdle the captain drank like a fish and swaggered and swore like twenty troopers the rear of the band was formed by the tipstavesstout fellows with hooks at the end of their poles intended to capture a fugitive or hale him along when caught with these were some others armed with brownbills no uniformity prevailed in the accoutrements of the party each man arraying himself as he listed some wore old leather jerkins and steel skirts some peascod doublets of elizabeths time and trunkhose that had covered many a limb besides their own others slops and galligaskins while the poorer sort were robed in rusty gowns of tuftmockado or taffeta once guarded with velvet or lined with skins but now tattered and threadbare their caps and bonnets were as varied as their apparelsome being highcrowned some trenchershaped and some few wide in the leaf and looped at the side moreover there was every variety of villainous aspect the savage scowl of the desperado the cunning leer of the trickster and the sordid look of the mean knave several of them betrayed by the marks of infamy branded on their faces or by the loss of ears that they had passed through the hands of the public executioner amongst these there was one with a visage more frightfully mutilated than those of his comrades the nose having been slit and subsequently sewed together again but so clumsily that the severed parts had only imperfectly united communicating a strange distorted and forbidding look to the physiognomy clement lanyere the owner of this gashed and ghastly face who was also reft of his ears and branded on the cheek had suffered infamy and degradation owing to the licence he had given his tongue in respect to the starchamber prosecuted in that court by sir giles mompesson as a notorious libeller and scandaller of the judges and first personages of the realm he was found guilty and sentenced accordingly the court showed little leniency to such offenders but it was a matter of grace that his clamorous tongue was not torn out likewise in addition to the punishment actually inflicted a heavy fine and imprisonment accompanied the corporal penalties thus utterly ruined and degraded and a mark for the finger of scorn to point at clement lanyere whose prospects had once been fair enough as his features had been prepossessing became soured and malevolent embittered against the world and at war with society he turned promoter or in modern parlance informer lodging complaints seeking out causes for prosecutions and bringing people into trouble in order to obtain part of the forfeits they incurred for his pains strange to say he attached himself to sir giles mompessonthe cause of all his misfortunesand became one of the most active and useful of his followers it was thought no good could come of this alliance and that the promoter only bided his time to turn upon his master against whom it was only natural he should nourish secret vengeance but if it were so sir giles seemed to entertain no apprehensions of him probably thinking he could crush him whenever he pleased either way the event was long deferred clement lanyere to all appearance continued to serve his master zealously and well and sir giles gave no sign whatever of distrust but on the contrary treated him with increased confidence the promoter was attired wholly in blackcloak cap doublet and hose were of sable and as owing to the emoluments springing from his vile calling his means were far greater than those of his comrades so his habiliments were better when wrapped in his mantle with his mutilated countenance covered with a mask which he generally wore the informer might have passed for a cavalier so tall and well formed was his figure and so bold his deportment the dangerous service he was employed upon which exposed him to insult and injury required him to be well armed and he took care to be so two or three of sir giless myrmidons having been selected for particular description the designations of some others must sufficesuch as staring hugh a rascal of unmatched effrontery the gib cat and cutting dick dissolute rogues from the pickthatch in turnbull street near clerkenwell old tom wootton once a notorious harbourer of masterless men at his house at smarts quay but now a sheriffs officer and perhaps it ought to be mentioned that there were some halfdozen swashbucklers and sharpers from alsatia under the command of captain bludder who was held responsible for their good conduct such was sir giless bodyguard on his entrance it may be remarked the curtain in front of the raised table was more closely drawn so as completely to conceal the guests but their importance might be inferred from the servingmen in rich liveries standing before the traverse profound silence reigned throughout the assemblage having uncovered as before mentioned and made a formal reverence to the company sir giles spoke as follows i crave your pardon worthy sirs he said in a distinct and resolute voice for this intrusion and regret to be the means of marring your festivity i came hither wholly unprepared to find such an assemblage yet though i would willingly have chosen a more fitting opportunity for my visit and would postpone if i could to another occasion the unpleasant duty i have to fulfil the matter is urgent and will not admit of delay you will hold me excused therefore if i proceed with it regardless of your presence and i am well assured no let or interruption will be offered me seeing i act with the royal licence and authority of which i am the unworthy representative truly your conduct requires explanation jocelyn mounchensey cried in a mocking tone if i had not been here in london i should have judged from your appearance and that of your attendants that a band of desperate marauders had broken in upon us and that we must draw our swords to defend our lives and save the house from pillage but after what you have said i conclude you to be the sheriff come with your followers to execute some writ of attachment and therefore however annoying the presence of such a functionary may behowever illtimed may be your visit and unmannerly your deportmentwe are bound not to molest you provocation like this was rarely addressed to sir giles and the choler occasioned by it was increased by the laughter and cheers of the company nevertheless he constrained his anger replying in a stern scornful tone i would not counsel you to molest me young man the mistake you have committed in regard to myself may be pardoned in one of your evident inexperience who fresh from the boorish society of the country finds himself for the first time amongst wellbred gentlemen of all here present you are probably the sole person ignorant that i am sir giles mompesson but it is scarcely likely that they should be aware as i chance to be that the clownish insolent who has dared to wag his tongue against me is the son of a starchamber delinquent chapter ix the letterspatent a slight reaction in sir giless favour was produced by his speech but jocelyn quite regained his position with the company when he exclaimed my father was misjudged his prosecutor was a villain and his sentence iniquitous you have uttered your own condemnation jocelyn mounchensey sir giles cried with a savage laugh know to your confusion that the high court of starchamber is so tender of upholding the honour of its sentences that it ever punishes such as speak against them with the greatest severity you have uttered your scandals openly imprudent young man you have indeed placed yourself in fearful jeopardy a gentleman near him observed to jocelyn escape if you can you are lost if you remain here but instead of following the friendly advice jocelyn would have assaulted sir giles if he had not been forcibly withheld by the gentleman the knight was not slow to follow up the advantage he had gained stand forward clement lanyere he exclaimed authoritatively the promoter instantly advanced look at this man sir giles continued addressing jocelyn and you will perceive how those who malign the starchamber are treated this disfigured countenance was once as free from seam or scar as your own and yet for an offence lighter than yours it hath been stamped as you see with indelible infamy answer clement lanyereand answer according to your consciencewas the sentence just of the high and honourable court by which you were tried it was just the promoter replied a deep flush dyeing his ghastly visage and lenient most lenient for it left my foul tongue the power of speech it now enjoys by whom were you prosecuted in the starchamber by him i now serve that is by myself do you bear me malice for what i did i have never said so on the contrary sir giles i have always declared i owe you a deep debt which you strive to pay which i will pay you hear what this man says mounchensey sir giles cried you have been guilty of the same offence as he why should you not be similarly punished if i were so punished i would stab my prosecutor to the heart jocelyn replied at this rejoinder lanyere who had hitherto kept his eyes on the ground suddenly raised them with a look of singular expression at the speaker humph sir giles ejaculated i must proceed to extremities with him i find keep strict watch upon him lanyere and follow him if he goes forth trace him to his lair now to business give me the letterspatent lupo he added turning to the scrivener as lanyere retired these letterspatent continued sir giles taking two parchment scrolls with large seals pendent from them from lupo vulp and displaying them to the assemblage these royal letters he repeated in his steady stern tones and glancing round with a look of halfdefiance passed under the great seal and bearing the kings signmanual as ye see gentlemen constitute the authority on which i act they accord to me and my copatentee sir francis mitchell absolute and uncontrolled power and discretion in granting and refusing licenses to all tavernkeepers and hostelkeepers throughout london they give us full power to enter and inspect all taverns and hostels at any time that may seem fit to us to prevent any unlawful games being used therein and to see that good order and rule be maintained they also render it compulsory upon all alehousekeepers tavernkeepers and innkeepers throughout london to enter into their own recognizances with us against the nonobservance of our rules and regulations for their governance and maintenance and to find two sureties and in case of the forfeiture of such recognizances by any act of the parties coming within the scope of our authority it is provided that one moiety of the sum forfeited be paid to the crown and the other moiety to us lend me your ears yet further i pray ye gentlemen these royal letters empower us to inflict certain fines and penalties upon all such as offend against our authority or resist our claims and they enable us to apprehend and commit to prison such offenders without further warrant than the letters themselves contain in brief gentlemen he continued in a peremptory tone as if insisting upon attention you will observe that the absolute control of all houses of entertainment where exciseable liquors are vended is delegated to us by his most gracious majesty king james to which end ample powers have been given us by his majesty who has armed us with the strong arm of the law will it please ye to inspect the letters gentlemen holding them forth you will find that his majesty hath thus writtenin cujus rei testimonium has literas nostras fieri fecimus patentes teste meipso apud westm die maij anno regni nostri c then follows the royal signature none of ye i presume will question its authenticity a deep silence succeeded in the midst of which jocelyn mounchensey broke forth i for one question it he cried i will never believe that a king who like our gracious sovereign has the welfare of his subjects at heart would sanction the oppression and injustice which those warrants if entrusted to unscrupulous hands must inevitably accomplish i therefore mistrust the genuineness of the signature if not forged it has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation some murmurs of applause followed this bold speech but the gentleman who had previously counselled the young man again interposed and whispered these words in his ear your rash vehemence will undo you if you take not heed beyond question sir giles hath the kings sanction for what he does and to censure him as you have done is to censure the crown which is next to treason be ruled by me my good young sir and meddle no more in the matter sir giles who had some difficulty in controlling his choler now spoke you have cast an imputation upon me jocelyn mounchensey he cried with concentrated fury which you shall be compelled to retract as publicly as you have made it to insult an officer of the crown in the discharge of his duty is to insult the crown itself as you will find in the kings name i command you to hold your peace or in the kings name i will instantly arrest you and i forbid any one to give you aid i will not be troubled thus appointed by his majesty to a certain office i exercise it as much for the benefit of the royal exchequer as for my own personal advantage i have his majestys full approval of what i do and i need nothing more i am accountable to no mansave the king addressing this menace as much to the rest of the company as to jocelyn but i came not here to render explanation but to act what ho madame bonaventure where are ye madame oh you are here bon jour sweet sir giles the landlady said making him a profound obeisance what is your pleasure with me sir and to what am i to attribute the honour of this visit tut madame you know well enough what brings me hither and thus attended he replied i come in pursuance of a notice served upon you a month ago you will not deny having received it since the officer who placed it in your hands is here present and he indicated clement lanyere au contraire sir giles madame bonaventure replied i readily admit the receipt of a written message from you which though scarcely intelligible to my poor comprehension did not seem as agreeably worded as a billetdoux mais ma foi i attached little importance to it i did not suppose it possiblenor do i suppose it possible nowwith a captivating smile which was totally lost upon sir gilesthat you could adopt such rigorous measures against me my measures may appear rigorous madame sir giles coldly replied but i am warranted in taking them nay i am compelled to take them not having made the satisfaction required by the notice you have deprived yourself of the protection i was willing to afford you i am now merely your judge the penalties incurred by your neglect are these your licence was suspended a month ago the notice expressly stating that it would be withdrawn unless certain conditions were fulfilled consequently as ever since that time you have been vending exciseable liquors without lawful permission you have incurred a fine of one hundred marks a day making a total of three thousand marks now due and owing from you partly to his majesty and partly to his majestys representatives this sum i now demand ah dieu three thousand marks madame bonaventure screamed what robbery is thiswhat barbarity t is ruinutter ruin i may as well close my house altogether and return to my own fair country as i am an honest woman sir giles i cannot pay it so it is quite useless on your part to make any such demand you profess inability to pay madame sir giles rejoined i cannot believe you having some knowledge of your means nevertheless i will acquaint you with a rule of law applicable to the contingency you put quod non habet in cere luet in corpore is a decree of the starchamber meaning for i do not expect you to understand latin that he who cannot pay in purse shall pay in person aware of the alternative you will make your choice and you may thank me that i have not adjudged you at onceas i have the powerto three months within the wood street compter ah sir giles what an atrocious idea you are worse than a savage to talk of such a loathsome prison to me ah mon dieu what is to happen to me would i were back again in my lovely bordeaux you will have an opportunity of revisiting that fine city madame for you will no longer be able to carry on your calling here ciel sir giles what mean you i mean madame that you are disabled from keeping any tavern for the space of three years madame bonaventure clasped her hands together and screamed aloud in pity sir gilesin pity she cried the inexorable knight shook his head the low murmurs of indignation among the company which had been gradually gathering force during the foregoing dialogue now became clamorous a most scandalous proceeding exclaimed one deprive us of our best french ordinary cried another infamous extortioner shouted a third well not permit such injustice let us take the law into our own hands and settle the question shouted a fourth ay down with the knight added a fifth but sir giles continued perfectly unmoved by the tempest raging around and laughed to scorn these menaces contenting himself with signing to captain bludder to be in readiness a truce to this gentlemen he at length thundered forth the kings warrant must be respected again madame bonaventure besought his pity but in vain she took hold of his arm and feigned to kneel to him but he shook her coldly off you are a very charming woman no doubt madame he said sarcastically and some men might find you irresistible but i am not made of such yielding stuff and you may spare yourself further trouble for all your powers of persuasion will fail with me i renew my demandand for the last time do not compel me to resort to extremities with you it would grieve me he added with a bitter smile to drag so pretty a woman through the public streets like a common debtor to the compter grace grace sir giles cried madame bonaventure then seeing him remain inflexible she added in an altered tone i will never submit with life to such an indignitynever well all protect you madame cried the assemblage with one voicelet him lay hands upon you and he shall see sir giles glanced at his myrmidons they stepped quickly towards him in a body at the same time jocelyn mounchensey whom no efforts of the friendly gentleman could now restrain sprang forward and drawing his sword was just in time to place himself before madame bonaventure as she drew hastily back have no fear madame you are safe with me the young man said glancing fiercely at the knight and his troop the greatest confusion now reigned throughout the room other swords were drawn and several of the guests mounted upon the benches to overlook the scene cyprien and the rest of the drawers and tradesmen ranged themselves behind their mistress prepared to resist any attempt on the part of the myrmidons to seize her the curtain at the head of the room was partly drawn aside showing that the distinguished persons at the upper table were equally excited gentlemen sir giles said still maintaining perfect calmness in the midst of the tumult a word with you ere it be too late i dont address myself to you jocelyn mounchensey for you are undeserving of any friendly considerationbut to all others i would counsel forbearance and nonresistance deliver up that woman to me i will die upon the spot sooner than you shall be surrendered said jocelyn encouraging the hostess who clung to his disengaged arm oh merci grand merci mon beau gentilhomme she exclaimed am i to understand then that you mean to impede me in the lawful execution of my purposes gentlemen sir giles demanded we mean to prevent an unlawful arrest several voices rejoined be it so the knight said i wash my hands of the consequences then turning to his followers he addedofficers at all hazards attach the person of dameris bonaventure and convey her to the compter at the same time arrest the young manbeside herjocelyn mounchenseywho has uttered treasonable language against our sovereign lord the king i will tell you how to dispose of him anon do my bidding at once but ere the order could be obeyed the authoritative voice which had previously been heard from the upper table exclaimedhold sir giles paused looked irresolute for a minute and then checked his myrmidons with a wave of the hand who is it stays the law he said with the glare of a tiger from whom a bone has been snatched one you must needs obey sir giles replied lord roos coming towards him from the upper table you have unconsciously played a part in a comedyand played it very well toobut it is time to bring the piece to an end we are fast verging on the confines of tragedy i do not understand you my lord sir giles returned gravely i discern nothing comic in the matter though much of serious import you do not perceive the comedy because it has been part of our scheme to keep you in the dark sir giles so there is a scheme then afoot here my lordha a little merry plot nothing more sir gilesin the working of which your worthy copatentee sir francis mitchell has materially assisted ha exclaimed sir giles glancing at his partner who still occupied his elevated position upon the tablei presume then i have to thank you my lord for the indignity offered to my friend as you please sir giles lord roos returned carelessly you call it an indignity but in my opinion the best thing to be done with a man whose head so swims with wine that his legs refuse to support him is to tie him in a chair he may else sacrifice his dignity by rolling under the table but let this pass for the nonce before sir francis was wholly overcome he was good enough to give me his signature you saw him do it gentlemen he added appealing to the company yesyeswe saw him write it was the general reply and to what end was this done my lord sir giles demanded sternly to enable me replied the imperturbable young nobleman to draw out a receipt in full of your joint claims against madame bonaventure i have done it sir giles and here it is and i have taken care to grant a renewal of her licence from the date of your notice so that no penalties or fines can attach to her for neglect take it madame bonaventure he continued handing her the paper it is your full acquittance and think you my lord that this shallow artificeto give it no harsher termwill avail you any thing sir giles cried scornfully i set it aside at once your pardon sir giles you will do no such thing and who will hinder meyou my lord even i sir giles proceed at your peril the young noblemans assurance staggered his opponent he must have some one to uphold him or he would not be thus confident he thought whose was the voice i heard it sounded likeno matter tis needful to be cautious you do not then hold yourself bound by the acts of your partner sir giles lord roos said i deny this to be his act the knight replied better question him at once on the subject lord roos said set him free cyprien the gascon did as he was bidden and with the aid of his fellow drawers helped sir francis from the table to the surprise of the company the knight then managed to stagger forward unassisted and would have embraced sir giles if the latter had not thrust him off in disgust with some violence what folly is this sir francis sir giles cried angrily you have forgotten yourself strangely you have taken leave of your senses methinks not a whit of it sir gilesnot a whit i never was more my own master than i am at present as i will prove to you prove it then by explaining how you came to sign that paper you could not mean to run counter to me but i did sir francis rejoined highly offended i meant to run counter to you in signing it and i mean it now sdeath you besotted fool you are playing into their hands besotted fool in your teeth sir giles i am as sober as yourself my hand has been put to that paper and what it contains i stand by you design then to acquit madame bonaventure consider what you say no need for consideration i have always designed it ten thousand thanks sir francis the hostess cried i knew i had an excellent friend in you the enamoured knight seized the hand she extended towards him but in the attempt to kiss it fell to the ground amid the laughter of the company are you satisfied now sir giles asked lord roos i am satisfied that sir francis has been duped he replied and that when his brain is free from the fumes of wine he will bitterly regret his folly but even his discharge will be insufficient though it may bind me it will not bind the crown which will yet enforce its claims that sir giles i leave competent authority to decide lord roos replied retiring and as he withdrew the curtains before the upper table were entirely withdrawn disclosing the whole of the brilliant assemblage and at the head of them one person far more brilliant and distinguished than the rest buckingham sir giles exclaimed i thought i knew the voice it was indeed the kings omnipotent favourite magnificently attired the marquis of buckingham as far outshone his companions in splendour of habiliments as he did in stateliness of carriage and beauty of person rising from the table and donning his plumed hat looped with diamonds with a gesture worthy of a monarch while all the rest remained uncovered as if in recognition of his superior dignity he descended to where sir giles mompesson was standing it need scarcely be said that jocelyn mounchensey had never seen the superb favourite before but he did not require to be told whom he beheld so perfectly did buckingham realize the descriptions given of him a little above the ordinary height with a figure of the most perfect symmetry and features as aristocratic and haughty as handsome it was impossible to conceive a prouder or a noblerlooking personage than the marquis his costume was splendid consisting of a doublet of white cut velvet roped with pearls which fitted him to admiration over his shoulders he wore a mantle of watchetcoloured velvet his neck was encircled by a falling band and silken hose of the same colour as the doublet completed his costume his deportment was singularly dignified but his manner might have conciliated more if it had been less imperious and disdainful sir giles made a profound obeisance as buckingham advanced towards him his salutation was haughtily returned i have heard something of your mode of proceeding with the keepers of taverns and hostels sir giles the proud marquis said but this is the first occasion on which i have seen it put in practiceand i am free to confess that you deal not over gently with them if the present may be considered a specimen of your ordinary conduct those letterspatent were not confided to you by his majesty to distress his subjects for your own particular advantage and profit but to benefit the community by keeping such places of entertainment in better order than heretofore i fear you have somewhat abused your warrant sir giles if to devote myself heart and soul to his majestys service and to enrich his majestys exchequer be to abuse my warrant i have done so my lord marquisbut not otherwise i have ever vindicated the dignity and authority of the crown you have just heard that though my own just claims have been defeated by the inadvertence of my copatentee i have advanced those of the king the king relinquishes all claims in the present case buckingham replied his gracious majesty gave me full discretion in the matter and i act as i know he himself would have acted and waving his hand to signify that he would listen to no remonstrances the marquis turned to madame bonaventure who instantly prostrated herself before him as she would have done before royalty itself warmly thanking him for his protection you must thank my lord roos and not me madame buckingham graciously replied raising her as he spoke it was at his lordships instance i came here he takes a warm interest in you madame i shall ever be beholden to his lordship i am sure madame bonaventure said casting down her eyes and blushing or feigning to blush as well as to you monseigneur my lord roos avouched pursued buckingham that at the three cranes i should find the prettiest hostess and the best wine in london and on my faith as a gentleman i must say he was wrong in neither particular brighter eyes i have never beheldrarer claret i have never drunk oh monseigneur you quite overwhelm me my poor house can scarcely hope to be honoured a second time with such a presence but should it so chance you will give me as good welcome as you have done today no lack of inducement to repeat the visit sir giles mompesson my lord marquis i lay my commands upon you good sir giles that no further molestation be offered to madame bonaventure but that you give a good report of her house withdraw your followers without delay your commands shall be obeyed my lord marquis sir giles rejoined but before i go i have an arrest to make that young man pointing to jocelyn has been talking treason it is false my lord marquis jocelyn replied his majesty hath not a more loyal subject than myself i would cut out my tongue rather than speak against him i have said the king is ill served in such officers as giles mompesson and sir francis mitchell and i abide by my words they can reflect no dishonour on his majesty save that they seem to imply a belief on your part that his majesty has chosen his officers badly buckingham said regarding the young man fixedly not so my lord marquis these men may have been favourably represented to his majesty who no doubt has been kept in ignorance of their iniquitous proceedings what are you driving at sir buckingham cried almost fiercely i mean my lord marquis that these persons may be the creatures of some powerful noble whose interest it is to throw a cloak over their malpractices fore heaven some covert insult would seem to be intended exclaimed buckingham who is this young man sir giles he is named jocelyn mounchensey my lord marquis and is the son of an old norfolk knight baronet who you may remember was arraigned before the court of starchamber heavily fined and imprisoned i do remember the case and the share you and sir francis had in it sir giles buckingham rejoined i am right glad to hear that my lord said jocelyn you will not then wonder that i avow myself their mortal enemy we laugh to scorn these idle vapourings said sir giles and were it permitted he added touching his sword i myself would find an easy way to silence them but the froward youth whose brains seem crazed with his fancied wrongs is not content with railing against us but must needs lift up his voice against all constituted authority he hath spoken contemptuously of the starchamberand that my lord marquis as you well know is an offence which cannot be passed over i am sorry for it buckingham rejoined but if he will retract what he has said and express compunction with promise of amendment in future i will exert my influence to have him held harmless i will never retract what i have said against that iniquitous tribunal jocelyn rejoined firmly i will rather die a martyr as my father did in the cause of truth your kindness is altogether thrown away upon him my lord sir giles said with secret satisfaction so i perceive buckingham rejoined our business is over he added to the nobles and gallants around him so we may to our barges you my lord he added to lord roos will doubtless tarry to receive the thanks of our pretty hostess and graciously saluting madame bonaventure he quitted the tavern accompanied by a large train and entering his barge amid the acclamations of the spectators was rowed towards whitehall chapter x the prentices and their leader while the marquis of buckingham and his suite were moving towards the wharf amid the acclamations of the crowd for in the early part of his brilliant career the haughty favourite was extremely popular with the multitude probably owing to the princely largesses he was in the habit of distributing among them a very different reception awaited those who succeeded him the hurrahs and other vociferations of delight and enthusiasm were changed into groans hootings and discordant yells when sir francis mitchell came in sight supported between two stout myrmidons and scarcely able to maintain his perpendicular as he was borne by them towards the wherry in waiting for him near the stairs though the knight was escorted by captain bludder and his alsatian bullies several of the crowd did not seem disposed to confine themselves to jeers and derisive shouts but menaced him with some rough usage planting themselves in his path they shook their fists in his face with other gestures of defiance and indignity and could only be removed by force captain bludder and his roaring blades assumed their fiercest looks swore their loudest oaths twisted their shaggy moustaches and tapped their rapierhilts but they prudently forbore to draw their weapons well knowing that the proceeding would be a signal for a brawl and that the cry of clubs would be instantly raised amongst the foremost of those who thus obstructed sir francis and his party was a young man with a lithe active figure bright black eyes full of liveliness and malice an olive complexion and a gipsylike cast of countenance attired in a tightfitting brown frieze jerkin with stone buttons and purple hose his head was covered with a montero cap with a cocks feather stuck in it he was armed neither with sword nor dagger but carried a large cudgel or club the wellknown and formidable weapon of the london prentices in the use of which whether as a quarterstaff or missile they were remarkably expert even a skilful swordsman stood but poor chance with them besides this saucylooking personage who was addressed as dick taverner by his comrades there were many others who to judge from their habiliments and their cudgels belonged to the same fraternity as himself that is to say they were apprentices to grocers drapers haberdashers skinners ironmongers vintners or other respectable artificers or tradesfolk now dick taverner had an especial grudge against our two extortioners for though he himself being prentice to a bookseller in pauls churchyard had little concern with them he was the son of an innkeepersimon taverner of the emperors head garlick hillwho had been recently mined by their exactions his licence taken from him and his house closed enough to provoke a less mettlesome spark than dick who had vowed to revenge the parental injuries on the first opportunity the occasion now seemed to present itself and it was not to be lost chancing to be playing at bowls in the alley behind the three cranes with some of his comrades on the day in question dick learnt from cyprien what was going forward and the party resolved to have their share in the sport if needful they promised the drawer to rescue his mistress from the clutches of her antagonists and to drive them from the premises but their services in this respect were not required they next decided on giving sir francis mitchell a sound ducking in the thames their measures were quickly and warily taken issuing from an arched doorway at the side of the tavern they stationed some of their number near it while the main party posted themselves at the principal entrance in front scouts were planted inside to communicate with cyprien and messengers were despatched to cry clubs and summon the neighbouring prentices from queenhithe thames street trinity lane old fish street and dowgate hill so that fresh auxiliaries were constantly arriving buckingham with the young nobles and gallants were of course allowed to pass free and were loudly cheered but the prentices soon ascertained from their scouts that sir francis was coming forth and made ready for him utterly unconscious of his danger the inebriate knight replied to the gibes scoffs and menaces addressed to him by snapping his fingers in his opponents faces and irritating them in their turn but if he was insensible of the risk he ran those around him were not and his two supporters endeavoured to hurry him forward violently resisting their efforts he tried to shake them off and more than once stood stockstill until compelled to go on arrived at the stairhead he next refused to embark and a scene of violent altercation ensued between him and his attendants many boats were moored off the shore with a couple of barges close at hand and the watermen and oarsmen standing up in their craft listened to what was going forward with much apparent amusement hastily descending the steps captain bludder placed himself near the wherry intended for the knight and called to the others to make short work of it and bring him down at this juncture the word was given by dick taverner who acted as leader and in less than two minutes sir francis was transferred from the hands of his myrmidons to those of the prentices to accomplish this a vigorous application of cudgels was required and some broken pates were the consequence of resistance but the attack was perfectly successful the myrmidons and alsatians were routed and the prentices remained masters of the field and captors of a prisoner stupefied with rage and astonishment captain bludder looked on at one moment thinking of drawing his sword and joining the fray but the next perceiving that his men were evidently worsted he decided upon making off and with this view he was about to jump into the wherry when his purpose was prevented by dick taverner and a few others of the most active of his companions who dashed down the steps to where he stood the captain had already got one foot in the wherry and the watermen equally alarmed with himself were trying to push off when the invaders came up and springing into the boat took possession of the oars sending bludder floundering into the thames where he sunk up to the shoulders and stuck fast in the mud roaring piteously for help scarcely were the prentices seated than sir francis mitchell was brought down to them and the poor knight beginning to comprehend the jeopardy in which he was placed roared for help as lustily as the halfdrowned alsatian captain and quite as ineffectually the latter was left to shift for himself but the former was rowed out some twenty or thirty yards from the shore where a stout cord being fastened to his girdle he was plunged headforemost into the river and after being thrice drawn up and as often submerged again he was dragged on board and left to shiver and shake in his dripping habiliments in the stern of the boat the bath had completely sobered him and he bitterly bemoaned himself declaring that if he did not catch his death of cold he should be plagued with cramps and rheumatism during the rest of his days he did not dare to utter any threats against his persecutors but he internally vowed to be revenged upon themcost what it might the prentices laughed at his complaints and dick taverner told himthat as he liked not cold water he should have spared them their ale and wine but as he had meddled with their liquors and with those who sold them they had given him a taste of a different beverage which they should provide free of cost for all those who interfered with their enjoyments and the rights of the public dick added that his last sousing was in requital for the stoppage of the emperors head and that with his own free will he would have left him under the water with a stone round his neck this measure of retributive justice accomplished the prentices and their leader made for the stairs where they landed after telling the watermen to row their fare to the point nearest his lodgings an order which was seconded by sir francis himself who was apprehensive of further outrage neither would he tarry to take in captain bludder though earnestly implored to do so by that personage who having in his struggles sunk deeper into the oozy bed could now only just keep his bearded chin and mouth above the level of the tide taking compassion upon him dick taverner threw him an oar and instantly grasping it the alsatian was in this way dragged ashore presenting a very woful spectacle his nether limbs being covered with slime while the moisture poured from his garments as it would from the coat of a waterspaniel his hat had floated down the stream and he had left one boot sticking in the mud while his buff jerkin saturated with wet clung to his skin like a damp glove leaving him to wring his cloak and dry his habiliments in the best way he could the leader of the prentices collected together his forces and disposing them in something like military array placed himself at their head and marched towards the tavern where they set up a great shout hitherto they had met with no interruption whatever on the contrary the watermen bargemen and others had cheered them on in their work of mischief and the crowd on shore appeared rather friendly to them than otherwise flushed with success the riotous youths seemed well disposed to carry their work of retribution to extremities and to inflict some punishment upon sir giles proportionate to his enormities having ascertained from their scouts that no one connected with the usurious knight had come forth they felt quite secure of their prey and were organising a plan of attack when intelligence was brought by a scout that a great disturbance was going on inside in consequence of a young gentleman having been arrested by sir giles and his crew and that their presence was instantly required by madame bonaventure on hearing this dick taverner shoutedto the rescue to the rescue and rushed into the house followed by the prentices who loudly echoed his cries par ici messieurs par icithis way this way vociferated cyprien who met them in the passagethe bowlingalleythere they are but the gascons directions were scarcely needed the clashing of swords would have served to guide the prentices to the scene of conflict chapter xi john wolfe when jocelyn mounchensey called for his reckoning madame bonaventure took him aside showing by her looks that she had something important to communicate to him and began by telling him he was heartily welcome to all he had partaken of at her ordinary adding that she considered herself very greatly his debtor for the gallantry and zeal he had displayed in her behalf not that i was in any real peril my fair young sir she continued though i feigned to be so for i have powerful protectors as you perceive and indeed this was all a preconcerted scheme between my lord roos and his noble friends to turn the tables on the two extortioners but that does not lessen my gratitude to you and i shall try to prove it you are in more danger than perchance you wot of and i feel quite sure sir giles means to carry his threat into execution and to cause your arrest seeing him smile disdainfully as if he had no apprehensions she added somewhat quicklywhat will your bravery avail against so many mon beau gentilhomme mon dieu nothing no no i must get you assistance luckily i have some friends at hand the prenticesgrands et forts gaillards avec des estocscyprien has told me they are here most certainly they will take your part so sir giles shall not carry you off after all jocelyns lips again curled with the same disdainful smile as before ah i vous etes trop temeraire madame bonaventure cried tapping his arm sit down here for awhile i will give you the signal when you may depart with safety do not attempt to stir till then you understand jocelyn did not understand very clearly but without making any observation to the contrary he took the seat pointed out to him the position was wellchosen inasmuch as it enabled him to command the movements of the foe and offered him a retreat through a sidedoor close at hand though he was naturally quite ignorant whither the outlet might conduct him while this was passing sir giles was engaged in giving directions respecting his partner whose inebriate condition greatly scandalized him and it was in pursuance of his orders that sir francis was transported to the wharf where the misadventure before related befel him never for a moment did sir giles watchful eye quit jocelyn upon whom he was ready to pounce like a tiger if the young man made any movement to depart and he only waited till the tavern should be clear of company to effect the seizure meanwhile another person approached the young man this was the friendly stranger in the furred gown and flat cap who had sat next him at dinner and who it appeared was not willing to abandon him in his difficulties addressing him with much kindness the worthy personage informed him that he was a bookseller named john wolfe and carried on business at the sign of the bible and crown in pauls churchyard where he should be glad to see the young man whenever he was free to call upon him but i cannot disguise from you master jocelyn mounchenseyfor your dispute with sir francis mitchell has acquainted me with your name john wolfe saidthat your rashness has placed you in imminent peril so that there is but little chance for the present of my showing you the hospitality and kindness i desire sir giles seems to hover over you as a rapacious vulture might do before making his swoop heaven shield you from his talons and now my good young sir accept one piece of caution from me which my years and kindly feelings towards you entitle me to make an you scape this danger as i trust you may let it be a lesson to you to put a guard upon your tongue and not suffer it to outrun your judgment you are much too rash and impetuous and by your folly nay do not quarrel with me my young friendi can give no milder appellation to your conduct have placed yourself in the power of your enemies not only have you provoked sir francis mitchell whose malice is more easily aroused than appeased but you have defied sir giles mompesson who is equally implacable in his enmities and as if two such enemies were not enough you must needs make a third yet more dangerous than either how so good master wolfe jocelyn cried to whom do you refer to whom should i refer master jocelyn wolfe rejoined but to my lord of buckingham whom you wantonly insulted for the latter indiscretion there can be no excuse whatever there may be for the former and it was simple madness to affront a nobleman of his exalted rank second only in authority to the king himself but how have i offended the marquis demanded jocelyn surprised is it possible you can have spoken at random and without knowledge of the force of your own words john wolfe rejoined looking hard at him it may be so for you are plainly ignorant of the world well then he added lowering his tone when you said that these two abominable extortioners were the creatures of some great man who glozed over their villainous practices to the king and gave a better account of them than they deserve you were nearer the truth than you imagined but it could hardly be agreeable to the marquis to be told this to his face since it is notorious to all except to yourself that he is the man heavens exclaimed jocelyn i now see the error i have committed a grave error indeed rejoined wolfe shaking his head and most difficult to be repairedfor the plea of ignorance though it may suffice with me will scarcely avail you with the marquis indeed it can never be urged since he disowns any connection with these men and it is suspected that his halfbrother sir edward villiers goes between them in all their secret transactions of this however i know nothing personally and only tell you what i have heard but if it were not almost treasonable to say it i might add that his majesty is far too careless of the means whereby his exchequer is enriched and his favourites gratified and at all events suffers himself to be too easily imposed upon hence all these patents and monopolies under which we groan the favourites must have money and as the king has little to give them they raise as much as they please on the credit of his name thus everything is sold places posts titles all have their pricebribery and corruption reign everywhere the lordkeeper pays a pension to the marquisso doth the attorneygeneraland simony is openly practised for the bishop of salisbury paid him l for his bishopric but this is not the worst of it is it not terrible to think of a proud nobleman clothed almost with supreme authority being secretly leagued with sordid wretches whose practices he openly discountenances and contemns and receiving share of their spoil is it not yet more terrible to reflect that the royal coffers are in some degree supplied by similar means tis enough to drive an honest man distracted jocelyn said and you cannot wonder at my indignation though you may blame my want of caution i have said nothing half so strong as you have just uttered master wolfe ah but my good young sir i do not publicly proclaim my opinions as you do my lord of buckinghams name must no more be called in question than his majestys to associate the marquiss name with those of his known instruments were to give him mortal offence even to hint at such a connection is sufficient to provoke his displeasure but enough of this my purpose is not to lecture you but to befriend you tell me frankly my good young sirand be not offended with the offerwill my purse be useful to you if so tis freely at your service and it may help you in your present emergencyfor though there is not enough in it to bribe the master to forego his purpose against you there is amply sufficient to procure your liberation privily from the men i thank you heartily good master wolfe and believe me i am not withheld by false pride from accepting your offer jocelyn replied but i must trust to my own arm to maintain my liberty and to my own address to regain it if i be taken again i thank you sir i grieve that i cannot lend you other aid john wolfe replied looking compassionately at him but my peaceful avocations do not permit me to take any part in personal conflicts and i am loath to be mixed up in such disturbances nevertheless i do not like to stand by and see outrage done concern yourself no more about me worthy sir interrupted jocelyn perhaps i shall not be molested and if i should be i am well able to take care of myself let those who assail me bear the consequences but john wolfe still lingered if some of my apprentices were only here he said and especially that riotous rogue dick taverner something might be done to help you effectuallyha what is that uproar as a tumultuous noise mixed with the cries of clubsclubs was heard without coming from the direction of the wharf as i live the prentices are out and engaged in some mischievous work and it will be strange if dick taverner be not among them i will see what they are about and as he spoke he hurried to the oriel window which looked out upon the wharf exclaimingay ayt is as i thought dick is among them and at their head fore heaven they are attacking those ruffianly braggarts from whitefriars and are laying about them lustily with their cudgels ha what is this i see the alsatians and the myrmidons are routed and the brave lads have captured sir francis mitchell what are they about to do with him i must go forth and see his purpose however was prevented by a sudden movement on the part of sir giles and his attendants they came in the direction of jocelyn mounchensey with the evident intention of seizing the young man jocelyn instantly sprang to his feet drew his sword and put himself in a posture of defence the myrmidons prepared to beat down the young mans blade with their halberds and secure him when jocelyns cloak was plucked from behind and he heard madame bonaventures voice exclaimcome this wayfollow me instantly thus enjoined he dashed through the door which was instantly fastened as soon as he had made good his retreat chapter xii the arrest and the rescue lupo vulp had endeavoured to dissuade sir giles from putting his design of arresting jocelyn into immediate execution alleging the great risk he would incur as well from the resolute character of the young man himself who was certain to offer determined resistance as from the temper of the company which being decidedly adverse to any such step might occasion a disturbance that would probably result in the prisoners rescue in any case sir giles said the wily scrivener let me counsel you to tarry till the greater part of the guests be gone and the assemblage outside dispersed for i noted many turbulent prentices among the mob who are sure to be troublesome since the young man shows no present disposition to quit the house sir giles replied looking askance at jocelyn who just then had moved to another part of the room with madame bonaventure there is no urgency and it may be prudent to pause a few moments as you suggest good lupo but i will not suffer him to depart i perceive from her gestures and glances that our tricksy hostess is plotting some scheme with him plot away fair mistress you must have more cunning than i give you credit for if you outwit me a second time in the same day i can guess what she proposes you note that side door near them lupo she is advising the youths flight that way and he like a hairbrained fool will not listen to the suggestion but it will be well to watch the outlet hark ye lanyere he added to the promoter take three men with you and go round quickly to the passage with which yon door communicates station yourselves near the outlet and if mounchensey comes forth arrest him instantly you see the door i mean about it quick and lanyere instantly departed with three of the myrmidons i would this arrest could be lawfully effected sir giles said lupo vulp by a serjeantatarms or pursuivant there would then be no risk again i venture to counsel you to proceed regularly no great delay would be occasioned if your worship went to westminster and made a complaint against the young man before the council in that case a messenger of the court would be despatched to attach his person and even if he should quit the house in the meanwhile lanyere will keep on his track that were the surest course as to the manner of proceeding i conclude it will be by ore tenus it is not likely that this youths headstrong temper coupled with his fantastic notions of honour will permit him to deny your worships accusation and therefore his confession being written down and subscribed by himself will be exhibited against him when he is brought to the bar of the starchamber and he will be judged ex ore suo your worship will make quick work of it cum confitente reo citius est agendum replied sir giles no one knows better than thou good lupo how promptly and effectually the court of starchamber will vindicate its authority and how severely it will punish those who derogate from its dignity no part of the sentence shall be remitted with my consent this insolent youth shall suffer to the same extent as lanyere pilloried branded mutilated degraded he shall serve as a warning to my enemies your worship can scarce make him more of a scarecrow than you have made of lanyere lupo remarked with a grin but do you decide on applying in the first instance to the council no sir giles replied i will not lose sight of him he shall not have a chance of escape marked you not lupo how the rash fool committed himself with buckingham and think you the proud marquis would hold me blameless if by accident he should get off scotfree after such an outrage but see the room is wellnigh cleared only a few loiterers remain the time is come and he was about to order the attack when the disturbance outside reached his ears and checked him for a moment sir giles was considering what could be the cause of the tumult and hesitating whether to go forth and support sir francis in case he stood in need of assistance when the discomfited myrmidons rushed into the room a few words sufficed to explain what had occurred and indeed the bloody visages of some of the men showed how roughly they had been handled though greatly exasperated sir giles was determined not to be baulked of his prey and fearing jocelyn might escape in the confusion which an attack upon the prentices would occasion he gave the word for his instant seizure and rushed towards him as before related how he was baffled has already been told his wrath knew no bounds when the young man disappeared he hurled himself furiously against the door but it resisted all his efforts to burst it open suddenly the bolt was withdrawn and clement lanyere and his men stood before him have you secured him sir giles demanded trying to descry the fugitive among them death and fiends you have not let him escape no one has passed us except madame bonaventure the promoter replied she was wholly unattended and came in this direction we were stationed within yon antichamber which appears to be the sole means of communication with this passage and we ought therefore to have intercepted the young man when he came forth you were not wont to be thus shortsighted lanyere there must be some other mode of exit which you have failed to discover sir giles cried furiously ha here it is he exclaimed dashing aside a piece of tapestry that seemed merely hung against the wall but in reality concealed a short flight of steps purblind dolts that you are not to find this out you shall answer for your negligence hereafter if we take him not and accompanied by the troop he hurried down the steps which brought him to a lower room communicating on one hand with a small court and on the other with the kitchen and offices attached to the tavern directing lanyere to search the latter sir giles rushed into the court and uttered a shout of savage joy on perceiving jocelyn sword in hand scaling a wall which separated the court from the bowlinggreen some difficulty it appeared had occurred to the hostess in forcing open a private door in the yard leading to the green which being rarely used for the principal entrance was situated elsewhere its fastenings were rusty and refused to act this delay favoured the pursuers and on hearing their approach jocelyn strove to effect his retreat in the manner described but sir giles was further served though unintentionally by madame bonaventure who succeeded in drawing back the rusty bolt at the very moment he came up and no impediment now existing the knight thrust her rudely aside and sprang through the doorway just as jocelyn leaped from the wall disregarding sir giless summons to surrender the young man hurried on till he reached the middle of the bowlinggreen where finding flight impossible as there was no apparent outlet at the further end of the garden while it was certain that the tipstaves would pluck him from the wall with their hooks if he attempted to clamber over it he turned and stood upon his defence willing to have the credit of disarming him unaided and confident in his own superior strength and skill sir giles signed to his myrmidons to stand back while he alone advanced towards the young man a turn in his strong wrist would he imagined suffice to accomplish his purpose but he found out his error the moment he engaged with his opponent in dexterity and force the latter was fully his match while in nimbleness of body jocelyn surpassed him the deadly glances thrown at him by the young man showed that the animosity of the latter would only be satisfied with blood changing his purpose therefore sir giles in place of attempting to cross his antagonists sword rapidly disengaged his point and delivered a stoccata or in modern terms of fence a thrust in carte over the arm which was instantly parried for some minutes the conflict continued without material success on either side holding his rapier short with the point towards his adversarys face jocelyn retreated a few paces at first but then charging in turn speedily won back his ground stoccatas imbroccatas drittas mandrittas and riversas were exchanged between them in a manner that delighted the myrmidons most of whom were amateurs of swordplay infuriated by the unexpected resistance he encountered sir giles at length resolved to terminate the fight and finding his antagonist constantly upon some sure ward endeavoured to reach him with a half incartata but instantly shifting his body with marvellous dexterity jocelyn struck down the others blade and replied with a straight thrust which must infallibly have taken effect if his rapier had not been beaten from his grasp by clement lanyere at the very moment it touched his adversarys breast at the same time the young mans arms were grasped from behind by two of the myrmidons and he lay at his enemys disposal sir giles however sheathed his rapier saying with a grim smile that he did not mean to deprive himself of the satisfaction of seeing his foe stand in the pillory and submit to the sworn torturers knife adding it was somewhat strange that one who could guard his body so well should keep such indifferent watch over his tongue jocelyn made no reply to the sarcasm and the knight was preparing to depart with his followers when a loud and tumultuous uproar proclaimed the approach of the apprentices the posse of victorious youths made their way to the bowlinggreen by the principal entrance situated as before mentioned at a different point from the door by which the others had gained it more apprehensive of losing his prisoner than concerned for his personal safety for though the aggressive party greatly exceeded his own in numbers he knew well how to deal with them being accustomed to such encounters sir giles gave some orders respecting jocelyn to clement lanyere and then prepared to resist the onslaught by causing his band to form a solid square those armed with bills and staves being placed in the foremost ranks this disposition being quickly made he drew his sword and in a loud authoritative tone commanded the apprentices to stand back such was the effect produced by his voice and the terrors of his countenance which seldom failed to strike awe into beholders that the intending rescuers came to a halt and showed some hesitation in engaging him what means this disturbance thundered sir giles and why do you offer to molest me in the execution of my duty know you not that assemblages like yours are unlawful and that you are liable to severe punishment unless you immediately disperse yourselves and peaceably depart to your own habitations about your business i say and trouble me no longer but first i command you to deliver up your ringleaders and especially those who as i am told have perpetrated the gross outrage and violence upon the person of sir francis mitchell an example shall be made of them you waste your breath sir giles and your big words will avail you nothing with us dick taverner replied now hear me in return we the bold and loyal prentices of london who serve our masters and our masters master the kings highness well and truly will not allow an unlawful arrest to be made by you or by any other man and we command you peaceably to deliver up your prisoner to us or by the rood we will take him forcibly from your hands out insolent fellow cried sir giles thou wilt alter thy tune when thou art scourged at the cartstail you must catch me first sir giles replied dick and two words will go to that we have read sir francis mitchell a lesson he is not likely to forget and we will read you one an you provoke us we have a few old scores to wipe off ay marry have we cried an embroiderers apprentice these extortioners have ruined my masters trade by their goldandsilverthread monopoly hundreds of worthy men have been thrown out of employment by their practices said a vintners prentice we sell not half the wine we used to do and no wonder seeing twothirds of the inns in london are shut up the brewers will be all ruined said a burly prentice with a wooden shovel over his shoulder since every day a fresh alehouse is closed and no new licences are granted murrain seize all such monopolists they are worse than the fly in hops or smut in barley ay plague take em exclaimed dick taverner they are as bad as the locusts of egypt when they have devoured the substance of one set of tradesfolk they will commence upon that of another no one is safe from them it will be your turn next master mercer yours after him master ironmonger however hard of digestion may be your wares you will come third master fishmonger you fourth master grocer and when they are surfeited with spiceries and fish they will fall upon you tooth and nail master goldsmith i trow not cried the apprentice last appealed to our masters are too rich and too powerful to submit to such usage the very reason they will undergo it replied dick their riches are only a temptation to plunder i repeat no man is safe from these extortioners since the law will not give us redress and put them down we must take the law into our own hands they shall have club law ay ayprentices lawclub law chorussed the others sir giles will make a starchamber matter of it he will have us up before the council laughed the goldsmiths prentice he will buy a monopoly of cudgels to deprive us of their use cried a bowyer we will bestow that patent upon him gratis quoth dick making his staff whistle round his head the prisonergentlemen prenticesdo not forget him cried cyprien who with two other servingmen and the cook had joined the assailing party madame bonaventure implores you to effect his rescue and so we will my jovial gascon replied dick come sir giles are we to have the young gentleman from you by force or freewill you shall have him in neither way sirrah the knight rejoined you yourself shall bear him company in the fleet upon them my men and make for the door and as the command was given he and his troop made a sudden dash upon the prentices who unable to stand against the bills levelled against their breasts gave way still the gallant youths were by no means routed instantly closing upon their opponents and being quite as nimble of foot as they they contrived to cut off their retreat from the garden and a sharp conflict took place between the parties as they came to close quarters near the entrance three of the myrmidons were felled by dick taverners cudgel and at last watching his opportunity with both hands he launched a bowl which he had picked up at sir giless head if the missile had taken effect the fight would have been over but the knight avoided the blow by stooping down and the bowl passing over him hit lupo vulp full in the stomach and brought him to the ground deprived of breath meanwhile sir giles springing quickly forward pinned the apprentice against the wall with his rapiers point i have thee at last knave he cried seizing dick by the collar and delivering him to the custody of the myrmidons nearest himi told thee thou shouldst visit the fleet and so thou shalt notwithstanding the capture of their leader the prentices fought manfully and it still appeared doubtful whether sir giles would be able to effect a retreat after all embarrassed as he now was with two prisoners under these circumstances he made a sign to clement lanyere to withdraw with jocelyn through the other door ordering the two myrmidons who had charge of dick taverner to follow him with their captive it was no easy task to carry out the order but the promoter managed to accomplish it singlehanded he drove back all who opposed his progress while the two prisoners were borne towards the door by the men having them in custody hitherto jocelyn had made no attempt at selfliberation awaiting probably the result of the prentices efforts in his behalf or some more favourable opportunity than had hitherto presented itself on reaching the little court the time for exertion seemed to be come shaking off the myrmidons who pinioned him and seizing a bill from one of them he instantly stretched the fellow at his feet and drove off his comrade this done he lent immediate assistance to dick taverner setting him free and arming him with as much promptitude as he had used to effect his own deliverance while thus engaged he received no interruption from clement lanyere though if he had chosen the promoter might no doubt have effectually opposed him but lanyere either was or feigned to be engaged with some skirmishers at the door and it was only when both the prisoners had got free that he rushed towards them loudly reprehending the men for their carelessness but if they were to blame he was no less so for he showed little address in following the fugitives and managed to take a wrong turn in the passage which led both him and the myrmidons astray so that the prisoners got clear off how jocelyn and dick taverner contrived to reach the vintry wharf neither of them very distinctly knewsuch was the hurried manner in which they passed through the tavern but there they were precisely at the moment that sir giles mompesson having fought his way through all opposition issued from the porch at the head of his band quite satisfied with his previous encounter with the redoubtable knight and anxious to escape before his evasion should he discovered dick beckoned to his companion and making all the haste they could to the stairs they both jumped into the nearest wherry when the apprentice ordered the two watermen within it to row for their lives to londonbridge chapter xiii how jocelyn mounchensey encountered a masked horseman on stamford hill two days after the events last recorded a horseman followed at a respectful distance by a mounted attendant took his way up stamford hill he was young and of singularly prepossessing appearance with a countenance full of fire and spirit and blooming with health and it was easy to see that his life had been passed in the country and in constant manly exercise for though he managed his horsea powerful bay chargerto perfection there was nothing of the town gallant or of the soldier about him his doublet and cloak were of a plain dark material and had seen service but they well became his fine symmetrical figure as did the buff boots defending his wellmade vigorous limbs better seat in saddle or lighter hand with bridle no man could possess than he and his noble steed which like himself was full of courage and ardour responded to all his movements and obeyed the slightest indication of his will his arms were rapier and dagger and his broadleaved hat ornamented with a black feather covered the luxuriant brown locks that fell in long ringlets over his shoulders so debonnair was the young horseman in deportment so graceful in figure and so comely in looks that he had excited no little admiration as he rode forth at an early hour that morning from bishopgate street and passing under the wide portal in the old city walls speeded towards the then rural district of shoreditch leaving old bedlam and its saddening associations on the right and finsbury fields with its gardens doghouses and windmills on the left at the end of bishopgatestreetwithout a considerable crowd was collected round a party of comely young milkmaids who were executing a lively and characteristic dance to the accompaniment of a bagpipe and fiddle instead of carrying pails as was their wont these milkmaids who were all very neatly attired bore on their heads a pile of silver plate borrowed for the occasion arranged like a pyramid and adorned with ribands and flowers in this way they visited all their customers and danced before their doors a pretty usage then observed in the environs of the metropolis in the month of may the merry milkmaids set up a joyous shout as the youth rode by and many a bright eye followed his gallant figure till it disappeared at the conduit beyond shoreditch a pack of young girls who were drawing water suspended their task to look after him and so did every buxom country lass he encountered whether seated in tilted cart or on a pillion behind her sturdy sire to each salutation addressed to him the young man cordially replied in a voice blithe as his looks and in some cases where the greeting was given by an elderly personage or a cap was respectfully doffed to him he uncovered his own proud head and displayed his handsome features yet more fully so much for the master now for the man in his own opinion at leastfor he was by no means deficient in selfconceitthe latter came in for an equal share of admiration and certes if impudence could help him to win it he lacked not the recommendation staring most of the girls out of countenance he leered at some of them so offensively that their male companions shook their fists or whips at him and sometimes launched a stone at his head equally free was he in the use of his tongue and his jests were so scurrilous and so little relished by those to whom they were addressed that it was perhaps well for him in some instances that the speed at which he rode soon carried him out of harms reach the knave was not illfavoured being young supple of limb olivecomplexioned blackeyed saucy roguishlooking with a turnedup nose and extremely white teeth he wore no livery and indeed his attire was rather that of a citizens apprentice than such as beseemed a gentlemans lacquey he was well mounted on a stout sorrel horse but though the animal was tractable enough and easy in its paces he experienced considerable difficulty in maintaining his seat on its back in this way jocelyn mounchensey and dick taverner for the reader will have had no difficulty in recognising the pair arrived at stamford hill and the former drawing in the rein proceeded slowly up the gentle ascent it was one of those delicious spring mornings when all nature seems to rejoice when the newlyopened leaves are greenest and freshest when the lark springs blithest from the verdant mead and soars nearest heaven when a thousand other feathered choristers warble forth their notes in copse and hedge when the rooks caw mellowly near their nests in the lofty trees when gentle showers having fallen overnight have kindly prepared the earth for the morrows genial warmth and sunshine when that sunshine each moment calls some new object into life and beauty when all you look upon is pleasant to the eye all you listen to is delightful to the earin short it was one of those exquisite mornings only to be met with in the merry month of may and only to be experienced in full perfection in merry england arrived at the summit of the hill commanding such extensively charming views jocelyn halted and looked back with wonder at the vast and populous city he had just quitted now spread out before him in all its splendour and beauty in his eyes it seemed already overgrown though it had not attained a tithe of its present proportions but he could only judge according to his opportunity and was unable to foresee its future magnitude but if london has waxed in size wealth and population during the last two centuries and ahalf it has lost nearly all the peculiar features of beauty which distinguished it up to that time and made it so attractive to jocelyns eyes the diversified and picturesque architecture of its ancient habitations as yet undisturbed by the innovations of the italian and dutch schools and brought to full perfection in the latter part of the reign of elizabeth gave the whole city a characteristic and fanciful appearance old towers old belfries old crosses slender spires innumerable rose up amid a world of quaint gables and angular roofs story above story sprang those curious dwellings irregular yet homogeneous dear to the painters and the poets eye elaborate in ornament grotesque in design well suited to the climate and admirably adapted to the wants and comforts of the inhabitants picturesque like the age itself like its costume its manners its literature all these characteristic beauties and peculiarities are now utterly gone all the old picturesque habitations have been devoured by fire and a new city has risen in their steadnot to compare with the old city thoughand conveying no notion whatever of itany more than you or i worthy reader in our formal and i grieve to say it illcontrived attire resemble the picturesquelooking denizens of london clad in doublet mantle and hose in the time of james the first another advantage in those days must not be forgotten the canopy of smoke overhanging the vast modern babel and oftentimes obscuring even the light of the sun itself did not dim the beauties of the ancient citysea coal being but little used in comparison with wood of which there was then abundance as at this time in the capital of france thus the atmosphere was clearer and lighter and served as a finer medium to reveal objects which would now be lost at a quarter the distance fair sparkling and clearly defined then rose up old london before jocelyns gaze girded round with gray walls defended by battlements and approached by lofty gates four of whichto wit cripplegate moorgate bishopgate and aldgatewere visible from where he stood it riveted attention from its immense congregation of roofs spires pinnacles and vanes all glittering in the sunshine while in the midst of all and preeminent above all towered one gigantic pilethe glorious gothic cathedral far on the east and beyond the city walls though surrounded by its own mural defences was seen the frowning tower of londonpart fortress and part prisona structure never viewed in those days without terror being the scene of so many passing tragedies looking westward and rapidly surveying the gardens and pleasant suburban villages lying on the north of the strand the young mans gaze settled for a moment on charing crossthe elaboratelycarved memorial to his queen eleanor erected by edward iand then ranging over the palace of whitehall and its two gates westminster abbeymore beautiful without its towers than with themit became fixed upon westminster hall for there in one of its chambers the ceiling of which was adorned with gilded stars were held the councils of that terrible tribunal which had robbed him of his inheritance and now threatened him with deprivation of liberty and mutilation of person a shudder crossed him as he thought of the starchamber and he turned his gaze elsewhere trying to bring the whole glorious city within his ken a splendid view indeed well might king james himself exclaim when standing not many years previously on the very spot where jocelyn now stood and looking upon london for the first time since his accession to the throne of englandwell might he exclaim in rapturous accents as he gazed on the magnificence of his capitalat last the richest jewel in a monarchs crown is mine after satiating himself with this to him novel and wonderful prospect jocelyn began to bestow his attention on objects closer at hand and examined the landscapes on either side of the eminence which without offering any features of extraordinary beauty were generally pleasing and exercised a soothing influence upon his mind at that time stamford hill was crowned with a grove of trees and its eastern declivity was overgrown with brushwood the whole country on the essex side was more or less marshy until epping forest some three miles off was reached through a swampy vale on the left the river lea so dear to the angler took its slow and silent course while through a green valley on the right flowed the new river then only just opened pointing out the latter channel to jocelyn dick taverner who had now come up informed him that he was present at the completion of that important undertaking and a famous sight it was the apprentice said the lord mayor of london the aldermen and the recorder were all present in their robes and gowns to watch the floodgate opened which was to pour the stream that had run from amwell head into the great cistern near islington and this was done amidst deafening cheers and the thunder of ordnance a proud day it was for sir hugh myddleton dick added and some reward for his perseverance through difficulties and disappointments it is to be hoped the good gentleman has obtained more substantial reward than that jocelyn replied he has conferred an inestimable boon upon his fellowcitizens and is entitled to their gratitude for it as to gratitude on the part of the citizens i cant say much for that sir and it is not every man that meets with his desserts or we know where our friends sir giles mompesson and sir francis mitchell would be the good cits are content to drink the pure water of the new river without bestowing a thought on him who has brought it to their doors meantime the work has wellnigh beggared sir hugh myddleton and he is likely to obtain little recompense beyond what the consciousness of his own beneficent act will afford him but will not the king requite him jocelyn asked the king has requited him with a title dick returned a title however which may be purchased at a less price than good sir hugh has paid for it nowadays but it must be owned to our sovereigns credit that he did far more than the citizens of london would do since when they refused to assist master myddleton as he then was in his most useful work king james undertook and bound himself by indenture under the great seal to pay half the expenses without this it would probably never have been accomplished i trust it may be profitable to sir hugh in the end jocelyn said and if not he will reap his reward hereafter it is not unlikely we may encounter him as he now dwells near edmonton and is frequently on the road dick said and if so i will point him out to you i have some slight acquaintance with him having often served him in my masters shop in pauls churchyard talking of edmonton with your permission sir we will break our fast at the bell where i am known and where you will be well served the host is a jovial fellow and trusty and may give us information which will be useful before we proceed on our perilous expedition to theobalds i care not how soon we arrive there jocelyn cried for the morning has so quickened my appetite that the bare idea of thy hosts good cheer makes all delay in attacking it unsupportable i am entirely of your opinion sir dick said smacking his lips at the bell at edmonton we are sure of fresh fish from the lea fresh eggs from the farmyard and stout ale from the cellar and if these three things do not constitute a good breakfast i know not what others do so let us be jogging onwards we have barely two miles to ride five minutes to tottenham ten to edmonton tis done it was not however accomplished quite so soon as dick anticipated ere fifty yards were traversed they were brought to a stop by an unlookedfor incident suddenly emerging from a thick covert of wood which had concealed him from view a horseman planted himself directly in their path ordering them in a loud authoritative voice to stand and enforcing attention to the injunction by levelling a caliver at jocelyns head the appearance of this personage was as mysterious as formidable the upper part of his features was concealed by a black mask his habiliments were sable and the colour of his powerful steed was sable likewise boots cap cloak and feather were all of the same dusky hue his frame was strongly built and besides the caliver he was armed with sword and poniard altogether he constituted an unpleasant obstacle in the way dick taverner was not able to render much assistance on the occasion the suddenness with which the masked horseman burst forth upon them scared his horse and the animal becoming unmanageable began to rear and finally threw its rider to the groundluckily without doing him much damage meanwhile the horseman lowering his caliver thus addressed jocelyn who taking him for a robber was prepared to resist the attack you are mistaken in me master jocelyn mounchensey he said i have no design upon your purse i call upon you to surrender yourself my prisoner never with life the young man replied in spite of your disguise i recognise you as one of sir giles mompessons myrmidons and you may conclude from our former encounter whether my resistance will be determined or not you had not escaped on that occasion but for my connivance master jocelyn the man in the mask rejoined now hear me i am willing to befriend you on certain conditions and to prove my sincerity i engage you shall go free if you accept them i do not feel disposed to make any terms with you jocelyn said sternly and as to my freedom of departure i will take care that it is not hindered i hold a warrant from the starchamber for your arrest said the man in the mask and you will vainly offer resistance if i choose to execute it let this be well understood before i proceed and now to show you the extent of my information concerning you and that i am fully aware of your proceedings i will relate to you what you have done since you fled with that froward apprentice whose tricks will assuredly bring him to bridewell from the three cranes you were landed at london bridge and went thence with your companion to the rose at newington butts where you lay that night and remained concealed as you fancied during the whole of the next day i say you fancied your retreat was unknown because i was aware of it and could have seized you had i been so disposed the next night you removed to the crown in bishopgate street and as you did not care to return to your lodgings near saint botolphs church without aldgate you privily despatched dick taverner to bring your horses from the falcon in gracechurch street where you had left them with the foolhardy intention of setting forth this morning to theobalds to try and obtain an interview of the king you have spoken the truth jocelyn replied in amazement but if you designed to arrest me and could have done so why did you defer your purpose question me not on that point some day or other i may satisfy you not now enough that i have conceived a regard for you and will not harm you unless compelled to do so by selfdefence nay more i will serve you you must not go to theobalds tis a mad scheme conceived by a hot brain and will bring destruction upon you if you persist in it i must follow you thither and prevent greater mischief follow me then if you list jocelyn cried for go i shall but be assured i will liberate myself from you if i can go hotheaded boy the man in the mask rejoined but he then added quickly yet noi will not deliver you thus to the power of your enemies without a further effort to save you since you are resolved to go to theobalds you must have a protectora protector able to shield you even from buckingham whose enmity you have reason to dread there is only one person who can do this and that is count gondomar the spanish liegerambassador luckily he is with the king now in place of making any idle attempts to obtain an interview of his majesty or forcing yourself unauthorised on the royal presence which will end in your arrest by the knight marshall seek out count gondomar and deliver this token to him tell him your story and do what he bids you and as he spoke the man in the mask held forth a ring which jocelyn took i intended to make certain conditions with you the mysterious personage pursued for the service i should render you but you have thwarted my plans by your obstinacy and i must reserve them to our next meeting for we shall meet again and that ere long and then when you tender your thanks for what i have now done i will tell you how to requite the obligation i swear to requite it if i canand as you desire jocelyn cried struck by the others manner enough the masked personage rejoined i am satisfied proceed on your way and may good fortune attend you your destiny is in your own hands obey count gondomars behests and he will aid you effectually and without a word more the man in the mask struck spurs into his horses sides and dashed down the hill at a headlong pace in the direction of london jocelyn looked after him and had not recovered from his surprise at the singular interview that had taken place when he disappeared by this time dick taverner having regained his feet limped towards him leading his horse it must be the fiend in person quoth the apprentice contriving to regain the saddle i trust you have made no compact with him sir not a sinful one i hope jocelyn replied glancing at the ring and they proceeded on their way towards tottenham and were presently saluted by the merry ringing of bells proclaiming some village festival footnotes lest we should be charged with an anachronism we may mention that the bell at edmonton immortalized in the story of john gilpin was in good repute in the days we treat of as will appear from the following extract from john saviles tractate entitled king james his entertainment at theobalds with his welcome to london having described the vast concourse of people that flocked forth to greet their new sovereign on his approach to the metropolis honest john saysafter our breakfast at edmonton at the sign of the bell we took occasion to note how many would come down in the next hour so coming up into a chamber next to the street where we might both best see and likewise take notice of all passengers we called for an hourglass and after we had disposed of ourselves who should take the number of the horse and who the foot we turned the hourglass which before it was half run out we could not possibly truly number them they came so exceedingly fast but there we broke off and made our account of horses and footmen which course continued that day from four oclock in the morning till three oclock in the afternoon and the day before also as the host of the house told us without intermission besides establishing the existence of the renowned bell at this period the foregoing passage is curious in other respects chapter xiv the mayqueen and the puritans daughter popular sports and pastimes were wisely encouraged by james the first whose great consideration for the enjoyments of the humbler classes of his subjects cannot be too highly commended and since the main purpose of this history is to point out some of the abuses prevalent during his reign it is but fair that at least one of the redeeming features should be mentioned it has ever been the practice of sourspirited sectarianism to discountenance recreations of any kind however harmless on the sabbath and several flagrant instances of this sort of interference on the part of the puritanical preachers and their disciples having come before james during his progress through the northern counties of england and especially lancashire he caused on his return to london his famous declaration concerning lawful sports on sundays and holidays to be promulgated wherein a severe rebuke was administered to the puritans and precisians and the cause of the people espoused in terms which while most creditable to the monarch are not altogether inapplicable to other times besides those in which they were delivered whereas says king james in his manifesto we did justly rebuke some puritans and precise people and took order that the like unlawful carriage should not be used by any of them hereafter in the prohibiting and unlawful punishing of our good people for using their lawful recreations and honest exercises upon sundays and other holidays after the afternoon sermon or service we now find that two sorts of people wherewith that country is much infested we mean papists and puritans have maliciously traduced those our just and honourable proceedings and therefore we have thought good hereby to clear and make our pleasure to be manifested to all our good people in those parts and he sums up his arguments in favour of the license granted as followsfor when shall the common people have leave to exercise if not upon the sundays and holidays seeing they must apply their labour and win their living in all working days truly an unanswerable proposition at the same time that these provisions for rational recreation were made all unlawful games were prohibited conformity was strictly enjoined on the part of the puritans themselves and disobedience was rendered punishable by expatriation as in the case of recusants generally such was the tenor of the royal mandate addressed to the bishop of each diocese and to all inferior clergy throughout the kingdom arbitrary it might be but it was excellent in intention for stubbornnecked personages had to be dealt with with whom milder measures would have proved ineffectual as it was violent opposition was raised against the decree and the puritanical preachers wore loud in its condemnation and as far as was consistent with safety vehement in their attacks upon its royal author the boon however was accepted by the majority of the people in the spirit in which it was offered and the licence afforded them was but little abused perfect success indeed must have attended the benign measure had it not been for the efforts of the puritanical and popish parties who made common cause against it and strove by every means to counteract its beneficial influence the first because in the austerity of their faith they would not have the sabbath in the slightest degree profaned even by innocent enjoyment the second not because they cared about the fancied desecration of the lords day but because they would have no other religion enjoy the same privileges as their own thus sectarianism and intolerance went for once hand in hand and openly or covertly as they found occasion did their best to make the people dissatisfied with the benefit accorded them trying to persuade them its acceptance would prejudice their eternal welfare such arguments however had no great weight with the masses who could not be brought to see any heinous or deadly sin in lawful recreation or exercises after divine service always provided the service itself were in no respect neglected and so the kings decree prevailed over all sectarian opposition and was fully carried out the merry month of may became really a season of enjoyment and was kept as a kind of floral festival in every village throughout the land maygames whitsunales morricedances were renewed as in bygone times and all robust and healthful sports as leaping vaulting and archery were not only permitted on sundays by the authorities but enjoined these preliminary remarks are made for the better understanding of what is to follow we have already stated that long before jocelyn and his companion reached tottenham they were made aware by the ringing of bells from its old ivygrown church tower and by other joyful sounds that some festival was taking place there and the nature of the festival was at once revealed as they entered the long straggling street then as now constituting the chief part of the pretty little village and beheld a large assemblage of country folk in holiday attire wending their way towards the green for the purpose of setting up a maypole upon it and making the welkin ring with their gladsome shouts all the youths and maidens of tottenham and its vicinity it appeared had risen before daybreak that morning and sallied forth into the woods to cut green boughs and gather wildflowers for the ceremonial at the same time they selected and hewed down a tall straight treethe tallest and straightest they could find and stripping off its branches placed it on a wain and dragged it to the village with the help of an immense team of oxen numbering as many as forty yoke each ox had a garland of flowers fastened to the tip of its horns and the tall spar itself was twined round with ropes of daffodils bluebells cowslips primroses and other early flowers while its summit was surmounted with a floral crown and festooned with garlands variouscoloured ribands kerchiefs and streamers the foremost yokes of oxen had bells hung round their necks which they shook as they moved along adding their blithe melody to the general hilarious sounds when the festive throng reached the village all its inhabitantsmale and female old and youngrushed forth to greet them and such as were able to leave their dwellings for a short while joined in the procession at the head of which of course was borne the maypole after it came a band of young men armed with the necessary implements for planting the shaft in the ground and after them a troop of maidens bearing bundles of rushes next came the minstrels playing merrily on tabor fife sacbut rebec and tambourine then followed the queen of the may walking by herselfa rustic beauty hight gillian greenfordfancifully and prettily arrayed for the occasion and attended at a little distance by robin hood maid marian friar tuck the hobbyhorse and a band of morricedancers then came the crowd pellmell laughing shouting and huzzaingmost of the young men and women bearing green branches of birch and other trees in their hands the spot selected for the maypole was a piece of green sward in the centre of the village surrounded by picturesque habitations and having on one side of it the ancient cross the latter however was but the remnant of the antique structure the cross having been robbed of its upper angular bar and otherwise mutilated at the time of the reformation and it was now nothing more than a high wooden pillar partly cased with lead to protect it from the weather and supported by four great spurs arrived at the green the wain was brought to a halt the crowd forming a vast circle round it so as not to interfere with the proceedings the pole was then taken out reared aloft and so much activity was displayed so many eager hands assisted that in an inconceivably short space of time it was firmly planted in the ground whence it shot up like the central mast of a manofwar far overtopping the roofs of the adjoining houses and looking very gay indeed with its floral crown atop and its kerchiefs and streamers fluttering in the breeze loud and reiterated shouts broke from the assemblage on the satisfactory completion of the ceremony the church bells pealed merrily and the minstrels played their most enlivening strains the rushes were strewn on the ground at the foot of the maypole and arbours were formed with marvellous celerity in different parts of the green with the branches of the trees at the same time the ancient cross was decorated with boughs and garlands the whole scene offered as pretty and cheerful a sight as could be desired but there was one beholder as will presently appear who viewed it in a different light it now came to the queen of the mays turn to advance to the pole and stationing herself beneath it the morricedancers and the rest of the mummers formed a ring round her and taking hands footed it merrily to the tune of green sleeves long before this jocelyn and his attendant had come up and both were so much interested that they felt no disposition to depart gillians attractions had already fired the inflammable heart of the apprentice who could not withdraw his gaze from her and so ardent were his looks and so expressive his gestures of admiration that ere long he succeeded to his no small delight in attracting her notice in return gillian greenford was a brighteyed fairhaired young creature light laughing radiant with cheeks soft as peach bloom and beautifully tinged with red lips carnationhued and teeth white as pearls her particoloured linseywoolsey petticoats looped up on one side disclosed limbs with no sort of rustic clumsiness about them but on the contrary a particularly neat formation both of foot and ankle her scarlet bodice which like the lower part of her dress was decorated with spangles bugles and tinsel ornaments of various kindsvery resplendent in the eyes of the surrounding swains as well as in those of dick tavernerher bodice we say spanning a slender waist was laced across while the snowy kerchief beneath it did not totally conceal a very comely bust a wreath of natural flowers was twined very gracefully within her waving and almost lintwhite locks and in her hand she held a shepherdesss crook such was the beauty of tottenham and the present queen of the may dick taverner thought her little less than angelic and there were many besides who shared in his opinion if dick had been thus captivated on the sudden jocelyn had not escaped similar fascination from another quarter it befel in this way at an open oriel window in one of the ancient and picturesque habitations before described as facing the green stood a young maiden whose beauty was of so high an order and so peculiar a character that it at once attracted and fixed attention such at least was the effect produced by it on jocelyn shrinking from the public gaze and perhaps from some motive connected with religious scruples scarcely deeming it right to be a spectator of the passing scene this fair maiden was so placed as to be almost screened from general view yet it chanced that jocelyn from the circumstance of being on horseback and from his position was able to command a portion of the room in which she stood and he watched her for some minutes before she became aware she was the object of his regards when at length she perceived that his gaze was steadily fixed upon her a deep blush suffused her cheeks and she would have instantly retired if the young man had not at once lowered his looks still he ever and anon ventured a glance towards the oriel window and was delighted to find the maiden still therenay he fancied she must have advanced a step or two for he could unquestionably distinguish her features more plainly and lovely they weremost lovely pensive in expression and perhaps a thought too pale until the crimsoning tide had mounted to her cheek thus mantled with blushes her countenance might gain something in beauty but it lost much of the peculiar charm which it derived from extreme transparency and whiteness of skina tint which set off to perfection the splendour of her magnificent black eyes with their darklyfringed lids and brows while it also relieved in an equal degree the jetty lustre of her hair her features were exquisitely chiselled delicate and classical in mould and stamped with refinement and intelligence perfect simplicity combined with a total absence of personal ornament distinguished her attire and her raven hair was plainly but by no means unbecomingly braided over her snowy forehead something in this simplicity of costume and in her manner inclined jocelyn to think the fair maiden must belong to some family professing puritanical opinions and he found upon inquiry from one of his neighbours in the throngan old farmerthat this was actually the case the young lady was mistress aveline calveley his informant said only child of master hugh calveley who had but lately come to dwell in tottenham and of whom little was known save that he was understood to have fought at the battle of langside and served with great bravery under essex both in spain and in ireland in the times of good queen besssuch times as england would never see again the old farmer parenthetically remarked with a shake of the head master hugh calveley he went on to say was a strict puritan austere in his life and morose in manner an open railer against the licence of the times and the profligacy of the court minionsin consequence of which he had more than once got himself into trouble he abhorred all such sports as were now going forward and had successfully interfered with the parish priest sir onesimus who was somewhat of a precisian himself to prevent the setting up the maypole on the past sundayfor which the farmer added some of the young folks owe him a grudge and he expressed a hope at the same time that the day might pass by without any exhibition being made of their illwill towards him these puritans are not in favour with our youth the old man said and no great marvel they be not for they check them in their pleasures and reprove them for harmless mirth now as to mistress aveline herself she is devout and good but she takes no part in the enjoyments proper to her years and leads a life more like a nun in a convent or a recluse in a cell than a marriageable young lady she never stirs forth without her father and as you may suppose goes more frequently to lecture or to church or to some conventicle than anywhere else such a life would not suit my grandchild gillian at all nevertheless mistress aveline is a sweet young lady much beloved for her kindness and goodness and her gentle words have healed many a wound occasioned by the harsh speech and severe reproofs of her father there siryou may behold her fair and saintly countenance now she seems pleased with the scene and i am sure she well may be for it is always a pleasant and a heartcheering sight to see folks happy and enjoying themselves and i cannot think that the beneficent power above ever intended we should make ourselves miserable on earth in order to win a place in heaven i am an old man sir and feeling this to be true i have ever inculcated my opinions upon my children and grandchildren yet i confess i am surprisedknowing what i do of her fathers characterthat mistress aveline should indulge herself with beholding this profane spectacle which ought by rights to be odious in her eyes the latter part of this speech was uttered with a sly chuckle on the part of the old farmer not altogether agreeable to jocelyn the growing interest he felt in the fair puritan rendered him susceptible the eyes of the two young persons had met again more than once and were not quite so quickly withdrawn on either side as before perhaps because aveline was less alarmed by the young mans appearance or more attracted by it and perhaps on his part because he had grown a little bolder we know not how this might be but we do know that the fair puritan had gradually advanced towards the front of the window and was now leaning slightly out of it so that her charms of face and figure were more fully revealed meanwhile the maypole had been planted and the first dance round it concluded at its close gillian quitting her post of honour near the tree and leaving the morricedancers and mummers to resume their merry rounds unsanctioned by her sovereign presence took a tambourine from one of the minstrels and proceeded to collect gratuities within it intended for the hired performers in the ceremony she was very successful in her efforts as the number of coins soon visible within the tambourine showed not without blushing and some hesitation did the may queen approach dick taverner the prentice made a pretence of fumbling in his pouch in order to prolong the interview which chance had thus procured him and after uttering all the complimentary phrases he could muster and looking a great deal more than he said he wound up his speech by declaring he would bestow a mark and that was no slight sum for the highest coin yet given was a silver groat upon the minstrels if they would play a lively dance for him and she the may queen would grace him with her hand in it encouraged by the laughter of the bystanders and doubtless entertaining no great dislike to the proposal gillian with a little affected coyness consented and the mark was immediately deposited in the tambourine by dick who transported by his success sprang from his saddle and committing his steed to the care of a youth near him whom he promised to reward for his trouble followed close after the may queen as she proceeded with her collection ere long she came to jocelyn and held out the tambourine towards him an idea just then occurred to the young man you have a pretty nosegay there fair maiden he said pointing to a bunch of pinks and other fragrant flowers in her breast i will buy it from you if you list you shall have it and welcome fair sir gillian replied detaching the bouquet from her dress and offering it to him well done gillian the old farmer cried approvingly ah are you there grandsire the may queen exclaimed come your gift for the minstrels and mummersquick quick and while old greenford searched for a small coin jocelyn placed a piece of silver in the tambourine will you do me a favour my pretty maiden he said courteously that i will right willingly fair sir she replied provided i may do it honestly you shall not do it else old greenford observed come your gift grandsireyou are slow in finding it have patience wench have patience young folks are always in a hurry here tis only a silver groat she exclaimed tossing her head why this young man behind me gave a mark and so did this gallant gentleman on horseback poh poh go along wench they will take better care of their money when they grow older stay my pretty maiden jocelyn cried you have promised to do me a favour what is it she inquired present this nosegay on my part to the young lady in yonder window what offer this to mistress aveline calveley gillian exclaimed in surprise are you sure she will accept it sir tut do his bidding child without more ado old greenford interposed i shall like to see what will come of itha ha gillian could not help smiling too and proceeded on her mission jocelyn put his horse into motion and slowly followed her almost expecting aveline to withdraw but he was agreeably disappointed by finding her maintain her place at the window she must have remarked what was going forward and therefore her tarrying emboldened him and buoyed up his hopes arrived beneath the window gillian committed the tambourine to dick taverner who still hovered behind her like her shadow and fastening the bouquet to the end of her shepherdesss crook held it up towards aveline crying out in a playful tone and with an arch look tis a love gift to mistress aveline calveley on the part of that young cavalier whether the offering thus presented would have been accepted may be questioned but it was never destined to reach her for whom it was intended scarcely was the flowerladen crook uplifted than a man of singularly stern aspect with gray hair cut close to the head grizzled beard and military habiliments of ancient make suddenly appeared behind aveline and seizing the nosegay cast it angrily and contemptuously forth so that it fell at jocelyns feet chapter xv hugh calveley jocelyn at once comprehended that the person who had thus dashed the nosegay to the ground could be no other than hugh calveley but all doubt on the point was removed by aveline herself who exclaimed in a reproachful toneo father what have you done what have i done the puritan rejoined speaking in a loud voice as if desirous that his words should reach the assemblage outside i have done that which thou thyself shouldst have done aveline i have signified my abhorrence of this vain ceremonial but wherefore do i find you here this is no fitting sight for any discreet maiden to witness and little did i think that daughter of mine would encourage such profane displays by her presence little did i think that you aveline would look on and smile while these ignorant and benighted folk set up their idol piping dancing and singing around it as the gentiles did at the dedications of their deities for it is an idol they have set up and they have become like the heathens worshippers of stocks and stones are we not expressly forbidden by the holy scriptures to make unto ourselves idols and graven images the sins of idolatry and superstition will assuredly provoke the divine displeasure and kindle the fire of its wrath as they did in the days of moses after the worshipping of the golden calf by the israelites thus spake offended heavenlet me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them grievously will the lord punish such as are guilty of these sins for hath he not declared as we read in leviticus i will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries to desolation and be assured o daughter that heavy judgments will descend upon the land if warning be not taken in time nay dear father i cannot view the matter in the same serious light that you do aveline rejoined neither do i think evil can be derived from pastimes like the present unless by the evil disposed i must frankly own that it is pleasant to me to witness such innocent enjoyment as is here exhibited while as to yon maypole with its pretty floral decorations i can never be brought to regard it as an emblem of superstition and idolatry nevertheless had you commanded me to refrain from the sight i would unhesitatingly have obeyed you but i thought i was free to follow my own inclinations why so you were child the puritan rejoined because i had full reliance on you and did not conceive you could have been so easily beguiled by satan i lament to find you cannot discern the superstition and wickedness lurking within this false though fairseeming spectacle do you not perceive that in setting up this wooden idol and worshipping it these people are returning to the dark and sinful practices of paganism of which it is an undoubted remnant if you cannot discern this i will make it manifest to you anon but i tell you now briefly he continued in a voice of thunder calculated to reach those at a distance that the ceremony is impious that those who take part in it are idolaters and that those who look on and approve are participators in the sin yea are equal in sin to the actors themselves hereupon some murmurs of displeasure arose among the crowd but they were instantly checked by the curiosity generally felt to hear avelines reply which was delivered in clear and gentle but distinct tones far be it from me to dispute with you dear father she said and it is with reluctance that i offer an opinion at all adverse to your own but it seems to me impossible to connect these pastimes with heathenish and superstitious rites for though they may bear some resemblance to ceremonials performed in honour of the goddesses maia and flora yet such creeds being utterly forgotten and their spirit extinct it cannot revive in sports that have merely reference to harmless enjoyment not one i am sure of these worthy folk has the slightest thought of impiety you know not what you say girl the puritan rejoined sharply the evil spirit is not extinct and these growing abominations prove it to be again raising its baleful crest to pollute and destroy listen to my words ye vain and foolish ones he continued advancing to the front of the window and stretching forth his arms towards the assemblage repent and amend your ways ere it be too late hew down the offensive idol which you term your maypole and cast it into the flames cease your wanton sports your noisy pipings your profane dances your filthy tipplings hear what the prophet isaiah saithwo to them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink and againwo to the drunkards of ephraim and i say wo unto you also for you are like unto those drunkards o do not this abominable thing that my soul hateth be not guilty of the brutish sin of drunkenness reflect on the words of holy jobthey take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ they spend their days in mirth and in a moment go down to the grave hew down your idol i say again consume it utterly and scatter its ashes to the winds strip off the gaudes and tinsel in which you have decked your foolish may queen have done with your senseless and profane mummeries and dismiss your robin hoods your friar tucks and your hobbyhorses silence your pestilent minstrels and depart peaceably to your own homes abandon your sinful courses or assuredly the lord will come upon you unawares and cut you in sunder and appoint your portion among unbelievers so sonorous was the voice of the puritan so impressive were his looks and gestures that his address commanded general attention while he continued to speak the sports were wholly stopped the minstrels left off playing to listen to him and the mummers suspended their merry evolutions round the maypole the poor denounced may queen who on the rejection of her nosegay had flown back to jocelyn now looked doubly disconcerted at this direct attack upon her and her finery and pouted her pretty lips in vexation dick taverner who stood by her side seemed disposed to resent the affront and shook his fist menacingly at the puritan jocelyn himself was perplexed and annoyed for though inclined to take part with the assemblage the growing interest he felt in aveline forbade all interference with her father chapter xvi of the sign given by the puritan to the assemblage meanwhile a great crowd had collected beneath the window and though no interruption was offered to the speaker it was easy to discern from the angry countenances of his hearers what was the effect of the address upon them when he had done hugh calveley folded his arms upon his breast and sternly regarded the assemblage he was wellstricken in years as his grizzled hair and beard denoted but neither was his strength impaired nor the fire of his eye dimmed squarely built with hard and somewhat massive features strongly stamped with austerity he was distinguished by a soldierlike deportment and manner while his bronzed countenance which bore upon it more than one cicatrice showed he must have been exposed to foreign suns and seen much service there was great determination about the mouth and about the physiognomy generally while at the same time there was something of the wildness of fanaticism in his looks he was habited in a buff jerkin with a brown lackered breastplate over it thighpieces of a similar colour and similar material and stout leathern boots a broad belt with a heavy sword attached to it crossed his breast and round his neck was a plain falling band you could not regard hugh calveley without feeling he was a man to die a martyr in any cause he had espoused a deep groan was now directed against him but it moved not a muscle of his rigid countenance jocelyn began to fear from the menacing looks of the crowd that some violence might be attempted and he endeavoured to check it bear with him worthy friends he cried he means you well though he may reprove you somewhat too sharply beshrew him for an envious railer cried a miller he mars all our pleasures with his peevish humours he would have us all as discontented with the world as himselfbut we know better he will not let us have our lawful sports as enjoined by the king himself on sundays and he now tries to interfere with our recreations on holidays a pest upon him for a cankerbitten churl his sullen looks are enough to turn all the cream in the village sour observed an old dame why doth he not betake himself to the conventicle and preach there old greenford cried why should we have all these bitter texts of scripture thrown at our heads why should we be likened to the drunkards of ephraim because we drink our whitsunales i have tasted nothing more than my morning cup as yet why should our maypole be termed an idol answer me that good grandsire gillian demanded nay let him who called it so answer thee child for i cannot the old farmer rejoined i can see naught idolatrous in it why should our pretty may queen be despoiled of her ornaments because they please not his fanatical taste dick taverner demanded for my part i can discern no difference between a puritan and a knave and i would hang both this sally met with a favourable reception from the crowd and a voice exclaimeday hang all knavish puritans again hugh calveley lifted up his voice think not to make me afraid he cried i have confronted armed hosts with boldness when engaged in a worse cause than this and i am not likely to give way before a base rabble now that i have become a soldier of christ and fight his battles i repeat my warnings to you and will not hold my peace till you give heed to them continue not in the sins of the gentiles lest their punishment come upon you these are fearful times we live in london is become another nineveh and will be devoured by flames like that great city it is full of corruption and debauchery of oppressions thefts and deceits with the prophet nahum i exclaimwo to the city it is full of lies and robbery what griping usury what extortion are practised within it what fraud what injustice what misrule but the lords anger will be awakened against it palaces of kings are of no more account in his eyes than cottages of peasantshe cutteth off the spirits of princes he is terrible to the kings of the earth he knoweth no difference between them that sit on thrones and those that go from door to door for what saith the prophet isaiahi will punish the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks let the great ones of the land be warned as well as the meanest or judgment will come upon them methinks that smacks of treason cried dick taverner our puritan has quitted us poor fowl to fly at higher game hark ye sir he added to hugh calveley you would not dare utter such words as those in the kings presence thou art mistaken friend the other rejoined it is my purpose to warn him in terms strong as those i have just used why should i hold my peace when i have a mission from on high i shall speak to the king as nathan spoke to david he speaks like a prophet cried the miller i begin to have faith in him no doubt the iniquities of london are fearful if he preach against extortioners and usurers only i am with him dick taverner said if he rid london of sir giles mompesson and his peers he will do good servicestill better if he will put down corruption and injustice as exhibited in the court of starchambereh master jocelyn mounchensey at the mention of this name the puritan appeared greatly surprised and looked round inquiringly till his eye alighted upon the young man after regarding him for a moment fixedly he demandedart thou jocelyn mounchensey the young man equally surprised replied in the affirmative the son of sir ferdinando mounchensey of massingham in norfolk inquired the puritan the same jocelyn answered thy father was my nearest and dearest friend young man hugh calveley said and thy fathers son shall be welcome to my dwelling enter i pray of you yet pause for a moment i have a word more to declare to these people ye heed not my words and make a mock of me he continued addressing the assemblage but i will give you a sign that i have spoken the truth he will bring the devil among us i trow cried dick taverner tis to be hoped he will not split the maypole with a thunderbolt said the miller nor spoil our whitsunales cried old greenford nor lame our hobbyhorse said one of the mummers nor rob me of my wreath and garlands said gillian that he shall not i promise you fair may queen dick tavernor rejoined gallantly i will do none of these things i would not harm you even if i had the power the puritan said but i will discharge a bolt against the head of yon idol he added pointing towards the flowercrowned summit of the maypole and if i break its neck and cast it down ye will own that a higher hand than mine directs the blow and that the superstitious symbol ought not to be left standing as to what we may do or what we may acknowledge we will give no promise master hugh calveley rejoined old greenford but een let fly thy bolt if thou wilt some dissent was offered to this singular proposition but the majority of voices overruled it and withdrawing for a moment hugh calveley returned with an arbalist which he proceeded deliberately to arm in view of the crowd and then placed a quarrel within it in the name of the lord who cast down the golden idol made by aaron and the israelites i launch this bolt he cried as he took aim and liberated the cord the short ironheaded squarepointed arrow whizzed through the air and by the mischief it did as it hit its mark seemed to confirm the puritans denunciation striking the maypole precisely at the summit it shattered the wood and brought down the floral crown surmounting it as well as the topmost streamers the spectators stared aghast be warned by this thundered hugh calveley with gloomy triumph your idol is smittennot by my hand but by his who will chastise your wickedness whereupon he closed the window and departed presently afterwards the door was opened by an old gravelooking decentlyclad servingman addressing jocelyn who had already dismounted and given his horse in charge to the youth engaged for a similar purpose by dick taverner this personage invited him in his masters name to enter and with a heart throbbing with emotion the young man complied chance seemed to befriend him in a way he could never have anticipated and he now hoped to obtain an interview with aveline his conductor led him through a passage to a large chamber at the back of the house with windows looking upon a garden the room was panelled with dark shining oak had a polished floor an immense chimneypiece and a moulded ceiling within it were a few highbacked chairs and some other cumbrous furniture while on an oak table at the side was spread the simple morning repast of the puritan and his daughter but all these things were lost upon jocelyn who had eyes only for one object she was there and how lovely she appeared how exquisite in figurehow faultless in feature some little embarrassment was discoverable in her manner as the young man entered but it quickly disappeared her father was with her and advancing towards jocelyn he took him kindly by the hand and bade him welcome then without relinquishing his grasp he presented the young man to his daughter saying this is jocelyn the son of my dear departed friend sir ferdinando mounchensey some inscrutable design of providence has brought him hither and right glad i am to behold him years ago his father rendered me a signal service which i requited as i best could and there is nothing i would not gladly do for the son of such a friend you will esteem him accordingly aveline i will not fail in my duty father she replied blushing slightly and jocelyn thought these words were the sweetest he had ever heard pronounced i would pray you to break your fast with us if our simple fare will content you said hugh calveley pointing to the table i am not overdainty and shall do ample justice to whatever is set before me jocelyn replied smiling it is well said the puritan i am glad to find the son of my old friend is not a slave to his appetites as are most of the young men of this generation with this they approached the board and a lengthy grace being pronounced by hugh calveley jocelyn sat down by the side of aveline scarcely able to believe in the reality of his own happinessso like a dream it seemed chapter xvii a rash promise during the slender repast jocelyn in reply to the inquiries of the puritan explained the twofold motive of his coming to london namely the desire of taking vengeance on his fathers enemies and the hope of obtaining some honourable employment such as a gentleman might accept my chances in the latter respect are not very great he said seeing i have no powerful friends to aid me in my endeavours and i must consequently trust to fortune but as regards my enemies if i can only win an audience of the king and plead my cause before him i do not think he will deny me justice justice exclaimed the puritan with deep scorn james stuart knows it not an archhypocrite and perfidious as hypocritical he holdeth as a maxim that dissimulation is necessary to a ruler he has the cowardice and the ferocity of the hyaena he will promise fairly but his deeds will falsify his words recollect how his judas kiss betrayed somerset recollect his conduct towards the gowries but imagine not because you have been evil intreated and oppressed that the king will redress your wrongs and reinstate you in your fallen position rather will he take part with the usurers and extortioners who have deprived you of your inheritance how many poor wretches doth he daily condemn to the same lingering agonies and certain destruction that he doomed your father lamentable as is the good sir ferdinandos case it stands not alone it is one of many and many many more will be added to the list if this tyrannical herodias be suffered to govern and as if goaded by some stinging thought that drove him nigh distracted hugh calveley arose and paced to and fro within the chamber his brow became gloomier and his visage sterner bear with him good master jocelyn aveline said in a low tone he hath been unjustly treated by the king and as you see can ill brook the usage bear with him i pray of you jocelyn had no time to make reply suddenly checking himself and fixing his earnest gaze upon the young man the puritan said give ear to me my son if i desired to inflame your breast with rage against this tyrant i should need only to relate one instance of his cruelty and injustice i had a frienda very dear friend he continued in a tone of deep pathosconfined within the fleet prison by a decree of the starchamber he was to me as a brother and to see him gradually pining away cut me to the soul proud by nature he refused to abase himself to his oppressor and could not be brought to acknowledge wrongs he had never committed pardon therefore was denied himnot pardon merely but all mitigation of suffering my friend had been wealthy but heavy fines and penalties had stripped him of his possessions and brought him to destitution lord of an ancient hall with woods and lands around it wherein he could ride for hours without quitting his own domains his territories were now narrowed to a few yards while one dark dreary chamber was alone accorded him finding he must necessarily perish if left to rot there i prevailed upon him not without much reluctance on his part to petition the king for liberation and was myself the bearer of his prayer earnestly pleading the cause of the unfortunate man and representing his forlorn condition i besought his majestys gracious intercession but when i had wearied the royal ear with entreaties the sharp reply wasdoth he make submission will he confess his offence and as i could only affirm that as he was guilty of no crime so he could confess none the king returned me the petition coldly observingthe dignity of our court of starchamber must be maintained before all things he hath been guilty of contempt towards it and must purge him of the offence but the man will die sire i urged if he be not removed from the fleet his prisonlodging is near a foul ditch and he is sick with fever neither can he have such aid of medicine or of nursing as his case demands the greater reason he should relieve himself by speedy acknowledgment of the justice of his sentence said the king the matter rests not with us but with himself but he is a gentleman sire i persisted to whom truth is dearer than life and who would rather languish in misery for thrice the term he is likely to last than forfeit his own selfesteem by admitting falsehood and injustice then let him perish in his pride and obstinacy cried the king impatiently and thereupon he dismissed me o sir exclaimed jocelyn rising and throwing his arms round the puritans neck you then were the friend who tended my poor father in his last moments heaven bless you for it yes jocelyn it was i who heard your fathers latest sigh the puritan replied returning his embrace and your own name was breathed with it his thoughts were of his son far awaytoo young to share his distresses or to comprehend them alas alas cried jocelyn mournfully lament not for your father jocelyn said the puritan solemnly he is reaping the reward of his earthly troubles in heaven be comforted i say the tyrant can no longer oppress him he is beyond the reach of his malice he can be arraigned at no more unjust tribunals he is where no cruel and perfidious princes no iniquitous judges no griping extortioners shall ever enter jocelyn endeavoured to speak but his emotion overpowered him i have already told you that your father rendered me a service impossible to be adequately requited pursued the puritan what that service was i will one day inform you suffice it now that it bound me to him in chains firmer than brass willingly would i have laid down my life for him if he had desired it gladly would i have taken his place in the fleet prison if that could have procured him liberation unable to do either i watched over him while he livedand buried him when dead o sir you have bound me to you as strongly as you were bound to my father cried jocelyn for the devotion shown to him i hold myself eternally your debtor the puritan regarded him steadfastly for a moment what if i were to put these professions to the test he asked do so jocelyn replied earnestly my life is yours your life exclaimed hugh calveley grasping his arm almost fiercely while his eye blazed consider what you offer i need not consider jocelyn rejoined i repeat my life is yours if you demand it perhaps i shall demand it cried hugh calveley ere long perhaps demand it when you will jocelyn said father aveline interposed do not let the young man bind himself by this promise release him i pray of you the promise cannot be recalled my child the puritan replied but i shall never claim its fulfilment save for some high and holy purpose are you sure your purpose is holy father aveline said in a low tone what mean you child cried hugh calveley knitting his brows i am but an instrument in the hands of heaven appointed to do its work and as directed so i must act heaven may make me the scourge of the oppressor and evildoer or the sword to slay the tyrant i may die a martyr for my faith or do battle for it with carnal weapons for all these i am ready resigning myself to the will of god is it for nothing thinkst thou that this young manthe son of my dear departed friendhas been brought hither at this particular conjuncture is it for nothing that wholly unsolicited he has placed his life at my disposal and in doing so has devoted himself to a great cause like myself he hath wrongs to avenge and the lord of hosts will give him satisfaction but not in the way you propose father aveline rejoined heaven will assuredly give you both satisfaction for the wrongs you have endured but it must choose its own means of doing so and its own time it hath chosen the means and the time is coming quickly cried the puritan his eye again kindling with fanatical light the lord will cut off from israel head and tail these things are riddles to me observed jocelyn who had listened to what was passing with great uneasiness i would solicit an explanation you shall have it my son hugh calveley replied but not now my hour for solitary prayer and selfcommunion is come and i must withdraw to my chamber go forth into the garden jocelynand do thou attend him aveline i will join you when my devotions are ended so saying he quitted the room while the youthful pair went forth as enjoined chapter xviii how the promise was cancelled it was a large garden once fairly laid out and planted but now sadly neglected the broad terrace walk was overgrown with weeds the stone steps and the carved balusters were broken in places and covered with moss the once smooth lawn was unconscious of the scythe the parterres had lost their quaint devices and the knots of flowerstrefoil cinquefoil diamond and crossbowwere no longer distinguishable in their original shapes the labyrinths of the maze were inextricably tangled and the long green alleys wanted clearing out but all this neglect passed unnoticed by jocelyn so completely was he engrossed by the fair creature at his side even the noise of the may games which temporarily interrupted by hugh calveley had recommenced with greater vigour than everthe ringing of the church bells the shouts of the crowd and the sounds of the merry minstrelsy scarcely reached his ear for the first time he experienced those delicious sensations which newborn love excites within the breast and the enchantment operated upon him so rapidly and so strongly that he was overpowered by its spell almost before aware of it it seemed that he had never really lived till this moment never at least comprehended the bliss afforded by existence in the companionship of a being able to awaken the transports he now experienced a new world seemed suddenly opened to him full of love hope sunshine of which he and aveline were the sole inhabitants hitherto his life had been devoid of any great emotion the one feeling latterly pervading it had been a sense of deep wrong coupled with the thirst of vengeance no tenderer influence had softened his almost rugged nature and his breast continued arid as the desert now the rock had been stricken and the living waters gushed forth abundantly not that in norfolk and even in the remote part of the county where his life had been passed female beauty was rare nowhere indeed is the flower of loveliness more thickly sown than in that favoured part of our isle but all such young damsels as he had beheld had failed to move him and if any shaft had been aimed at his breast it had fallen wide of the mark jocelyn mounchensey was not one of those highly susceptible naturesquick to receive an impression quicker to lose it neither would he have been readily caught by the lures spread for youth by the designing of the sex imbued with something of the antique spirit of chivalry which yet though but slightly influenced the age in which he lived he was ready and able to pay fervent homage to his mistresss sovereign beauty supposing he had one and maintain its supremacy against all questioners but utterly incapable of worshipping at any meaner shrine heartwhole therefore when he encountered the puritans daughter he felt that in her he had found an object he had long sought to whom he could devote himself heart and soul a maiden whose beauty was without peer and whose mental qualities corresponded with her personal attractions nor was it a delusion under which he laboured aveline calveley was all his imagination painted her purity of heart gentleness of disposition intellectual endowments were as clearly revealed by her speaking countenance as the innermost depths of a fountain are by the pellucid medium through which they are viewed hers was a virgin heart which like his own had received no previous impression love for her father alone had swayed her though all strong demonstrations of filial affection had been checked by that fathers habitually stern manner brought up by a female relative in cheshire who had taken charge of her on her mothers death which had occurred during her infancy she had known little of her father till late years when she had come to reside with him and though devout by nature she could ill reconcile herself to the gloomy notions of religion he entertained or to the ascetic mode of life he practised with no desire to share in the pomps and vanities of life she could not be persuaded that cheerfulness was incompatible with righteousness nor could all the railings she heard against them make her hate those who differed from her in religious opinions still she made no complaint entirely obedient to her fathers will she accommodated herself as far as she could to the rule of life prescribed by him aware of his pertinacity of opinion she seldom or ever argued a point with him even if she thought right might be on her side holding it better to maintain peace by submission than to hazard wrath by disputation the discussion on the may games was an exception to her ordinary conduct and formed one of the few instances in which she had ventured to assert her own opinion in opposition to that of her father of late indeed she had felt great uneasiness about him much changed he seemed occupied by some dark dread thought which partially revealed itself in wrathful exclamations and muttered menaces he seemed to believe himself chosen by heaven as an instrument of vengeance against oppression and her fears were excited lest he might commit some terrible act under this fatal impression she was the more confirmed in the idea from the eagerness with which he had grasped at jocelyns rash promise and she determined to put the young man upon his guard if in order to satisfy the readers curiosity we are obliged to examine the state of avelines heart in reference to jocelyn we must state candidly that no such ardent flame was kindled within it as burnt in the breast of the young man that such a flame might arise was very possible nay even probable seeing that the sparks of love were there and material for combustion was by no means wanting all that was required was that those sparks should be gently fannednot heedlessly extinguished little was said by the two young persons as they slowly paced the terrace both felt embarrassed jocelyn longing to give utterance to his feelings but restrained by timidityaveline trembling lest more might be said than she ought to hear or if obliged to hear than she could rightly answer thus they walked on in silence but it was a silence more eloquent than words since each comprehended what the other felt how much they would have said was proclaimed by the impossibility they found of saying anything at length jocelyn stopped and plucking a flower observed as he proffered it for her acceptance my first offering to you was rejected may this be more fortunate make me a promise and i will accept it she replied willingly cried jocelyn venturing to take her hand and gazing at her tenderly most willingly you are far too ready to promise she rejoined with a sad sweet smile what i desire is this recall your hasty pledge to my father and aid me in dissuading him from the enterprise in which he would engage you as the words were uttered the puritan stepped from behind the alley which had enabled him to approach them unperceived and overhear their brief converse hold he exclaimed in a solemn tone and regarding jocelyn with great earnestness that promise is sacred it was made in a fathers name and must be fulfilled as to my purpose it is unchangeable the enthusiasts influence over jocelyn would have proved irresistible but for the interposition of aveline be not controlled by him she said in a low tone to the young man adding to her father for my sake let the promise be cancelled let him ask it and it shall be rejoined the puritan gazing steadily at the young man as if he would penetrate his soul do you hesitate he cried in accents of deep disappointment perceiving jocelyn waver you cannot misunderstand his wishes father said aveline let him speak for himself hugh calveley exclaimed angrily jocelyn mounchensey he continued folding his arms upon his breast and regarding the young man fixedly as before son of my old friend son of him who died in my arms son of him whom i committed to the earth if thou hast aught of thy fathers true spirit thou wilt rigidly adhere to a pledge voluntarily given and which uttered as it was uttered by thee has all the sanctity all the binding force of a vow before heaven where it is registered and approved by him who is gone before us greatly moved by this appeal jocelyn might have complied with it but aveline again interposed not so father she cried the spirits of the just made perfectand of such is the friend you mentionwould never approve of the design with which you would link this young man in consequence of a promise rashly made discharge him from it i entreat you her energy shook even the puritans firmness be it as thou wilt daughter he said after the pause of a few moments during which he waited for jocelyn to speak but as the young man said nothing he rightly interpreted his silencebe it as thou wilt since he too wills it so i give him back his promise but let me see him no more sir i beseech you cried jocelyn but he was cut short by the puritan who turning from him contemptuously said to his daughterlet him depart immediately aveline signed to the young man to go but finding him remain motionless she took him by the hand and led him some way along the terrace then releasing her hold she bade him farewell wherefore have you done this inquired jocelyn reproachfully question me not but be satisfied i have acted for the best she replied o jocelyn she continued anxiously if an opportunity should occur to you of serving my father do not neglect it be assured i will not the young man replied shall we not meet again he asked in a tone of deepest anxiety perhaps she answered but you must go my father will become impatient again farewell on this they separated the young man sorrowfully departing while her footsteps retreated in the opposite direction meanwhile the may games went forward on the green with increased spirit and merriment and without the slightest hinderance more than once the mummers had wheeled their mazy rounds with gillian and dick taverner footing it merrily in the midst of them more than once the audacious prentice now become desperately enamoured of his pretty partner had ventured to steal a kiss from her lips more than once he had whispered words of love in her ear though as yet he had obtained no tender response onceand once onlyhad he taken her hand but then he had never quitted it afterwards in vain other swains claimed her for a dance dick refused to surrender his prize they breakfasted together in a little bower made of green boughs the most delightful and loverlike retreat imaginable dicks appetite furious an hour ago was now clean gone he could eat nothing he subsisted on love alone but as she was prevailed upon to sip from a foaming tankard of whitsun ale he quaffed the remainder of the liquid with rapture this done they resumed their merry sports and began to dance again the bells continued to ring blithely the assemblage to shout and the minstrels to play a strange contrast to what was passing in the puritans garden chapter xix theobalds palace the magnificent palace of theobalds situated near cheshunt in hertfordshire originally the residence of the great lord treasurer burleigh and the scene of his frequent and sumptuous entertainments to queen elizabeth and the ambassadors to her court when she was seen says stow in as great royalty and served as bountifully and magnificently as at any other time or place all at his lordships charge with rich shows pleasant devices and all manner of sports to the great delight of her majesty and her whole train with great thanks from all who partook of it and as great commendations from all that heard of it abroadthis famous and delightful palace with its stately gardens wherein elizabeth had so often walked and held converse with her faithful counsellor and its noble parks and chases well stocked with deer wherein she had so often hunted came into possession of james the first in the manner we shall proceed to relate some years before the date of this history james first made acquaintance with theobalds during his progress from scotland to assume the english crown and it was the last point at which he halted before entering the capital of his new dominions here for four days he and his crowd of noble attendants were guests of sir robert cecil afterwards earl of salisbury who proved himself the worthy son of his illustrious and hospitable sire by entertaining the monarch and his numerous train in the same princely style that the lord treasurer had ever displayed towards queen elizabeth an eyewitness has described the kings arrival at theobalds on this occasion thus then says john savile for his majestys coming up the walk there came before him some of the nobility barons knights esquires gentlemen and others amongst whom was the sheriff of essex and most of his men the trumpets sounding next before his highness sometimes one sometimes another his majesty riding not continually betwixt the same two but sometimes one sometimes another as seemed best to his highness the whole nobility of our land and scotland round about him observing no place of superiority all bareheaded all of whom alighted from their horses at their entrance into the first court save only his majesty alone who rid along still four noblemen laying their hands upon his steed two before and two behind in this manner he came to the court door where i myself stood at the entrance into that court stood many noblemen amongst whom was sir robert cecil who there meeting his majesty conducted him into his house all which was practised with as great applause of the people as could be hearty prayer and throwing up of hats his majesty had not stayed above an hour in his chamber but hearing the multitude throng so fast into the uppermost court to see his highness he showed himself openly out of his chamber window by the space of half an hour together after which time he went into the labyrinthlike garden to walk where he secreted himself in the meanders compact of bays rosemary and the like overshadowing his walk to defend him from the heat of the sun till supper time at which was such plenty of provision for all sorts of men in their due places as struck me with admiration and first to begin with the ragged regiments and such as were debarred the privilege of any court these were so sufficiently rewarded with beef veal mutton bread and beer that they sung holiday every day and kept a continual feast as for poor maimed and distressed soldiers which repaired thither for maintenance the wine money and meat which they had in very bounteous sort hath become a sufficient spur to them to blaze it abroad since their coming to london the reader will marvel at the extraordinary and unstinting hospitality practised in those days which as we have shown was exhibited to all comers irrespective of rank even to the ragged regiments and which extended its bounties in the shape of alms to the wounded and disabled veteran we find no parallel to it in modern times theobalds produced a highly favourable impression upon james who passionately attached to the chase saw in its wellstocked parks the means of gratifying his tastes to the fullest extent its contiguity to enfield chase was also a great recommendation and its situation beautiful in itself was retired and yet within easy distance of the metropolis it appeared to him to combine all the advantages of a royal huntingseat with all the splendours of a palace and his predilections were confirmed by a second visit paid by him to it in when he was accompanied by his brotherinlaw christianus king of denmark and when the two monarchs were gloriously entertained by the earl of salisbury the danish king drank inordinately so did the whole of his suite and they soon inoculated the english court with their sottish tastes bonnie king jamie himself got fou twice aday and melancholy to relate the ladies of the court followed the royal example and abandoning their sobriety were seen to roll about in intoxication so says sir john harington who has given a very diverting account of the orgies at theobalds and the inebriate extravagances of christianus one day writes sir john a great feast was held and after dinner the representation of solomons temple and the coming of the queen of sheba was made or as i may better say was meant to have been made before their majesties by device of the earl of salisbury and others but alas as all earthly things do fail to poor mortals in enjoyment so did prove our presentment thereof the lady that did play the queens part did carry most precious gifts to both their majesties but forgetting the steps arising to the canopy overset her casket into his danish majestys lap and fell at his feet though i rather think it was into his face much was the hurry and confusion cloths and napkins were at hand to make all clean his majesty then got up and would dance with the queen of sheba but he fell down and humbled himself before her and was carried to an inner chamber and laid on a bed of state the entertainment and show went forward and most of the presenters went backward or fell down wine did so occupy their upper chambers worthy sir john seems to have been greatly scandalized as he well might be at these shameless proceedings and he exclaims pathetically the danes have again conquered the britons for i see no man or woman either that can command himself or herself nor does he fail to contrast these strange pageantries with what occurred of the same sort in the same place in queen elizabeths time observing i never did see such lack of good order discretion and sobriety as i have now done having set his heart upon theobalds james offered the earl of salisbury in exchange for it the palace and domains of hatfield and the proposal being accepted it could not very well be refused the delivery of the muchcoveted place was made on the nd may the prince joinville brother to the duke de guise being present on the occasion where fresh festivities were held accompanied by an indifferent masque from ben jonson whether the king or the earl had the best of the bargain we are not prepared to decide enchanted with his acquisition james commenced the work of improvement and embellishment by enlarging the park appropriating a good slice of enfield chace with parts of northaw and cheshunt commons and surrounding the whole with a high brick wall ten miles in circumference within this ring he found ample scope for the indulgence of his hunting propensities since it contained an almost inexhaustible stock of the finest deer in the kingdom and within it might be heard the sound of his merry horn and the baying of his favourite staghounds whenever he could escape from the cares of state or the toils of the councilchamber his escapes from these demands upon his time were so frequent and the attraction of the woods of theobalds so irresistible that remonstrances were made to him on the subject but they proved entirely ineffectual he declared he would rather return to scotland than forego his amusements theobalds in the time of its grandeur might be styled the fontainebleau of england though not to be compared with windsor castle in grandeur of situation or magnificence of forest scenery still it was a stately residence and worthy of the monarch of a mighty country crowned with four square towers of considerable height and magnitude each with a lion and vane on the top it had besides a large lanternshaped central turret proudly domineering over the others and made with timber of excellent workmanship curiously wrought with divers pinnacles at each corner wherein were hung twelve bells for chimage and a clock with chimes of sundry work the whole structure was built says the survey of excellent brick with coigns jambs and cornices of stone approached from the south by a noble avenue of trees planted in double rows and a mile in length it presented a striking and most picturesque appearance with its lofty towers its great gilded vanes supported as we have said by lions its crowd of twisted chimnies its leaded and arched walks its balconies and its immense bay windows nor did it lose its majestic and beautiful aspect as you advanced nearer and its vast proportions became more fully developed then you perceived its grand though irregular facades its enormous gates its cloistered walks and its superb gardens and comprehended that with its five courts and the countless apartments they contained to say nothing of the world of offices that the huge edifice comprised a town within itselfand a wellpeopled town too the members of the household and the various retainers connected with it were multitudinous as the rooms themselves one charm and peculiarity of the palace visible from without consisted in the arched walks before referred to placed high up on the building on every side screened from the weather these walks looked upon the different courts and gardens and commanded extensive views of the lovely sylvan scenery around hence cheshunt and waltham abbey enfield and other surrounding villages could be distinguished through the green vistas of the park on the south facing the grand avenue was a large open cloister built upon several large fair pillars of stone arched over with seven arches with a fair rail and balusters well painted with the kings and queens of england and the pedigree of the old lord burleigh and divers other ancient families the body of the palace consisted of two large quadrangles one of which eightysix feet square was denominated the fountain court from the circumstance of a fountain of black and white marble standing within it the other quadrangle somewhat larger being one hundred and ten feet square was called the middle court in addition to these there were three other smaller courts respectively entitled the dial court the buttery court and the dovehouse court wherein the offices were situated on the east side of the fountain court stood an arched cloister and on the groundfloor there was a spacious hall paved with marble and embellished with a curiouslycarved ceiling adjoining it were the apartments assigned to the earl of salisbury as keeper of theobalds the councilchamber and the chambers of sir lewis lewkener master of the ceremonies and sir john finett above was the presencechamber wainscotted with oak painted in livercolour and gilded having rich pendents from the ceiling and vast windows resplendent with armorial bearings near this were the privychamber and the kings bedchamber together with a wide gallery one hundred and twentythree feet in length wainscotted and roofed like the presencechamber but yet more gorgeously fretted and painted its walls were ornamented with stags heads with branching antlers on the upper floor were the rooms assigned to the duke of lennox as lord chamberlain and close to them was one of the external leaded walks before alluded to sixtytwo feet longand eleven wide which from its eminent position carried the gaze to ware in the middlecourt were the queens apartments comprising her chapel presencechamber and other rooms and over them a gallery nearly equal in length to that reserved for the king in this quadrangle also were prince charless lodgings over the latter was the green gallery one hundred and nine feet in length and proportionately wide and above the gallery was another external covered walk wherein were two lofty arches of brick of no small ornament to the house and rendering it comely and pleasant to all that passed by the gardens were enchanting and in perfect keeping with the palace occupying several acres they seemed infinitely larger than they were since they abounded in intricate alleys labyrinths and mazes so that you were easily lost within them and sometimes wanted a clue to come forth they contained some fine canals fountains and statues in addition to the great gardens were the priorygardens with other inclosures for pheasants aviaries and menageries for james was very fond of wild beasts and had a collection of them worthy of a zoological garden in one of his letters to buckingham when the latter was at madrid we find him inquiring about the elephant camels and wild asses he had always a camelhouse at theobalds to close our description we may add that the tenniscourt manege stable kennels and falconry were on a scale of magnitude proportionate to the palace beneath the widespreading branches of a noble elm forming part of the great avenue and standing at a short distance from the principal entrance to the palace were collected together one pleasant afternoon in may a small group of persons consisting almost entirely of the readers acquaintances chief amongst them was jocelyn mounchensey who having dismounted and fastened his horse to the branch was leaning against the large trunk of the tree contemplating the magnificent structure we have attempted to describe unacquainted as yet with its internal splendours he had no difficulty in comprehending them from what he beheld from without the entrance gates were open and a wide archway beyond leading to the great quadrangle gave him a view of its beautiful marble fountain in the midst ornamented with exquisite statues of venus and cupid numerous officers of the household pages ushers and servingmen in the royal liveries with now and then some personage of distinction were continually passing across the fountain court gaily attired courtiers in doublets of satin and mantles of velvet were lounging in the balconies of the presencechamber staring at jocelyn and his companions for want of better occupation other young nobles accompanied by richlyhabited damessome of them the highestborn and loveliest in the landwere promenading to and fro upon the garden terrace on the right chattering and laughing loudly there was plenty of life and movement everywhere even in the lord chamberlains walk which as we have said was contrived in the upper part of the structure and formed a sort of external gallery three persons might be discerned and to save the reader any speculation we will tell him that these persons were the duke of lennox lord chamberlain the conde de gondomar the spanish liegerambassador and the lord roos in front of the great gates were stationed four warders with the royal badge woven in gold on the front and back of their crimson doublets with roses in their velvet hats roses in their buskins and halberts over their shoulders just within the gates stood a gigantic porter a full head and shoulders taller than the burly warders themselves from the summit of the lofty central tower of the palace floated the royal banner discernible by all the country round on the other side of the tree against which jocelyn was leaning and looking down the long avenue rather than towards the palace stood dick taverner who however bestowed little attention upon his master being fully occupied by a more attractive object close at hand dickon it appeared had succeeded in inducing gillian greenford to accompany him in the expedition to theobalds and as the fair damsel could not of course go alone she had cajoled her goodnatured old grandsire into conveying her thither and she was now seated behind him upon a pillion placed on the back of a strong roughcoated horse dick was in raptures at his success the ride from tottenham had been delightful they had tarried for a short time to drink a cup of ale at the bell at edmonton where dick meant to have breakfasted though chance had so agreeably prevented him and where the liquor was highly approved by the old farmer who became thenceforth exceedingly chatty and talked of nothing else but good queen bess and her frequent visits to theobalds in the old lord burleighs time during the rest of the journey little heed was paid to his garrulity by the young couple they let him talk on feigning to listen but in reality noting scarce a word he said as they entered the park of theobalds however they found their tongues and gillian became loud in her admiration of the beautiful glades that opened before them and of the dappled denizens of the wood that tripped lightsomely across the sward or hurried towards the thickets the park indeed looked beautiful with its fine oaks in their freshlyopened foliage of the tenderest green its numerous spreading beeches its scattered thorns white with blossom and the young fern just springing from the seed in the brakes no wonder gillian was delighted dick was equally enchanted and regretted he was not like king james master of a great park that he might hunt within it at his pleasure of course if he had been king gillian would naturally have been his queen and have hunted with him old greenford too admired the scene and could not but admit that the park was improved though he uttered something like a groan as he thought that queen elizabeth and the lord treasurer could be seen in it no longer after riding for a couple of miles along a road which led them over beautifully undulating ground affording glimpses of every variety of forest scenerysometimes plunging them into the depths of groves where the path was covered by overarching treessometimes crossing the open chace studded by single aged oaks of the largest sizesometimes skirting the margin of a pool fringed with flags reeds and bulrushes for the protection of the waterfowlnow passing the large heronry to the strict preservation of which james attached the utmost importance they at length approached the long avenue leading to the palace at its entrance they found jocelyn waiting for them the young man who cared not for their company had ridden on in advance the strange events of the morning gave him plenty of material for reflection and he longed to commune with himself accordingly when the others stopped at edmonton he quitted them promising to halt till they came up before entering the precincts of the palace if his ride was not so agreeable as theirs it at least enabled him to regain in some degree his composure of mind which had been greatly disturbed by his abrupt parting with aveline her image was constantly before him and refusing to be dismissed connected itself with every object he beheld at first he despaired of meeting her again but as he gradually grew calmer his hopes revived and difficulties which seemed insuperable began to disperse by the time dick taverner and his companions came up he felt some disposition to talk and gillians hearty merriment and high spirits helped to enliven him having ascertained from one of the royal keepers whom he had encountered that the king with a large company was out hawking on the banks of the new river which was cut through the park and that he would in all probability return through the great avenue to the palace he proposed that they should station themselves somewhere within it in order to see him pass this arrangement pleased all parties so proceeding slowly up the avenue they took up a position as described more than an hour however elapsed and still james who no doubt was pleased with his sport came not without being aware of their high quality or having the slightest notion that the conde gondomar was one of them jocelyn had remarked the three personages in the lord chamberlains walk he had seen them pause and apparently look towards the little group of which he himself formed part shortly after this two of the party retired leaving the third alone in the gallery byandby these two individuals were seen to cross the fountain court and passing through the great gates to direct their steps towards the avenue as they approached jocelyn recognised one of them as lord roos whom he had seen play so singular a part at madame bonaventures ordinary the other was wholly unknown to him but that he was a person of the utmost distinction he felt convinced as well from his haughty bearing and sumptuous attire as from the evident respect paid him by his companion in stature he was rather short being somewhat under the ordinary standard but his figure was admirably proportioned and was displayed to the greatest advantage by his rich habiliments his doublet was of seagreen satin embroidered with silver and black with rich open sleeves and his spanish cloak was of velvet of the same colour and similarly embroidered his hose were of tawny silk and the plumes in his bonnet black striped with white he was decorated with the order of the golden fleece and bore at his side a genuine blade of toledo with a handle of rarest workmanship bound his throat he wore a large triple ruff edged with pointed lace his face was oval in shape his complexion of a rich olive hue his eyes large dark and keen his features singularly handsome and his looks penetrating his hair was ravenblack cut short and removed from the forehead lord roos and his companion passed close to jocelyn without appearing to notice him but they halted before gillian regarding her with insolent admiration evidently she was the object that had brought them forth the poor damsel was terribly confused by their ardent glances and libertine scrutiny and blushed to her very temples as to dick taverner he trembled with rage and jealousy and began to repent having brought his treasure into such a dangerous neighbourhood the person who seemed to be most struck with gillians charms was the wearer of the spanish mantle en verdad he exclaimed that is the loveliest piece of rusticity i have seen since i came to england i thought mine eyes did not deceive me as to her beauty when i caught sight of her from the lord chamberlains gallery the conde de gondomar hath ever an eagles eye for a pretty woman lord roos replied laughing the conde de gondomar mentally ejaculated jocelyn who had overheard what he said why this is he to whom the ring must be shown the opportunity must not be lost accordingly regardless of the impropriety of the proceeding he uncovered his head and advancing towards the spaniard said i believe i have the honour of addressing the conde de gondomar what means this intrusion sir lord roos demanded insolently what have you to say to his excellency i bring him a token my lord the young man replied exhibiting the ring given him by the masked horseman to the ambassador ha exclaimed de gondomar glancing at the ring and then regarding jocelyn steadfastly i must speak with this young man my lord and abandon the damsel demanded lord roos nonoyou must take care of her de gondomar replied in a low tone can you not induce lady exeter to take her into her service i will try lord roos replied and see he added pointing down the avenue the royal party is returning so i can at once ascertain whether her ladyship will second your excellencys designs do so said de gondomar and i shall be for ever indebted to you this girl has quite taken my fancy and i must not lose her and now sir he added stepping aside with jocelyn you have brought me the token from my assured agent and i understand from it that you are a person upon whom i may rely in all that beseems a gentleman and a man of honour and loyalty your excellency may rely on me jocelyn replied i shall require nothing inconsistent with those principles the spanish ambassador said this point disposed of let me know how i can serve you for i presume you have some request to prefer your excellency can very materially serve me jocelyn returned i am in danger i thought as much de gondomar observed with a smile since you have placed yourself under my protection i will do my best to hold you harmless but who is your enemy i have two deadly enemies sir giles mompesson and sir francis mitchell jocelyn rejoined i know them wellinstruments of buckingham said de gondomar they are indeed dangerous enemies i have another yet more dangerous returned jocelyn i have reason to fear that by boldness of speech i have incurred the enmity of the marquis of buckingham himself ah this indeed is serious said de gondomar i am threatened with arrest by the starchamber pursued jocelyn so your excellency will perceive that my position is fraught with extreme peril still i persuade myself if i could obtain a hearing of the king i should be able to set my enemies at defiance and obtain my right de gondomar smiled somewhat scornfully you will obtain little in that way he said and your enemies will crush you effectually but you must explain to me precisely how you are circumstanced and i will then consider what can be done for you and begin by acquainting me with your name and condition for as yet i am entirely ignorant whom i am addressing upon this jocelyn succinctly related to the ambassador all such particulars of his history as have been laid before the reader de gondomar listened to him with attention and put some questions to him as he proceeded at its close his countenance brightened you are in an awkward dilemma it must be owned master jocelyn mounchensey he said but i think i can protect you in spite of them allin spite of buckingham himself luckily he is not at theobalds at presentso the coast is clear for action the first blow is half the battle i must present you to the king without delay and see his majesty approaches stand close behind me and act as i advise you by a sign chapter xx king james the first meantime the royal cavalcade came slowly up the avenue it was very numerous and all the more brilliant in appearance since it comprised nearly as many highborn dames as nobles amongst the distinguished foreigners who with their attendants swelled the party were the venetian liegerambassador giustiniano and the marquis de tremouille of the family des ursins ambassador from france these exalted personages rode close behind the king and one or the other of them was constantly engaged in conversation with him giustiniano had one of those dark grave handsome countenances familiarized to us by the portraits of titian and tintoretto and even the kings jests failed in making him smile he was apparelled entirely in black velvet with a cloak bordered with the costly fur of the black fox all his followers were similarly attired the sombre venetian presented a striking contrast to his vivacious companion the gay and graceful de tremouille who glittered in white satin embroidered with leaves of silver while the same colour and the same ornaments were adopted by his retinue no order of precedence was observed by the court nobles each rode as he listed prince charles was absent and so was the supreme favourite buckingham but their places were supplied by some of the chief personages of the realm including the earls of arundel pembroke and montgomery the marquis of hamilton and the lords haddington fenton and doncaster intermingled with the nobles the courtiers of lesser rank and the ambassadors followers were the ladies most of whom claimed attention from personal charms rich attire and the grace and skill with which they managed their horses perhaps the most beautiful amongst them was the young countess of exeter whose magnificent black eyes did great execution the lovely countess was mounted on a fiery spanish barb given to her by de gondomar forced into a union with a gouty and decrepit old husband the countess of exeter might have pleaded this circumstance in extenuation of some of her follies it was undoubtedly an argument employed by her admirers who in endeavouring to shake her fidelity to her lord told her it was an infamy that she should be sacrificed to such an old dotard as he whether these arguments prevailed in more cases than one we shall not inquire too nicely but if courtscandal may be relied on they didbuckingham and de gondomar being both reputed to have been her lovers the last however in the list and the one who appeared to be most passionately enamoured of the beautiful countess and to receive the largest share of her regard was lord roos and as this culpable attachment and its consequences connect themselves intimately with our history we have been obliged to advert to them thus particularly lord roos was a near relative of the earl of exeter and although the infirm and gouty old peer had been excessively jealous of his lovely young wife on former occasions when she had appeared to trifle with his honour he seemed perfectly easy and unsuspicious now though there was infinitely more cause for distrust possibly he had too much reliance on lord rooss good feelings and principles to suspect him very different was lady rooss conduct this unhappy lady whom we have already mentioned as the daughter of sir thomas lake secretary of state had the misfortune to be sincerely attached to her handsome but profligate husband whose neglect and frequent irregularities she had pardoned until the utter estrangement occasioned by his passion for the countess of exeter filled her with such trouble that overpowered at length by anguish she complained to her mother lady lakean ambitious and imperious woman whose vanity had prompted her to bring about this unfortunate match expressing the greatest indignation at the treatment her daughter had experienced lady lake counselled her to resent it undertaking herself to open the eyes of the injured earl of exeter to his wifes infidelity but she was dissuaded from her purpose by sir thomas lake though generally governed by his wife sir thomas succeeded in this instance in overruling her design of proceeding at once to extremities with the guilty pair recommending that in the first instance lord roos should be strongly remonstrated with by lady lake and her daughter when perhaps his fears might be aroused if his sense of duty could not be awakened this final appeal had not yet been made but an interview had taken place between lady roos and her husband at which with many passionate entreaties she had implored him to shake off the thraldom in which he had bound himself and to return to her when all should be forgiven and forgottenbut without effect thus matters stood at present as we have seen though the countess of exeter formed one of the chief ornaments of the hawking party lord roos had not joined it his absence being occasioned by a summons from the conde de gondomar with some of whose political intrigues he was secretly mixed up whether the countess missed him or not we pretend not to say all we are able to declare is she was in high spirits and seemed in no mood to check the advances of other aspirants to her favour her beautiful and expressive features beamed with constant smiles and her lustrous black eyes seemed to create a flame wherever their beams alighted but we must quit this enchantress and her spells and proceed with the description of the royal party in the rear of those on horseback walked the falconers in liveries of green cloth with bugles hanging from the shoulder each man having a hawk upon his fist completely tired in its hood bells varvels and jesses at the heels of the falconers and accompanied by a throng of varlets in russet jerkins carrying staves came two packs of houndsone used for what was termed in the language of falconry the flight at the riverthese were all waterspaniels and the other for the flight at the field nice music they made in spite of the efforts of the varlets in russet to keep them quiet hawking in those days was what shooting is in the present fowlingpieces being scarcely used if at all thus the varieties of the hawktribe were not merely employed in the capture of pheasants partridges grouse rails quails and other game besides waterfowl but in the chase of hares and in all of these pursuits the falconers were assisted by dogs game of course could only be killed at particular seasons of the year and wildgeese wildducks woodcocks and snipes in the winter but spring and summer pastime was afforded by the crane the bustard the heron the rook and the kite while at the same periods some of the smaller description of waterfowl offered excellent sport on lake or river a striking and picturesque sight that cavalcade presented with its nodding plumes of many colours its glittering silks and velvets its proud array of horsemen and its still prouder array of lovely women whose personal graces and charms baffle description while they invite it pleasant were the sounds that accompanied the progress of the train the jocund laugh the musical voices of women the jingling of bridles the snorting and trampling of steeds the baying of hounds the shouts of the varlets and the winding of horns but having as yet omitted the principal figure we must hasten to describe him by whom the party was headed the king then was mounted on a superb milkwhite steed with wideflowing mane and tail and of the easiest and gentlest pace its colour was set off by its red chanfrein its nodding crest of red feathers its broad poitrinal with red tassels and its saddle with red housings though devoted to the chase as we have shown james was but an indifferent horseman and his safety in the saddle was assured by such highbolstered bows in front and at the back that it seemed next to impossible he could be shaken out of them yet in spite of all these precautions accidents had befallen him on one occasion sir symonds dewes relates that he was thrown headlong into a pond and on another we learn from a different source that he was cast over his horses head into the new river and narrowly escaped drowning his boots alone being visible above the ice covering the stream moreover the monarchs attire was excessively stiff and cumbrous and this while it added to the natural ungainliness of his person prevented all freedom of movement especially on horseback his doublet which on the present occasion was of green velvet considerably frayedfor he was by no means particular about the newness of his apparelwas padded and quilted so as to be daggerproof and his hose were stuffed in the same manner and preposterously large about the hips then his ruff was triplebanded and so stiffly starched that the head was fixed immovably amidst its plaits though not handsome jamess features were thoughtful and intelligent with a gleam of cunning in the eye and an expression of sarcasm about the mouth and they contained the type of the peculiar physiognomy that distinguished all his unfortunate line his beard was of a yellowish brown and scantily covered his chin and his thin moustaches were of a yet lighter hue his hair was beginning to turn gray but his complexion was ruddy and hale proving that but for his constant ebriety and indulgence in the pleasures of the table he might have attained a good old ageif indeed his life was not unfairly abridged his large eyes were for ever rolling about and his tongue was too big for his mouth causing him to splutter in utterance besides giving him a disagreeable appearance when eating while his legs were so weak that he required support in walking notwithstanding these defects and his general coarseness of manner james was not without dignity and could when he chose assume a right royal air and deportment but these occasions were rare as is well known his pedantry and his pretensions to superior wisdom and discrimination procured him the title of the scottish solomon his general character will be more fully developed as we proceed and we shall show the perfidy and dissimulation which he practised in carrying out his schemes and tried to soften down under the plausible appellation of kingcraft james was never seen to greater advantage than on occasions like the present his hearty enjoyment of the sport he was engaged in his familiarity with all around him even with the meanest varlets by whom he was attended and for whom he had generally some droll nickname his complete abandonment of all the etiquette which either he or his master of the ceremonies observed elsewhere his goodtempered vanity and boasting about his skill as a woodsmanall these things created an impression in his favour which was not diminished in those who were not brought much into contact with him in other ways when hunting or hawking james was nothing more than a hearty country gentleman engaged in the like sports the cavalcade came leisurely on for the king proceeded no faster than would allow the falconers to keep easily up with those on horseback he was in high good humour and laughed and jested sometimes with one ambassador sometimes with the other and having finished a learned discussion on the manner of fleeing a hawk at the river and on the field as taught by the great french authorities martin malopin and aime cassian with the marquis de tremouille had just begun a similar conversation with giustiniano as to the italian mode of manning hooding and reclaiming a falcon as practised by messer francesco sforzino vicentino when he caught sight of the conde de gondomar standing where we left him at the side of the avenue on which he came to a sudden halt and the whole cavalcade stopped at the same time salud conde magnifico exclaimed king james as the spaniard advanced to make his obeisance to him how is it that we find you standing under the shade of the tree friendly to the vineamictoe vitibus ulmi as ovid hath it is it that yon blooming chloe he continued leering significantly at gillian hath more attraction for you than our court dames troth the quean is not illfavoured but ye ha lost a gude days sport count forbye ither losses which we sall na particularize we hae had a noble flight at the heron and anither just as guid after the bustard gods santy the run the langleggit loon gave us lady exeter on her braw spanish barbwe ken whose gift it iswas the only one able to keep with us and it was her leddyships ain peregrine falcon that checked the fleeing carle at last by our faith the countess understands the gentle science weel she cared not to soil her dainty gloves by rewarding her hawk with a soppa as his excellency giustiniano would term it of the bustards heart bluid and brains but wha hae ye gotten wi ye he added for the first time noticing jocelyn a young gentleman in whom i am much interested and whom i would crave permission to present to your majesty replied de gondomar saul of our body count the permission is readily granted replied james evidently much pleased with the young mans appearance ye shall bring him to us in the privychamber before we gang to supper and moreover ye shall hae full licence to advance what you please in his behoof he is a weelgrown weelfavoured laddie almost as much sae as our ain dear dog steenie but we wad say to him in the words of the roman bard o formose puer nimium ne crede colori gude pairts are better than gude looks not that the latter are to be undervalued but baith should exist in the same person we shall soon discover whether the young man hath been weel nurtured and if all correspond we shall not refuse him the light of our countenance i tender your majesty thanks for the favour you have conferred upon him replied de gondomar but ye have not yet tauld us the youths name count said the king your majesty i trust will not think i make a mystery where none is needed if i say that my protege claims your gracious permission to preserve for the moment his incognito de gondomar replied when i present him of course his name will be declared be it as you will count james replied we ken fu weel ye hae gude reason for a ye do fail not in your attendance on us at the time appointed as de gondomar with a profound obeisance drew back the king put his steed in motion general attention having been thus called to jocelyn all eyes were turned towards him his appearance and attire were criticised and much speculation ensued as to what could be the spanish ambassadors motive for undertaking the presentation meanwhile lord roos had taken advantage of the brief halt of the hunting party to approach the countess of exeter and pointing out gillian to her inquired in a low tone and in a few words to which however his looks imparted significance whether she would take the pretty damsel into her service as tirewoman or handmaiden the countess seemed surprised at the request and after glancing at the beauty of tottenham was about to refuse it when lord roos urged in a whisper t is for de gondomar i ask the favour in that case i readily assent the countess replied i will go speak to the damsel at once if you desire it how pretty she is no wonder his inflammable excellency should be smitten by her and detaching her barb as she spoke from the cavalcade she moved towards gillian accompanied by lord roos the pretty damsel was covered with fresh confusion at the great ladys approach and was indeed so greatly alarmed that she might have taken to her heels if she had been on the ground and not on the pillion behind her grandsire be not abashed my pretty maiden the countess said in a kind and encouraging tone there is nothing to be afraid of aware that i am in want of a damsel like yourself to tire my hair and attend upon me lord roos has drawn my attention to you and if i may trust to appearancesas i think i may she added with a very flattering and persuasive smile in your caseyou are the very person to suit me provided you are willing to enter my service i am the countess of exeter a countess exclaimed gillian do you hear that grandsire the beautiful lady is a countess what an honour it would be to serve her it might be the old man replied with hesitation and in a whisper yet i do not exactly like the manner of it dont accept the offer gillian dont go said dick taverner whose breast was full of uneasiness your answer my pretty maiden the countess said with a winning smile i am much beholden to you my lady gillian replied and it will delight me to serve you as you proposethat is if i have my grandsires consent to it and the good man i am sure has your welfare too much at heart to withhold it the countess replied but follow me to the palace and we will confer further upon the matter inquire for the countess of exeters apartments and with another gracious smile she rejoined the cavalcade leaving lord roos behind he thanked her with a look for her complaisance o gillian i am sure ill will come of this dick taverner exclaimed wherefore should it she rejoined almost beside herself with delight at the brilliant prospect suddenly opened before her my fortune is made you are right my pretty damsel it is lord roos remarked fail not to do as the countess has directed you and i will answer for the rest you hear what the kind young nobleman says grandsire gillian whispered in his ear you cannot doubt his assurance i hear it all old greenford replied but i know not what to think i suppose we must go to the palace to be sure we must gillian cried i will go there alone if you will not go with me satisfied with what he had heard lord roos moved away nodding approval at gillian the cavalcade as we have said was once more in motion but before it had proceeded far it was again most unexpectedly brought to a halt suddenly stepping from behind a large tree which had concealed him from view a man in military habiliments with grizzled hair and beard and an exceedingly resolute and stern cast of countenance planted himself directly in the monarchs path and extending his hand towards him exclaimed in a loud voice stand o king who art thou fellow and what wouldst thou demanded james who had checked his horse with such suddenness as almost to throw himself out of his highholstered saddle i have a message to deliver to thee from heaven replied hugh calveley aha exclaimed james recovering in some degree for he thought he had a madman to deal with what may thy message be and willing to gain a character for courage though it was wholly foreign to his nature he motioned those around him to keep back thy message fellow he repeated hear then what heaven saith to thee the puritan replied have i not brought thee out of a land of famine into a land of plenty thou oughtest therefore to have judged my people righteously but thou hast perverted justice and not relieved the oppressed therefore unless thou repent i will rend thy kingdom from thee and from thy posterity after thee thus saith the lord whose messenger i am chapter xxi consequences of the puritans warning coupling hugh calveleys present strange appearance and solemn warning with his previous denunciations uttered in secret and his intimations of some dread design with which he had sought to connect the young man himself intimating that its execution would jeopardize his life putting these things together we say jocelyn could not for an instant doubt that the king was in imminent danger and he felt called upon to interfere even though he should be compelled to act against his fathers friend and the father of aveline no alternative in fact was allowed him as a loyal subject his duty imperiously required him to defend his sovereign and perceiving that no one in consequence of the kings injunctions advanced towards the puritan jocelyn hastily quitted the conde de gondomar and rushing forward stationed himself between the monarch and his bold admonisher and so near to the latter that he could easily prevent any attack being made by him upon james evidently disconcerted by the movement hugh calveley signed to the young man to stand aside but jocelyn refused compliance the rather that he suspected from the manner in which the other placed his hand in his breast that he had some weapon concealed about his person casting a look of bitterest reproach at him which plainly as words saidungrateful boy thou hast prevented my purpose the puritan folded his hands upon his breast with an air of deep disappointment fly cried jocelyn in a tone calculated only to reach his ears i will defend you with my life waste not another momentfly but hugh calveley regarded him with cold disdain and though he moved not his lips he seemed to say you have destroyed me and i will not remove the guilt of my destruction from your head the puritans language and manner had filled james with astonishment and fresh alarm but feeling secure in the propinquity of jocelyn to the object of his uneasiness and being closely environed by his retinue the foremost of whom had drawn their swords and held themselves in readiness to defend him from the slightest hostile attempt it was not unnatural that even so timorous a person as he should regain his confidence once more therefore he restrained by his gestures the angry impetuosity of the nobles around him who were burning to chastise the rash intruder and signified his intention of questioning him before any measures were adopted against him let him be he cried he is some puir demented creature fitter for bedlam than anywhere else and we will see that he be sent thither but molest him not till we hae spoken wi him and certified his condition more fully quit not the position ye hae sae judiciously occupied young sir albeit against our orders he cried to jocelyn dinna draw your blade unless the fellow seeks to come till us not that we are under ony apprehension but there are bluidthirsty traitors even in our pacific territories and as this may be ane of them it is weel not to neglect due precaution and now man he added raising his voice and addressing the puritan who still maintained a steadfast and unmoved demeanour with his eye constantly fixed upon his interrogator ye say ye are a messenger frae heaven an it be saewhilk we take leave to doubt rather conceiving ye to be an envoy from the prince of darkness than an ambassador from abovean ill choice hath been made in ye unto what order of prophets do ye conceive yourself to belong to this interrogation propounded in a jeering tone the puritan deigned no reply but an answer was given for him by archee the court jester who had managed in the confusion to creep up to his royal masters side he belongs to the order of melchisedec said archee a reply that occasioned some laughter among the nobles in which the king joined heartily tut fule ye are as daft as the puir body before us cried james ken ye not that melchisedec was a priest and not a prophet while to judge frae yon fellows abulyiements if he belongs to any church at all it maun be to the church militant and yet aiblins ye are na sae far out after a like aneuch he may be infected with the heresy of the melchisedeciansa pestilent sect who plagued the early christian church sairly placing their master aboon our blessed lord himself and holding him to be identical wi the holy ghaist are ye a melchisedecian sirrah i am a believer in the gospel the puritan replied and am willing to seal my faith in it with my blood i am sent hither to warn thee o king and thou wilt do well not to despise my words repent ere it be too late wonderfully hath thy life been preserved dedicate the remainder of thy days to the service of the most high persecute not his people and revile them not purge thy city of its uncleanness and idolatry and thy court of its corruption profane not the sabbath i see how it is interrupted archee with a scream the man hath been driven stark wud by your majestys book of sports a book devised by the devil cried hugh calveley catching at the suggestion and which ought to be publicly burnt by the hangman instead of being read in the churches how much mischief hath that book done how many abominations hath it occasioned and alas how much persecution hath it caused for have not many just men and sincere preachers of the word been prosecuted in thy court misnamed of justice and known o king as the starchamber suffering stripes and imprisonment for refusing to read thy mischievous proclamation to their flocks i knew iti knew it screamed archee delighted with the effect he had produced take heed sirrah he cried to the puritan that ye make not acquaintance wi that court misnamed of justice yer ain sell he is liker to be arraigned at our court styled the kings bench and hanged drawn and quartered afterwards roared james far more enraged at the disrespectful mention made of his manifesto than by anything that had previously occurred the man is not sae doited as we supposed him he is not sane enough to keep his neck from the halter rejoined archee your majesty should spare him since you are indirectly the cause of his malady intercede not for me cried hugh calveley i would not accept any grace at the tyrants hands let him hew me in pieces and my blood shall cry out for vengeance upon his head by our halidame a dangerous traitor exclaimed james hear me o king thundered the puritan for the third and last time i lift up my voice to warn thee visions have appeared to me in the night and mysterious voices have whispered in mine ear they have revealed to me strange and terrible thingsbut not more strange and terrible than true they have told me how thy posterity shall suffer for the injustice thou doest to thy people they have shown me a scaffold which a king shall mountand a block whereon a royal head shall be laid but it shall be better for that unfortunate monarch though he be brought to judgment by his people than for him who shall be brought to judgment by his god yet more i have seen in my visions two kings in exile one of whom shall be recalled but the other shall die in a foreign land as to thee thou mayst live on yet awhile in fancied security but destruction shall suddenly overtake thee thou shalt be stung to death by the serpent thou nourishest in thy bosom whatever credit might be attached to them the puritans prophetic forebodings produced from the manner in which they were delivered a strong impression upon all his auditors unquestionably the man was in earnest and spoke like one who believed that a mission had been entrusted to him no interruption was offered to his speech even by the king though the latter turned pale as these terrible coming events were shadowed forth before him his words are awsome he muttered and gar the flesh creep on our banes will nane o ye stap his tongue better hae stapt it afore this said archee he has said ower meikle or not aneuch the deils malison on thee fellow for a prophet of ill hast thou aught to allege why his majesty should not tuck thee up with a halter i have spoken responded the puritan let the king do with me what he lists seize him arrest him ye are nearest to him sir shouted the king to jocelyn the command could not be disobeyed as jocelyn drew near and laid his hand upon hugh calveley the latter looked reproachfully at him saying thou doest well son of my old friend jocelyn was unable to reply for a crowd now pressed forward on all sides completely surrounding the prisoner some of the nobles threatened him with their swords and the warders who had come up from the gateway thrust at him with their partizans jocelyn had great difficulty in shielding him from the infuriated throng touch him not he cried clearing a space around them with the point of his sword his majesty has committed him to my custody and i am responsible for him pardon me if i disarm you sir he added in an undertone to the prisoner here is my sword replied hugh calveley unbuckling his belt and delivering up the weapon it sustained to jocelyn it hath never been dishonoured and he added lowering his voice it hath been twice drawn in thy fathers defence the reproach cut jocelyn to the heart at this moment the crowd drew aside to allow the kings approach hath he been searched to see whether any deadly or offensive weapon is concealed about him demanded james he cannot have any more offensive weapon than his tongue cried archee who accompanied his royal master i counsel your majesty to deprive him of that there is something hidden in his breast cried one of the warders searching in his jerkin and at length drawing forth a short clumsy pistol or dag as the weapon was then called it is loaded an please your majesty the man continued after examining it exclamations of horror arose from those around and jocelyn had again some difficulty in protecting the prisoner from their fury a dag ejaculated james a loaded dag crammed to the muzzle wi bullets nae doubt haud it down man haud it down it may fire off of itsel and accomplish the villains murtherous and sacrilegious design and sae this was to be the instrument of our destruction dost thou confess thy guilt thou bluidthirsty traitor or shall the torture force the truth from thee the torture will force nothing from me replied hugh calveley but i tell thee tyrant that i would have slain thee had not my hand been stayed heard ye ever the like o that exclaimed james his ruddy cheek blanched with fright and his voice quavering why he exceedeth in audacity the archtraitor fawkes himsel and what stayed thy hand villain he demandedwhat stayed thy hand thou bloodthirsty traitor the presence of this youth jocelyn mounchensey rejoined hugh calveley had he not come between us when he did and checked my purpose i had delivered my country from oppression i told thee tyrant thou hadst been marvellously preserved thy preserver stands before thee heaven defend us exclaimed james trembling what an escape we hae had there hath been a special interposition o providence in our behoof our gratitude is due to him who watcheth ower us and in some degree to him who hath been made the instrument of your majestys preservation observed the conde de gondomar who formed one of the group near the king since the foul traitor hath proclaimed the name of my young protege there can be no need for further concealment master jocelyn mounchensey hath been singularly fortunate in rendering your majesty a service and may for ever congratulate himself on his shareaccidental though it bein this affair by my halidame he shall have reason for congratulation cried james graciously regarding the young man ay let him rise by my fall tis meet he should cried the puritan bitterly shower thy honours upon him tyrant give him wealth and titles i could not wish him worse misfortune than thy favour hold thy scurril tongue villain or it shall be torn out by the roots said james thou shalt see that i can as promptly reward those that serve me as thou shalt presently feel i can severely punish those that seek to injure me hark ye count he added to the spanish ambassador while those around drew back a little seeing it was his majestys pleasure to confer with him in private this youththis jocelyn mounchensey hath gentle bluid in his veinshe comes of a good stock ha he is the representative of an old norfolk family de gondomar replied what the son of sir ferdinando demanded james a shade crossing his countenance which did not escape the wily ambassadors notice you have guessed right sire he said this is sir ferdinandos son and if i may be permitted to say so your majesty owes him some reparation for the wrongs done his father how count exclaimed james with a look of slight displeasure do you venture to question our judgments on hearsayfor ye can know naething o your ain knowledge i know enough to be satisfied that misrepresentations were made to your majesty respecting this young mans father de gondomar replied for i am well assured that if you ever erred at all it must have been through ignorance and want of due information this was what i designed to explain more fully than i can well do now when i availed myself of your majestys gracious permission to bring the young man into your presence and i should then have taken leave to express how much he merited your majestys favour and protection fortune however has outrun my wishes and given him a stronger claim upon you than any i could urge ye are right count rejoined james cautiously he hath the strongest claim upon us and he shall not find us ungrateful we will confer wi steeniewi buckingham we meanabout him pardon me sire said de gondomar if i venture to suggest that your majesty hath an admirable opportunity which i should be sorry to see neglected of showing your goodness and clemency and silencing for ever the voice of calumny which will sometimes be raised against you what mean ye count cried james ye wad na hae me pardon yon traitor most assuredly not sire de gondomar rejoined but i would urge some present mark of favour for him who hath saved you from the traitors fell designs and i am emboldened to ask this because i feel assured it must be consonant to your majestys own inclinations to grant the request it is sae count rejoined james we only desired to consult wi buckingham to ascertain whether he had ony objections but as this is altogether unlikely we will follow our ain inclinations and do as your excellency suggests de gondomar could scarcely conceal his satisfaction at this moment lord roos pressed towards the king i have something to say in reference to this young man my liege he cried in his favour demanded the king yes yes in his favour sire said de gondomar looking hard at the young nobleman you need not trouble his majesty further my lord he is graciously pleased to accede to our wishes ay ay nae mair need be said cried james let the young man stand forward and as jocelyn obeyed the injunction which was immediately communicated to him by de gondomar the king bade him kneel down and taking lord rooss sword touched him with it upon the shoulder exclaiming arise sir jocelyn you are safe now whispered de gondomar this is the first blow and it has been well struck so confused was the newmade knight by the honour thus unexpectedly conferred upon him that when he rose to his feet he could scarcely command himself sufficiently to make the needful obeisance and tender thanks to the king for a moment his brow was flushed with pride and his breast beat high but the emotions were instantly checked as he thought how the title had been purchased looking towards the prisoner he beheld him in the hands of the warders to whose custody he had been committed with his arms bound behind him by thongs his gaze had never quitted the young man during the ceremony which had just taken place and he still regarded him sternly and reproachfully let the prisoner be removed and kept in a place of safety till our pleasure respecting him be made known cried james and now my lords and ladies let us forward to the palace and the cavalcade was once more put in motion and passing through the great gateway entered the fountain court where the nobility of both sexes dismounted while their attendants and the falconers and varlets passed off to the offices the prisoner was conveyed to the porters lodge and strictly guarded till some secure chamber could be prepared for him on the way thither jocelyn contrived to approach him and to say in a low tonecan i do aught for aveline concern not yourself about her sir jocelyn rejoined hugh calveley with stern contempt she is in a place of safety you will never behold her more chapter xxii wife and motherinlaw quick steps descended the narrow staircasesteps so light and cautious that they made no sound before drawing aside the arras that covered the secret entrance to the chamber the lady paused to listen and hearing nothing to alarm her she softly raised a corner of the woof and looked in what did she behold a young man seated beside a carved oak table with his back towards her he was reading a letter the contents of which seemed greatly to disturb him for he more than once dashed it aside and then compelled himself to resume its perusal no one else was in the room which was spacious and lofty though somewhat sombre being wholly furnished with dark oak while the walls were hung with ancient tapestry heavy curtains were drawn before the deep bay windows increasing the gloom the chamber was lighted by a brass lamp suspended from the moulded ceiling the ribs of which were painted and the bosses at the intersections gilded near the concealed entrance where the lady stood was placed a large curiouslycarved ebony cabinet against which leaned a suit of tilting armour and a lance while on its summit were laid a morion a brigandine greaves gauntlets and other pieces of armour on the right of the cabinet the tapestry was looped aside disclosing a short flight of steps terminated by the door of an antichamber almost as the lady set foot within the room which she did after a brief deliberation dropping the arras noiselessly behind her the young man arose her entrance had not been perceived so violently was he agitated crushing the letter which had excited him so much between his fingers and casting it furiously from him he gave vent to an incoherent expression of rage though naturally extremely handsome his features at this moment were so distorted by passion that they looked almost hideous in person he was slight and finelyformed and the richness of his attire proclaimed him of rank the lady who unperceived had witnessed his violent emotion was remarkably beautiful her figure was superb and she had the whitest neck and arms imaginable and the smallest and most delicatelyformed hands her features derived something of haughtiness from a slightly aquiline nose and a short curled upper lip her eyes were magnificentlarge dark and almost oriental in shape and splendour jetty brows and thick lustrous raven hair completed the catalogue of her charms her dress was of white brocade over which she wore a loose robe of violetcoloured velvet with open hanging sleeves well calculated to display the polished beauty of her arms her ruff was of point lace and round her throat she wore a carcanet of pearls while other precious stones glistened in her dusky tresses this beautiful dame whose proud lips were now more compressed than usual and whose dark eyes emitted fierce raysvery different from their customary tender and voluptuous glanceswas the countess of exeter he whom she looked upon was lord roos and the chamber she had just entered was the one assigned to the young nobleman in the palace of theobalds she watched him for some time with curiosity at length his rage found vent in words perdition seize them both he exclaimed smiting his forehead with his clenched hand was ever man cursed with wife and motherinlaw like mine they will perforce drive me to desperate measures which i would willingly avoid but if nothing else will keep them quiet the grave must ay the grave he repeated in a hollow voice it is not my fault if i am compelled to send them thither fools to torment me thus feeling she had heard more than she ought the countess would have retired but as retreat might have betrayed her she deemed it better to announce her presence by saying you are not alone my lord startled by her voice lord roos instantly turned and regarded her with haggard looks you here frances he exclaimed i did not expect you so soon i came before the hour becausebut you seem greatly agitated has anything happened little more than what happens daily he replied and yet it is more for the crisis has arrived and a fearful crisis it is o frances he continued vehemently how dear you are to me to preserve your love i would dare everything even my souls welfare i would hesitate at no crime to keep you ever near me let those beware who would force you from me what means this passion my lord inquired the countess it means that since there are those who will mar our happiness who jealous of our loves will utterly blight and destroy them who will tear us forcibly asunder recking little of the anguish they occasion since we have enemies who will do this who will mortally wound uslet us no longer hesitate but strike the first blow we must rid ourselves of them at any cost and in any way i will not affect to misunderstand you my lord the countess replied her beautiful features beginning to exhibit traces of terror but has it arrived at this point is the danger imminent and inevitable imminent but not inevitable lord roos rejoined it can be avoided as i have hinted in one way and in one way only there is a letter i have just received from my wife wherein after her usual upbraidings remonstrances and entreaties she concludes by saying that if i continue deaf to her prayers and refuse to break off entirely with you and return to her our criminal attachmentfor so she terms our loveshould be divulged to the deluded earl of exeter who will know how to redress her wrongs and avenge his own injured honour what answer save one can be returned to that letter frances if we set her at defiance as we have hitherto done she will act for she is goaded on by that fury her mother we must gain a little time in order that the difficulties now besetting us may be effectually removed i shudder to think of it william said the countess trembling and turning deathly pale no it must not be rather than such a crime should be committed i will comply with their demand and leave me cried lord roos bitterly frances your affection is not equal to mine or you could not entertain such a thought for a moment you almost make me suspect he added sternly that you have transferred your love to another ah beware beware i am not to be trifled with like your husband i forgive you the doubt my lordunjust though it bebecause your mind is disturbed but were you calm enough to view the matter as it really is you would perceive that my resolution has nothing in it inconsistent with affection for you but rather that my very love for you compels me to the step what i propose is best for both of us the remedy you suggest would work our ruin here and hereafter would drive us from society and render us hateful to each other my soul revolts at it and though i myself have received a mortal affront from your wifes mother lady lake though she has poured forth all the malice of which she is capable upon my devoted head yet i would rather forgive herrather sue for pity from her than go the fearful length you propose no william the pang of parting from you will indeed be terrible but it must be endured fate wills it so and it is therefore useless to struggle against it o recall those words frances cried the young nobleman throwing himself at her feet and clasping her hands passionately recall them i implore of you in uttering them you pronounce my dooma doom more dreadful than death which would be light in comparison with losing you plunge this sword to my heart he exclaimed plucking the shining weapon from his side and presenting it to her free me from my misery at once but do not condemn me to lingering agony rise william rise i pray of you ejaculated the countess overcome by the intensity of his emotion and put up your sword the love you display for me deserves an adequate return and it shall meet it come what will i will not leave you but o let us not plunge deeper in guilt if it can be avoided but how can it be avoided cried lord roos will they listen to our prayers will they pity us will they hesitate at our destruction i know noti know not replied the countess bewildered but i stand appalled before the magnitude of the offence they will not spare us pursued lord roos and therefore we cannot spare them in my turn i bend to you william said the countess sinking on her knee before him and taking his hand by the love you bear me i beseech you not to harm your wife we have wronged her deeplylet us not have her death to answer for if the blow must fall let it be upon the mothers head i have less compassion for her lady lake deserves no compassion replied lord roos raising the countess and embracing her tenderly for she is the cause of all this mischief it is to her agency we owe the storm which threatens us with ruin but things have gone too far now to show compunction for either of them our security demands that both should be removed i may now say as you have just said william and with far greater reason cried the countess that you love me not or you would not refuse my request how can i comply with it he rejoined nothing were done if only partly done know you the charge that lady roos means to bring against you though alike false and improbable it is one to find easy credence with the king and it has been framed with that view you will understand this when i tell you what it is in this letter he added picking up the paper he had thrown down and unfolding it she accuses you of practising sorcery to enslave my affections she declares you have bewitched me and that she has proof of the manner in which it was done and of the sinful compact you have entered into for the purpose o william this is falseutterly false exclaimed the countess in despair i know it he rejoined you have no need to practise other enchantments with me than those you possess by nature but what i tell you will show you the extent of their malice and steel your heart as it hath already steeled mine against them but this accusation is too monstrous it will not be believed cried the countess monstrous as it is it is more likely to be believedmore certain to be maintainedthan the other which they lay at our door we may deny all their assertions may intimidate or give the lie to the witnesses they may produce against us may stamp as forgeries your letters which have unluckily fallen into their hands but if this charge of witchcraft be once brought against you it will not fall to the ground the king will listen to it because it flatters his prejudices and even my voice would fail to save you from condemnationfrom the stake horrible exclaimed lady exeter spreading her hands before her eyes as if to exclude some dreadful object o to live in an age when such enormities can be perpetrated when such frightful weapons can be used against the innocentfor i am innocent at least of this offence all seems against me all doors of escapesave oneclosed and whither does that door lead to the bottomless pit if there be truth in aught we are told by heaven lord roos seemed unable or unwilling to reply and a deep pause ensued for a few moments during which the guilty pair shunned each others regards it was broken at length by lady exeter who said reproachfully you should have burnt my letters william without them they would have had no evidence against me imprudent that you were you have destroyed me reproach me not prances he rejoined i admit my imprudence and blame myself severely for it but i could not part with a line i had received from you i inclosed the letters in a little coffer which i deposited in a secret drawer of that cabinet as in a place of perfect safety the coffer and its contents mysteriously disappeared how it was purloined i cannot inform you do your suspicions alight on no one she inquired they have fallen on several but i have no certainty that i have been right in any instance he replied that i have some spy near me i am well aware and if i detect him he shall pay for his perfidy with his life hist cried lady exeter did you not hear a noise no he rejoined where she pointed to the little passage leading to the antechamber he instantly went thither and examined the place but without discovering any listener there is no one he said as he returned no one in fact could have obtained admittance without my knowledge for my spanish servant diego in whom i can place full confidence is stationed without i distrust that man william she observed when i asked whom you thought had removed the letters my own suspicions had attached to him i do not think he would have done it lord roos replied he has ever served me faithfully and besides i have a guarantee for his fidelity in the possession of a secret on which his own life hangs i can dispose of him as i please again that sound exclaimed the countess i am sure some one is there your ears have deceived you said the young nobleman after examining the spot once more and likewise the secret entrance by which the countess had approached the chamber i heard nothing and can find nothing your nerves are shaken and make you fanciful it may be so she rejoined but it was evident she was not convinced for she lowered her tones almost to a whisper as she continued it might be that the question she designed to put was one she dared not ask aloud what means do you purpose to employ in the execution of your design the same as those employed by somerset and his countess in the removal of sir thomas overbury but more expeditious and more certain he replied under his breath dreadful she exclaimed with a shudder but the same judgment that overtook the somersets may overtake us such crimes are never hidden crimes fouler than theirs have never been brought to light and never will there was one in which somerset himself was concerned involving the destruction of a far higher personage than overbury and this dare not even be hinted at because the greatest person in the land was connected with it returned the countess i conclude you refer to the death of prince henry i do answered lord roos somerset would never have been questioned about overbury if his fall had not been resolved upon by the king one other question and i ask no more said the countess scarcely able to syllable her words who is to administer the deadly draught luke hatton lady lakes apothecary he is a creature of mine and entirely devoted to me our lives will be in his hands ever afterwards said the countess in a deep whisper they will be in safe keeping he rejoined endeavouring to reassure her o william i would i could prevail upon you to defer this project to what end the sooner it is done the better it cannot indeed be deferred i shall send for luke hatton tonight at this announcement the countess who had gradually been growing fainter and becoming paler lost all power of supporting herself and uttering a cry fell into his outstretched arms in a state of complete insensibility while lord roos half distracted was considering what means he could adopt for her restoration a man with an almost tawny complexion hair and eyes to match and habited in the young noblemans livery of crimson and white suddenly entered from the antechamber how dare you come in unsummoned diego cried lord roos furiously begone instantly sirrah i crave your lordships pardon replied the spanish servant but i was obliged to apprise you that your wife the baroness roos and lady lake are without and will not be denied admission damnation exclaimed lord roos what brings them here at such an hour but you must on no account admit them diegoat least till i have had time to remove the countess to her own chamber what a cursed mischance diego instantly withdrew apparently to obey his lords command but he had scarcely entered the little passage when two ladies pushed past him and made their way into the room they arrived just in time to intercept lord roos who was conveying his insensible burthen towards the secret staircase the young nobleman was as much confounded by their appearance as if two spectres had risen before him both ladies were very richly attired and the younger of the two was by no means destitute of beauty though of a pale and pensive character the elder had a full noble figure haughty features now lighted up with a smile of triumph as she gazed on lord roos very different was the expression of the other who seemed so much grieved and agitated by what she beheld as to be almost ready to lapse into the same condition as the countess if lord roos could have seen the grin upon diegos swarthy visage as he stood at the entrance of the passage leading to the antechamber he would have had little doubt to whom he was indebted for this surprise it is needless to say that the ladies who had thus broken upon lord rooss privacy and obtained full confirmation of their suspicions if they had any doubts remaining were his wife and motherinlaw chapter xxiii the tress of hair how to extricate himself from the dilemma in which he was placed lord roos scarcely knew but he had a good deal of selfpossession and it did not desert him on the present trying occasion after such consideration as circumstances permitted he could discern only one chance of escape and though wellnigh hopeless he resolved to adopt it if consummate audacity could carry him throughand it was required in the present emergencyhe had no lack of it hitherto not a word had passed between him and the intruders on his privacy lady lake seemed to enjoy his confusion too much to do anything to relieve it and his wife was obliged to regulate her movements by those of her mother without breaking the silence which by this time had become painfully oppressive he proceeded to deposit the still inanimate person of the countess of exeter upon a couch and casting a handkerchief as if undesignedly over her face he marched quickly up to the spot where diego was standing and said to him in a deep determined tone but so low as not to be overheard by the others you have betrayed me villain and unless you obey me unhesitatingly and corroborate all my assertions however startling they may appear you shall pay for your treachery with your life this done he turned towards the two ladies and with more calmness than might have been expected addressed himself to lady lake you imagine you have made an important discovery madam he said a discovery which will place me and a noble lady whose reputation you and your daughter seek to injure in great perplexity and you conclude that being completely as you fancy in your power i shall consent to any terms you and lady roos may propose rather than suffer you to go forth from this chamber and reveal what you have seen in it is it not so madam ay my lord lady lake replied bitterly you have stated the matter correctly enough except in one particular we do not imagine we have made a discovery because we are quite sure of it we do not fancy you will agree to our terms because we are certain you will only too gladly screen yourself and the partner of your guilt from exposure and disgrace at any sacrifice and allow me to observe that the tone adopted by your lordship is neither befitting the circumstances in which you are placed nor the presence in which you stand some sense of shame must at least be left yousome show of respect if nothing more ought to be observed towards your injured wife were i acting alone in this matter i would show you and my lady of exeter no consideration whatever but i cannot resist the pleadings of my daughter and for her sakeand hers alonei am content to suspend the blow unless forced to strike in which case nothing shall stay my hands i thank your ladyship for your clemency said lord roos with mock humility o my dear lord do not for ever close the door between us cried lady roos return to me and all shall be forgiven peace elizabeth exclaimed lady lake impatiently know you not from sad experience that your husband is inaccessible to all gentle entreaty his heart is steeled to pity solicit not that which is your right and which must be conceded whether he like or not let him bend the knee to you let him promise amendment and implore pardon and it will then be for you to consider whether you will extend forgiveness to him lady roos looked as if she would fain interrupt her mother but she was too much under her subjection to offer a remark it is time to undeceive you madam said lord roos wholly unmoved by what was said i am not in the strait you suppose and have not the slightest intention of soliciting lady rooss pardon or making any promise to her o mother you see that even you fail to move him said lady roos tearfully what is to happen to me you will make me chide you daughter if you exhibit this weakness cried lady lake angrily let me deal with him in spite of your affected confidence my lord you cannot be blind to the position in which you stand and though you yourself personally may be careless of the consequences of a refusal of our demands you cannot i conceive be equally indifferent to the fate of the countess of exeter which that refusal will decide i am so little indifferent to the safety of the countess madam that i cannot sufficiently rejoice that she is out of the reach of your malice how my lord exclaimed lady lake astounded at his assurance out of reach when she is here you cannot mean she added with an undefinable expression of satisfaction that she is dead dead ejaculated lady roos the countess dead i thought she was only in a swoon what riddle is it you would have us read my lord demanded lady lake no riddle whatever madam replied lord roos i only mean to assert that the person you behold upon that couch is not the countess of exeter not the countess exclaimed lady roos oh if this were possible but no no i cannot be deceived i now see the reason why her face has been covered with a kerchief cried lady lake but it shall not save her from our scrutiny so saying she advanced towards the couch with the intention of removing the covering when lord roos barred her approach not a step nearer madam he cried in a peremptory tone i will not allow you to gratify your curiosity further you and lady roos may make the most of what you have seen and proclaim abroad any tale your imaginations may devise forth you will only render yourselves ridiculous and encounter derision in lieu of sympathy no one will credit your assertions because i shall be able to prove that at this moment lady exeter is in a different part of the palace this bold falsehood will not serve your turn my lord whoever she may be the person on that couch shall be seized and we shall then ascertain the truth and she would have moved towards the door if lord roos had not caught hold of her arm while at the same time he drew his sword thinking from his fierce looks and menacing gestures that her mother might be sacrificed to his fury lady roos fell on her knees before him imploring pity and she continued in this supplicating posture till lady lake angrily bade her rise you have come here without my permission madam lord roos cried furiously to his motherinlaw and you shall not depart until i choose secure the door diego and bring me the key it is well he continued as the injunction was obeyed lady lake submitted without resistance to the constraint imposed upon her she could not well do otherwise for though her screams would have brought aid it might have arrived too late and after all she did not intend to settle matters in this way but she betrayed no symptoms of fear and as we have stated ordered her daughter to discontinue her supplications and now madam said lord roos releasing lady lake as he took the key from diego i will tell you who that person is pointing to the couch add not to the number of falsehoods you have already told my lord rejoined lady lake contemptuously i am perfectly aware who she is but i would fain hear his explanation mother said lady roos what explanation can be offered cried lady lake do you doubt the evidence of your senses i know not what i doubt or what i believe exclaimed lady roos distractedly then believe what i tell you bess said her husband this is the countesss handmaiden gillian greenford an impudent lie cried lady lake a truth my lady interposed diego a truth to which i am ready to swear no doubt of it thou false knave and double traitor thou art worthy of thy lord there is no lie however absurd and improbable which he can invent that thou wilt not support thou art ready now to perjure thyself for him but let him place little reliance on thee for thou wilt do the same thing for us tomorrow i scarcely think it probable my lady diego replied bowing lady lake turned from him in supreme disgust admitting for a moment the possibility of your lordships assertion being correct said lady roos how comes gillian greenford for so methinks you name her in her mistresss attire t is easily explained chuck lord roos rejoined anxious no doubt to set herself off to advantage she hath made free with the countesss wardrobe your own favourite attendant sarah swarton hath often arranged herself in your finest fardingales kirtlets and buskpoints as diego will tell you is it not so rascal t is precisely as my lord hath stated my lady said the spaniard to lady roos when sarah swarton hath been so habited i have more than once mistaken her for your ladyship yet sarah is very unlike me said lady roos that only shows how deceptive appearances are chuck and how little we ought to trust to them observed lord roos how can you suffer yourself to be thus duped elizabeth said lady lake because her ladyship would rather believe me than you madam rejoined lord roos but she is not duped heaven forgive him exclaimed diego aside and supposing it were gillian how would the case be mended as far as you are concerned elizabeth said lady lake are you not as much injured by one as by the other it may be replied her daughter but i am jealous only of the countess i would kneel to any other woman and thank her who would tear my husband from her embraces weak fool i disown you exclaimed lady lake angrily what a wife cried diego apart his lordship is quite unworthy of her now i should appreciate such devotion at this juncture there was a slight movement on the part of lady exeter and something like a sigh escaped her she revives whispered lady lake to her daughter we shall soon learn the truth i will find a means to make her speak well my lord she added aloud and speaking in a sarcastic tone if you will have it so it is idle to dispute it but what will the countess say when she discovers your infidelity on this a brisker movement took place on the couch and a hand was raised as if to snatch away the kerchief we have her whispered lady lake triumphantly to her daughter surely she proceeded aloud the countess will deeply resent the transfer of your affections to her handmaiden lord roos saw the peril in which he stood a moment more and lady lake had gained her point and the countess betrayed herself lady exeter will place little reliance on any representations you may make madam he said giving particular significance to his words except so far as they concern herself and then she will take care to refute them as to the circumstance of gillian greenford visiting me fainting in my arms from excess of timidity poor girl and being discovered by you and lady roos in that position the countess will laugh at it when it comes to her knowledgeas why should she do otherwise but she will feel very differently when she finds that you and your daughter insist that it was she herself and not her handmaiden whom you beheld rely on it madam lady exeter will contradict that assertion and disprove it let it be disproved now let the person on that couch disclose her features and we shall then see whether she be the countess or gillian ay let her do that my lordlet her speak to us urged lady roos diablo how is this request to be complied with i marvel said diego apart but lord roos was too experienced a player to be defeated by this turn in the game gillian has already been sufficiently annoyed he cried and shall not submit to this ordeal besides she has relapsed into insensibility as you see she does what your lordship wills her it is clear said lady lake contemptuously we know what construction to put upon your refusal i care not what construction you put upon it cried lord roos losing patience you and lady roos may think what you please and act as you please enough for me you can prove nothing why this is more like yourself my lord retorted lady lake derisively having thrown aside the mask you will be spared the necessity of further subterfuge the countess doubtless will imitate your example lay aside her feigned insensibility and defy us she need be under no apprehension since she has your own warrant that we can prove nothing your purpose i perceive is to irritate me madam cried lord roos fiercely and so far you are likely to succeed though you fail in all else i have no mask to throw off but if you will have me declare myself your enemy i am ready to do so henceforth let there be no terms kept between uslet it be open warfare be it so my lord and you will soon find who will be worsted in the struggle oh do not proceed to these fearful extremities dear mother and dearest husband cried lady roos turning from one to the other imploringly cease these provocations i pray of you be friends and not enemies as you pleasepeace or war it is the same to me said lord roos meantime i am wearied of this scene and must put an end to it diego and beckoning his servant to him he whispered some directions in his ear my lord shall be obeyed said diego as he received his commission gillian shall be conveyed with all care to her chamber we must have some proof that she has been here thought lady lake but how to obtain it i have it take these she added in a whisper to her daughter and giving a pair of scissors and contrive if possible to sever a lock of her hair before she be removed by a look lady roos promised compliance while this was passing diego had approached the couch and fastening the kerchief securely round the countesss face he raised her in his arms and moved towards the secret staircase the tapestried covering of which was held aside by lord roos to give him passage rapidly as the spaniard moved he did not outstrip lady roos whose design being favoured by the escape from its confinement of one of the countesss long dark tresses she had no difficulty of possessing herself of it in the manner prescribed by her mother lady exeter was aware of the loss she had sustained and uttered a stifled cry but this was attributed to the fright natural to the occasion by lord roos who had not noticed what had taken place and only caused him to hurry diegos departure but before the latter had wholly disappeared with his burthen the perfumed and silken tress of hair was delivered to lady lake who muttered triumphantly as she received itthis will convict her she cannot escape us now the prize was scarcely concealed when lord roos sheathing the sword which he had hitherto held drawn advanced towards his motherinlaw now that the object of your disquietude is removed madam it will not be necessary to prolong this interview he said have we then your lordships permission to depart rejoined lady lake coldly we are not i presume to avail ourselves of the private means of exit contrived for your amorous adventures lest we should make other discoveries your ladyship will leave by the way you entered rejoined lord roos i will attend you to the doorand unfasten it for you before we go i would have a word with my husbandit may be my last said lady roos to her mother i pray you withdraw a little that we may be alone better not rejoined lady lake but unable to resist her daughters imploring looks she added well as you will but it is useless with this she proceeded to the little passage and remained there as lady roos turned to her husband she saw from the stern and inflexible look he had assumed that any appeal made to him would be unavailing and she attempted none a moment elapsed before she could utter a word and then it was only a murmur to heaven for guidance and support what say you elizabeth demanded lord roos thinking she had addressed him i asked for support from on high william and it has been accorded to me she replied in a low sweet voice i can now speak to you it is not to weary you with supplications or reproaches that i thus detain you i have something to impart to you and i am sure you will eagerly listen to it come nearer that we may not be overheard lord roos whose curiosity was aroused by her manner obeyed her i am all attention he said i feel i am in your way william she rejoined in a deep whisper and that you desire my death nay interrupt me not i am sure you desire it and i am equally sure that the desire will be gratified and that you will kill me kill you bess cried lord roos startled how can you imagine aught so frightful there is a power granted to those who love deeply as i do of seeing into the hearts of those they love and reading their secrets i have read yours william nay be not alarmed i have kept it to myself hitherto and will keep it to the end you wish me dead i say and you shall have your wishbut not in the way you propose having lost your love i am become indifferent to lifeor rather life is grown intolerable to me but though death may be a release it must not come from your hand you cannot mean to destroy yourself elizabeth cried lord roos appalled i mean to trouble you no longer i mean to make the last and greatest sacrifice i can for you and to save you from a crimeor if you must share the crime at least to screen you from punishment look here she added producing a small phial bid me drink of this and ere tomorrow you are free and i am at rest shall i do it nono rejoined lord roos snatching the phial from her live bess live am i to live for you william she cried with inexpressible joy he made no answer but averted his head in mercy give me back the phial she exclaimed again plunged into the depths of despair i must refuse your request he replied have you done elizabeth demanded lady lake coming forth from the passage a moment more mother cried lady roos one wordone look she added to her husband but he neither spoke to her nor regarded her i am ready to accompany you now mother said the poor lady faintly nerve yourself weakhearted girl said lady lake in a low tone revenge is ours if i could only strike her without injuring him i should not heed thought lady roos but where he suffers i must also suffer and yet more acutely and scarcely able to support herself she followed her mother to the door of the antechamber which was unlocked and thrown open for them by her husband he did not bid her farewell as lady lake passed forth she paused for a moment and said tomorrow my lord we will ascertain whether the tress of hair we have obtained from the fair visitant to your chamber matches with that of gillian greenford or with the raven locks of the countess of exeter and satisfied with the effect produced by this menace she departed with her daughter before lord roos could utter a reply chapter xxiv the fountain court on the morning after the eventful passage in his life previously related our newlycreated knight was standing in a pensive attitude beside the beautiful fountain adorned with two fair statues representing the queen of love and her son heretofore described as placed in the centre of the great quadrangle of the palace of theobalds sir jocelyn was listening to the plashing of the sparkling jets of water as they rose into the air and fell back into the broad marble basin and appeared to be soothed by the pleasant sound his breast had been agitated by various and conflicting emotions in an incredibly short space of time events had occurred some of which seemed likely to influence the whole of his future career while one of them though it had advanced him far beyond what he could have anticipated appeared likely to mar altogether his prospects of happiness though the difficulties therefore that surrounded him had been unexpectedly overcome though by the exertions of the conde de gondomar who had followed up his first success with wonderful promptitude and perseverance and had dexterously contrived by all the insidious arts of which lie was so perfect a master to ingratiate his protege still further with the king without the protege himself being aware of the manner in which he was served though james himself appeared greatly pleased with him at the banquet in the evening to which owing to the skilful management of the spanish ambassador he was invited and bestowed such marked attention upon him that the envy and jealousy of most of the courtiers were excited by it though he seemed on the highroad to still greater favour and was already looked upon as a rising favourite who might speedily supplant others above him in this everchanging sphere if he did not receive a check though his present position was thus comparatively secure and his prospects thus brilliant he felt ill at ease and deeply dissatisfied with himself he could not acquit himself of blame for the part he had played though involuntarily in the arrest of hugh calveley it was inexpressibly painful to him and he felt it as a reproach from which he could not free himself to have risen however unexpectedly on his own part by the unfortunate puritans fall how could he ever face aveline again she must regard him with horror and detestation as the involuntary cause of her fathers destruction a bar had been placed between them which nothing could ever remove and though on the one hand he was suddenly exalted far beyond his hopes yet on the other he was as suddenly cast down and threatened to be for ever deprived of the bliss he had in view the possession of which he coveted far more than wealth or grandeur additional complexity had been given to his position from the circumstance that at de gondomars secret instance of which like all the rest he was unaware he had been appointed as officer in custody of hugh calveley until the latter who was still detained a close prisoner in the porters lodge should be removed to the tower or the fleet as his majesty might direct this post he would have declined had there been a possibility of doing so any plan he might have formed of aiding the prisoners escape was thus effectually prevented as he could not violate his duty and it was probably with this view that the wily ambassador had obtained him the appointment in fact he had unconsciously become little more than a puppet in the hands of the plotting spaniard who pulled the strings that moved him at pleasure regardless of the consequences what de gondomars ulterior designs were with him had not yet become manifest these perplexing thoughts swept through sir jocelyns breast as he stood by the marble fountain and listened to the sound of its falling waters while thus occupied he perceived two persons issue from the arched entrance fronting the gate adjoining the porters lodge in which the prisoner was still detained and make their way slowly across the quadrangle in the direction of the cloister on its eastern side above which were apartments assigned to the secretary of state sir thomas lake the foremost of the two was merely a yeoman of the guard and would not for a moment have attracted sir jocelyns attention if it had not been for a female who accompanied him and whom he was evidently conducting to sir thomas lakes rooms as sir jocelyn not only saw the man point towards them but heard him mention the secretary of states name something whispered him that this closelyhooded femalethe lower part of whose face was shrouded in a muffler so that the eyes alone were visiblewas aveline little could be discerned of the features but the exquisitelyproportioned figure so simply yet so tastefully arrayed could only be hers and if he could have doubted that it was aveline the suddenness with which her looks were averted as she beheld him and the quickness with which she stepped forward so as even to outstrip her companionthese circumstances coupled with the violent throbbing of his own heart convinced him he was right he would have flown after her if he had dared would have poured forth all his passionate feelings to her had he been permitted would have offered her his life to deal with as she pleased but his fears restrained him and he remained riveted to the spot gazing after her until she entered the great hall on the ground floor beneath the secretary of states apartments why she sought sir thomas lake he could easily understand it was only from him that authority to visit her father could be obtained after remaining irresolute for a few minutes during which the magnificent structure around him faded entirely from his view like a vision melting into air and he heard no more the pleasant plashing of the fountain he proceeded to the great hall near the cloister resolved to wait there till her return chapter xxv sir thomas lake a gravelooking man of a melancholy and severe aspect and attired in a loose robe of black velvet was seated alone in a chamber the windows of which opened upon the fountain court which we have just quitted he wore a silken skullcap from beneath which a few gray hairs escaped his brow was furrowed with innumerable wrinkles occasioned as much by thought and care as by age his pointed beard and moustaches were almost white contrasting strikingly with his dark jaundiced complexion the result of an atrabilarious temperament his person was extremely attenuated and his hands thin and bony he had once been tall but latterly had lost much of his height in consequence of a curvature of the spine which bowed down his head almost upon his breast and fixed it immoveably in that position his features were good but as we have stated were stamped with melancholy and sharpened by severity this person was sir thomas lake secretary of state the table at which he sat was strewn over with official documents and papers he was not however examining any of them but had just broken the seal of a private packet which he had received from his wife when an usher entered and intimated that a young maiden who was without solicited a moments audience the request would have been refused if the man had not gone on to say that he believed the applicant was the daughter of the crazy puritan who had threatened the kings life on the previous day on hearing this sir thomas consented to see her and she was admitted accordingly as soon as the usher had retired aveline unmuffled herself and cold and apathetic as he was sir thomas could not help being struck by her surpassing beauty unimpaired even by the affliction under which she laboured and he consequently softened in some degree the customary asperity of his tones in addressing her who are you maiden and what seek you he demanded eyeing her with curiosity i am daughter to the unfortunate hugh calveley now a prisoner in the palace she replied i am sorry to hear it rejoined sir thomas resuming his habitually severe expression for you are the daughter of a very heinous offender the enormity of hugh calveleys crime which is worse than parricide deprives him of all human sympathy and compassion in coming to me you do not i presume intend to weary me with prayers for mercy for none is deserved and none will be shown for my own part i shall not utter a word in mitigation of the dreadful sentence certain to be pronounced upon him nor shall i advise the slightest clemency to be shown him on the part of his majesty such an offender cannot be too severely punished i do not say this he continued somewhat softening his harshness to aggravate the distress and shame you naturally feel but i wish to check at once any hopes you may have formed yet though i have no pity for him i have much for you since doubtless you are innocent of all knowledge of your fathers atrocious designhappily prevented and i would therefore say to you shut out all feelings for him from your heart the man who raises his hand against his sovereign cuts off by the act all ties of kindred and love affection is changed to abhorrence and such detestation does his horrible offence inspire that those of his own blood are bound to shun him lest he derive comfort and consolation from their presence thus considered you are no longer his daughter for he has himself severed the links between you you no longer owe him filial duty and regard for to such he is no more entitled leave him to his fate and if possible for ever obliterate his memory from your breast you counsel what i can never perform honourable sir replied aveline and were he even branded like cain i could not shut my heart towards him nothing can make me forget that i am his daughter that his offence will be dreadfully expiated i do not doubt but if i can alleviate his sufferings in any way i will do so and i will never cease to plead for mercy for him and o honourable sir you regard his offence in a darker light than it deserves you treat him as if he had actually accomplished the direful purpose attributed to him whereas nothing has been proven against him beyond the possession of a weapon which he might keep about his person for selfdefence the plea you urge is futile maiden rejoined sir thomas he is judged out of his own mouth for his own lips have avowed his criminal intention still it was but the intention honourable sir in such cases the intention is equal to the crimeat least in the eyes of law and justice no plea will save hugh calveley of that rest assured one plea may be urged for him which whether it avail or not is the truth and shall be made it is painful to speak of my father as i must now do but there is no help for it of late years he has been subject to strange mental hallucinations which have bordered close upon madness if they have not reached that terrible point nocturnal vigils fastings and prayers have affected his health he has denied himself sufficient rest and has only partaken of food barely sufficient to sustain nature and no more the consequence has been that strange fancies have troubled his brain that at dead of night when alone in his chamber he has imagined that visions have appeared to him that voices have spokenawful voicestalking of prophecies lamentations and judgments and charging him with a mighty and terrible mission all these things i have heard from his own lips and i have heard and seen much more which has satisfied me that his intellects are disordered and that he cannot be held accountable for his actions if such be the case he should have been kept under restraint and not suffered to go abroad said sir thomas such madmen are highly mischievous and dangerous much blame rests with you maiden the whole blame is mine she exclaimed i confess my errormy crimeand will atone for it willingly with my life provided he be spared if a sacrifice must be made let me be the victim there is no sacrifice and no victim returned sir thomas gravely though he was not unmoved by her filial devotion there is an offender and there will be justice and justice must be satisfied inexorable as fate her dread sentences cannot be averted o honourable sir you may one day recall those words for which of us can hold himself free from offence my father is not guilty in the eyes of heaven or if he be i am equally culpable since i ought to have prevented the commission of the crime o i shall never forgive myself that i did not follow him when he parted from me yesterday let me hear how that occurred maiden asked sir thomas it chanced in this way sir i have already described my fathers state of mind and the distempered view he has been accustomed to take of all things yesterday mayday sports were held in the village of tottenham where we dwelt and as such things are an abomination in his sight he took upon him to reprove the actors in the pastimes they who witnessed his conduct on that occasion would hardly hold him to be under the due control of reason amongst the spectators was the son of an old friend whose name having accidentally reached my father he invited him into the house and a misunderstanding having arisen between them the latter suddenly leftdismissed almost with rudeness on his departure my father was greatly disturbedmore so than i have ever seen him after awhile he withdrew to his own chamber as was his habit to pray and i hoped would become tranquillized but the very reverse happened for when he reappeared i saw at once that a fearful change had taken place in him his eye blazed with preternatural light his gestures were wild and alarming and his language full of menace and denunciation he again spoke of his mission from heaven and said that its execution could no longer be delayed this should have been a warning to you observed sir thomas knitting his brows it should honourable sir but i did not profit by it i knew and felt that he was no longer under the dominion of reasonthat he was labouring under some terrible delusion that approached its crisis but i did not check him i yielded passive obedience to his injunction that i should depart instantly with an old servant to london and i agreed to tarry at a house which he mentioned till i heard from him i had sad forebodings that i should never hear from him againor if i did that the tidings would be worse than none at all but i obeyed i could not indeed resist his will i set forth with my attendant and my father parted with us at the door he placed money in my hand and bade me farewell but in such a tone and with such a look that i felt his senses were gone and i would have stayed him but it was then too late breaking from my embrace he sprang upon his horse which was ready saddled and rode off taking the direction of edmonton while i with a heart full of distress and misgiving pursued my way to london ere midnight my sad presentiments were verified a messenger traced me out bringing intelligence of the direful event that had happened and informing me that my father was a prisoner at theobalds as soon as i could procure means of reaching the palace i set forth and arrived here about an hour ago when failing in my efforts to obtain an interview with my father who is closely confined and none suffered to come near him save with authority from the secretary of state i sought an audience of you honourable sir in the hope that you would grant me permission to see him if i do grant it the interview must take place in the presence of the officer to whom his custody has been committed replied sir thomas with this restriction i am willing to sign an order for you be it as you please honourable sir and take my heartfelt gratitude for the grace sir thomas struck a small bell upon the table and the usher appeared at the summons bid the officer in charge of hugh calveley attend me he said the man bowed and departed sir thomas lake then turned to the paper which he had just opened before avelines appearance and was soon so much engrossed by it that he seemed quite unconscious of her presence his countenance became gloomier and more austere as he read on and an expression of painalmost a groanescaped him he appeared then to feel sensible that he had committed an indiscretion for he laid down the paper and as if forcibly diverting himself from its contents addressed aveline what you have said respecting your fathers condition of mind he observed by no means convinces me that it is so unsound as to render him irresponsible for his actions it were to put a charitable construction upon his conduct to say that no one but a madman could be capable of it but there was too much consistency in what he has said and done to admit of such an inference but for the interposition of another person he owned that he would have killed the king and the disappointment he exhibited and the language he used prove such to have been his fixed intention his mind may have been disturbed but what of that all who meditate great crimes it is to be hoped are not entirely masters of themselves yet for that reason they are not to be exempt from punishment he who is sane enough to conceive an act of wickedness to plan its execution and to attempt to perpetrate it although he may be in other respects of unsettled mind is equally amenable to the law and ought equally to suffer for his criminality with him who has a wiser and sounder head upon his shoulders aveline attempted no reply but the tears sprang to her eyes at this moment the door was thrown open by the usher to admit sir jocelyn mounchensey the emotion displayed by the young couple when thus brought together passed unnoticed by the secretary of state as he was occupied at the moment in writing the authority for aveline and did not raise his eyes towards them are you the officer to whom my fathers custody has been entrusted exclaimed aveline as soon as she could give utterance to her surprise why do you ask that question mistress demanded sir thomas looking up what can it signify to you who hath custody of your father provided good care be taken of him there is a latin maxim which his majesty cited at the banquet last nightetiam aconito inest remediumand which may be freely rendered by our homely saying that it is an ill wind that bloweth nobody good luck and this hath proved true with sir jocelyn mounchenseyfor the gust that hath wrecked your father hath driven him into port where he now rides securely in the sunshine of the kings favour nor is this to be wondered at since it was by sir jocelyn that his majestys life was preserved the king preserved by him exclaimed aveline in bewilderment ay marry and indeed young mistress rejoined sir thomas he arrested the fell traitor was knighted on the spot for the service by the king was invited afterwards to the grand banquet in the evening and received with more distinction than any other guest and he is now as you find entrusted with the custody of the prisoner thus if your father has done little good to himself he hath done much to sir jocelyn aveline could not repress an exclamation of anguish no more of this i entreat sir thomas cried sir jocelyn it is right she should hear the truth replied the secretary of state here is her authority for admittance to her father he continued giving it to him it must take place in your presence sir jocelyn and you will pay strict attention to what they say he added in a low tone for you will have to report all that passes between them to the council something may arise to implicate the girl herself so let naught escape you be vigilant in your office as is needful i mention this as you are new to it if the prisoner continues obstinate as he hath hitherto shown himself threaten him with the torture the rack will certainly be applied when he reaches the tower i need not give you further instructions i think sir jocelyn be pleased to return to me when the interview is over upon this he bowed gravely and sounded the bell for the usher unable to offer any remonstrance sir jocelyn approached aveline who could scarcely support herself with the intention of offering her assistance but she shrank from him and again muffling her face went forth while he slowly followed her chapter xxvi the forged confession some little time had elapsed since avelines departure on her sorrowful errand and sir thomas lake was still alone and once more deeply engrossed in the consideration of the document which it will be recollected had occasioned him so much disquietude and the feeling by no means diminished when the usher entered and announced lady lake severe and inflexible as we have described him the secretary of state was generally yielding enough towards his lady of whom he stood in great awe and whom he treated with the utmost deference but on this occasion contrary to habitude he received her very coldly and without rising motioned her to a seat beside him disregarding the want of attention which under other circumstances she would have resented lady lake took the seat indicated without remark and continued silent till the usher had retired then turning quickly towards her husband and fixing an inquiring look upon him she said in a low voice what think you of this document sir thomas this forgery he rejoined in the same tone but without raising his eyes towards her ay this forgery if you choose to call it so she returned let me have your opinion upon it is it as it should be are its expressions such as would be used by a guilty woman like the countess imploring pity and seeking to shield herself from disgrace do you find fault with it can it be amended in any particular i find such grave fault with it replied the secretary of state still without looking up that i would amend it by casting it into the flames lady lake it is my duty to warn you this is a fearful crime you would commit and severely punishable by the law you may excuse it to yourself because you have an end in view which seems to justify the means but the excuse will not avail you with others you have said that in a conflict with one so cunning and unscrupulous as our noble soninlaw you are compelled to fight him with his own weaponsto meet trick with trick manoevre with manoeuvre but take my word for it you would more easily defeat him by straightforward means be ruled by me in this one instance abandon a scheme which must inevitably lead to consequences i shudder to contemplate and let this fabricated confession be destroyed give it me she cried snatching the paper from him you were ever timid sir thomas and if you had not lacked courage this expedient would not have been necessary odious and dangerous as it is the measure is forced upon me and i shall not shrink from it but you shall not be called upon to play any part in the transaction i alone will do it i alone will be responsible for all that may ensue we shall all be responsible he rejoined you will not only ruin yourself but all your family if this fearful step be taken hitherto we have had right on our side but henceforth we shall be more culpable than the others i am resolved upon the course cried lady lake and all your argumentsall your warnings will not dissuade me from it so you may spare your breath sir thomas as you see i have omitted the charge of witchcraft and have only made the countess confess her criminality with lord roos and of this we have had abundant proofs nay we should have them still if those condemnatory letters of hers which had come into our possession had not been stolen that mischance necessitates the present measure having managed to deprive us of our weapons lord roos thinks himself secure but he will find his mistake when this document is produced to confound him i tremble at the thought groaned the secretary of state these fears are worse than womanish exclaimed his lady shake them off and be yourself who is to prove that the confession proceeds not from the countess not she herself since no one will believe her not lord roos for he will be equally discredited not diego for his testimony would be valueless the countesss handwriting has been so skilfully imitated that the falsification cannot be detected compare it with this note written by herself to lady roos and which though it proves nothing has so far answered my purpose compare i say the writing of the confession and the signature with this note and declare if you can discern any difference between them as to the signatures of lord roos and diego affixed to the document they are equally well simulated that the forgery is skilfully executed i do not deny replied the secretary of state and that circumstance though it does not lessen the crime may lessen the chance of detection since nothing i can urge will turn you from your design and you are determined to employ this dangerous instrument at least be cautious in its use terrify lord roos with it if you choose threaten to lay it before the earl of exeterbefore the king himselfin case of our soninlaws noncompliance with your demands but beware how you proceed further do not part with it for a moment so that if need be you may destroy it do you heed me my lady i do sir thomas she replied be assured i will act with due cautioni am glad to find you are coming round to my views and are disposed to countenance the measure i countenance it exclaimed the secretary of state in alarm no such thing i disapprove of it entirely and cannot sufficiently reprehend it but as i well know when you have once made up your mind the fiend himself cannot turn you from your purpose i give you the best counsel i can under the circumstances i wash my hands of it altogether would to heaven i had never been consulted upon itnever even been made acquainted with the project however as you have gone so far with me you may go a step further and let me know what story you mean to attach to this confession how will you feign to have obtained it the statement i shall make will be this and it will be borne out by so many corroborative circumstances that it will be impossible to contradict it you observe that the document is dated on the th of april last it is not without reason that it is so dated on that day i and our daughter lady roos attended by her maid sarah swarton proceeded to the earl of exeters residence at wimbledon for the purpose of having an interview with the countess and we then saw her in the presence of lord roos and his servant diego but you gained nothing by the journey remarked her husband your pardon sir thomas she rejoined i gained this confession on the way back i reflected upon what had occurred and i thought how flushed with triumph i should have been if instead of meeting with discomfiture i had gained my pointif i had brought the haughty countess to her kneeshad compelled her to write out and sign a full avowal of her guilt coupled with supplications for forgiveness from my injured daughter and myselfand as a refinement of revenge had forced lord roos and his servant to attest by their signatures the truth of the confession i thought of thisand incensed that i had not done it resolved it should be done an ill resolve muttered her husband in luke hatton our apothecary i had the man for my purpose pursued lady lake aware of his marvellous talent for imitating any writing he pleasedaware also that i could entirely rely upon him i resolved to call in his aid imprudent woman you have placed yourself wholly in his power groaned sir thomas suppose he should betray the terrible trust you have reposed in him he will not betray it replied lady lake he is too deeply implicated in the matter not to keep silence for his own sake but to proceed the document such as you see it was drawn out by myself and transcribed by luke hatton and the writing so admirably counterfeited that lady exeter herself may well doubt if it be not her own then as to the circumstances they will all bear me out we were known to have been at wimbledon on the day in question we were known to have had an interview with lady exeter at which lord roos and diego were present the interview was private and therefore no one can tell what took place at it but the probabilities are that what i shall assert really did occur sir thomas signified his assent and she went on the plot is well contrived and with prudent management cannot fail of success we have the time of the supposed occurrencethe actors in itand the scenefor i shall describe the particular room in which the interview really did take place and i shall further bring forward sarah swarton who will declare that she was concealed behind the hangings and heard the countess read over the confession before she signed it another party to the affairand a woman ejaculated sir thomas the dangers of discovery are multiplied a hundredfold the danger exists only in your imagination said his lady come admit sir thomas that the scheme is well contrived and that they must be cunning indeed if they escape from the meshes i have woven for them you have displayed ingenuity enough i am free to own if it had been directed to a better end but in the best contrived scheme some flaw is ever found which is sure to mar it you can detect no flaw in this i am persuaded sir thomas if you can let me know it nay it is only when too late that such things are found out the supposed armour of proof is then found wanting at some vital point however i will say no more he observed perceiving her impatience what is done cannot be undone have you prepared our daughter will she consent to aid you she will replied lady lake i had some difficulty with her at first but i found means to overrule her scruples and she consented at last to act as i desired provided all other means failed of accomplishing the object in view and they have failed since we have lost those letters for though i have one other proof left which might perhaps be adduced i do not attach much importance to it what is it inquired sir thomas quickly you shall know anon she answered suffice it i have done all i could to avoid having recourse to the present measure and have delayedits execution to the last moment but that proof of which you were speaking cried sir thomas let me hear it perhaps it may obviate the necessity of this dangerous proceeding i do not think so but you shall judge last night our daughter and myself obtained secret admittance to lord rooss chamber and we found the countess there and fainting in his arms why that is enough to convict them you want nothing more hear me to an end and you will change your opinion placing the inanimate countess on a couch and covering her face with a handkerchief lord roos had the effrontery to assert that we were mistaken insisting that it was not lady exeter we beheldbut her handmaiden gillian greenford and he appealed to the perfidious knave diego in confirmation of his assertion but you did not leave without satisfying yourselves of the truth demanded sir thomas his lordship took care we should have no means of doing so she answered he caused diego to convey her away by a secret staircase sdeath that was unlucky you have no proof then that it was the countess you beheld nothing beyond a lock of her hair which was secured by lady roos as the man was removing her that may be enough cried the secretary of state and prevent the necessity of resorting to this frightful expedient we must see the girl and interrogate her gillian greenford you say she is called she shall be brought hither at once it is possible she may be without returned lady lake before i came here i summoned her in your name we will see cried sir thomas striking upon the bell and the usher appearing to the summons informed him that in effect the damsel in question was in attendance she seems much alarmed sir thomas said the usher and has with her a young man who appears to take a tender interest in her and wishes to be present at the investigation let him come in with her said the secretary of state and seeing the usher pause he inquired if he had anything further to say his excellency the spanish ambassador and my lord roos are without and desire admittance replied the man sir thomas consulted his lady by a look and as she made no objection he signified his pleasure that they should be admitted and accordingly the door was thrown open for the entrance of all the persons mentioned gillian came first and seemed much embarrassed by the situation in which she found herself she had been well tutored for the part she had to play but the instructions she had received entirely fled from her mind as she found herself in the presence of two such awful personages as sir thomas lake and his lady both of whom fixed keen glances upon her feeling ready to drop with fright she looked at dick taverner as if imploring his support but this dick declined to afford his jealousy having been roused by what he had heard he determined to be governed in his conduct towards her by the result of the investigation accordingly though it cost him an effort he held back as the conde de gondomar appeared sir thomas lake arose and made him a profound salutation which was returned with equal ceremony by the spanish ambassador the latter however did not take a seat but remained standing with lord roos whose presence was acknowledged by a cold and distant bow from his fatherinlaw the young nobleman did not appear in the slightest degree disconcerted by the reception he met with or apprehensive of the result of the investigation he jested apart with de gondomar and both he and the spanish ambassador appeared greatly amused by gillians embarrassment behind him stood his servant diego you are handmaiden to the countess of exeter i presume demanded lady lake of the damsel i am my lady she answered the girl does not look as if the imputations cast upon her character can be true observed sir thomas lake as this was said poor gillian became suffused with blushes and hung her head before i put any further questions to her remarked lady lake i will ask lord roos if he still persists in affirming that it was this damsel who visited him last night dick taverner looked as if his fate depended upon the response the young nobleman might make to the inquiry i must decline to answer your ladyships question returned lord roos why cannot he speak out muttered dick this uncertainty is worse than anything what says the damsel herself observed sir thomas lake does she admit the charge you cannot expect her to do that sir thomas interposed lord roos i expect her to answer my question rejoined the secretary of state sharply were you in lord rooss room last night he added to gillian oh dear i am ready to faint she exclaimed catch me dickcatch me answer yes or no or i wont he rejoined well then yes if i must say something she replied poor dick fell back as if struck by a shot i dont believe it cried sir thomas nor i either said dick recovering himself i dont believe she could do such a wicked thing besides it was the foreign ambassador there he added pointing to de gondomar who seemed most enamoured of her yesterday and i shouldnt have been so much surprised if she had gone to see him perhaps she did he continued addressing the poor damsel who again hung her head i can take upon me to affirm that such was not the case observed de gondomar have you the lock of hair with you whispered sir thomas to his lady i have she replied taking a small packet from her bosom the movement did not pass unnoticed by lord roos and the spanish ambassador between whom an almost imperceptible smile passed if you have put all the interrogations you desire to make to gillian madam said lord roos to his motherinlaw perhaps she may be permitted to depart the situation cannot be agreeable to her a moment more my lord cried lady lake if i detain her it is to clear her character i know her to be perfectly innocent at this announcement dick taverners countenance brightened and he extended his arms towards gillian who gladly availed herself of his support i am quite sure she was not the person i surprised in your chamber last night continued lady lake indeed madam how do you arrive at that conviction because that persons hair was jet black whereas gillians as we see is of the exactly opposite colour dick taverner could not help pressing his lips against the back of the pretty damsels neck as this was uttered your proof of this madam demanded lord roos behold it she cried this look of hair was cut off before your visitant escaped and has remained in my possession ever since ha how is this she exclaimed as she unfolded the packet and disclosed a tress of fair hair evidently matching gillians lintwhite locks what transformation has taken place witchcraft has been practised this is the countesss work the minion must have been there after all cried dick taverner thrusting gillian from him the charge of witchcraft will not serve your turn madam said lord roos derisively the explanation is simple your eyes have deceived you most palpably cried the conde de gondomar who had caught gillian in his arms as the jealous apprentice cast her from him i am afraid her ladyship cannot see very clearly i see clearly enough that a trick has been practised upon me lady lake rejoined sharply but let lord roos look to himself i will have my revenge and a terrible one it shall be do not commit yourself said sir thomas in a low tone your business here is at an end fair maiden said the conde de gondomar to gillian and as your lover abandons you i am ready to take charge of you so saying he led her forth followed by lord roos whose smile of triumph exasperated his motherinlaw almost beyond endurance for a moment dick tayerner remained irresolute but his mistress had no sooner disappeared than he rushed after her vowing he would have her back if it cost him his life chapter xxvii the puritans prison hugh calveley it has already been intimated was lodged in a vault beneath the gateway the place was commonly used as a sort of blackhole for the imprisonment of any refractory member of the royal household or soldier on guard guilty of neglect of duty circular in shape it contained a large pillar to which iron rings and chains were attached the walls were of stone the roof arched with ribs springing from the pillar that supported it and the floor was paved window there was none but air was admitted through a small grated aperture in the roof and thus imperfectly ventilated it will not be wondered at that the vault should be damp moisture constantly trickled down the walls and collected in pools on the broken pavement but unwholesome as it was and altogether unfit for occupation it was deemed good enough for those generally thrust into it and far too good for its present tenant as the prisoner exhibited no violence the thongs with which his hands were bound were removed on his entrance to the vault and he was allowed the free use of his limbs the breastplate in which he was clad was taken from him and his vesture was again closely searched but no further discovery was made either of concealed weapon or of any paper or letter tending to show that he had accomplices in his dread design the only thing found upon him indeed was a small bible and this after it had been examined he was permitted to retain to the interrogatories put to him by master dendy the serjeantatarms he returned the briefest answers and when he had said as much as he thought fit he obstinately refused to make further reply incensed at his perversity and determined to extort a full confession in order that it might be laid before the king the serjeantatarms ordered the manacles to be applied but though the torture was exquisite he bore it with firmness and without uttering a groan maintaining the same determined silence as before had he dared master dendy would have had recourse to severer measures but having no warrant for any such proceeding he was obliged to content himself with threats to these hugh calveley replied by a grim smile of contempt but as the serjeantatarms was departing to make his report to sir thomas lake he said i have something to disclose but it is for the kings ear alone better reveal it to me rejoined dendy halting i have it in my power to render your situation far more tolerable or to inflict greater torment upon you make your choice deal with me as you please returned hugh calveley sternly what i have to say is to the king and to the king only and though you break every bone in my body with your engines and tear off my flesh with redhot pincers you shall not force the secret from me master dendy looked at him and felt disposed to place him in the dreadful instrument of torture called skeffingtons irons which was hanging against the wall but the consideration that had hitherto restrained himnamely that he was without authority for the step and might be called to account for itweighed with him still wherefore he contented himself with ordering the prisoner to be chained to the pillar and having seen the injunction obeyed he left him in this miserable plight hugh calveley remained for some hours without light and without food how the time was passed none knew but the two yeomen of the guard who entered the vault found him on his knees absorbed in prayer they brought a lamp with them and refreshments of a better kind than those usually afforded to a prisoner and set them before him but he refused to partake of them the only favour he besought was permission to read his bible and the lamp placed within reach he was soon deeply engrossed in the perusal of those pages from which when earnestly sought consolation has ever been derived under the most trying circumstances sir jocelyn had forborne to visit the prisoner from a fear that his presence might be painful but the office imposed upon him by the king left him no alternative and about midnight he descended to the vault to ascertain from personal inspection that hugh calveley was in safe custody the door was unlocked by the halberdier stationed at it and the young man found himself alone with the prisoner he was inexpressibly shocked by the spectacle he beheld as he had no idea how severely the unfortunate puritan had been treated nor of the sort of prison in which he was confined hugh calveley who was still intently reading the bible which he had placed upon his knee while he held the lamp near it to throw the light upon its leaves did not appear to be disturbed by the opening of the door nor did he raise his eyes but at last a deep groan issuing from the breast of the young man aroused him and he held up the lamp to ascertain who was near on discovering that it was sir jocelyn he knitted his brow and after sternly regarding him for a moment returned to his bible without uttering a word but finding the other maintained his post he demanded almost fiercely why he was disturbed can i do aught for your relief rejoined the young man at least i can have those chains taken off thou speakest as one in authority cried hugh calveley regarding him fixedly art thou appointed to be my jailer sir jocelyn made no answer but averted his head this only was wanting to fill up the measure of my scorn for thee pursued the puritan thou art worthy of thine office but show me no favour for i will receive none at thy hands i would rather wear these fetters to my death however much they may gall my limbs than have them struck off by thee i would rather rot in this dungeonay though it were worse than it isthan owe my liberation to thee the sole favour thou canst show me is to rid me of thy presence which is hateful to me and chases holy thoughts from my breast putting evil in their place why should this be so o friend of my father exclaimed sir jocelyn and why should my presence be hateful to you there is no man living whom i would less willingly offend than yourself and in all i have done where you have been concerned i have had no free agency judge me not then too harshly i commiserate your situation from the depths of my heart and would relieve it were it possible then wherefore persist in troubling me rejoined hugh calveley have i not good cause for my dislike of you you have disappointed the expectations i had formed of you you failed me when i put your professions to the test you thwarted my design at the moment when its success was certain and when the tyrant was completely in my power but for you i should not be here loaded with these fetters or if i were i should be consoled by the thought that i had liberated my country from oppression instead of being crushed by the sense of failure what seek you from me miserable timeserver have you not had your reward for the service you have rendered the king is he not grateful enough i have served as your steppingstone to promotion what more can i do you can cease to do me injustice returned sir jocelyn honours procured as mine have been are valueless and i would rather be without them i sought them not they have been forced upon me look at the matter fairly and you will see that all these consequences whether for good or ill have sprung from your own desperate act it may be so rejoined the puritan i will not dispute it but though ill has accrued to me and good to you i would not change positions with you you will wear the tyrants fetters for ever i shall soon be free from mine have you nothing to say concerning your daughter demanded the young man nothing replied the puritan with an expression of deep pain which however he checked by a mighty effort i have done with the world and desire not to be brought back to it and you refuse to be freed from your chains my sole desire as i have said is to be freed from you that wish at least shall be granted replied sir jocelyn as with a sad heart he departed chapter xxviii the secret thrice was the guard relieved during that long night and as often was the prisoner visited on the first occasion he was found to be still engaged with his bible and he so continued during the whole time the man remained in the vault the next who came discovered him on his knees praying loudly and fervently and unwilling to disturb him left him at his devotions but the third who entered was struck with terror at the prisoners appearance he had risen from the ground and was standing as erect as the fetters would permit with his hands outstretched and his eyes fixed on vacancy he was muttering something but his words were unintelligible he looked like one who beheld a vision and this impression was produced upon the man who half expected some awful shape to reveal itself to him but whatever it might be spirit of good or ill it was visible to the puritan alone after gazing at him for some minutes in mixed wonderment and fright the halberdier ventured to draw near him as he touched him the puritan uttered a fearful cry and attempted to spring forward as if to grasp some vanishing object but being checked in the effort by the chain he fell heavily to the ground and seemed to sustain severe injury for when the man raised him and set him against the pillar though he made no complaint it was evident he suffered excruciating pain the halberdier poured out a cup of wine and offered it to him but though wellnigh fainting he peremptorily refused it from this moment a marked change was perceptible in his looks the hue of his skin became cadaverous his eyes grew dim and glassy and his respiration was difficult everything betokened that his sufferings would be speedily over and that however he might deserve it hugh calveley would be spared the disgrace of death by the hands of the executioner the halberdier was not unaware of his condition and his first impulse was to summon assistance but he was deterred from doing so by the earnest entreaty of the puritan to be left alone and thinking this the most merciful course he could pursue under the circumstances he yielded to the request scarcely expecting to behold him alive again it was by this same man that the door of the vault was opened to sir jocelyn and aveline the shock experienced by the maiden at the sight of her father had wellnigh overcome her she thought him dead and such was sir jocelyns first impression the unfortunate puritan was still propped against the pillar as the halberdier had left him but his head had fallen to one side and his arms hung listlessly down with a piercing shriek his daughter flew towards him and kneeling beside him raised his head gently and gazing eagerly into his face perceived that he still lived though the spirit seemed ready to wing its flight from its fleshly tabernacle the situation was one to call forth every latent energy in avelines character controlling her emotion she uttered no further cry but set herself with calmness to apply such restoratives as were at hand to her father after bathing his temples and chafing his hands she had the satisfaction ere long of seeing him open his eyes at first he seemed to have a difficulty in fixing his gaze upon her but her voice reached his ears and the feeble pressure of his hand told that he knew her the power of speech returned to him at length and he faintly murmured my child i am glad to see you once more i thought all was over but it has pleased heaven to spare me for a few moments to give you my blessing bow down your head o my daughter and take it and though given by a sinner like myself it shall profit you may the merciful god who pardoneth all that repent even at the last hour and watcheth over the orphan bless you and protect you amen exclaimed jocelyn fervently who was it spoke demanded the puritan and as no answer was returned he repeated the inquiry it was ijocelyn mounchensey the son of your old friend replied the young man come nigh to me jocelyn said the dying man i have done you wrong and entreat your pardon o talk not thus cried jocelyn springing towards him i have nothing to forgive but much to be forgiven you have a noble heart jocelyn rejoined hugh calveley and in that respect resemble your father in his name i conjure you to listen to me you will not refuse my dying request i have a sacred trust to commit to you name it cried the young man and rest assured it shall be fulfilled give me some wine gasped the puritan faintly my strength is failing fast and it may revive me and with great effort he swallowed a few drops from the cup filled for him by jocelyn still his appearance was so alarming that the young man could not help urging him not to delay i understand replied hugh calveley slightly pressing his hand you think i have no time to lose and you are right my child then is the trust i would confide to you son behold thy sister daughter behold thy brother i will be more than a brother to her cried sir jocelyn earnestly more thou canst not be rejoined hugh calveley unless unless what demanded sir jocelyn i cannot explain cried the puritan with an expression of agony there is not time suffice it she is already promised in marriage father exclaimed aveline in surprise and with something of reproach i never heard of such an engagement before it has been made without my consent i charge you to fulfil it nevertheless my child if it be required said hugh calveley solemnly promise me this or i shall not die content speak let me hear you and she reluctantly gave the required promise sir jocelyn uttered an exclamation of anguish what afflicts you my son demanded the puritan to whom have you promised your daughter in marriage inquired the young man you have constituted me her brother and i am therefore entitled to inquire you will learn when the demand is made said the puritan you will then know why i have given the promise and the nature of the obligation imposed upon my daughter to fulfil it but is this obligation ever to remain binding demanded sir jocelyn if the claim be not made within a year after my death she is discharged from it replied hugh calveley o thanks father thanks exclaimed aveline at this moment the door of the vault was thrown open and two persons entered the foremost of whom sir jocelyn instantly recognised as the king the other was his majestys physician doctor mayerne turquet a glance sufficed to explain to the latter the state of the puritan ah parbleu the man is dying your majesty he exclaimed deeing is he cried james the mair reason he suld tell his secret to us without procrastination harkye prophet of ill he continued as he strode forward the judgment of heaven ye predicated for us seems to have fallen on your ainsell and to have laid you low even afore our arm could touch you ye have gude reason to be thankful you have escaped the woodie sae een make a clean breast of it confess your enormities and reveal to us the secret matter whilk we are tauld ye hae to communicate let all else withdraw a few paces said hugh calveley and do thou o king approach me what i have to say is for thine ear alone there will be no danger in granting his request inquired james of his physician none whatever replied doctor mayerne turquet the only danger is in delay your majesty should lose no time the man is passing rapidly away a few moments more and he will have ceased to exist on a sign from the king sir jocelyn then stepped aside but aveline refused to quit her father even for a moment as james drew near hugh calveley raised himself a little in order to address him i say unto thee o king he cried as elijah said unto ahab because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lordbehold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and i will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin now the muckle diel seize thee villain exclaimed james furiously is it to listen to thy texts that thou hast brought me hither and as hugh calveley exhausted by the effort he had made fell back with a groan he bent his head towards him crying the secret man the secret or the tormenter shall wring it from thee the puritan essayed to speak but his voice was so low that it did not reach the ears of the king what sayest thou he demanded speak louder saul of our body he exclaimed after a moments pause during which the sudden alteration that took place in the prisoners features made him suspect that all was over our belief is he will never speak again he hath escaped us and taen his secret wi him a loud shriek burst from aveline as she fell upon her fathers lifeless body let us forth cried the king stopping his ears we carena to be present at scenes like this we hae had a gude riddance o this traitor though we wad hae gladly heard what he had to tell sir jocelyn mounchensey ye will see that this young woman be cared for and when ye have caused her to be removed elsewhere follow us to the tenniscourt to which we shall incontinently adjourn so saying he quitted the vault with his physician chapter xxix luke hatton feigning sudden indisposition and the excuse was not altogether without foundation the countess of exeter quitted theobalds palace on the day after her unlucky visit to lord rooss chamber and proceeded to her husbands residence at wimbledon where she was speedily joined by her lover who brought her word of the advantage he had gained over their foe i have fairly checkmated my gracious motherinlaw he cried with a laugh and it would have diverted you as much as it did me and de gondomar who was present on the occasion if you could have witnessed her rage and mortification when she discovered the change that had been effected and that in place of your magnificent black ringlet which i now wear next my heart and shall ever keep as a lovetoken she had only a sorry specimen of your handmaidens lintwhite locks as i live it was truly laughable the good lady would have annihilated me if she could and threatened me with terrible reprisals at first she tried to attribute the transformation which she could not otherwise account for to witchcraft and though i derided the charge i must needs say the trick was so cleverly performed that it did look like magic the packet containing the tress of hair had never been out of her own keeping this she affirmed and it was true but there was a friendly hand to open it nevertheless to purloin its priceless treasure and to substitute something of a similar kind though of comparatively little value in its place that handone not likely to be suspected was no other than that of my ladys confidential attendant sarah swarton the juggle was played by her at the instance of diego anticipating some such occurrence as the present and desirous of having a spy upon the movements of our enemies i some time since directed diego to pay secret court to sarah and my forethought has now been rewarded the main difficulty lay with poor gillian she was greatly embarrassed by her situation and her perplexity was increased by the presence of a jealous lover in the shape of an apprentice who refused to leave her till his doubts should be satisfied this was awkward as the story could not be very well reconciled so as to suit all parties accordingly when the discovery was made which seemed to proclaim the poor girls infidelity the youths rage and consternation were nearly equal to lady lakes a circumstance that added considerable zest to the comedy but i see it does not divert you so much as i expected and therefore to relieve your mind i may tell you that the jealous varlet soon repented of his rash determination and pursuing his mistress whom do gondomar had considerately taken under his protection prevailed upon her to give the amorous ambassador the slip and return with him to her fathers abode at tottenham i am right glad to hear it said the countess though i have seen so little of gillian i cannot help taking an interest in her she is so pretty and so innocent in appearance and her manners are so artless and engaging i owe her some reparation for the mischief i have done her and will not neglect to make it i am sorry i ever was induced by you to take her into my service and i am thankful to hear she has escaped de gondomars snares you are wonderfully interested about her methinks frances and i hope she will be grateful for your consideration rejoined lord roos with a laugh but i should not be surprised if de gondomar still gained his point it is not his way to give up a pursuit he has once undertaken however to leave the pretty damsel to her fate which will depend entirely on her own conduct let us return to ourselves we have good reason to be satisfied with the issue of this adventure of the lock of hair nevertheless that recurrence to the charge of witchcraft on the part of my vindictive motherinlaw shows the extent of her malice and i cannot doubt that in threatening me with reprisals she will be as good as her word it behoves us therefore to be beforehand with her what she may intend i cannot say but i am satisfied she has a formidable scheme on foot and that nothing but her husbands interposition prevented its disclosure when she was so violently incensed against me you fill me with terror william exclaimed the countess will this womans hostility towards me never cease never replied lord roos with a sudden change of manner and laying aside the levity he had hitherto exhibited there is but one way of ending the struggle luke hatton can help us to it persuaded we should require him i have brought him with me he waits in the hall below with diego shall i summon him to our conference on no account exclaimed lady exeter hastily i will not see him you have done wrong to bring that poisoner here my lord you will destroy me listen to me frances replied lord roos the next step taken by lady lake will be fatal to us there must be no delay no irresolution on our part or all is lost i cannot depend upon myself or i would not call in anothers aid you will comprehend how wanting in firmness i am when i tell you what happened the other night incredible as it may sound my wife in order to prove her devotion to me and to free me from further annoyance on her part offered to take poison and but for my interference fool that i was to stay her would have drained the phial containing the deadly potion the weakness was momentary and i reproached myself for it when too late but it convinced me that a firmer hand than mine must be employed in the task and can you after what you have related williamcan you seriously meditate the destruction of a fond woman who has generosity enough to lay down her life for you this is more incredible than the restmore monstrously wicked wicked it may be but the excuseif i have anylies in my overwhelming passion for you frances replied lord roos in a frenzied tone and it seems decided by the relentless destiny that governs me that the continued indulgence of the fatal passion shall only be purchased at the price of my soul that penalty i am prepared to pay rather than lose you i will become obdurate will turn my heart to stone so that it shall no more melt at the tears of this fond foolish woman and i will slay her without remorse any other obstacle between us shall be removedbe it her mother her fatheryour husband i will immolate a hundred victims at the altar of our love i will shrink from nothing to make you mine for ever for i would rather share eternal bale with you frances than immortal bliss with another you almost make me fancy some evil being has obtained possession of you william said the countess gazing at him with affright it may be that the fiend himself hath accepted my wild offer he rejoined gloomily but if my wish be granted it matters not i will not listen to such fearful impiety said the countess shuddering let us dismiss this subject for the present and recur to it when you are calmer it cannot be postponed frances time presses and even now lady lake may have got the start of us i shall be calm enough when this is over will you consent to see luke hatton why need i see him inquired the countess with increasing uneasiness why will you force his hateful presence upon me if the deed must be done why can you not alone undertake it i will tell why i cannot he replied in a sombre tone and regarding her fixedly i must have a partner in the crime it will bind us to each other in links not to be severed i shall have no fear of losing you then countess i go to bring luke hatton to you and without waiting for her reply he strode out of the room lady exeter would have arrested him but she had not the nerve to do so and with an exclamation of anguish she fell back in her chair what dominion sin has usurped over me she mentally ejaculated i have lost the power of resisting its further encroachment i see the enormity of the offence i am about to commit and though my soul revolts at it i cannot hold back i am as one on the brink of a precipice who beholds the dreadful gulf before him into which another step must plunge him yet is too giddy to retreat and must needs fall over pity me kind heaven i am utterly helpless without thy aid while the unhappy lady thus unavailingly deplored the sad position in which her own misconduct had placed her and from which she felt wholly incapable of extricating herself while in this wretched frame of mind she awaited her lovers returnwith as we have shown some remains of good struggling with the evil in her bosomwe will cast a hasty glance round the chamber in which she sat and we are prompted to do this not because it merits particular description but because it was the room referred to by lady lake as the scene of the confession she had forged the apartment then was spacious and handsomely furnished in the heavy taste of the period with but little to distinguish it from other rooms visited by us in the course of this story like most of them it had a gloomy air caused by the dark hue of its oaken panels and the heavy folds of its antiquated and faded tapestry the latter was chiefly hung against the lower end of the chamber and served as a screen to one of the doors at the opposite end there was a wide and deep bay window glowing with stained glass amid the emblazonry of which might be discerned the proud escutcheon of the house of exeter with the two lions rampant forming its supporters on the right of the enormous carved mantelpiece which with its pillars statues scutcheons and massive cornice mounted to the very ceiling was hung a portrait of the earl of exetera grave dignified personage clad in the attire of elizabeths time and on the left was a likeness of the countess herself painted in all the pride of her unequalled beauty and marvellous in resemblance then but how different in expression from her features now in the recess of the window stood an oak table covered with a piece of rich carpet fringed with gold on which a massive silver inkstand and materials for writing were placed and this table was seized upon by lady lake as a feature in her plot here she would have it the confession was signed by the countess another point in reference to this scheme must not be passed unnoticed we have mentioned the heavy hangings at the lower end of the room according to the plotter it was behind these that sarah swartonthe intended witness of the imaginary scenewas concealed the principal subjects represented on the arras were the judgment of solomon and the temptation of our first parents in the garden by the serpent the hangings had evidently not been removed for years and did not reach within two feet of the grounda circumstance that had escaped the attention of lady lakeproving the truth of her husbands observation that in the best contrived plot some imperfection will exist certain to operate in its detection to return to the unhappy countess so lost was she in reflection that she did not remark lord rooss return till made aware of it by a slight touch on the shoulder when she raised her eyes they fell upon an object that inspired her with the dread and aversion that a noxious reptile might have produced she had never seen luke hatton before and if she had figured him to her mind at all it was not as anything agreeable but she was not prepared for so hideous and revolting a personage as he appeared to be his face was like an ugly mask on which a sardonic grin was stamped his features were large and gaunt and he had the long hooked nose and the sharppointed bestial ears of a satyr with leering eyesbetokening at once sensuality and cunning he had the chin and beard of a goat and crisplycurled hair of a pale yellow colour with all this there was something sordid in his looks as well as his attire which showed that to his other vices he added that of avarice a mock humility belied by the changeless sneer upon his countenance distinguished his deportment it could be seen at once that however cringing he might be he despised the person he addressed moreover in spite of all his efforts to control it there was something sarcastic in his speech his doublet and hose both of which had endured some service and were wellnigh threadbare were tawnycoloured and he wore a short yellow cloak a great ruff of the same colour and carried a brown steeplecrowned hat in his hand i await your ladyships commands said luke hatton bowing obsequiously i have none to give you lady exeter rejoined with irrepressible disgust i have not sent for you go hence not at all abashed by this reception luke hatton maintained his place and threw an inquiring glance at lord roos my dear countess said the young nobleman seating himself negligently upon a tabouret beside her i must pray you not to dismiss this worthy man so hastily you will find him eminently serviceable and as to his trustworthiness i have the best reasons for feeling satisfied of it because i hold in my hand a noose which whenever i please i can tighten round his neck of this he is quite aware and therefore he will serve us faithfully as well from fear as from gratitude her ladyship may place entire confidence in me remarked luke hatton with a grin this is not the first affair of the kind in which i have been engaged i have prepared potions and powders which mistress turner with whose reputation your ladyship must needs be acquainted used to vend to her customers my draughts have removed many a troublesome husband and silenced many a jealous wife i have helped many an heir to the speedy enjoyment of an inheritance which but for my assistance would not have come to him for years the lover with a rival in his way who has come to me has soon been freed from all anxiety on that score the courtier eager for a post which a superior held has gained it by my aid yet none of those whom i have thus benefited have been suspected your ladyship i repeat need have no fears of meand no scruples with me state your wishes and they shall be implicitly obeyed i have no wish except to be relieved of a presence which is disagreeable to me replied the countess again luke hatton consulted lord roos with a regard i find i must act for her ladyship said the young nobleman you will take therefore the instructions i shall give you as proceeding from her what two names do you find upon that paper those of your lordships wife and motherinlaw returned luke hatton you comprehend what her ladyship would have done with those persons said lord roos looking at him steadfastly perfectly replied luke hatton o do not give this fatal order my lord cried lady exeter trembling how many days do you require to effect their removal demanded lord roos without appearing to notice her remark i do not require many hours replied luke hatton but it will be well not to be too precipitate neither must they die at the same time all precaution shall be taken the names are placed in a particular order is it so the countess would have them taken in that case i must commence with lady roos wretch dost thou dare to make such an appeal to me cried lady exeter rising begone instantly i say thou hast no order whatever from me or if thou fanciest so i revoke it the order cannot be revoked cried lord roos grasping her arm this is not a time for hesitation or repentance having commenced the work you must go through with itwhether you will or not whether i will or not exclaimed lady exeter regarding him with angry surprise have i heard you aright my lord am i to be forced into association in this foul deed have i sunk so low in your esteem that you venture to treat me thus pardon me francespardon me he cried imploringly i have said more than i intended if i appear to exercise undue influence over you now you will forgive me hereafter because the situation is one that requires decision and that quality i possess in a higher degree than yourself luke hatton must obey the orders given him and you must sanction them never she exclaimed emphatically then we part for ever cried lord roos no matter what the pang may benor what befals mei will go farewell for ever countess stay she cried we must not part thus then you consent he exclaimed luke hatton receives his orders from you ask me not that question she cried with a shudder if her ladyship will but sign this said luke hatton holding towards her the paper on which the names were written it will suffice for me you hear what he says frances you will do it cried lord roos tis but a few strokes of a pen those few strokes will cost me my soul she rejoined but if it must he so it must give me the pen and as lord roos complied she signed the paper nov you may go said lord roos to luke hatton who received the paper with a diabolical grin you may count upon your reward in a weeks time my lord said luke hatton still grinning and shifting his glance from the halffainting countess to the young nobleman in a weeks time he repeated you will have to put on mourning for your wifeand in a month for your motherinlaw and with a cringing bow and moving with a soft catlike footstep he quitted the room leaving the guilty pair alone together end of vol i
