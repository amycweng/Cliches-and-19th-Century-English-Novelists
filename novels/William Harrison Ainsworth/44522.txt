the household of the worthy carpenter it may be conceived was thrown into the utmost confusion and distress by the unaccountable disappearance of the two boys as time wore on and they did not return mr woods anxiety grew so insupportable that he seized his hat with the intention of sallying forth in search of them though he did not know whither to bend his steps when his departure was arrested by a gentle knock at the door there he is cried winifred starting up joyfully and proving by the exclamation that her thoughts were dwelling upon one subject only there he is i fear not said her father with a doubtful shake of the head thames would let himself in and jack generally finds an entrance through the backdoor or the shopwindow when he has been out at untimely hours but go and see who it is love stay ill go myself his daughter however anticipated him she flew to the door but returned the next minute looking deeply disappointed and bringing the intelligence that it was only mrs sheppard who almost screamed mrs wood jack sheppards mother answered the little girl dejectedly she has brought a basket of eggs from willesden and some flowers for you for me vociferated mrs wood in indignant surprise eggs for me you mistake child they must be for your father no im quite sure she said theyre for you replied winifred but she does want to see father i thought as much sneered mrs wood ill go to her directly said wood bustling towards the door i dare say she has called to inquire about jack i dare say no such thing interposed his better half authoritatively remain where you are sir at all events let me send her away my dear supplicated the carpenter anxious to avert the impending storm do you hear me cried the lady with increasing vehemence stir a foot at your peril but my love still remonstrated wood you know im going to look after the boys after mrs sheppard you mean sir interrupted his wife ironically dont think to deceive me by your false pretences marry come up im not so easily deluded sit down i command you winny show the person into this room ill see her myself and thats more than she bargained for ill be sworn finding it useless to struggle further mr wood sank submissively into a chair while his daughter hastened to execute her arbitrary parents commission at length i have my wish continued mrs wood regarding her husband with a glance of vindictive triumph i shall behold the shameless hussy face to face and if i find her as goodlooking as shes represented i dont know what ill do in the end but ill begin by scratching her eyes out in this temper it will naturally be imagined that mrs woods reception of the widow who at that moment was ushered into the room by winifred was not particularly kind and encouraging as she approached the carpenters wife eyed her from head to foot in the hope of finding something in her person or apparel to quarrel with but she was disappointed mrs sheppards dressextremely neat and clean but simply fashioned and of the plainest and most unpretending materialoffered nothing assailable and her demeanour was so humble and her looks so modest thatif she had been illlookingshe might possibly have escaped the shafts of malice preparing to be levelled against her but alas she was beautifuland beauty is a crime not to be forgiven by a jealous woman as the lapse of time and change of circumstances have wrought a remarkable alteration in the appearance of the poor widow it may not be improper to notice it here when first brought under consideration she was a miserable and forlorn object squalid in attire haggard in looks and emaciated in frame now she was the very reverse of all this her dress it has just been said was neatness and simplicity itself her figure though slight had all the fulness of health and her complexionstill pale but without its former sickly castcontrasted agreeably by its extreme fairness with the dark brows and darker lashes that shaded eyes which if they had lost some of their original brilliancy had gained infinitely more in the soft and chastened lustre that replaced it one marked difference between the poor outcast who oppressed by poverty and stung by shame had sought temporary relief in the stupifying draughtthat worst medicine of a mind diseasedand those of the same being freed from her vices and restored to comfort and contentment if not to happiness by a more prosperous course of events was exhibited in the mouth for the fresh and feverish hue of lip which years ago characterised this feature was now substituted a pure and wholesome bloom evincing a total change of habits and though the coarse character of the mouth remained in some degree unaltered it was so modified in expression that it could no longer be accounted a blemish in fact the whole face had undergone a transformation all its better points were improved while the less attractive ones and they were few in comparison were subdued or removed what was yet more worthy of note was that the widows countenance had an air of refinement about it of which it was utterly destitute before and which seemed to intimate that her true position in society was far above that wherein accident had placed her well mrs sheppard said the carpenter advancing to meet her and trying to look as cheerful and composed as he could what brings you to town ehnothing amiss i trust nothing whatever sir answered the widow a neighbour offered me a drive to paddington and as i havent heard of my son for some time i couldnt resist the temptation of stepping on to inquire after him and to thank you for your great goodness to us both ive brought a little gardenstuff and a few newlaid eggs for you maam she added turning to mrs wood who appeared to be collecting her energies for a terrible explosion in the hope that they may prove acceptable heres a nosegay for you my love she continued opening her basket and presenting a fragrant bunch of flowers to winifred if your mother will allow me to give it you dont touch it winny screamed mrs wood it may be poisoned im not afraid mother said the little girl smelling at the bouquet how sweet these roses are shall i put them into water put them where they came from replied mrs wood severely and go to bed but mother maynt i sit up to see whether thames returns implored winifred what can it matter to you whether he returns or not child rejoined mrs wood sharply ive spoken and my words lawwith you at least she added bestowing a cutting glance upon her husband the little girl uttered no remonstrance but replacing the flowers in the basket burst into tears and withdrew mrs sheppard who witnessed this occurrence with dismay looked timorously at wood in expectation of some hint being given as to the course she had better pursue but receiving none for the carpenter was too much agitated to attend to her she ventured to express a fear that she was intruding intruding echoed mrs wood to be sure you are i wonder how you dare show your face in this house hussy i thought you sent for me maam replied the widow humbly so i did retorted mrs wood and i did so to see how far your effrontery would carry you im sure im very sorry i hope i havent given any unintentional offence said the widow again meekly appealing to wood dont exchange glances with him under my very nose woman shrieked mrs wood ill not bear it look at me and answer me one question and mind no prevaricatingnothing but the truth will satisfy me mrs sheppard raised her eyes and fixed them upon her interrogator are you not that mans mistress demanded mrs wood with a look meant to reduce her supposed rival to the dust i am no mans mistress answered the widow crimsoning to her temples but preserving her meek deportment and humble tone thats false cried mrs wood im too well acquainted with your proceedings madam to believe that profligate women are never reclaimed he has told me sufficient of you my dear interposed wood for goodness sake i will speak screamed his wife totally disregarding the interruption i will tell this worthless creature what i know about herand what i think of her not now my lovenot now entreated wood yes now rejoined the infuriated dame perhaps i may never have another opportunity she has contrived to keep out of my sight up to this time and ive no doubt shell keep out of it altogether for the future that was my doing dearest urged the carpenter i was afraid if you saw her that some such scene as this might occur hear me madam i beseech you interposed mrs sheppard and if it please you to visit your indignation on any one let it be upon me and not on your excellent husband whose only fault is in having bestowed his charity upon so unworthy an object as myself unworthy indeed sneered mrs wood to him i owe everything continued the widow life itselfnay more than lifefor without his assistance i should have perished body and soul he has been a father to me and my child i never doubted the latter point i assure you madam observed mrs wood you have said pursued the widow that she who has once erred is irreclaimable do not believe it madam it is not so the poor wretch driven by desperation to the commission of a crime which her soul abhors is no more beyond the hope of reformation than she is without the pale of mercy i have sufferedi have sinnedi have repented and though neither peace nor innocence can be restored to my bosom though tears cannot blot out my offences nor sorrow drown my shame yet knowing that my penitence is sincere i do not despair that my transgressions may be forgiven mighty fine ejaculated mrs wood contemptuously you cannot understand me madam and it is well you cannot blest with a fond husband surrounded by every comfort you have never been assailed by the horrible temptations to which misery has exposed me you have never known what it is to want food raiment shelter you have never seen the child within your arms perishing from hunger and no relief to be obtained you have never felt the hearts of all hardened against you have never heard the jeer or curse from every lip nor endured the insult and the blow from every hand i have suffered all this i could resist the tempter now i am strong in healthin mind but thenoh madam there are momentsmoments of darkness which overshadow a whole existencein the lives of the poor houseless wretches who traverse the streets when reason is wellnigh benighted when the horrible promptings of despair can alone be listened to and when vice itself assumes the aspect of virtue pardon what i have said madam i do not desire to extenuate my guiltfar less to defend it but i would show you and such as youwho happily are exempted from trials like minehow much misery has to do with crime and i affirm to you on my own conviction that she who falls because she has not strength granted her to struggle with affliction may be reclaimedmay repent and be forgiveneven as she whose sins though many were forgiven her it gladdens me to hear you talk thus joan said wood in a voice of much emotion while his eyes filled with tears and more than repays me for all i have done for you if professions of repentance constitute a magdalene mrs sheppard is one no doubt observed mrs wood ironically but i used to think it required something more than mere words to prove that a persons character was abused very right my love said wood very sensibly remarked so it does bu i can speak to that point mrs sheppards conduct from my own personal knowledge has been unexceptionable for the last twelve years during that period she has been a model of propriety oh of course rejoined mrs wood i cant for an instant question such distinterested testimony mrs sheppard im sure will say as much for you hes a model of conjugal attachment and fidelity a pattern to his family and an example to his neighbours aint he madam he is indeed replied the widow fervently moremuch more than that hes no such thing cried mrs wood furiously hes a base deceitful tyrannical hoaryheaded libertinethats what he is but ill expose him ill proclaim his misdoings to the world and then we shall see where hell stand marry come up ill show him what an injured wife can do if all wives were of my mind and my spirit husbands would soon be taught their own insignificance but a time will come and that before long when our sex will assert its superiority and when we have got the upper hand let em try to subdue us if they can but dont suppose madam that anything i say has reference to you im speaking of virtuous womenof wives madam mistresses neither deserve consideration nor commiseration i expect no commiseration returned mrs sheppard gently nor do i need any but rather than be the cause of any further misunderstanding between you and my benefactor i will leave london and its neighbourhood for ever pray do so madam retorted mrs wood and take your son with you my son echoed the widow trembling yes your son madam if you can do any good with him its more than we can the house will be well rid of him for a more idle goodfornothing reprobate never crossed its threshold is this true sir cried mrs sheppard with an agonized look at wood i know youll not deceive me is jack what mrs wood represents him hes not exactly what i could desire him to be joan replied the carpenter reluctantly but a ragged colt sometimes makes the best horse hell mend i hope never said mrs woodhell never mend he has taken more than one step towards the gallows already thieves and pickpockets are his constant companions thieves exclaimed mrs sheppard horrorstricken jonathan wild and blueskin have got him into their hands continued mrs wood impossible exclaimed the widow wildly if you doubt my word woman replied the carpenters wife coldly ask mr wood i know youll contradict it sir said the widow looking at wood as if she dreaded to have her fears confirmedi know you will i wish i could joan returned the carpenter sadly mrs sheppard let fall her basket my son she murmured wringing her hands piteously my son the companion of thieves my son in jonathan wilds power it cannot be why not rejoined mrs wood in a taunting tone your sons father was a thief and jonathan wild unless im misinformed was his friendso its not unnatural he should show some partiality towards jack jonathan wild was my husbands bitterest enemy said mrs sheppard he first seduced him from the paths of honesty and then betrayed him to a shameful death and he has sworn to do the same thing by my son oh heavens that i should have ever indulged a hope of happiness while that terrible man lives compose yourself joan said wood all will yet be well oh nono replied mrs sheppard distractedly all cannot be well if this is true tell me sir she added with forced calmness and grasping woods arm what has jack done tell me in a word that i may know the worst i can bear anything but suspense youre agitating yourself unnecessarily joan returned wood in a soothing voice jack has been keeping bad company thats the only fault i know of thank god for that ejaculated mrs sheppard fervently then it is not too late to save him where is he sir can i see him no that you cant answered mrs wood he has gone out without leave and has taken thames darrell with him if i were mr wood when he does return id send him about his business i wouldnt keep an apprentice to set my authority at defiance mr woods reply if he intended any was cut short by a loud knocking at the door oddsmylifewhats that he cried greatly alarmed its jonathan wild come back with a troop of constables at his heels to search the house rejoined mrs wood in equal trepidation we shall all be murdered oh that mr kneebone were here to protect me if it is jonathan rejoined wood it is very well for mr kneebone hes not here hed have enough to do to protect himself without attending to you i declare im almost afraid to go to the door something im convinced has happened to the boys has jonathan wild been here today asked mrs sheppard anxiously to be sure he has returned mrs wood and blueskin too theyre only just gone mercy on us what a clatter she added as the knocking was repeated more violently than before while the carpenter irresolutely quitted the room with a strong presentiment of ill upon his mind a light quick step was heard descending the stairs and before he could call out to prevent it a man was admitted into the passage is this misther wudds my pretty miss demanded the rough voice of the irish watchman it is seplied winifred have you brought any tidings of thames darrell troth have i replied terence but bless your angilic face how did you contrive to guess that is he wellis he safeis he coming back cried the little girl disregarding the question hes in st giless roundhouse answered terence but tell mr wudd im here and have brought him a message from his unlawful son and dont be detainin me my darlin for theres not a minute to lose if the poor lads to be recused from the clutches of that thief and thieftaker o the wurld jonathan wild the carpenter upon whom no part of this hurried dialogue had been lost now made his appearance and having obtained from terence all the information which that personage could impart respecting the perilous situation of thames he declared himself ready to start to saint giless at once and ran back to the room for his hat and stick expressing his firm determination as he pocketed his constables staff with which he thought it expedient to arm himself of being direfully revenged upon the thieftaker a determination in which he was strongly encouraged by his wife terence meanwhile who had followed him did not remain silent but recapitulated his story for the benefit of mrs sheppard the poor widow was thrown into an agony of distress on learning that a robbery had been committed in which her son for she could not doubt that jack was one of the boys was implicated nor was her anxiety alleviated by mrs wood who maintained stoutly that if thames had been led to do wrong it must be through the instrumentality of his worthless companion and there youre right you may dipind marm observed terence master thames dittwhats his blessed namehas honesty written in his handsome phiz but as to his companion jack sheppard i think you call him hes a born and bred thief lord bless you marm we sees plenty on em in our purfession them young prigs is all alike i seed he was oneand a sharp un tooat a glance oh exclaimed the widow covering her face with her hands take a drop of brandy before we start watchman said wood pouring out a glass of spirit and presenting it to terence who smacked his lips as he disposed of it wont you be persuaded joan he added making a similar offer to mrs sheppard which she gratefully declined if you mean to accompany us you may need it you are very kind sir returned the widow but i require no support nothing stronger than water has passed my lips for years we may believe as much of that as we please i suppose observed the carpenters wife with a sneer mr wood she continued in an authoritative tone seeing her husband ready to depart one word before you set out if jack sheppard or his mother ever enter this house again i leave itthats all now do what you please you know my fixed determination mr wood made no reply but hastily kissing his weeping daughter and bidding her be of good cheer hurried off he was followed with equal celerity by terence and the widow traversing what remained of wych street at a rapid pace and speeding along drury lane the trio soon found themselves in kendrick yard when they came to the roundhouse terrys courage failed him such was the terror inspired by wilds vindictive character that few durst face him who had given him cause for displeasure aware that he should incur the thieftakers bitterest animosity by what he had done the watchman whose wrath against quilt arnold had evaporated during the walk thought it more prudent not to hazard a meeting with his master till the storm had in some measure blown over accordingly having given wood such directions as he thought necessary for his guidance and received a handsome gratuity in return for his services he departed it was not without considerable demur and delay on the part of sharples that the carpenter and his companion could gain admittance to the roundhouse reconnoitring them through a small grated loophole he refused to open the door till they had explained their business this wood acting upon terrys caution was most unwilling to do but finding he had no alternative he reluctantly made known his errand and the bolts were undrawn once in the constables manner appeared totally changed he was now as civil as he had just been insolent apologizing for their detention he answered the questions put to him respecting the boys by positively denying that any such prisoners had been entrusted to his charge but offered to conduct him to every cell in the building to prove the truth of his assertion he then barred and doublelocked the door took out the key a precautionary measure which with a grim smile he said he never omitted thrust it into his vest and motioning the couple to follow him led the way to the inner room as wood obeyed his foot slipped and casting his eyes upon the floor he perceived it splashed in several places with blood from the freshness of the stains which grew more frequent as they approached the adjoining chamber it was evident some violence had been recently perpetrated and the carpenters own blood froze within his veins as he thought with a thrill of horror that perhaps on this very spot not many minutes before his arrival his adopted son might have been inhumanly butchered nor was this impression removed as he stole a glance at mrs sheppard and saw from her terrified look that she had made the same alarming discovery as himself but it was now too late to turn back and nerving himself for the shock he expected to encounter he ventured after his conductor no sooner had they entered the room than sharples who waited to usher them in hastily retreated closed the door and turning the key laughed loudly at the success of his stratagem vexation at his folly in suffering himself to be thus entrapped kept wood for a short time silent when he could find words he tried by the most urgent solicitations to prevail upon the constable to let him out but threats and entreatieseven promises were ineffectual and the unlucky captive after exhausting his powers of persuasion was compelled to give up the point the room in which he was detainedthat lately occupied by the mohocks who it appeared had been allowed to departwas calculated to inspire additional apprehension and disgust strongly impregnated with the mingled odours of tobacco ale brandy and other liquors the atmosphere was almost stifling the benches running round the room though fastened to the walls by iron clamps had been forcibly wrenched off while the table which was similarly secured to the boards was upset and its contentsbottles jugs glasses and bowls were broken and scattered about in all directions everything proclaimed the mischievous propensities of the recent occupants of the chamber here lay a heap of knockers of all sizes from the huge lions head to the small brass rapper there a collection of signboards with the names and calling of the owners utterly obliterated on this side stood the instruments with which the latter piece of pleasantry had been effectednamely a bucket filled with paint and a brush on that was erected a trophy consisting of a watchmans rattle a laced hat with the crown knocked out and its place supplied by a lantern a campaign wig saturated with punch a torn steenkirk and ruffles some halfdozen staves and a broken sword as the carpenters gaze wandered over this scene of devastation his attention was drawn by mrs sheppard towards an appalling object in one corner this was the body of a man apparently lifeless and stretched upon a mattress with his head bound up in a linen cloth through which the blood had oosed near the body which it will be surmised was that of abraham mendez two ruffianly personages were seated quietly smoking and bestowing no sort of attention upon the newcomers their conversation was conducted in the flash language and though unintelligible to wood was easily comprehended by this companion who learnt to her dismay that the wounded man had received his hurt from her son whose courage and dexterity formed the present subject of their discourse from other obscure hints dropped by the speakers mrs sheppard ascertained that thames darrell had been carried offwhere she could not make outby jonathan wild and quilt arnold and that jack had been induced to accompany blueskin to the mint this intelligence which she instantly communicated to the carpenter drove him almost frantic he renewed his supplications to sharples but with no better success than heretofore and the greater part of the night was passed by him and the poor widow whose anxiety if possible exceeded his own in the most miserable state imaginable at length about three oclock as the first glimmer of dawn became visible through the barred casements of the roundhouse the rattling of bolts and chains at the outer door told that some one was admitted whoever this might be the visit seemed to have some reference to the carpenter for shortly afterwards sharples made his appearance and informed the captives they were free without waiting to have the information repeated wood rushed forth determined as soon as he could procure assistance to proceed to jonathan wilds house in the old bailey while mrs sheppard whose maternal fears drew her in another direction hurried off to the mint chapter xiv the flash ken in an incredibly short space of timefor her anxiety lent wings to her feetmrs sheppard reached the debtors garrison from a scout stationed at the northern entrance whom she addressed in the jargon of the place with which long usage had formerly rendered her familiar she ascertained that blueskin accompanied by a youth whom she knew by the description must be her son had arrived there about three hours before and had proceeded to the cross shovels this was enough for the poor widow she felt she was now near her boy and nothing doubting her ability to rescue him from his perilous situation she breathed a fervent prayer for his deliverance and bending her steps towards the tavern in question revolved within her mind as she walked along the best means of accomplishing her purpose aware of the cunning and desperate characters of the persons with whom she would have to dealaware also that she was in a quarter where no laws could be appealed to nor assistance obtained she felt the absolute necessity of caution accordingly when she arrived at the shovels with which as an old haunt in her bygone days of wretchedness she was well acquainted instead of entering the principal apartment which she saw at a glance was crowded with company of both sexes she turned into a small room on the left of the bar and as an excuse for so doing called for something to drink the drawers at the moment were too busy to attend to her and she would have seized the opportunity of examining unperceived the assemblage within through a little curtained window that overlooked the adjoining chamber if an impediment had not existed in the shape of baptist kettleby whose portly person entirely obscured the view the master of the mint in the exercise of his twofold office of governor and publican was mounted upon a chair and holding forth to his guests in a speech to which mrs sheppard was unwillingly compelled to listen gentlemen of the mint said the orator when i was first called some fifty years ago to the important office i hold there existed across the water three places of refuge for the oppressed and persecuted debtor we know it cried several voices it happened gentlemen pursued the master on a particular occasion about the time ive mentioned that the archduke of alsatia the sovereign of the savoy and the satrap of salisbury court met by accident at the cross shovels a jolly night we made of it as you may suppose for four such monarchs dont often come together well while we were smoking our pipes and quaffing our punch alsatia turns to me and says mint says he youre well off herepretty well says i youre not badly off at the friars for that matteroh yes we are says hehow so says iits all up with us says he theyve taken away our charterthey cant says ithey have says hethey cant i tell you says i in a bit of a passion its unconstitutionalunconstitutional or not says salisbury court and savoy speaking together its true we shall become a prey to the philistines and must turn honest in selfdefenceno fear o that thought ii see how itll be observed alsatia everybodyll pay his debts and only think of such a state of things as thatits not to be thought of says i thumping the table till every glass on it jingled and i know a way asll prevent itwhat is it mint asked all threewhy hang every bailiff that sets a foot in your territories and youre safe says iwell do it said they filling their glasses and looking as fierce as king georges grenadier guards heres your health mint but gentlemen though they talked so largely and looked so fiercely they did not do it they did not hang the bailiffs and where are they ay where are they echoed the company with indignant derision gentlemen returned the master solemnly it is a question easily answeredthey are nowhere had they hanged the bailiffs the bailiffs would not have hanged them we ourselves have been similarly circumstanced attacked by an infamous and unconstitutional statute passed in the reign of the late usurper william of orange for i may remark that if the right king had been upon the throne that illegal enactment would never have received the royal assentthe stuartsheaven preserve emalways siding with the debtors attacked in this outrageous manner i repeat it has been all but up with us but the vigorous resistance offered on that memorable occasion by the patriotic inhabitants of bermuda to the aggressions of arbitrary power secured and established their privileges on a firmer basis than heretofore and while their pusillanimous allies were crushed and annihilated they became more prosperous than ever gentlemen i am proud to say that i originatedthat i directed those measures i hope to see the day when not southwark alone but london itself shall become one mintwhen all men shall be debtors and none creditorswhen imprisonment for debt shall be utterly abolishedwhen highwayrobbery shall be accounted a pleasant pastime and forgery an accomplishmentwhen tyburn and its gibbets shall be overthrowncapital punishments discontinuednewgate ludgate the gatehouse and the compters razed to the groundbridewell and clerkenwell destroyedthe fleet the kings bench and the marshalsea remembered only by name but in the mean time as that day may possibly be farther off than i anticipate we are bound to make the most of the present take care of yourselves gentlemen and your governor will take care of you before i sit down i have a toast to propose which i am sure will be received as it deserves to be with enthusiasm it is the health of a strangerof mr john sheppard his father was one of my old customers and i am happy to find his son treading in his steps he couldnt be in better hands than those in which he has placed himself gentlemenmr sheppards good health and success to him baptists toast was received with loud applause and as he sat down amid the cheers of the company and a universal clatter of mugs and glasses the widows view was no longer obstructed her eye wandered quickly over that riotous and disorderly assemblage until it settled upon one group more riotous and disorderly than the rest of which her son formed the principal figure the agonized mother could scarcely repress a scream at the spectacle that met her gaze there sat jack evidently in the last stage of intoxication with his collar opened his dress disarranged a pipe in his mouth a bowl of punch and a halfemptied rummer before himthere he sat receiving and returning or rather attempting to returnfor he was almost past consciousnessthe blandishments of a couple of females one of whom had passed her arm round his neck while the other leaned over the back of his chair and appeared from her gestures to be whispering soft nonsense into his ear both these ladies possessed considerable personal attractions the younger of the two who was seated next to jack and seemed to monopolize his attention could not be more than seventeen though her person had all the maturity of twenty she had delicate oval features light laughing blue eyes a pretty nez retrousse why have we not the term since we have the best specimens of the feature teeth of pearly whiteness and a brilliant complexion set off by rich auburn hair a very white neck and shouldersthe latter perhaps a trifle too much exposed the name of this damsel was edgeworth bess and as her fascinations will not perhaps be found to be without some influence upon the future fortunes of her boyish admirer we have thought it worth while to be thus particular in describing them the other bona roba known amongst her companions as mistress poll maggot was a beauty on a much larger scalein fact a perfect amazon nevertheless though nearly six feet high and correspondingly proportioned she was a model of symmetry and boasted with the frame of a thalestris or a trulla the regular lineaments of the medicean venus a mans laced hatwhether adopted from the caprice of the moment or habitually worn we are unable to statecocked knowingly on her head harmonized with her masculine appearance mrs maggot as well as her companion edgeworth bess was showily dressed nor did either of them disdain the aid supposed to be lent to a fair skin by the contents of the patchbox on an empty cask which served him for a chair and opposite jack sheppard whose rapid progress in depravity afforded him the highest satisfaction sat blueskin encouraging the two women in their odious task and plying his victim with the glass as often as he deemed it expedient to do so by this time he had apparently accomplished all he desired for moving the bottle out of jacks reach he appropriated it entirely to his own use leaving the devoted lad to the care of the females some few of the individuals seated at the other tables seemed to take an interest in the proceedings of blueskin and his party just as a bystander watches any other game but generally speaking the company were too much occupied with their own concerns to pay attention to anything else the assemblage was for the most part if not altogether composed of persons to whom vice in all its aspects was too familiar to present much of novelty in whatever form it was exhibited nor was jack by any means the only stripling in the room not far from him was a knot of lads drinking swearing and playing at dice as eagerly and as skilfully as any of the older hands near to these hopeful youths sat a fence or receiver bargaining with a clouter or pickpocket for a suitor to speak in more intelligible language a watch and seals two cloaks commonly called watchcases and a wedgelobb otherwise known as a silver snuffbox next to the receiver was a gang of housebreakers laughing over their exploits and planning fresh depredations and next to the housebreakers came two gallantlooking gentlemen in long periwigs and ridingdresses and equipped in all other respects for the road with a roast fowl and a bottle of wine before them amid this varied throngvaried in appearance but alike in characterone object alone we have said rivetted mrs sheppards attention and no sooner did she in some degree recover from the shock occasioned by the sight of her sons debased condition than regardless of any other consideration except his instant removal from the contaminating society by which he was surrounded and utterly forgetting the more cautious plan she meant to have adopted she rushed into the room and summoned him to follow her halloa cried jack looking round and trying to fix his inebriate gaze upon the speakerwhos that your mother replied mrs sheppard come home directly sir mother be returned jack who is it bess how should i know replied edgeworth bess but if it is your mother send her about her business that i will replied jack in the twinkling of a bedpost glad to see you once more in the mint mrs sheppard roared blueskin who anticipated some fun come and sit down by me take a glass of gin maam cried poll maggot holding up a bottle of spirit it used to be your favourite liquor ive heard jack my love cried mrs sheppard disregarding the taunt come away not i replied jack im too comfortable where i am be off jack exclaimed his unhappy parent mr sheppard if you please maam interrupted the lad i allow nobody to call me jack do i bess eh nobody whatever love replied edgeworth bess nobody but me dear and me insinuated mrs maggot my little fancy mans quite as fond of me as of you bess aint you jacky darling not quite poll returned mr sheppard but i love you next to her and both of you better than her pointing with the pipe to his mother oh heavens cried mrs sheppard bravo shouted blueskin tom sheppard never said a better thing than thatho ho illustration jack cried his mother wringing her hands in distraction youll break my heart poh poh returned her son women dont so easily break their hearts do they bess certainly not replied the young lady appealed to especially about their sons wretch cried mrs sheppard bitterly i say retorted edgeworth bess with a very unfeminine imprecation i shant stand any more of that nonsense what do you mean by calling me wretch madam she added marching up to mrs sheppard and regarding her with an insolent and threatening glance yeswhat do you mean maam added jack staggering after her come with me my love comecome cried his mother seizing his hand and endeavouring to force him away he shant go cried edgeworth bess holding him by the other hand here poll help me thus exhorted mrs maggot lent her powerful aid and between the two jack was speedily relieved from all fears of being carried off against his will not content with this exhibition of her prowess the amazon lifted him up as easily as if he had been an infant and placed him upon her shoulders to the infinite delight of the company and the increased distress of his mother now lets see wholl dare to take him down she cried nobody shall cried mr sheppard from his elevated position im my own master now and ill do as i please ill turn cracksman like my fatherrob old woodhe has chests full of money and i know where theyre keptill rob him and give the swag to you pollill jack would have said more but losing his balance he fell to the ground and when taken up he was perfectly insensible in this state he was laid upon a bench to sleep off his drunken fit while his wretched mother in spite of her passionate supplications and resistance was by blueskins command forcibly ejected from the house and driven out of the mint chapter xv the robbery in willesden church during the whole of the next day and night the poor widow hovered like a ghost about the precincts of the debtors garrisonfor admission by the masters express orders was denied her she could learn nothing of her son and only obtained one solitary piece of information which added to rather than alleviated her miserynamely that jonathan wild had paid a secret visit to the cross shovels at one time she determined to go to wych street and ask mr woods advice and assistance but the thought of the reception she was likely to meet with from his wife deterred her from executing this resolution many other expedients occurred to her but after making several ineffectual attempts to get into the mint unobserved they were all abandoned at length about an hour before dawn on the second daysundayhaving spent the early part of the night in watching at the gates of the robbers sanctuary and being almost exhausted from want of rest she set out homewards it was a long walk she had to undertake even if she had endured no previous fatigue but feeble as she was it was almost more than she could accomplish daybreak found her winding her painful way along the harrow road and in order to shorten the distance as much as possible she took the nearest cut and struck into the meadows on the right crossing several fields newly mown or filled with lines of tedded hay she arrived not without great exertion at the summit of a hill here her strength completely failed her and she was compelled to seek some repose making her couch upon a heap of hay she sank at once into a deep and refreshing slumber when she awoke the sun was high in heaven it was a bright and beautiful day so bright so beautiful that even her sad heart was cheered by it the air perfumed with the delicious fragrance of the newmown grass was vocal with the melodies of the birds the thick foliage of the trees was glistening in the sunshine all nature seemed happy and rejoicing but above all the serene sabbath stillness reigning around communicated a calm to her wounded spirit what a contrast did the lovely scene she now gazed upon present to the squalid neighbourhood she had recently quitted on all sides expanded prospects of country the most exquisite and most varied immediately beneath her lay willesdenthe most charming and secluded village in the neighbourhood of the metropoliswith its scattered farmhouses its noble granges and its old grey churchtower just peeping above a grove of rookhaunted trees towards this spot mrs sheppard now directed her steps she speedily reached her own abodea little cottage standing in the outskirts of the village the first circumstance that struck her on her arrival seemed ominous her clock had stoppedstopped at the very hour on which she had quitted the mint she had not the heart to wind it up again after partaking of some little refreshment and changing her attire mrs sheppard prepared for church by this time she had so far succeeded in calming herself that she answered the greetings of the neighbours whom she encountered on her way to the sacred edificeif sorrowfully still composedly every old country church is beautiful but willesden is the most beautiful country church we know and in mrs sheppards time it was even more beautiful than at present when the hand of improvement has proceeded a little too rashly with alterations and repairs with one or two exceptions there were no pews and as the intercourse with london was then but slight the seats were occupied almost exclusively by the villagers in one of these seats at the end of the aisle farthest removed from the chancel the widow took her place and addressed herself fervently to her devotions the service had not proceeded far when she was greatly disturbed by the entrance of a person who placed himself opposite her and sought to attract her attention by a number of little arts surveying her as he did so with a very impudent and offensive stare with this personwho was no other than mr kneeboneshe was too well acquainted having more than once been obliged to repel his advances and though his impertinence would have given her little concern at another season it now added considerably to her distraction but a far greater affliction was in store for her just as the clergyman approached the altar she perceived a boy steal quickly into the church and ensconce himself behind the woollendraper who in order to carry on his amatory pursuits with greater convenience and at the same time display his figure of which he was not a little vain to the utmost advantage preferred a standing to a sitting posture of this boy she had only caught a glimpsebut that glimpse was sufficient to satisfy her it was her sonand if she could have questioned her own instinctive love she could not question her antipathy when she beheld partly concealed by a pillar immediately in the rear of the woollendraper the dark figure and truculent features of jonathan wild as she looked in this direction the thieftaker raised his eyesthose gray bloodthirsty eyestheir glare froze the lifeblood in her veins as she averted her gaze a terrible idea crossed her why was he there why did the tempter dare to invade that sacred spot she could not answer her own questions but vague fearful suspicions passed through her mind meanwhile the service proceeded and the awful command thou shalt not steal was solemnly uttered by the preacher when mrs sheppard who had again looked round towards her son beheld a hand glance along the side of the woollendraper she could not see what occurred though she guessed it but she saw jonathans devilish triumphing glance and read in ityour son has committed a robberyherein these holy wallshe is minemine for ever she uttered a loud scream and fainted illustration chapter xvi jonathan wilds house in the old bailey just as st sepulchres church struck one on the eventful night of the th of june to which it will not be necessary to recur a horseman mounted on a powerful charger and followed at a respectful distance by an attendant galloped into the open space fronting newgate and directed his course towards a house in the old bailey before he could draw in the rein his steedstartled apparently by some object undistinguishable by the riderswerved with such suddenness as to unseat him and precipitate him on the ground the next moment however he was picked up and set upon his feet by a person who having witnessed the accident flew across the road to his assistance youre not hurt i hope sir rowland inquired this individual not materially mr wild replied the other a little shaken thats all curses light on the horse he added seizing the bridle of his steed who continued snorting and shivering as if still under the influence of some unaccountable alarm what can ail him i know what ails him your honour rejoined the groom riding up as he spoke hes seen somethin not o this world most likely observed jonathan with a slight sneer the ghost of some highwayman who has just breathed his last in newgate no doubt may be returned the man gravely take him home saunders said sir rowland resigning his faulty steed to the attendants care i shall not require you further strange he added as the groom departed bay stuart has carried me through a hundred dangers but never played me such a trick before and never should again were he mine rejoined jonathan if the best nag ever foaled were to throw me in this unlucky spot id blow his brains out what do you mean sir asked trenchard a fall against newgate is accounted a sign of death by the halter replied wild with illdisguised malignity tush exclaimed sir rowland angrily from that door continued the thieftaker pointing to the gloomy portal of the prison opposite which they were standing the condemned are taken to tyburn its a bad omen to be thrown near that door i didnt suspect you of so much superstition mr wild observed the knight contemptuously facts convince the most incredulous answered jonathan drily ive known several cases where the ignominious doom ive mentioned has been foretold by such an accident as has just befallen you there was major priceyou must recollect him sir rowlandhe stumbled as he was getting out of his chair at that very gate well he was executed for murder then there was tom jarrot the hackneycoachman who was pitched off the box against yonder curbstone and broke his leg it was a pity he didnt break his neck for he was hanged within the year another instance was that of toby tanner no more of this interrupted trenchard where is the boy not far hence replied wild after all our pains we were near losing him sir rowland how so asked the other distrustfully you shall hear returned jonathan with the help of his comrade jack sheppard the young rascal made a bold push to get out of the roundhouse where my janizaries had lodged him and would have succeeded too if by good luckfor the devil never deserts so useful an agent as i am sir rowlandi hadnt arrived in time to prevent him as it was my oldest and trustiest setter abraham mendez received a blow on the head from one of the lads that will deprive me of his services for a week to comeif indeed it does not disable him altogether however if ive lost one servant ive gained another thats one comfort jack sheppard is now wholly in my hands what is this to me sir said trenchard cutting him short nothing whatever rejoined the thieftaker coldly but it is much to me jack sheppard is to me what thames darrell is to youan object of hatred i owed his father a grudge that i settled long ago i owe his mother one and will repay the debt with interest to her son i could make away with him at once as you are about to make away with your nephew sir rowlandbut that wouldnt serve my turn to be complete my vengeance must be tardy certain of my prey i can afford to wait for it besides revenge is sweetened by delay and i indulge too freely in the passion to rob it of any of its zest ive watched this ladthis sheppardfrom infancy and though i have apparently concerned myself little about him i have never lost sight of my purpose i have suffered him to be brought up decentlyhonestly because i would make his fall the greater and deepen the wound i meant to inflict upon his mother from this night i shall pursue a different course from this night his ruin may be dated he is in the care of those who will not leave the task assigned to themthe utter perversion of his principleshalffinished and when i have steeped him to the lips in vice and depravity when i have led him to the commission of every crime when there is neither retreat nor advance for him when he has plundered his benefactor and broken the heart of his motherthenbut not till then i will consign him to the fate to which i consigned his father this i have sworn to dothis i will do not unless your skulls bulletproof cried a voice at his elbow and as the words were uttered a pistol was snapped at his head whichfortunately or unfortunately as the reader pleasesonly burnt the priming the blaze however was sufficient to reveal to the thieftaker the features of his intended assassin they were those of the irish watchman ah terry oflaherty vociferated jonathan in a tone that betrayed hot the slightest discomposure ah terry oflaherty he cried shouting after the irishman who took to his heels as soon as he found his murderous attempt unsuccessful you may run but youll not get out of my reach ill put a brace of dogs on your track wholl soon hunt you down you shall swing for this after next sessions or my names not jonathan wild i told you sir rowland he added turning to the knight and chuckling the devil never deserts me conduct me to your dwelling sir without further delay said trenchard sternlyto the boy the boys not at my house replied wild where is he then demanded the other hastily at a place we call the dark house at queenhithe answered jonathan a sort of underground tavern or nightcellar close to the riverside and frequented by the crew of the dutch skipper to whose care hes to be committed you need have no apprehensions about him sir rowland hes safe enough now i left him in charge of quilt arnold and rykhart van galgebrokthe skipper i spoke ofwith strict orders to shoot him if he made any further attempt at escape and theyre not ladsthe latter especiallyto be trifled with i deemed it more prudent to send him to the dark house than to bring him here in case of any search after him by his adoptive fatherthe carpenter wood if you choose you can see him put on board the zeeslang yourself sir rowland but perhaps youll first accompany me to my dwelling for a moment that we may arrange our accounts before we start ive a few necessary directions to leave with my people to put em on their guard against the chance of a surprise suffer me to precede you this way sir rowland the thieftakers residence was a large dismallooking habitation separated from the street by a flagged courtyard and defended from general approach by an iron railing even in the daylight it had a sombre and suspicious air and seemed to slink back from the adjoining houses as if afraid of their society in the obscurity in which it was now seen it looked like a prison and indeed it was jonathans fancy to make it resemble one as much as possible the windows were grated the doors barred each room had the name as well as the appearance of a cell and the very porter who stood at the gate habited like a jailer with his huge bunch of keys at his girdle his forbidding countenance and surly demeanour seemed to be borrowed from newgate the clanking of chains the grating of locks and the rumbling of bolts must have been music in jonathans ears so much pains did he take to subject himself to such sounds the scanty furniture of the rooms corresponded with their dungeonlike aspect the walls were bare and painted in stonecolour the floors devoid of carpet the beds of hangings the windows of blinds and excepting in the thieftakers own audiencechamber there was not a chair or a table about the premises the place of these conveniences being elsewhere supplied by benches and dealboards laid across jointstools great stone staircases leading no one knew whither and long gloomy passages impressed the occasional visitor with the idea that he was traversing a building of vast extent and though this was not the case in reality the deception was so cleverly contrived that it seldom failed of producing the intended effect scarcely any one entered mr wilds dwelling without apprehension or quitted it without satisfaction more strange stories were told of it than of any other house in london the garrets were said to be tenanted by coiners and artists employed in altering watches and jewelry the cellars to be used as a magazine for stolen goods by some it was affirmed that a subterranean communication existed between the thieftakers abode and newgate by means of which he was enabled to maintain a secret correspondence with the imprisoned felons by others that an underground passage led to extensive vaults where such malefactors as he chose to screen from justice might lie concealed till the danger was blown over nothing in short was too extravagant to be related of it and jonathan who delighted in investing himself and his residence with mystery encouraged and perhaps originated these marvellous tales however this may be such was the ill report of the place that few passed along the old bailey without bestowing a glance of fearful curiosity at its dingy walls and wondering what was going on inside them while fewer still of those who paused at the door read without some internal trepidation the formidable nameinscribed in large letters on its bright brassplateof jonathan wild arrived at his habitation jonathan knocked in a peculiar manner at the door which was instantly opened by the grimvisaged porter just alluded to no sooner had trenchard crossed the threshold than a fierce barking was heard at the farther extremity of the passage and the next moment a couple of mastiffs of the largest size rushed furiously towards him the knight stood upon his defence but he would unquestionably have been torn in pieces by the savage hounds if a shower of oaths seconded by a vigorous application of kicks and blows from their master had not driven them growling off apologizing to sir rowland for this unpleasant reception and swearing lustily at his servant for occasioning it by leaving the dogs at liberty jonathan ordered the man to light them to the audienceroom the command was sullenly obeyed for the fellow did not appear to relish the rating ascending the stairs and conducting them along a sombre gallery in which trenchard noticed that every door was painted black and numbered he stopped at the entrance of a chamber and selecting a key from the bunch at his girdle unlocked it following his guide sir rowland found himself in a large and lofty apartment the extent of which he could not entirely discern until lights were set upon the table he then looked around him with some curiosity and as the thieftaker was occupied in giving directions to his attendant in an undertone ample leisure was allowed him for investigation at the first glance he imagined he must have stumbled upon a museum of rarities there were so many glasscases so many open cabinets ranged against the walls but the next convinced him that if jonathan was a virtuoso his tastes did not run in the ordinary channels trenchard was tempted to examine the contents of some of these cases but a closer inspection made him recoil from them in disgust in the one he approached was gathered together a vast assortment of weapons each of which as appeared from the ticket attached to it had been used as an instrument of destruction on this side was a razor with which a son had murdered his father the blade notched the haft crusted with blood on that a bar of iron bent and partly broken with which a husband had beaten out his wifes brains as it is not however our intention to furnish a complete catalogue of these curiosities we shall merely mention that in front of them lay a large and sharp knife once the property of the public executioner and used by him to dissever the limbs of those condemned to death for hightreason together with an immense twopronged fleshfork likewise employed by the same terrible functionary to plunge the quarters of his victims in the caldrons of boiling tar and oil every gibbet at tyburn and hounslow appeared to have been plundered of its charnel spoil to enrich the adjoining cabinet so well was it stored with skulls and bones all purporting to be the relics of highwaymen famous in their day halters each of which had fulfilled its destiny formed the attraction of the next compartment while a fourth was occupied by an array of implements of housebreaking almost innumerable and utterly indescribable all these interesting objects were carefully arranged classed and as we have said labelled by the thieftaker from this singular collection trenchard turned to regard its possessor who was standing at a little distance from him still engaged in earnest discourse with his attendant and as he contemplated his ruthless countenance on which duplicity and malignity had set their strongest seals he could not help calling to mind all he had heard of jonathans perfidiousness to his employers and deeply regretting that he had placed himself in the power of so unscrupulous a miscreant jonathan wild at this time was on the highroad to the greatness which he subsequently and not long afterwards obtained he was fast rising to an eminence that no one of his nefarious profession ever reached before him nor it is to be hoped will ever reach again he was the napoleon of knavery and established an uncontrolled empire over all the practitioners of crime this was no light conquest nor was it a government easily maintained resolution severity subtlety were required for it and these were qualities which jonathan possessed in an extraordinary degree the danger or difficulty of an exploit never appalled him what his head conceived his hand executed professing to stand between the robber and the robbed he himself plundered both he it was who formed the grand design of a robber corporation of which he should be the sole head and director with the right of delivering those who concealed their booty or refused to share it with him to the gallows he divided london into districts appointed a gang to each district and a leader to each gang whom he held responsible to himself the country was partitioned in a similar manner those whom he retained about his person or placed in offices of trust were for the most part convicted felons who having returned from transportation before their term had expired constituted in his opinion the safest agents inasmuch as they could neither be legal evidences against him nor withhold any portion of the spoil of which he chose to deprive them but the crowning glory of jonathan that which raised him above all his predecessors in iniquity and clothed this name with undying notorietywas to come when in the plenitude of his power he commenced a terrible trade till then unknownnamely a traffic in human blood this he carried on by procuring witnesses to swear away the lives of those persons who had incurred his displeasure or whom it might be necessary to remove no wonder that trenchard as he gazed at this fearful being should have some misgivings cross him apparently jonathan perceived he was an object of scrutiny for hastily dismissing his attendant he walked towards the knight so youre admiring my cabinet sir rowland he remarked with a sinister smile it is generally admired and sometimes by parties who afterwards contribute to the collection themselvesha ha this skull he added pointing to a fragment of mortality in the case beside them once belonged to tom sheppard the father of the lad i spoke of just now in the next box hangs the rope by which he suffered when ive placed another skull and another halter beside them i shall be contented to business sir said the knight with a look of abhorrence ay to business returned jonathan grinning the sooner the better here is the sum you bargained for rejoined trenchard flinging a pocketbook on the table count it jonathans eyes glistened as he told over the notes youve given me more than the amount sir rowland he said after he had twice counted them or ive missed my reckoning theres a hundred pounds too much keep it said trenchard haughtily ill place it to your account sir rowland answered the thieftaker smiling significantly and now shall we proceed to queenhithe stay cried the other taking a chair a word with you mr wild as many as you please sir rowland replied jonathan resuming his seat im quite at your disposal i have a question to propose to you said trenchard relating to and he hesitated relating to the father of the boythames darrell supplied jonathan i guessed what was coming you desire to know who he was sir rowland well you shall know without further fee inquired the knight not exactly answered jonathan drily a secret is too valuable a commodity to be thrown away but i said i wouldnt drive a hard bargain with you and i wont we are alone sir rowland he added snuffing the candles glancing cautiously around and lowering his tone and what you confide to me shall never transpireat least to your disadvantage i am at a loss to understand you sir said trenchard ill make myself intelligible before ive done rejoined wild i need not remind you sir rowland that i am aware you are deeply implicated in the jacobite plot which is now known to be hatching ha ejaculated the other of course therefore pursued jonathan you are acquainted with all the leaders of the proposed insurrectionnay must be in correspondence with them what right have you to suppose this sir demanded trenchard sternly have a moments patience sir rowland returned wild and you shall hear if you will furnish me with a list of these rebels and with proofs of their treason i will not only insure your safety but will acquaint you with the real name and rank of your sister alivas husband as well as with some particulars which will never otherwise reach your ears concerning your lost sister constance my sister constance echoed the knight what of her you agree to my proposal then said jonathan do you take me for as great a villain as yourself sir said the knight rising i took you for one who wouldnt hesitate to avail himself of any advantage chance might throw in his way returned the thieftaker coldly i find i was in error no matter a time may comeand that ere longwhen you will be glad to purchase my secrets and your own safety at a dearer price than the heads of your companions are you ready said trenchard striding towards the door i am replied jonathan following him and so he added in an undertone are your captors a moment afterwards they quitted the house chapter xvii the nightcellar after a few minutes rapid walking during which neither party uttered a word jonathan wild and his companion had passed saint pauls dived down a thoroughfare on the right and reached thames street at the period of this history the main streets of the metropolis were but imperfectly lighted while the lessfrequented avenues were left in total obscurity but even at the present time the maze of courts and alleys into which wild now plunged would have perplexed any one not familiar with their intricacies to thread them on a dark night jonathan however was well acquainted with the road indeed it was his boast that he could find his way through any part of london blindfolded and by this time it would seem he had nearly arrived at his destination for grasping his companions arm he led him along a narrow entry which did not appear to have an outlet and came to a halt cautioning the knight if he valued his neck to tread carefully jonathan then descended a steep flight of steps and having reached the bottom in safety he pushed open a door that swung back on its hinges as soon as it had admitted him and followed by trenchard entered the nightcellar the vault in which sir rowland found himself resembled in some measure the cabin of a ship it was long and narrow with a ceiling supported by huge uncovered rafters and so low as scarcely to allow a tall man like himself to stand erect beneath it notwithstanding the heat of the seasonwhich was not however found particularly inconvenient in this subterranean regiona large heapedup fire blazed ruddily in one corner and lighted up a circle of as villanous countenances as ever flame shone upon the guests congregated within the nightcellar were in fact little better than thieves but thieves who confined their depredations almost exclusively to the vessels lying in the pool and docks of the river they had as many designations as grades there were game watermen and game lightermen heavy horsemen and light horsemen scufflehunters and longapron men lumpers journeymen coopers mudlarks badgers and ratcatchersa race of dangerous vermin recently in a great measure extirpated by the vigilance of the thames police but at this period flourishing in vast numbers besides these plunderers there were others with whom the disposal of their pillage necessarily brought them into contact and who seldom failed to attend them during their hours of relaxation and festivityto wit dealers in junk old rags and marine stores purchasers of prizemoney crimps and jew receivers the latter formed by far the most knavishlooking and unprepossessing portion of the assemblage one or two of the tables were occupied by groups of fat frowzy women in flat caps with rings on their thumbs and baskets by their sides and no one who had listened for a single moment to their coarse language and violent abuse of each other would require to be told they were fishwives from billingsgate the present divinity of the cellar was a comely middleaged dame almost as stout and quite as shrillvoiced as the billingsgate fishwives abovementioned mrs spurling for so was she named had a warm nutbrown complexion almost as dark as a creole and a moustache on her upper lip that would have done no discredit to the oldest dragoon in the kings service this lady was singularly lucky in her matrimonial connections she had been married four times three of her husbands died of hempen fevers and the fourth having been twice condemned was saved from the noose by jonathan wild who not only managed to bring him off but to obtain for him the situation of underturnkey in newgate on the appearance of the thieftaker mrs spurling was standing near the fire superintending some culinary preparation but she no sooner perceived him than hastily quitting her occupation she elbowed a way for him and the knight through the crowd and ushered them with much ceremony into an inner room where they found the objects of their search quilt arnold and rykhart van galgebrok seated at a small table quietly smoking this service rendered without waiting for any farther order she withdrew both the janizary and the skipper arose as the others entered the room this is the gentleman observed jonathan introducing trenchard to the hollander who is about to intrust his young relation to your care de gentleman may rely on my showing his relation all de attention in my power replied van galgebrok bowing profoundly to the knight but if any unforseen accidentsuch as a slip overboardshould befal de jonker on de voyage he mushnt lay de fault entirely on my shouldershaw haw where is he asked sir rowland glancing uneasily around i do not see him de jonker hes here returned the skipper pointing significantly downwards bring him out quilt so saying he pushed aside the table and the janizary stooping down undrew a bolt and opened a trapdoor come out roared quilt looking into the aperture youre wanted but as no answer was returned he trust his arm up to the shoulder into the hole and with some little difficulty and exertion of strength drew forth thames darrell the poor boy whose hands were pinioned behind him looked very pale but neither trembled nor exhibited any other symptom of alarm why didnt you come out when i called you you young dog cried quilt in a savage tone because i knew what you wanted me for answered thames firmly oh you did did you said the janizary and what do you suppose we mean to do with you eh you mean to kill me replied thames by my cruel uncles command ah there he stands he exclaimed as his eye fell for the first time upon sir rowland where is my mother he added regarding the knight with a searching glance your mother is dead interposed wild scowling dead echoed the boy oh nono you say this to terrify meto try me but i will not believe you inhuman as he is he would not kill her tell me sir he added advancing towards the knight tell me has this man spoken falselytell me my mother is alive and do what you please with me tell him so and have done with him sir rowland observed jonathan coldly tell me the truth i implore you cried thames is she alive she is not replied trenchard overcome by conflicting emotions and unable to endure the boys agonized look are you answered said jonathan with a grin worthy of a demon my mothermy poor mother ejaculated thames falling on his knees and bursting into tears shall i never see that sweet face againnever feel the pressure of those kind hands morenor listen to that gentle voice ah yes we shall meet again in heaven where i shall speedily join you now then he added more calmly i am ready to die the only mercy you can show me is to kill me then we wont even show you that mercy retorted the thieftaker brutally so get up and leave off whimpering your time isnt come yet mr wild said trenchard i shall proceed no further in this business set the boy free if i disobey you sir rowland replied the thieftaker youll thank me for it hereafter gag him he added pushing thames rudely toward quilt arnold and convey him to the boat a word cried the boy as the janizary was preparing to obey his masters orders what has become of jack sheppard devil knows answered quilt but i believe hes in the hands of blueskin so theres no doubt hell soon be on the highroad to tyburn poor jack sighed thames you neednt gag me he added ill not cry out we wont trust you my youngster answered the janizary and thrusting a piece of iron into his mouth he forced him out of the room sir rowland witnessed these proceedings like one stupified he neither attempted to prevent his nephews departure nor to follow him jonathan kept his keen eye fixed upon him as he addressed himself for a moment to the hollander is the case of watches on board he asked in an under tone ja replied the skipper and the rings ja thats well you must dispose of the goldsmiths note i gave you yesterday as soon as you arrive at rotterdam itll be advertised tomorrow de duivel exclaimed van galgebrok very well it shall be done as you direct but about dat jonker he continued lowering his voice have you anything to add consarnin him its almosht a pity to put him onder de water is the sloop ready to sail asked wild without noticing the skippers remark ja answered van at a minuts nodish here are your despatches said jonathan with a significant look and giving him a sealed packet open them when you get on boardnot before and act as they direct you i ondershtand replied the skipper putting his finger to his nose it shall be done sir rowland said jonathan turning to the knight will it please you to remain here till i return or will you accompany us i will go with you answered trenchard who by this time had regained his composure and with it all his relentlessness of purpose come then said wild marching towards the door weve no time to lose quitting the nightcellar the trio soon arrived at the riverside quilt arnold was stationed at the stairhead near which the boat containing the captive boy was moored a few words passed between him and the thieftaker as the latter came up after which all the partywith the exception of quilt who was left on shoreembarked within the wherry which was pushed from the strand and rowed swiftly along the streamfor the tide was in its favourby a couple of watermen though scarcely two hours past midnight it was perfectly light the moon had arisen and everything could be as plainly distinguished as during the day a thin mist lay on the river giving the few craft moving about in it a ghostly look as they approached london bridge the thieftaker whispered van galgebrok who acted as steersman to make for a particular archnear the surrey shore the skipper obeyed and in another moment they swept through the narrow lock while the watermen were contending with the eddies occasioned by the fall below the bridge jonathan observed a perceptible shudder run through trenchards frame you remember that starling sir rowland he said maliciously and what occurred on it twelve years ago too well answered the knight frowning ah what is that he cried pointing to a dark object floating near them amid the boiling waves and which presented a frightful resemblance to a human face well see returned the thieftaker and stretching out his hand he lifted the dark object from the flood it proved to be a human head though with scarcely a vestige of the features remaining here and there patches of flesh adhered to the bones and the dank dripping hair hanging about what had once been the face gave it a ghastly appearance its the skull of a rebel said jonathan with marked emphasis on the word blown by the wind from a spike on the bridge above us i dont know whose brainless head it may be but itll do for my collection and he tossed it carelessly into the bottom of the boat after this occurence not a word was exchanged between them until they came in sight of the sloop which was lying at anchor off wapping arrived at her side it was soon evident from the throng of seamen in dutch dresses that displayed themselves that her crew were on the alert and a rope having been thrown down to the skipper he speedily hoisted himself on deck preparations were next made for taking thames on board raising him in his arms jonathan passed the rope round his body and in this way the poor boy was drawn up without difficulty while he was swinging in mid air thames regarded his uncle with a stern look and cried in a menacing voice we shall meet again not in this world returned jonathan weigh anchor van he shouted to the skipper and consult your despatches jaja returned the hollander and catching hold of thames he quitted the deck shortly afterwards he reappeared with the information that the captive was safe below and giving the necessary directions to his crew before many minutes had elapsed the zeeslang spread her canvass to the first breeze of morning by the thieftakers command the boat was then rowed toward a muddy inlet which has received in more recent times the name of execution dock as soon as she reached this spot wild sprang ashore and was joined by several personsamong whom was quilt arnold leading a horse by the bridlehe hastened down the stairs to meet him a coach was also in attendance at a little distance sir rowland who had continued absorbed in thought with his eyes fixed upon the sloop as she made her way slowly down the river disembarked more leisurely at length i am my own master murmured the knight as his foot touched the strand not so sir rowland returned jonathan you are my prisoner how ejaculated trenchard starting back and drawing his sword you are arrested for high treason rejoined wild presenting a pistol at his head while he drew forth a parchmenthere is my warrant traitor cried sir rowlanddamneddoubledyed traitor away with him vociferated jonathan to his myrmidons who having surrounded trenchard hurried him off to the coach before he could utter another wordfirst to mr walpole and then to newgate and now quilt he continued addressing the janizary who approached him with the horse fly to st giless roundhouse and if through the agency of that treacherous scoundrel terry oflaherty whom ive put in my black list old wood should have found his way there and have been detained by sharpies as i directed you may release him i dont care how soon he learns that he has lost his adopted son when ive escorted you proud fool to his new quarters ill proceed to the mint and look after jack sheppard with this he mounted his steed and rode off chapter xviii how jack sheppard broke out of the cage at willesden the heartpiercing scream uttered by mrs sheppard after the commission of the robbery in willesden church was productive of unfortunate consequences to her son luckily she was bereft of consciousness and was thus spared the additional misery of witnessing what afterwards befell him startled by the cry as may be supposed the attention of the whole congregation was drawn towards the quarter whence it proceeded amongst others a person near the door roused by the shriek observed a man make his exit with the utmost precipitation a boy attempted to follow but as the suspicions of the lookerson were roused by the previous circumstances the younger fugitive was seized and detained meanwhile mr kneebone having been alarmed by something in the widows look before her feelings found vent in the manner above described thrust his hand instinctively into his coat in search of his pocketbookabout the security of which as it contained several letters and documents implicating himself and others in the jacobite plot he was not unnaturally solicitousand finding it gone he felt certain he had been robbed turning quickly round in the hope of discovering the thief he was no less surprised than distressedfor in spite of his faults the woollendraper was a goodnatured fellowto perceive jack sheppard in custody the truth at once flashed across his mind this then was the cause of the widows wild inexplicable lookof her sudden shriek explaining his suspicious in a whisper to jacks captor who proved to be a churchwarden and a constable by name john dumpmr kneebone begged him to take the prisoner into the churchyard dump instantly complied and as soon as jack was removed from the sacred edifice his person was searched from head to footbut without success jack submitted to this scrutiny with a very bad grace and vehemently protested his innocence in vain did the woollendraper offer to set him free if he would restore the stolen article or give up his associate to whom it was supposed he might have handed it he answered with the greatest assurance that he knew nothing whatever of the matterhad seen no pocketbook and no associate to give up nor did he content himself with declaring his guiltlessness of the crime imputed to him but began in his turn to menace his captor and accuser loading the latter with the bitterest upbraidings by this time the churchyard was crowded with spectators some of whom dispersed in different directions in quest of the other robber but all that could be ascertained in the village was that a man had ridden off a short time before in the direction of london of this man kneebone resolved to go in pursuit and leaving jack in charge of the constable he proceeded to the small innwhich bore then as it bears now the name of the six bellswhere summoning the hostler his steed was instantly brought him and springing on its back he rode away at full speed meanwhile after a consultation between mr dump and the village authorities it was agreed to lock up the prisoner in the cage as he was conveyed thither an incident occurred that produced a considerable impression on the feelings of the youthful offender just as they reached the eastern outlet of the churchyardwhere the tall elms cast a pleasant shade over the rustic gravesa momentary stoppage took place at this gate two paths meet down that on the right the young culprit was draggedalong that on the left a fainting woman was borne in the arms of several females it was his mother and as he gazed on her pallid features and motionless frame jacks heart severely smote him he urged his conductors to a quicker pace to get out of sight of the distressing spectacle and even felt relieved when he was shut out from it and the execrations of the mob by the walls of the little prison the cage at willesden was and isfor it is still standinga small round building about eight feet high with a pointed tiled roof to which a number of boards inscribed with the names of the parish officers and charged with a multitude of admonitory notices to vagrants and other disorderly persons are attached over these boards the two arms of a guidepost serve to direct the wayfareron the right hand to the neighbouring villages of neasdon and kingsbury and on the left to the edgeware road and the healthy heights of hampstead the cage has a strong door with an iron grating at the top and further secured by a stout bolt and padlock it is picturesquely situated beneath a tree on the high road not far from the little hostel before mentioned and at no great distance from the church for some time after he was locked up in this prison jack continued in a very dejected state deserted by his older companion in iniquity and instigator to crime he did not know what might become of him nor as we have observed was the sad spectacle he had just witnessed without effect though within the last two days he had committed several heinous offences and one of a darker dye than any with which the reader has been made acquainted his breast was not yet so callous as to be wholly insensible to the stings of conscience wearied at length with thinking on the past and terrified by the prospect of the future he threw himself on the straw with which the cage was littered and endeavoured to compose himself to slumber when he awoke it was late in the day but though he heard voices outside and now and then caught a glimpse of a face peeping at him through the iron grating over the door no one entered the prison or held any communication with him feeling rather exhausted it occurred to him that possibly some provisions might have been left by the constable and looking about he perceived a pitcher of water and a small brown loaf on the floor he ate of the bread with great appetite and having drunk as much as he chose of the water poured the rest on the floor his hunger satisfied his spirits began to revive and with this change of mood all his natural audacity returned and here he was first visited by that genius which in his subsequent career prompted him to so many bold and successful attempts glancing around his prison he began to think it possible he might effect an escape from it the door was too strong and too well secured to break openthe walls too thick but the ceilingif he could reach itthere he doubted not he could make an outlet while he was meditating flight in this way and tossing about on the straw he chanced upon an old broken and rusty fork here was an instrument which might be of the greatest service to him in accomplishing his design he put it carefully aside resolved to defer the attempt till night time wore on somewhat slowly with the prisoner who had to control his impatience in the best way he could but as the shades of evening were darkening the door was unlocked and mr dump popped his head into the cage he brought another small loaf and a can with which he replenished the pitcher recommending jack to be careful as he would get nothing further till morning to this jack replied that he should be perfectly contented provided he might have a small allowance of gin the latter request though treated with supreme contempt by mr dump made an impression on some one outside for not long after the constable departed jack heard a tap at the door and getting up at the summons he perceived the tube of a pipe inserted between the bars at once divining the meaning of this ingenious device he applied his mouth to the tube and sucked away while the person outside poured spirit into the bowl having drunk as much as he thought prudent and thanked his unknown friend for his attention jack again lay down on the straw and indulged himself with another nap intending to get up as soon as it was perfectly dark the strong potation he had taken combined with fatigue and anxiety he had previously undergone made him oversleep himself and when he awoke it was just beginning to grow light cursing himself for his inertness jack soon shook off this drowsiness and set to work in earnest availing himself of certain inequalities in the door he soon managed to climb up to the roof and securing his feet against a slight projection in the wall began to use the fork with great effect before many minutes elapsed he had picked a large hole in the plaster which showered down in a cloud of dust and breaking off several laths caught hold of a beam by which he held with one hand until with the other he succeeded not without some difficulty in forcing out one of the tiles the rest was easy in a few minutes more he had made a breach in the roof wide enough to allow him to pass through emerging from this aperture he was about to descend when he was alarmed by hearing the tramp of horses feet swiftly approaching and had only time to hide himself behind one of the largest signboards before alluded to when two horsemen rode up instead of passing on as jack expected these persons stopped opposite the cage when one of them as he judged from the sound for he did not dare to look out of his hiding place dismounted a noise was next heard as if some instrument were applied to the door with the intent to force it open and jacks fears were at once dispelled at first he had imagined they were officers of justice come to convey him to a stronger prison but the voice of one of the parties which he recognised convinced him they were his friends look quick blueskin and be cursed to you was growled in the deep tones of jonathan wild we shall have the whole village upon us while youre striking the jigger use the gilt man illustration theres no need of picklock or crowbar here mr wild cried jack placing his hat on the right arm of the guidepost and leaning over the board ive done the trick myself why what the devils this vociferated jonathan looking up have you broken out of the cage jack something like it replied the lad carelessly bravo cried the thieftaker approvingly well that beats all i ever heard of roared blueskin but are you really there no im here answered jack leaping down i tell you what mr wild he added laughing it must be a stronger prison than willesden cage that can hold me ay ay observed jonathan youll give the keepers of his majestys jails some trouble before youre many years older ill warrant you but get up behind blueskin some one may observe us come jump up cried blueskin mounting his steed and ill soon wisk you to town edgeworth bess and poll maggot are dying to see you i thought bess would have cried her pretty eyes out when she heard you was nabbed you need give yourself no more concern about kneebone mr wild has done his business ayay laughed jonathan the pocketbook you prigged contained the letters i wanted hes now in springankle warehouse with sir rowland trenchard so get up and lets be off before i leave this place i must see my mother nonsense returned jonathan gruffly would you expose yourself to fresh risk if it hadnt been for her you wouldnt have been placed in your late jeopardy i dont care for that replied jack see her i will leave me behind im not afraid ill be at the cross shovels in the course of the day nay if youre bent upon this folly observed wild who appeared to have his own reasons for humouring the lad i shant hinder you blueskin will take care of the horses and ill go with you so saying he dismounted and flinging his bridle to his companion and ordering him to ride off to a little distance he followed jack who had quitted the main road and struck into a narrow path opposite the cage this path bordered on each side by high privet hedges of the most beautiful green soon brought them to a stile theres the house said jack pointing to a pretty cottage the small wooden porch of which was covered with roses and creepers with a little trim garden in front of it ill be back in a minute dont hurry yourself said jonathan ill wait for you here chapter xix good and evil as jack opened the gate and crossed the little garden which exhibited in every part the neatness and attention of its owner he almost trembled at the idea of further disturbing her peace of mind pausing with the intention of turning back he glanced in the direction of the village church the tower of which could just be seen through the trees the rooks were cawing amid the boughs and all nature appeared awaking to happiness from this peaceful scene jacks eye fell upon jonathan who seated upon the stile under the shade of an elder tree was evidently watching him a sarcastic smile seemed to play upon the chieftakers lips and abashed at his own irresolution the lad went on after knocking for some time at the door without effect he tried the latch and to his surprise found it open he stepped in with a heavy foreboding of calamity a cat came and rubbed herself against him as he entered the house and seemed by her mewing to ask him for food that was the only sound he heard jack was almost afraid of speaking but at length he summoned courage to call out mother whos there asked a faint voice from the bed your son answered the boy jack exclaimed the widow starting up and drawing back the curtain is it indeed you or am i dreaming youre not dreaming mother he answered im come to say good bye to you and to assure you of my safety before i leave this place where are you going asked his mother i hardly know returned jack but its not safe for me to remain much longer here true replied the widow upon whom all the terrible recollections of the day before crowded i know it isnt i wont keep you long but tell me how have you escaped from the confinement in which you were placedcome and sit by mehereupon the bedgive me your handand tell me all about it illustration her son complied and sat down upon the patchwork coverlet beside her jack said mrs sheppard clasping him with a hand that burnt with fever i have been illdreadfully illi believe deliriousi thought i should have died last nighti wont tell you what agony you have caused mei wont reproach you only promise me to amendto quit your vile companionsand i will forgive youwill bless you oh my dear dear son be warned in time you are in the hands of a wicked a terrible man who will not stop till he has completed your destruction listen to your mothers prayers and do not let her die brokenhearted it is too late returned jack sullenly i cant be honest if i would oh do not say so replied his wretched parent it is never too late i know you are in jonathan wilds power for i saw him near you in the church and if ever the enemy of mankind was permitted to take human form i beheld him then beware of him my son beware of him you know not what villany he is capable of be honest and you will be happy you are yet a child and though you have strayed from the right path a stronger hand than your own has led you thence return i implore of you to your masterto mr wood acknowledge your faults he is all kindness and will overlook them for your poor fathers sakefor mine return to him i say i cant replied jack doggedly cant repeated his mother why not ill tell you cried a deep voice from the back of the bed and immediately afterwards the curtain was drawn aside and disclosed the satanic countenance of jonathan wild who had crept into the house unperceived ill tell you why he cant go back to his master cried the thieftaker with a malignant grin he has robbed him robbed him screamed the widow jack her son averted his gaze ay robbed him reiterated jonathan the night before last mr woods house was broken into and plundered your son was seen by the carpenters wife in company with the robbers here he added throwing a handbill on the bed are the particulars of the burglary with the reward for jacks apprehension ah ejaculated the widow hiding her face come said wild turning authoritatively to jackyou have overstayed your time do not go with him jack shrieked his mother do notdo not he must thundered jonathan or he goes to jail if you must go to prison i will go with you cried mrs sheppard but avoid that man as you would a serpent come along thundered jonathan hear me jack shrieked his mother you know not what you do the wretch you confide in has sworn to hang you as i hope for mercy i speak the truthlet him deny it if he can pshaw said wild i could hang him now if i liked but he may remain with you if he pleases i shant hinder him you hear my son said the widow eagerly choose between good and evilbetween him and me and mind your lifemore than your lifehangs upon your choice it does so said wild choose jack the lad made no answer but left the room he is gone cried mrs sheppard despairingly for ever said the thieftaker preparing to follow devil cried the widow catching his arm and gazing with frantic eagerness in his face how many years will you give my son before you execute your terrible threat nine answered jonathan sternly end the second epoch epoch the third the prisonbreaker chapter i the return nearly nine years after the events last recorded and about the middle of may a young man of remarkably prepossessing appearance took his way one afternoon along wych street and from the curiosity with which he regarded the houses on the left of the road seemed to be in search of some particular habitation the age of this individual could not be more than twentyone his figure was tall robust and gracefully proportioned and his clear gray eye and open countenance bespoke a frank generous and resolute nature his features were regular and finelyformed his complexion bright and bloominga little shaded however by travel and exposure to the sun and with a praiseworthy contempt for the universal and preposterous fashion then prevailing of substituting a peruke for the natural covering of the head he allowed his own darkbrown hair to fall over his shoulders in ringlets as luxuriant as those that distinguished the court gallant in charles the seconds daysa fashion which we do not despair of seeing revived in our own days he wore a french military undress of the period with high jackboots and a laced hat and though his attire indicated no particular rank he had completely the air of a person of distinction such was the effect produced upon the passengers by his good looks and manly deportment that fewespecially of the gentler and more susceptible sexfailed to turn round and bestow a second glance upon the handsome stranger unconscious of the interest he excited and entirely occupied by his own thoughtswhich if his bosom could have been examined would have been found composed of mingled hopes and fearsthe young man walked on till he came to an old house with great projecting bay windows on the first floor and situated as nearly as possible at the back of st clements church here he halted and looking upwards read at the foot of an immense signboard displaying a gaudilypainted angel with expanded pinions and an olivebranch not the name he expected to find but that of william kneebone woollendraper tears started to the young mans eyes on beholding the change and it was with difficulty he could command himself sufficiently to make the inquiries he desired to do respecting the former owner of the house as he entered the shop a tall portly personage advanced to meet him whom he at once recognised as the present proprietor mr kneebone was attired in the extremity of the mode a fullcurled wig descended halfway down his back and shoulders a neckcloth of right mechlin was twisted round his throat so tightly as almost to deprive him of breath and threaten him with apoplexy he had lace also at his wrists and bosom gold clocks to his hose and red heels to his shoes a stiff formallycut coat of cinnamoncoloured cloth with rows of plate buttons each of the size of a crown piece on the sleeves pockets and skirts reached the middle of his legs and his costume was completed by the silverhilted sword at his side and the laced hat under his left arm bowing to the stranger the woollendraper very politely requested to know his business im almost afraid to state it faltered the other but may i ask whether mr wood the carpenter who formerly resided here is still living if you feel any anxiety on his account sir im happy to be able to relieve it answered kneebone readily my good friend owen woodheaven preserve himis still living and for a man wholl never see sixty again hes in excellent preservation i assure you you delight me with the intelligence said the stranger entirely recovering his cheerfulness of look i began to fear from his having quitted the old place that some misfortune must have befallen him quite the contrary rejoined the woollendraper laughing goodhumouredly everything has prospered with him in an extraordinary manner his business has thriven legacies have unexpectedly dropped into his lap and to crown all he has made a large fortune by a lucky speculation in southsea stockmade it too where so many others have lost fortunes your humble servant amongst the numberha ha in a word sir mr wood is now in very affluent circumstances he stuck to the shop as long as it was necessary and longer in my opinion when he left these premises three years ago i took them from him or ratherto deal frankly with youhe placed me in them rentfree for im not ashamed to confess it ive had losses and heavy ones and if it hadnt been for him i dont know where i should have been mr wood sir he added with much emotion is one of the best of men and would be the happiest were it not that and he hesitated well sir cried the other eagerly his wife is still living returned kneebone drily i understand replied the stranger unable to repress a smile but it strikes me ive heard that mrs wood was once a favourite of yours so she was replied the woollendraper helping himself to an enormous pinch of snuff with the air of a man who does not dislike to be rallied about his gallantryso she was but those days are overquite over since her husband has laid me under such a weight of obligation i couldnt in honour continuehem and he took another explanatory pinch added to which she is neither so young as she was nor is her temper by any means improvedhem say no more on the subject sir observed the stranger gravely but let us turn to a more agreeable oneher daughter that is a far more agreeable one i must confess returned kneebone with a selfsufficient smirk the stranger looked at him as if strongly disposed to chastise his impertinence is she married he asked after a brief pause marriednono replied the woollendraper winifred wood will never marry unless the grave can give up its dead when a mere child she fixed her affections upon a youth named thames darrell whom her father brought up and who perished it is supposed about nine years ago and she has determined to remain faithful to his memory you astonish me said the stranger in a voice full of emotion why it is astonishing certainly remarked kneebone to find any woman constantespecially to a girlish attachment but such is the case she has had offers innumerable for where wealth and beauty are combined as in her instance suitors are seldom wanting but she was not to be tempted she is a matchless creature exclaimed the young man so i think replied kneebone again applying to the snuffbox and by that means escaping the angry glance levelled at him by his companion i have one inquiry more to make of you sir said the stranger as soon as he had conquered his displeasure and i will then trouble you no further you spoke just now of a youth whom mr wood brought up as far as i recollect there were two what has become of the other why surely you dont mean jack sheppard cried the woollendraper in surprise that was the lads name returned the stranger i guessed from your dress and manner sir that you must have been long absent from your own country said kneebone and now im convinced of it or you wouldnt have asked that question jack sheppard is the talk and terror of the whole town the ladies cant sleep in their beds for him and as to the men they darent go to bed at all hes the most daring and expert housebreaker that ever used a crowbar he laughs at locks and bolts and the more carefully you guard your premises from him the more likely are you to insure an attack his exploits and escapes are in every bodys mouth he has been lodged in every roundhouse in the metropolis and has broken out of them all and boasts that no prison can hold him we shall see his skill has not been tried at present he is under the protection of jonathan wild does that villain still maintain his power asked the stranger sternly he does replied kneebone and what is more surprising it seems to increase jonathan completely baffles and derides the ends of justice it is useless to contend with him even with right on your side some years ago in just before the rebellion i was rash enough to league myself with the jacobite party and by wilds machinations got clapped into newgate whence i was glad to escape with my head upon my shoulders i charged the thieftaker as was the fact with having robbed me by means of the lad sheppard whom he instigated to deed of the very pocketbook he produced in evidence against me but it was of no availi couldnt obtain a hearing mr wood fared still worse bribed by a certain sir rowland trenchard jonathan kidnapped the carpenters adopted son thames darrell and placed him in the hands of a dutch skipper with orders to throw him overboard when he got out to sea and though this was proved as clear as day the rascal managed matters so adroitly and gave such a different complexion to the whole affair that he came off with flying colours one reason perhaps of his success in this case might be that having arrested his associate in the dark transaction sir rowland trenchard on a charge of high treason he was favoured by walpole who found his account in retaining such an agent be this as it may jonathan remained the victor and shortly afterwardsat the price of a third of his estate it was whisperedhe procured trenchards liberation from confinement at the mention of the latter occurrence a dark cloud gathered upon the strangers brow do you know anything further of sir rowland he asked nothing more than this answered kneebonethat after the failure of his projects and the downfall of his party he retired to his seat ashton hall near manchester and has remained there ever since entirely secluded from the world the stranger was for a moment lost in reflection and now sir he said preparing to take his departure will you add to the obligation already conferred by informing me where i can meet with mr wood with pleasure replied the woollendraper he lives at dollis hill a beautiful spot near willesden about four or five miles from town where he has taken a farm if you ride out there and the place is well worth a visit for the magnificent view it commands of some of the finest country in the neighbourhood of londonyou are certain to meet with him i saw him yesterday and he told me he shouldnt stir from home for a week to come he called here on his way back after he had been to bedlam to visit poor mrs sheppard jacks mother exclaimed the young man gracious heavenis she the inmate of a madhouse she is sir answered the woollendraper sadly driven there by her sons misconduct alas that the punishment of his offences should fall on her head poor soul she nearly died when she heard he had robbed his master and it might have been well if she had done so for she never afterwards recovered her reason she rambles continually about jack and her husband and that wretch jonathan to whom as far as can be gathered from her wild ravings she attributes all her misery i pity her from the bottom of my heart but in the midst of all her affliction she has found a steady friend in mr wood who looks after her comforts and visits her constantly indeed ive heard him say that but for his wife he would shelter her under his own roof that sir is what i call being a good samaritan the stranger said nothing but hastily brushed away a tear perceiving he was about to take leave kneebone ventured to ask whom he had had the honour of addressing before the question could be answered a sidedoor was opened and a very handsome woman of amazonian proportions presented herself and marched familiarly up to mr kneebone she was extremely showily dressed and her large hooped petticoat gave additional effect to her lofty stature as soon as she noticed the stranger she honoured him with an extremely impudent stare and scarcely endeavoured to disguise the admiration with which his good looks impressed her dont you perceive my dear mrs maggot that im engaged said kneebone a little disconcerted whove you got with you demanded the amazon boldly the gentleman is a stranger to me poll replied the woollendraper with increased embarrassment i dont know his name and he looked at the moment as if he had lost all desire to know it well hes a pretty fellow at all events observed mrs maggot eyeing him from head to heel with evident satisfactiona devilish pretty fellow upon my word poll said kneebone becoming very red you might have a little more delicacy than to tell him so before my face what exclaimed mrs maggot drawing up her fine figure to its full height because i condescend to live with you am i never to look at another manespecially at one so much to my taste as this dont think it you had better retire madam said the woollendraper sharply if you cant conduct yourself with more propriety order those who choose to obey you rejoined the lady scornfully though you lorded it over that fond fool mrs wood you shant lord it over me i can promise you that for you and she snapped her fingers in his face zounds cried kneebone furiously go to your own room woman directly or ill make you make me echoed mrs maggot bursting into a loud contemptuous laugh try enraged at the assurance of his mistress the woollendraper endeavoured to carry his threat into execution but all his efforts to remove her were unavailing at length after he had given up the point from sheer exhaustion the amazon seized him by the throat and pushed him backwards with such force that he rolled over the counter there she cried laughing thatll teach you to lay hands upon me again you should remember before you try your strength against mine that when i rescued you from the watch and you induced me to come and live with you i beat off four men any of whom was a match for youha ha my dear poll said kneebone picking himself up i entreat you to moderate yourself entreat a fiddlestick retorted mrs maggot im tired of you and will go back to my old lover jack sheppard hes worth a dozen of you or if this goodlooking young fellow will only say the word ill go with him you may go and welcome madam rejoined kneebone spitefully but i should think after the specimen youve just given of your amiable disposition no person would be likely to saddle himself with such an incumbrance what say you sir said the amazon with an engaging leer at the stranger you will find me tractable enough and with me by your side you need fear neither constable nor watchman ive delivered jack sheppard from many an assault i can wield a quarterstaff as well as a prizefighter and have beaten figg himself at the broadsword will you take me however tempting mrs maggots offer may appear the young man thought fit to decline it and after a few words of wellmerited compliment on her extraordinary prowess and renewed thanks to mr kneebone he took his departure good bye cried mrs maggot kissing her hand to him ill find you out and now she added glancing contemptuously at the woollendraper ill go to jack sheppard you shall first go to bridewell you jade rejoined kneebone here tom he added calling to a shopboy run and fetch a constable he had better bring halfadozen said the amazon taking up a clothyard wand and quietly seating herself one wont do on leaving mr kneebones house the young man hastened to a hotel in the neighbourhood of covent garden where having procured a horse he shaped his course towards the west end of the town urging his steed along oxford roadas that great approach to the metropolis was then termedhe soon passed marylebone lane beyond which with the exception of a few scattered houses the country was completely open on the right and laid out in pleasant fields and gardens nor did he draw in the rein until he arrived at tyburngate where before he turned off upon the edgeware road he halted for a moment to glance at the place of execution this fatal retreat for the unfortunate brave was marked by a low wooden railing within which stood the triple tree opposite the gallows was an open gallery or scaffolding like the stand at a racecourse which on state occasions was crowded with spectators without the inclosure were reared several lofty gibbets with their ghastly burthens altogether it was a hideous and revolting sight influenced probably by what he had heard from mr kneebone respecting the lawless career of jack sheppard and struck with the probable fate that awaited him the young man as he contemplated this scene fell into a gloomy reverie while he was thus musing two horsemen rode past him and proceeding to a little distance stopped likewise one of them was a stout squarebuilt man with a singularly swarthy complexion and harsh forbidding features he was well mounted as was his companion and had pistols in his holsters and a hanger at his girdle the other individual who was a little in advance was concealed from the strangers view presently however a sudden movement occurred and disclosed his features which were those of a young man of nearly his own age the dress of this person was excessively showy and consisted of a scarlet ridinghabit lined and faced with blue and bedizened with broad gold lace a green silkknit waistcoat embroidered with silver and decorated with a deep fringe together with a hat tricked out in the same gaudy style his figure was slight but wellbuilt and in stature he did not exceed five feet four his complexion was pale and there was something sinister in the expression of his large black eyes his head was small and bulletshaped and he did not wear a wig but had his sleek black hair cut off closely round his temples a mutual recognition took place at the same instant between the stranger and this individual both started the latter seemed inclined to advance and address the former but suddenly changing his mind he shouted to his companion in tones familiar to the strangers ear and striking spurs into his steed dashed off at full speed along the edgeware road impelled by a feeling into which we shall not pause to inquire the stranger started after them but they were better mounted and soon distanced him remarking that they struck off at a turning on the left he took the same road and soon found himself on paddingtongreen a row of magnificent and even then venerable elms threw their broad arms over this pleasant spot from a man who was standing beneath the shade of one these noble trees information was obtained that the horsemen had ridden along the harrow road with a faint view of overtaking them the pursuer urged his steed to a quicker pace arrived at westbournegreenthen nothing more than a common covered with gorse and furzebushes and boasting only a couple of cottages and an alehousehe perceived through the hedges the objects of his search slowly ascending the gentle hill that rises from kensallgreen by the time he had reached the summit of this hill he had lost all trace of them and the ardour of the chase having in some measure subsided he began to reproach himself for his folly in having wanderedas he conceivedso far out of his course before retracing his steps however he allowed his gaze to range over the vast and beautiful prospect spread out beneath him which is now hidden from the travellers view by the high walls of the general cemetery and can consequently only be commanded from the interior of that attractive place of burialand which before it was intersected by canals and railroads and portioned out into hippodromes was exquisite indeed after feasting his eye upon this superb panorama he was about to return when he ascertained from a farmer that his nearest road to willesden would be down a lane a little further on to the right following this direction he opened a gate and struck into one of the most beautiful green lanes imaginable which after various windings conducted him into a more frequented road and eventually brought him to the place he sought glancing at the fingerpost over the cage which has been described as situated at the outskirts of the village and seeing no directions to dollis hill he made fresh inquiries as to where it lay from an elderly man who was standing with another countryman near the little prison whose house do you want master said the man touching his hat mr woods was the reply there is dollis hill said the man pointing to a wellwooded eminence about a mile distant and there he added indicating the roof of a house just visible above a grove of trees is mr woods if you ride past the church and mount the hill youll come to neasdon and then youll not have above half a mile to go the young man thanked his informant and was about to follow his instructions when the other called after him i say master did you ever hear tell of mr woods famous prentice what apprentice asked the stranger in surprise why jack sheppard the notorious housebreakerhim as has robbed half lunnun to be sure you must know sir when he was a lad the day after he broke into his masters house in wych street he picked a gentlemans pocket in our church during sarvice timethat he did the heathen the gentleman catched him i th fact and we shut him up for safety i that prisn but said the fellow with a laugh he soon contrived to make his way out on it though ever since hes become so famous the folks about here ha christened it jack sheppards cage his mother used to live i this village just down yonder but when her son took to bad ways she went distractedand now shes i bedlam ive heerd i tell ee what john dump said the other fellow who had hitherto preserved silence i dont know whether you talkin o jack sheppard has put him into my head or not but i once had him pointed out to me and if that were him as i seed then hes just now ridden past us and put up at the six bells the deuce he has cried dump if you were sure o that we might seize him and get the reward for his apprehension that ud be no such easy matter replied the countryman jacks a desperate fellow and is always well armed besides he has a comrade with him but ill tell ee what we might do the young man heard no more taking the direction pointed out he rode off as he passed the six bells he noticed the steeds of the two horsemen at the door and glancing into the house perceived the younger of the two in the passage the latter no sooner beheld him than he dashed hastily into an adjoining room after debating with himself whether he should further seek an interview which though now in his power was so sedulously shunned by the other party he decided in the negative and contenting himself with writing upon a slip of paper the hasty wordsyou are known by the villagersbe upon your guardhe gave it to the ostler with instructions to deliver it instantly to the owner of the horse he pointed out and pursued his course passing the old rectory and still older church with its reverend screen of trees and slowly ascending a hill side from whence he obtained enchanting peeps of the spire and college of harrow he reached the cluster of wellbuilt houses which constitute the village of neasdon from this spot a road more resembling the drive through a park than a public thoroughfare led him gradually to the brow of dollis hill it was a serene and charming evening and twilight was gently stealing over the face of the country bordered by fine timber the road occasionally offered glimpses of a lovely valley until a wider opening gave a full view of a delightful and varied prospect on the left lay the heights of hampstead studded with villas while farther off a hazy cloud marked the position of the metropolis the stranger concluded he could not be far from his destination and a turn in the road showed him the house beneath two tall elms whose boughs completely overshadowed the roof stood mr woods dwellinga plain substantial commodious farmhouse on a bench at the foot of the trees with a pipe in his mouth and a tankard by his side sat the worthy carpenter looking the picture of goodheartedness and benevolence the progress of time was marked in mr wood by increased corpulence and decreased powers of visionby deeper wrinkles and higher shoulders by scantier breath and a fuller habit still he looked hale and hearty and the country life he led had imparted a ruddier glow to his cheek around him were all the evidences of plenty a world of haystacks beanstacks and strawricks flanked the granges adjoining his habitation the yard was crowded with poultry pigeons were feeding at his feet cattle were being driven towards the stall horses led to the stable a large mastiff was rattling his chain and stalking majestically in front of his kennel while a number of farmingmen were passing and repassing about their various occupations at the back of the house on a bank rose an oldfashioned terracegarden full of appletrees and other fruittrees in blossom and lively with the delicious verdure of early spring hearing the approach of the rider mr wood turned to look at him it was now getting dusk and he could only imperfectly distinguish the features and figure of the stranger i need not ask whether this is mr woods said the latter since i find him at his own gate you are right sir said the worthy carpenter rising i am owen wood at your service you do not remember me i dare say observed the stranger i cant say i do replied wood your voice seems familiar to meandbut im getting a little deafand my eyes dont serve me quite so well as they used to do especially by this light never mind returned the stranger dismounting youll recollect me by and by ive no doubt i bring you tidings of an old friend then youre heartily welcome sir whoever you are pray walk in here jem take the gentlemans horse to the stablesee him dressed and fed directly now sir will you please to follow me mr wood then led the way up a rather high and according to modern notions incommodious flight of steps and introduced his guest to a neat parlour the windows of which were darkened by pots of flowers and creepers there was no light in the room but notwithstanding this the young man did not fail to detect the buxom figure of mrs wood now more buxom and more gorgeously arrayed than everas well as a young and beautiful female in whom he was at no loss to recognise the carpenters daughter winifred wood was now in her twentieth year her features were still slightly marked by the disorder alluded to in the description of her as a childbut that was the only drawback to her beauty their expression was so amiable that it would have redeemed a countenance a thousand times plainer than hers her figure was perfecttall graceful roundedand then she had deep liquid blue eyes that rivalled the stars in lustre on the strangers appearance she was seated near the window busily occupied with her needle my wife and daughter sir said the carpenter introducing them to his guest mrs wood whose admiration for masculine beauty was by no means abated glanced at the wellproportioned figure of the young man and made him a very civil salutation winifreds reception was kind but more distant and after the slight ceremonial she resumed her occupation this gentleman brings us tidings of an old friend my dear said the carpenter ay indeed and who may that be inquired his wife one whom you may perhaps have forgotten replied the stranger but who can never forget the kindness he experienced at your hands or at those of your excellent husband at the sound of his voice every vestige of colour fled from winifreds cheeks and the work upon which she was engaged fell from her hand i have a token to deliver to you continued the stranger addressing her to me gasped winifred this locket he said taking a little ornament attached to a black ribband from his breast and giving it herdo you remember it i doi do cried winifred whats all this exclaimed wood in amazement do you not know me father said the young man advancing towards him and warmly grasping his hand have nine years so changed me that there is no trace left of your adopted son god bless me ejaculated the carpenter rubbing his eyes cancan it be surely screamed mrs wood joining the group it isnt thames darrell come to life again it isit is cried winifred rushing towards him and flinging her arms round his neckit is my deardear brother well this is what i never expected to see said the carpenter wiping his eyes i hope im not dreaming thames my dear boy as soon as winny has done with you let me embrace you my turn comes before yours sir interposed his better half come to my arms thames oh dear oh dear to repeat the questions and congratulations which now ensued or describe the extravagant joy of the carpenter who after he had hugged his adopted son to his breast with such warmth as almost to squeeze the breath from his body capered around the room threw his wig into the empty firegrate and committed various other fantastic actions in order to get rid of his superfluous satisfactionto describe the scarcely less extravagant raptures of his spouse or the more subdued but not less heartfelt delight of winifred would be a needless task as it must occur to every ones imagination supper was quickly served the oldest bottle of wine was brought from the cellar the strongest barrel of ale was tapped but not one of the party could eat or drinktheir hearts were too full thames sat with winifreds hand clasped in his own and commenced a recital of his adventures which may be briefly told carried out to sea by van galgebrok and thrown overboard while struggling with the waves he had been picked up by a french fishingboat and carried to ostend after encountering various hardships and privations for a long time during which he had no means of communicating with england he at length found his way to paris where he was taken notice of by cardinal dubois who employed him as one of his secretaries and subsequently advanced to the service of philip of orleans from whom he received a commission on the death of his royal patron he resolved to return to his own country and after various delays which had postponed it to the present time he had succeeded in accomplishing his object winifred listened to his narration with the profoundest attention and when it concluded her tearful eye and throbbing bosom told how deeply her feelings had been interested the discourse then turned to darrells old playmate jack sheppard and mr wood in deploring his wild career adverted to the melancholy condition to which it had reduced his mother for my part its only what i expected of him observed mrs wood and im sorry and surprised he hasnt swung for his crimes before this the gallows has groaned for him for years as to his mother ive no pity for her she deserves what has befallen her dear mother dont say so returned winifred one of the consequences of criminal conduct is the shame and disgrace whichworse than any punishment the evildoer can sufferis brought by it upon the innocent relatives and if jack had considered this perhaps he would not have acted as he has done and have entailed so much misery on his unhappy parent i always detested mrs sheppard cried the carpenters wife bitterly and i repeat bedlams too good for her my dear observed wood you should be more charitable charitable repeated his wife thats your constant cry marry come up ive been a great deal too charitable heres winny always urging you to go and visit mrs sheppard in the asylum and take her this and send her thatand ive never prevented you though such mistaken liberalitys enough to provoke a saint and then forsooth she must needs prevent your hanging jack sheppard after the robbery in wych street when you might have done so perhaps youll call that charity i call it defeating the ends of justice see what a horrible rascal youve let loose upon the world im sure mother rejoined winifred if any one was likely to feel resentment i was for no one could be more frightened but i was sorry for poor jackas i am still and hoped he would mend mend echoed mrs wood contemptuously hell never mend till he comes to tyburn at least i will hope so returned winifred but as i was saying i was most dreadfully frightened on the night of the robbery though so young at the time i remember every circumstance distinctly i was sitting up lamenting your departure dear thames when hearing an odd noise i went to the landing and by the light of a dark lantern saw jack sheppard stealing up stairs followed by two men with crape on their faces im ashamed to say that i was too much terrified to scream outbut ran and hid myself hold your tongue cried mrs wood i declare you throw me into an ague do you think i forget it didnt they help themselves to all the plate and the moneyto several of my best dresses and amongst others to my favourite kincob gown and ive never been able to get another like it marry come up id hang em all if i could were such a thing to happen again id never let mr wood rest till he brought the villains to justice i hope such a thing never will happen again my dear observed wood mildly but when it does it will be time to consider what course we ought to pursue let them attempt it if they dare cried mrs wood who had worked herself into a passion and ill warrant em the boldest robber among em shall repent it if he comes across me no doubt my dear acquiesced the carpenter no doubt thames who had been more than once on the point of mentioning his accidental rencounter with jack sheppard not being altogether without apprehension from the fact of his being in the neighbourhoodnow judged it more prudent to say nothing on the subject from a fear of increasing mrs woods displeasure and he was the more readily induced to do this as the conversation began to turn upon his own affairs mr wood could give him no further information respecting sir rowland trenchard than what he had obtained from kneebone but begged him to defer the further consideration of the line of conduct he meant to pursue until the morrow when he hoped to have a plan to lay before him of which he would approve the night was now advancing and the party began to think of separating as mrs wood who had recovered her good humour quitted the room she bestowed a hearty embrace on thames and she told him laughingly that she would defer all she had to propose to him until tomorrow tomorrow she never beheld it after an affectionate parting with winifred thames was conducted by the carpenter to his sleeping apartmenta comfortable cosy chamber such a one in short as can only be met with in the country with its dimitycurtained bed its sheets fragrant of lavender its clean white furniture and an atmosphere breathing of freshness left to himself he took a survey of the room and his heart leaped as he beheld over the chimneypiece a portrait of himself it was a copy of the pencil sketch taken of him nine years ago by winifred and awakened a thousand tender recollections when about to retire to rest the rencounter with jack sheppard again recurred to him and he half blamed himself for not acquainting mr wood with the circumstances and putting him upon his guard against the possibility of an attack on weighing the matter over he grew so uneasy that he resolved to descend and inform him of his misgivings but when he got to the door with this intention he became ashamed of his fears and feeling convinced that jackbad as he might bewas not capable of such atrocious conduct as to plunder his benefactor twice he contented himself with looking to the priming of his pistols and placing them near him to be ready in case of need he threw himself on the bed and speedily fell asleep chapter ii the burglary at dollis hill thames darrells fears were not however groundless danger in the form he apprehended was lurking outside nor was he destined to enjoy long repose on receiving the warning note from the ostler jack sheppard and his companion left willesden and takingas a blindthe direction of harrow returned at nightfall by a bylane to neasdon and put up at a little publichouse called the spotted dog here they remained till midnight when calling for their reckoning and their steeds they left the house it was a night wellfitted to their enterprise calm still and profoundly dark as they passed beneath the thick trees that shade the road to dollis hill the gloom was almost impenetrable the robbers proceeded singly and kept on the grass skirting the road so that no noise was made by their horses feet as they neared the house jack sheppard who led the way halted and addressed his companion in a low voice i dont half like this job blueskin he said it always went against the grain but since ive seen the friend and companion of my childhood thames darrell ive no heart for it shall we turn back and disappoint mr wild captain remonstrated the other in a deferential tone you know this is a pet project it might be dangerous to thwart him pish cried jack i dont value his anger a straw all our fraternity are afraid of him but i laugh at his threats he darent quarrel with me and if he does let him look to himself ive my own reasons for disliking this job well you know i always act under your orders captain returned blueskin and if you give the word to retreat i shall obey of course but i know what edgeworth bess will say when we go home emptyhanded why what will she say inquired sheppard that we were afraid replied the other but never mind her ay but i do mind her cried jack upon whom his comrades observation had produced the desired effect well do it thats right captain rejoined blueskin you pledged yourself to mr wild i did interrupted jack and i never yet broke an engagement though a thief jack sheppard is a man of his word to be sure he is acquiesced blueskin i should like to meet the man who would dare to gainsay it one word before we begin blueskin said jack authoritatively in case the family should be alarmedmind no violence theres one person in the house whom i wouldnt frighten for the world woods daughter i suppose observed the other youve hit it answered sheppard what say you to carrying her off captain suggested blueskin if youve a fancy for the girl we might do it nono laughed jack bess wouldnt bear a rival but if you wish to do old wood a friendly turn you may bring his wife i shouldnt mind ridding him of her said blueskin gruffly and if she comes in my way may the devil seize me if i dont make short work with her you forget rejoined jack sternly ive just said ill have no violencemind that with this they dismounted and fastening their horses to a tree proceeded towards the house it was still so dark that nothing could be distinguished except the heavy masses of timber by which the premises were surrounded but as they advanced lights were visible in some of the windows presently they came to a wall on the other side of which the dog began to bark violently but blueskin tossed him a piece of prepared meat and uttering a low growl he became silent they then clambered over a hedge and scaling another wall got into the garden at the back of the house treading with noiseless step over the soft mould they soon reached the building arrived there jack felt about for a particular window and having discovered the object of his search and received the necessary implements from his companion he instantly commenced operations in a few seconds the shutter flew openthen the windowand they were in the room jack now carefully closed the shutters while blueskin struck a light with which he set fire to a candle the room they were in was a sort of closet with the door locked outside but this was only a moments obstacle to jack who with a chisel forced back the bolt the operation was effected with so much rapidity and so little noise that even if any one had been on the alert he could scarcely have detected it they then took off their boots and crept stealthily up stairs treading upon the point of their toes so cautiously that not a board creaked beneath their weight pausing at each door on the landing jack placed his ear to the keyhole and listened intently having ascertained by the breathing which room thames occupied he speedily contrived to fasten him in he then tried the door of mr woods bedchamberit was locked with the key left in it this occasioned a little delay but jack whose skill as a workman in the particular line he had chosen was unequalled and who laughed at difficulties speedily cut out a panel by means of a centrebit and knife took the key from the other side and unlocked the door covering his face with a crape mask and taking the candle from his associate jack entered the room and pistol in hand stepped up to the bed and approached the light to the eyes of the sleepers illustration the loud noise proceeding from the couch proved that their slumbers were deep and real and unconscious of the danger in which she stood mrs wood turned over to obtain a more comfortable position during this movement jack grasped the barrel of his pistol held in his breath and motioned to blueskin who bared a long knife to keep still the momentary alarm over he threw a piece ofwash leather over a bureau so as to deaden the sound and instantly broke it open with a small crowbar while he was filling his pockets with golden coin from this store blueskin had pulled the platechest from under the bed and having forced it open began filling a canvass bag with its contentssilver coffeepots chocolatedishes waiters trays tankards goblets and candlesticks it might be supposed that these articles when thrust together into the bag would have jingled but these skilful practitioners managed matters so well that no noise was made after rifling the room of everything portable including some of mrs woods ornaments and wearing apparel they prepared to depart jack then intimated his intention of visiting winifreds chamber in which several articles of value were known to be kept but as notwithstanding his reckless character he still retained a feeling of respect for the object of his boyish affections he would not suffer blueskin to accompany him so he commanded him to keep watch over the sleepersstrictly enjoining him however to do them no injury again having recourse to the centrebitfor winifreds door was lockedjack had nearly cut out a panel when a sudden outcry was raised in the carpenters chamber the next moment a struggle was heard and blueskin appeared at the door followed by mrs wood jack instantly extinguished the light and called to his comrade to come after him but blueskin found it impossible to make offat least with the spoilmrs wood having laid hold of the canvassbag give back the things cried the lady helphelp mr wood leave go thundered blueskinleave goyoud betterand he held the sack as firmly as he could with one hand while with the other he searched for his knife no i wont leave go screamed mrs wood firemurderthievesive got one of em come along cried jack i cant answered blueskin this shedevil has got hold of the sack leave go i tell you and he forced open the knife with his teeth helpmurderthieves screamed mrs woodowenowenthames help coming cried mr wood leaping from the bed where are you here replied mrs wood helpill hold him leave her cried jack darting down stairs amid a furious ringing of bellsthe house is alarmedfollow me curses light on you cried blueskin savagely since you wont be advised take your fate and seizing her by the hair he pulled back her head and drew the knife with all his force across her throat there was a dreadful stifled groan and she fell heavily upon the landing the screams of the unfortunate woman had aroused thames from his slumbers snatchingup his pistols he rushed to the door but to his horror found it fastened he heard the struggle on the landing the fall of the heavy body the groanand excited almost to frenzy by his fears he succeeded in forcing open the door by this time several of the terrified domestics appeared with lights a terrible spectacle was presented to the young mans gazethe floor deluged with bloodthe mangled and lifeless body of mrs woodwinifred fainted in the arms of a female attendantand wood standing beside them almost in a state of distraction thus in a few minutes had this happy family been plunged into the depths of misery at this juncture a cry was raised by a servant from below that the robbers were flying through the garden darting to a window looking in that direction thames threw it up and discharged both his pistols but without effect in another minute the tramp of horses feet told that the perpetrators of the outrage had effected their escape chapter iii jack sheppards quarrel with jonathan wild scarcely an hour after the horrible occurrence just related as jonathan wild was seated in the audiencechamber of his residence at the old bailey occupied like peachum for whose portrait he sat with his accountbooks and registers he was interrupted by the sudden entrance of quilt arnold who announced jack sheppard and blueskin ah cried wild laying down his pen and looking up with a smile of satisfaction i was just thinking of you jack what news have you done the trick at dollis hillbrought off the swageh no answered jack flinging himself sullenly into a chair ive not why hows this exclaimed jonathan jack sheppard failed id not believe it if any one but himself told me so ive not failed returned jack angrily but weve done too much im no reader of riddles said jonathan speak plainly let this speak for me said sheppard tossing a heavy bag of money towards him you can generally understand that language theres more than i undertook to bring it has been purchased by blood what have you cut old woods throat asked wild with great unconcern as he took up the bag if i had youd not have seen me here replied jack sullenly the blood that has been spilt is that of his wife it was her own fault observed blueskin moodily she wouldnt let me go i did it in selfdefence i care not why you did it said jack sternly we work together no more come come captain remonstrated blueskin i thought youd have got rid of your illhumour by this time you know as well as i do that it was accident accident or not rejoined sheppard youre no longer pall of mine and so this is my reward for having made you the tiptop cracksman you are muttered blueskinto be turned off at a moments notice because i silenced a noisy woman its too hard think better of it my minds made up rejoined jack coldlywe part tonight ill not go answered the other i love you like a son and will follow you like a dog youd not know what to do without me and shant drive me off well remarked jonathan who had paid little attention to the latter part of the conversation this is an awkward business certainly but we must do the best we can in it you must keep out of the way till its blown over i can accommodate you below i dont require it returned sheppard im tired of the life im leading i shall quit it and go abroad ill go with you said blueskin before either of you go you will ask my permission said jonathan coolly how exclaimed sheppard do you mean to say you will interfere i mean to say this interrupted wild with contemptuous calmness that ill neither allow you to leave england nor the profession youve engaged in i wouldnt allow you to be honest even if you could be sowhich i doubt you are my slaveand such you shall continue slave echoed jack dare to disobey continued jonathan neglect my orders and i will hang you sheppard started to his feet hear me he cried restraining himself with difficulty it is time you should know whom you have to deal with henceforth i utterly throw off the yoke you have laid upon me i will neither stir hand nor foot for you more attempt to molest me and i split you are more in my power than i am in yours jack sheppard is a match for jonathan wild any day that he is added blueskin approvingly jonathan smiled contemptuously one motive alone shall induce me to go on with you said jack whats that asked wild the youth whom you delivered to van galgebrokthames darrell is returned impossible cried jonathan he was thrown overboard and perished at sea he is alive replied jack i have seen him and might have conversed with him if i had chosen now i know you can restore him to his rights if you choose do so and i am yours as heretofore humph exclaimed jonathan your answer cried sheppard yes or no i will make no terms with you rejoined wild sternly you have defied me and shall feel my power you have been useful to me or i would not have spared you thus long i swore to hang you two years ago but i deferred my purpose deferred echoed sheppard hear me out said jonathan you came hither under my protection and you shall depart freelynay more you shall have an hours grace after that time i shall place my setters on your heels you cannot prevent my departure replied jack dauntlessly and therefore your offer is no favour but i tell you in return i shall take no pains to hide myself if you want me you know where to find me an hour said jonathan looking at his watchremember if you send for me to the cross shovels in the mint where im going with blueskin i will surrender myself without resistance returned jack you will spare the officers a labour then rejoined jonathan cant i settle this business captain muttered blueskin drawing a pistol dont harm him said jack carelessly he dares not do it so saying he left the room blueskin said jonathan as that worthy was about to follow i advise you to remain with me no answered the ruffian moodily if you arrest him you must arrest me also as you will said jonathan seating himself jack and his comrade went to the mint where he was joined by edgeworth bess with whom he sat down most unconcernedly to supper his revelry however was put an end at the expiration of the time mentioned by jonathan by the entrance of a posse of constables with quilt arnold and abraham mendez at their head jack to the surprise of all his companions at once surrendered himself but blueskin would have made a fierce resistance and attempted a rescue if he had not been ordered by his leader to desist he then made off edgeworth bess who passed for sheppards wife was secured they were hurried before a magistrate and charged by jonathan wild with various robberies but as jack sheppard stated that he had most important disclosures to make as well as charges to bring forward against his accuser he was committed with his female companion to the new prison in clerkenwell for further examination chapter iv jack sheppards escape from the new prison in consequence of jack sheppards desperate character it was judged expedient by the keeper of the new prison to load him with fetters of unusual weight and to place him in a cell which from its strength and security was called the newgate ward the ward in which he was confined was about six yards in length and three in width and in height might be about twelve feet the windows which were about nine feet from the floor had no glass but were secured by thick iron bars and an oaken beam along the floor ran an iron bar to which jacks chain was attached so that he could move along it from one end of the chamber to the other no prisoner except edgeworth bess was placed in the same cell with him jack was in excellent spirits and by his wit drollery and agreeable demeanour speedily became a great favourite with the turnkey who allowed him every indulgence consistent with his situation the report of his detention caused an immense sensation numberless charges were preferred against him amongst others information was lodged of the robbery at dollis hill and murder of mrs wood and a large reward offered for the apprehension of blueskin and as in addition to this jack had threatened to impeach wild his next examination was looked forward to with the greatest interest the day before this examination was appointed to take placethe third of the prisoners detentionan old man respectably dressed requested permission to see him jacks friends were allowed to visit him but as he had openly avowed his intention of attempting an escape their proceedings were narrowly watched the old man was conducted to jacks cell by the turnkey who remained near him during their interview he appeared to be a stranger to the prisoner and the sole motive of his visit curiosity after a brief conversation which sheppard sustained with his accustomed liveliness the old man turned to bess and addressed a few words of commonplace gallantry to her while this was going on jack suddenly made a movement which attracted the turnkeys attention and during that interval the old man slipped some articles wrapped in a handkerchief into besss hands who instantly secreted them in her bosom the turnkey looked round the next moment but the manoeuvre escaped his observation after a little further discourse the old man took his departure left alone with edgeworth bess jack burst into a loud laugh of exultation blueskins a friend in need he said his disguise was capital but i detected it in a moment has he given you the tools he has replied bess producing the handkerchief bravo cried sheppard examining its contents which proved to be a file a chisel two or three gimblets and a piercer jonathan wild shall find its not easy to detain me as sure as he is now living ill pay him a visit in the old bailey before morning and then ill pay off old scores its almost worth while being sent to prison to have the pleasure of escaping i shall now be able to test my skill and running on in this way he carefully concealed the tools whether the turnkey entertained any suspicion of the old man jack could not tell but that night he was more than usually rigorous in his search and having carefully examined the prisoners and finding nothing to excite his suspicions he departed tolerably satisfied as soon as he was certain he should be disturbed no more jack set to work and with the aid of the file in less than an hour had freed himself from his fetters with besss assistance he then climbed up to the window which as has just been stated was secured by iron bars of great thickness crossed by a stout beam of oak the very sight of these impediments would have appalled a less courageous spirit than sheppardsbut nothing could daunt him to work then he went and with wonderful industry filed off two of the iron bars just as he completed this operation the file broke the oaken beam nine inches in thickness was now the sole but most formidable obstacle to his flight with his gimblet he contrived to bore a number of holes so close together that at last one end of the bar being completely pierced through yielded and pursuing the same with the other extremity it fell out altogether this last operation was so fatiguing that for a short time he was obliged to pause to recover the use of his fingers he then descended and having induced bess to take off some part of her clothing he tore the gown and petticoat into shreds and twisted them into a sort of rope which he fastened to the lower bars of the window with some difficulty he contrived to raise her to the window and with still greater difficulty to squeeze her through ither bulk being much greater than his own he then made a sort of running noose passed it over her body and taking firmly hold of the bars prepared to guide her descent but bess could scarcely summon resolution enough to hazard the experiment and it was only on jacks urgent intreaties and even threats that she could be prevailed on to trust herself to the frail tenure of the rope he had prepared at length however she threw herself off and jack carefully guiding the rope she landed in safety illustration the next moment he was by her side but the great point was still unaccomplished they had escaped from the new prison it is true but the wall of clerkenwell bridewell by which that jail was formerly surrounded and which was more than twenty feet high and protected by formidable and bristling chevaux de frise remained to be scaled jack however had an expedient for mastering this difficulty he ventured to the great gates and by inserting his gimblets into the wood at intervals so as to form points upon which he could rest his foot he contrived to ascend them and when at the top having fastened a portion of his dress to the spikes he managed not without considerable risk to draw up his female companion once over the iron spikes bess exhibited no reluctance to be let down on the other side of the wall having seen his mistress safe down jack instantly descended leaving the best part of his clothes as a memorial of his flight to the jailor and thus he effected his escape from the new prison chapter v the disguise in a hollow in the meadows behind the prison whence jack sheppard had escapedfor at this time the whole of the now thicklypeopled district north of clerkenwell bridewell was open country stretching out in fertile fields in the direction of islingtonand about a quarter of a mile off stood a solitary hovel known as black marys hole this spot which still retains its name acquired the appellation from an old crone who lived there and who in addition to a very equivocal character for honesty enjoyed the reputation of being a witch without inquiring into the correctness of the latter part of the story it may be sufficient to state that black mary was a person in whom jack sheppard thought he could confide and as edgeworth bess was incapable of much further exertion he determined to leave her in the old womans care till the following night while he shifted for himself and fulfilled his designfor however rash or hazardous a project might be if once conceived jack always executed itof visiting jonathan wild at his house in the old bailey it was precisely two oclock on the morning of whitmonday the th of may when the remarkable escape before detailed was completed and though it wanted full two hours to daybreak the glimmer of a waning moon prevented it from being totally dark casting a hasty glance as he was about to turn an angle of the wall at the great gates and upper windows of the prison and perceiving no symptoms of pursuit jack proceeded towards the hovel at a very deliberate pace carefully assisting his female companion over every obstacle in the road and bearing her in his arms when as was more than once the case she sank from fright and exhaustion in this way he crossed one or two public gardens and a bowlinggreenthe neighbourhood of clerkenwell then abounded in such places of amusementpassed the noted ducking pond where black mary had been frequently immersed and striking off to the left across the fields arrived in a few minutes at his destination descending the hollow or rather excavationfor it was an old disused claypit at the bottom of which the cottage was situatedhe speedily succeeded in arousing the ancient sibyl and having committed edgeworth bess to her care with a promise of an abundant reward in case she watched diligently over her safety and attended to her comforts till his returnto all which black mary readily agreedhe departed with a heart lightened of half its load jacks first object was to seek out blueskin whom he had no doubt he should find at the new mint at wapping for the old mint no longer afforded a secure retreat to the robber and with this view he made the best of his way along a byelane leading towards hockleyinthehole he had not proceeded far when he was alarmed by the tramp of a horse which seemed to be rapidly approaching and he had scarcely time to leap the hedge and conceal himself behind a tree when a tall man enveloped in an ample cloak with his hat pulled over his brows rode by at full speed another horseman followed quickly at the heels of the first but just as he passed the spot where jack stood his steed missed its footing and fell either ignorant of the accident or heedless of it the foremost horseman pursued his way without even turning his head conceiving the opportunity too favourable to be lost jack sprang suddenly over the hedge and before the man who was floundering on the ground with one foot in the stirrup could extricate himself from his embarrassing position secured his pistols which he drew from the holsters and held them to his head the fellow swore lustily in a voice which jack instantly recognised as that of quilt arnold and vainly attempted to rise and draw his sword dog thundered sheppard putting the muzzle of the pistol so close to the janizarys ear that the touch of the cold iron made him start dont you know me blood and thunder exclaimed quilt opening his eyes with astonishment it cant be captain sheppard it is replied jack and you had better have met the devil on your road than me do you remember what i said when you took me at the mint four days ago i told you my turn would come it has comeand sooner than you expected so i find captain rejoined quilt submissively but youre too noblehearted to take advantage of my situation besides i acted for others and not for myself i know it replied sheppard and therefore i spare your life i was sure you wouldnt injure me captain remarked quilt in a wheedling tone while he felt about for his sword youre far too brave to strike a fallen man ah traitor cried jack who had noticed the movement make such another attempt and it shall cost you your life so saying he unbuckled the belt to which the janizarys hanger was attached and fastened it to his own girdle and now he continued sternly was it your master who has just ridden by no answered quilt sullenly who then demanded jack speak or i fire well if you will have it its sir rowland trenchard sir rowland trenchard echoed jack in amazement what are you doing with him its a long story captain and ive no breath to tell itunless you choose to release me rejoined quilt get up then said jack freeing his foot from the stirrup nowbegin quilt however seemed unwilling to speak i should be sorry to proceed to extremities continued sheppard again raising the pistol well since you force me to betray my masters secrets replied quilt sullenly ive ridden express to manchester to deliver a message to sir rowland respecting thames darrell observed jack why how the devil did you happen to guess that cried the janizary no matter replied sheppard im glad to find im right you informed sir rowland that thames darrell was returned exactly so replied quilt and he instantly decided upon returning to london with me weve ridden post all the way and im horribly tired or you wouldnt have mastered me so easily perhaps not replied jack to whom an idea had suddenly occurred now sir ill trouble you for your coat ive left mine on the spikes of the new prison and must borrow yours why surely you cant be in earnest captain you wouldnt rob mr wilds chief janizary id rob mr wild himself if i met him retorted jack come off with it sirrah or ill blow out your brains in the first place and strip you afterwards well rather than you should commit so great a crime captain here it is replied quilt handing him the garment in question anything else your waistcoat zounds captain i shall get my death of cold i was in hopes youd be content with my hat and wig i shall require them as well rejoined sheppard and your boots my boots fire and fury they wont fit you they are too large besides how am i to ride home without them dont distress yourself returned jack you shall walk now he added as his commands were reluctantly obeyed help me on with them quilt knelt down as if he meant to comply but watching his opportunity he made a sudden grasp at sheppards leg with the intention of overthrowing him but jack was too nimble for him striking out his foot he knocked half a dozen teeth down the janizarys throat and seconding the kick with a blow on the head from the buttend of the pistol stretched him senseless and bleeding on the ground like master like man observed jack as he rolled the inanimate body to the side of the road from jonathan wilds confidential servant what could be expected but treachery with this he proceeded to dress himself in quilt arnolds clothes pulled the wig over his face and eyes so as completely to conceal his features slouched the hat over his brows drew the huge boots above his knees and muffled himself up in the best way he could on searching the coat he found amongst other matters a mask a key and a pocketbook the latter appeared to contain several papers which jack carefully put by in the hope that they might turn out of importance in a scheme of vengeance which he meditated against the thieftaker he then mounted the jaded hack which had long since regained its legs and was quietly browsing the grass at the roadside and striking spurs into its side rode off he had not proceeded far when he encountered sir rowland who having missed his attendant had returned to look after him what has delayed you demanded the knight impatiently my horse has had a fall replied jack assuming to perfectionfor he was a capital mimicthe tones of quilt arnold it was some time before i could get him to move i fancied i heard voices rejoined sir rowland so did i answered jack we had better move on this is a noted place for highwaymen i thought you told me that the rascal who has so long been the terror of the townjack sheppardwas in custody so he is returned jack but theres no saying how long he may remain so besides there are greater rascals than jack sheppard at liberty sir rowland sir rowland made no reply but angrily quickened his pace the pair then descended saffronhill threaded fieldlane and entering holborn passed over the little bridge which then crossed the muddy waters of fleetditch mounted snowhill and soon drew in the bridle before jonathan wilds door aware of quilt arnolds mode of proceeding jack instantly dismounted and instead of knocking opened the door with the passkey the porter instantly made his appearance and sheppard ordered him to take care of the horses well what sort of journey have you had quilt asked the man as he hastened to assist sir rowland to dismount oh weve lost no time as you perceive replied jack is the governor within yes youll find him in the audiencechamber he has got blueskin with him ah indeed whats he doing here inquired jack come to buy off jack sheppard i suppose replied the fellow but it wont do mr wild has made up his mind and when thats the case all the persuasion on earth wont turn him jack will be tried tomorrow and as sure as my names obadiah lemon hell take up his quarters at the kingshead pointing to newgate over the way well we shall see replied jack look to the horses obadiah this way sir rowland as familiar as quilt arnold himself with every part of wilds mysterious abode as well as with the ways of its inmates jack without a moments hesitation took up a lamp which was burning in the hall and led his companion up the great stone stairs arrived at the audiencechamber he set down the light upon a stand threw open the door and announced in a loud voice but with the perfect intonation of the person he representedsir rowland trenchard jonathan who was engaged in conversation with blueskin instantly arose and bowed with cringing ceremoniousness to the knight the latter haughtily returned his salutation and flung himself as if exhausted into a chair youve arrived sooner than i expected sir rowland observed the thieftaker lost no time on the roadehi didnt expect you till tomorrow at the earliest excuse me an instant while i dismiss this personyouve your answer blueskin he added pushing that individual who seemed unwilling to depart towards the door its useless to urge the matter further jack is registered in the black book one word before i go urged blueskin not a syllable replied wild if you talk as long as an old bailey counsel youll not alter my determination wont my life do as well as his supplicated the other humph exclaimed jonathan doubtfully and you would surrender yourselfeh ill surrender myself at once if youll engage to bring him off and youll get the reward from old wood its two hundred pounds recollect that faithful fellow murmured jack i forgive him his disobedience will you do it persisted blueskin no replied wild and ive only listened to your absurd proposal to see how far your insane attachment to this lad would carry you i do love him cried blueskin and thats the long and short of it ive taught him all he can do and there isnt his fellow and never will be again ive seen many a clever cracksman but never one like him if you hang jack sheppard youll cut off the flower o the purfession but ill not believe it of you its all very well to read him a lesson and teach him obedience but youve gone far enough for that not quite rejoined the thieftaker significantly well growled blueskin youve had my offer and you my warning retorted wild good night blueskin whispered jack in his natural tones as the other passed him wait without power o mercy cried blueskin starting whats the matter demanded jonathan harshly nothinnothin returned blueskin only i thought you saw the hangman no doubt said jack take courage man it is only quilt arnold come make yourself scarce dont you see mr wilds busy and then he added in an under tone conceal yourself outside and be within call blueskin nodded and left the room jack affected to close the door but left it slightly ajar what did you say to him inquired jonathan suspiciously i advised him not to trouble you farther about jack sheppard answered the supposed janizary he seems infatuated about the lad observed wild i shall be obliged to hang him to keep him company and now sir rowland he continued turning to the knight to our own concerns its a long time since we met eight years and more i hope youve enjoyed your health slife you are wonderfully altered i should scarcely have known you the knight was indeed greatly changed though not much passed the middle term of life he seemed prematurely stricken with old age his frame was wasted and slightly bent his eyes were hollow his complexion haggard and his beard which had remained unshorn during his hasty journey was perfectly white his manner however was as stern and haughty as ever and his glances retained their accustomed fire i did not come hither to consult you as to the state of my health sir he observed displeased by jonathans allusion to the alteration in his appearance true replied wild you were no doubt surprised by the unlookedfor intelligence i sent you of your nephews return was it unlookedfor on your part demanded the knight distrustfully on my soul yes rejoined jonathan i should as soon have expected the bones of tom sheppard to reunite themselves and walk out of that case as thames darrell to return the skipper van galgebrok affirmed to menay gave me the additional testimony of two of his crewthat he was thrown overboard but it appears he was picked up by fishermen and carried to france where he has remained ever since and where it would have been well for him if he had remained altogether have you seen him asked trenchard i have replied wild and nothing but the evidence of my senses would have made me believe he was living after the positive assurance i received to the contrary he is at present with mr woodthe person whom you may remember adopted himat dollis hill near willesden and its a singular but fortunate circumstance so far as we are concerned that mrs wood chanced to be murdered by blueskin the fellow who just left the room on the very night of his return as it has thrown the house into such confusion and so distracted them that he has had no time as yet for hostile movements and what course do you propose to pursue in reference to him asked sir rowland my plan is a very simple one rejoined the thieftaker smiling bitterly i would treat him as you treated his father sir rowland murder him cried trenchard shuddering ay murder him if you like the term returned wild i should call it putting him out of the way but no matter how you phrase it the end is the same i cannot consent to it replied sir rowland firmly since the sea has spared him i will spare him it is in vain to struggle against the arm of fate i will shed no more blood and perish upon the gibbet rejoined jonathan contemptuously flight is still left me replied trenchard i can escape to france and do you think ill allow you to depart cried jonathan in a menacing tone and compromise my safety no no we are linked together in this matter and must go through with it you cannotshall not retreat death and hell cried sir rowland rising and drawing his sword do you think you can shackle my free will villain in this particular instance i do sir rowland replied jonathan calmly because you are wholly in my power but be patient i am your fast friend thames darrell must die our mutual safety requires it leave the means to me more blood more blood cried trenchard passing his hand with agony across his brow shall i never banish those horrible phantoms from my couchthe father with his bleeding breast and dripping hairthe mother with her wringing hands and looks of vengeance and reproachand must another be added to their numbertheir son horrorlet me be spared this new crime and yet the gibbetmy name tarnishedmy escutcheon blotted by the hangmanno i cannot submit to that i should think not observed jonathan who had some practice in the knights moods and knew how to humour him its a miserable weakness to be afraid of bloodshedthe general who gives an order for wholesale carnage never sleeps a wink the less soundly for the midnight groans of his victims and we should deride him as a coward if he did and life is much the same whether taken in battle on the couch or by the roadside besides those whom ive slain with my own hands ive brought upwards of thirty persons to the gallows most of their relics are in yonder cases but i dont remember that any of them have disturbed my rest the mode of destruction makes no difference its precisely the same thing to me to bid my janizaries cut thames darrells throat as to order jack sheppards execution as jonathan said this jacks hand involuntarily sought a pistol but to the point continued wild unconscious of the peril in which the remark had placed himto the point on the terms that procured your liberation from newgate i will free you from this new danger those terms were a third of my estate observed trenchard bitterly what of that rejoined jonathan any price was better than your head if thames darrell escapes you will lose both life and property true true replied the knight with an agonized look there is no alternative none whatever rejoined wild is it a bargain take half of my estatetake allmy life if you willi am weary of it cried trenchard passionately no replied jonathan ill not take you at your word as regards the latter proposition we shall both i hope live to enjoy our shareslong after thames darrell is forgottenha ha a third of your estate i accept and as these things should always be treated as matters of business ill just draw up a memorandum of our arrangement and as he spoke he took up a sheet of paper and hastily traced a few lines upon it sign this he said pushing the document towards sir rowland the knight mechanically complied with his request enough cried jonathan eagerly pocketing the memorandum and now in return for your liberality ill inform you of a secret with which it is important you should be acquainted a secret exclaimed trenchard concerning whom mrs sheppard replied jonathan mysteriously mrs sheppard echoed jack surprised out of his caution ah exclaimed wild looking angrily towards his supposed attendant i beg pardon sir replied jack with the accent and manner of the janizary i was betrayed into the exclamation by my surprise that anything in which sir rowland trenchard was interested could have reference to so humble a person as mrs sheppard be pleased then in future not to let your surprise find vent in words rejoined jonathan sternly my servants like eastern mutes must have eyes and earsand hands if need bebut no tongues you understand me sirrah perfectly replied jack im dumb your secret demanded trenchard impatiently i need not remind you sir rowland replied wild that you had two sistersaliva and constance both are dead observed the knight gloomily not so answered wild constance is yet living constance alive impossible ejaculated trenchard ive proofs to the contrary replied jonathan if this is the case where is she in bedlam replied the thieftaker with a satanic grin gracious heaven exclaimed the knight upon whom a light seemed suddenly to break you mentioned mrs sheppard what has she to with constance trenchard mrs sheppard is constance trenchard replied jonathan maliciously here jack sheppard was unable to repress an exclamation of astonishment again cried jonathan sternly beware what vociferated trenchard my sister the wife of one condemned felon the parent of another it cannot be it is so nevertheless replied wild stolen by a gipsy when scarcely five years old constance trenchard after various vicissitudes was carried to london where she lived in great poverty with the dregs of society it is useless to trace out her miserable career though i can easily do so if you require it to preserve herself however from destitution or what she considered worse she wedded a journeyman carpenter named sheppard alas that one so highly born should submit to such a degradation groaned the knight i see nothing surprising in it rejoined jonathan in the first place she had no knowledge of her birth and consequently no false pride to get rid of in the second she was wretchedly poor and assailed by temptations of which you can form no idea distress like hers might palliate far greater offences than she ever committed with the same inducements we should all do the same thing poor girl she was beautiful once so beautiful as to make me who care little for the allurements of women fancy myself enamoured of her jack sheppard again sought his pistol and was only withheld from levelling it at the thieftakers head by the hope that he might gather some further information respecting his mother and he had good reason before long to congratulate himself on his forbearance what proof have you of the truth of this story inquired trenchard this replied jonathan taking a paper from a portfolio and handing it to the knight this written evidence signed by martha cooper the gipsy by whom the girl was stolen and who was afterwards executed for a similar crime it is attested you will observe by the reverend mr purney the present ordinary of newgate i am acquainted with mr purneys handwriting said jack advancing and can at once decide whether this is a forgery or not look at it then said wild giving him the portfolio its the ordinarys signature undoubtedly replied jack and as he gave back the portfolio to sir rowland he contrived unobserved to slip the precious document into his sleeve and from thence into his pocket and does any of our bright blood flow in the veins of a ruffianly housebreaker cried trenchard with a look of bewilderment ill not believe it others may if you wont muttered jack retiring thank heaven im not basely born now mark me said jonathan and youll find i dont do things by halves by your father sir montacute trenchards will you are awareand therefore i need not repeat it except for the special purpose i have in viewyou are aware i say that by this will in case your sister aliva died without issue or on the death of such issue the property reverts to constance and her issue i hear said sir rowland moodily and i muttered jack thames darrell once destroyed pursued jonathan constanceor rather mrs sheppardbecomes entitled to the estates which eventuallyprovided he escaped the gallowswould descend to her son ha exclaimed jack drawing in his breath and leaning forward with intense curiosity well sir gasped sir rowland but this need give you no uneasiness pursued jonathan mrs sheppard as i told you is in bedlam an incurable maniac while her son is in the new prison whence he will only be removed to newgate and tyburn so you think muttered jack between his ground teeth to make your mind perfectly easy on the score of mrs sheppard continued jonathan after weve disposed of thames darrell ill visit her in bedlam and as i understand i form one of her chief terrors ill give her such a fright that ill engage she shant long survive it devil muttered jack again grasping his pistol but feeling secure of vengeance he determined to abide his time and now having got rid of the minor obstacles said jonathan ill submit a plan for the removal of the main difficulty thames darrell ive said is at mr woods at dollis hill wholly unsuspicious of any designs against him and in fact entirely ignorant of your being acquainted with his return or even of his existence in this state it will be easy to draw him into a snare tomorrow nightor rather tonight for we are fast verging on another dayi propose to lure him out of the house by a stratagem which i am sure will prove infallible and then what so easy as to knock him on the head to make sure work of it ill superintend the job myself before midnight ill answer for it it shall be done my janizaries shall go with me you hear what i say quilt he added looking at jack i do replied sheppard abraham mendez will like the taskfor he has entertained a hatred to the memory of thames darrell ever since he received the wound in the head when the two lads attempted to break out of st giless roundhouse ive despatched him to the new prison but i expect him back every minute the new prison exclaimed sheppard what is he gone there for with a message to the turnkey to look after his prisoner replied wild with a cunning smile jack sheppard had a visitor i understand yesterday and may make an attempt to escape its as well to be on the safe side it is replied jack at this moment his quick ears detected the sound of footsteps on the stairs he drew both his pistols and prepared for a desperate encounter there is another mystery i would have solved said trenchard addressing wild you have told me much but not enough what do you require further asked jonathan the name and rank of thames darrells father said the knight another time replied the thieftaker evasively i will have it now rejoined trenchard or our agreement is void you cannot help yourself sir rowland replied jonathan contemptuously indeed replied the knight drawing his sword the secret villain or i will force it from you before wild could make any reply the door was thrown violently open and abraham mendez rushed into the room with a face of the utmost consternation he hash eshcaped cried the jew who jack exclaimed jonathan yesh replied abraham i vent to de new prishn and on wishitin his shel vid de turnkey vot should ve find but de shains on de ground de vinder broken and jack and agevorth besh gone damnation cried jonathan stamping his foot with uncontrollable rage id rather have given a thousand pounds than this had happened but he might have broken out of prison and yet not got over the wall of clerkenwell bridewell did you search the yard fool ve did replied abraham and found his fine goat and ruffles torn to shtrips on de shpikes near de creat cate it vosh plain he vent dat vay jonathan gave utterance to a torrent of imprecations while he thus vented his rage the door again opened and quilt arnold rushed into the room bleeding and halfdressed sblood whats this cried jonathan in the utmost surprise quilt arnold is that you it is sir sputtered the janizary ive been robbed maltreated and nearly murdered by jack sheppard by jack sheppard exclaimed the thieftaker yes and i hope youll take ample vengeance upon him said quilt i will when i catch him rely on it rejoined wild you neednt go far to do that returned quilt there he stands ay here i am said jack throwing off his hat and wig and marching towards the group amongst whom there was a general movement of surprise at his audacity sir rowland i salute you as your nephew back villain said the knight haughtily i disown you the whole story of your relationship is a fabrication time will show replied jack with equal haughtiness but however it may turn out i disown you well jack said jonathan who had looked at him with surprise not unmixed with admiration you are a bold and clever fellow i must allow were i not jonathan wild id be jack sheppard im almost sorry ive sworn to hang you but it cant be helped im a slave to my word were i to let you go youd say i feared you besides youve secrets which must not be disclosed nab and quilt to the door jack you are my prisoner and you flatter yourself you can detain me laughed jack at least ill try replied jonathan sarcastically you must be a cleverer lad than even i take you for if you get out of this place what ho blueskin shouted jack here i am captain cried a voice from without and the door was suddenly thrown open and the two janizaries felled to the ground by the strong arm of the stalwart robber your boast you see was a little premature mr wild said sheppard adieu my worthy uncle fortunately ive secured the proof of my birth confusion thundered wild close the doors below loose the dogs curses they dont hear me ill ring the alarmbell and he raised his arm with the intention of executing his purpose when a ball from jacks pistol passed through the back of his hand shattering the limb aha my lad he cried without appearing to regard the pain of the wound now ill show you no quarter and with the uninjured hand he drew a pistol which he fired but without effect at jack fly captain fly vociferated blueskin i shant be able to keep these devils down fly they shall knock me on the headcurse embefore they shall touch you come along cried jack darting through the door the keys on the outsidequick quick instantly alive to this chance blueskin broke away two shots were fired at him by jonathan one of which passed through his hat and the other through the fleshy part of his arm but he made good his retreat the door was closedlockedand the pair were heard descending the stairs hells curses roared jonathan theyll escape not a moment is to be lost so saying he took hold of a ring in the floor and disclosed a flight of steps down which he hurried followed by the janizaries this means of communication instantly brought them to the lobby but jack and his companion were already gone jonathan threw open the streetdoor upon the pavement near the court lay the porter who had been prostrated by a blow from the buttend of a pistol the man who was just able to move pointed towards giltspurstreet jonathan looked in that direction and beheld the fugitives riding off in triumph tonight it is their turn said jonathan binding up his wounded fingers with a handkerchief tomorrow it will be mine chapter vi winifred receives two proposals the tragical affair at dollis hill it need scarcely be said was a dreadful blow to the family mr wood bore up with great fortitude against the shock attended the inquest delivered his evidence with composure and gave directions afterwards for the funeral which took place on the day but one followingsunday as soon however as the last solemn rites were over and the remains of the unfortunate woman committed to their final restingplace in willesden churchyard his firmness completely deserted him and he sank beneath the weight of his affliction it was fortunate that by this time winifred had so far recovered as to be able to afford her father the best and only solace that under the circumstances he could have receivedher personal attentions the necessity which had previously existed of leaving the ghastly evidence of the murderous deed undisturbedthe presence of the mangled corpsethe bustle of the inquest at which her attendance was requiredall these circumstances produced a harrowing effect upon the young girls imagination but when all was over a sorrowful calm succeeded and if not free from grief she was tranquil as to thames though deeply and painfully affected by the horrible occurrence that had marked his return to his old friends he was yet able to control his feelings and devote himself to the alleviation of the distress of the more immediate sufferers by the calamity it was sunday eveninga soft delicious evening and from the happy cheerful look of the house none would have dreamed of the dismal tragedy so lately acted within its walls the birds were singing blithely amid the treesthe lowing of the cows resounded from the yarda delicious perfume from the garden was wafted through the open windowat a distance the churchbells of willesden were heard tolling for evening service all these things spoke of peacebut there are seasons when the pleasantest external influences have a depressing effect on the mind by painfully recalling past happiness so at least thought one of two persons who were seated together in a small backparlour of the house at dollis hill she was a lovely girl attired in deep mourning and having an expression of profound sorrow on her charming features her companion was a portly handsome man also dressed in a full suit of the deepest mourning with the finest of lace at his bosom and wrists and a sword in a black sheath by his side these persons were mr kneebone and winifred the funeral it has just been said took place on that day amongst others who attended the sad ceremony was mr kneebone conceiving himself called upon as the intimate friend of the deceased to pay this last tribute of respect to her memory he appeared as one of the chief mourners overcome by his affliction mr wood had retired to his own room where he had just summoned thames much to her annoyance therefore winifred was left alone with the woollendraper who following up a maxim of his own that nothing was gained by too much bashfulness determined to profit by the opportunity he had only been prevented indeed by a fear of mrs wood from pressing his suit long ago this obstacle removed he thought he might now make the attempt happen what might he could not be in a worse position we have had a sad loss my dear winifred he beganfor i must use the privilege of an old friend and address you by that familiar namewe have had a sad loss in the death of your lamented parent whose memory i shall for ever revere winifreds eyes filled with tears this was not exactly what the woollendraper desired so he resolved to try another tack what a very remarkable thing it is he observed applying to his snuffbox that thames darrell whom we all supposed deadkneebone in his heart sincerely wished he had been soshould turn out to be alive after all strange i shouldnt know him when he called on me it is strange replied winifred artlessly i knew him at once of course rejoined kneebone a little maliciously but thats easily accounted for may i be permitted as a very old and very dear friend of your lamented parent whose loss i shall ever deplore to ask you one question undoubtedly replied winifred and you will answer it frankly certainly now for it thought the woollendraper i shall at least ascertain how the land lieswell then my dear he added aloud do you still entertain the strong attachment you did to captain darrell winifreds cheeks glowed with blushes and fixing her eyes which flashed with resentment upon the questioner she said i have promised to answer your question and i will do so i love him as a brother only as a brother persisted kneebone if winifred remained silent her looks would have disarmed a person of less assurance than the woollendraper if you knew how much importance i attach to your answer he continued passionately you would not refuse me one were captain darrell to offer you his hand would you accept it your impertinence deserves very different treatment sir said winifred but to put an end to this annoyance i will tell youi would not and why not asked kneebone eagerly i will not submit to be thus interrogated said winifred angrily in the name of your lamented parent whose memory i shall for ever revere i implore you to answer me urged kneebone whywhy would you not accept him because our positions are different replied winifred who could not resist this appeal to her feelings you are a paragon of prudence and discretion rejoined the woollendraper drawing his chair closer to hers disparity of rank is ever productive of unhappiness in the married state when captain darrells birth is ascertained ive no doubt hell turn out a noblemans son at least i hope so for his sake as well as my own he added mentally he has quite the air of one and now my angel that i am acquainted with your sentiments on this subject i shall readily fulfil a promise which i made to your lamented parent whose loss i shall ever deplore a promise to my mother said winifred unsuspiciously yes my angel to herrest her soul she extorted it from me and bound me by a solemn oath to fulfil it oh name it you are a party concerned promise me that you will not disobey the injunctions of her whose memory we must both of us ever revere promise me if in my powercertainly but what is it what did you promise to offer you my heart my hand my life replied kneebone falling at her feet sir exclaimed winifred rising inequality of rank can be no bar to our union continued kneebone heaven be praised i am not the son of a nobleman in spite of her displeasure winifred could not help smiling at the absurdity of this address taking this for encouragement her suitor proceeded still more extravagantly seizing her hand he covered it with kisses adorable girl he cried in the most impassioned tone and with the most impassioned look he could command adorable girl i have long loved you to desperation your lamented mother whose loss i shall ever deplore perceived my passion and encouraged it would she were alive to back my suit this is beyond all endurance said winifred striving to withdraw her hand leave me sir i insist never rejoined kneebone with increased ardournever till i receive from your own lips the answer which is to make me the happiest or the most miserable of mankind hear me adorable girl you know not the extent of my devotion no mercenary consideration influences me loveadmiration for your matchless beauty alone sways me let your fatherif he chooses leave all his wealth to his adopted son i care not possessed of you i shall have a treasure such as kings could not boast pray cease this nonsense said winifred and quit the room or i will call for assistance at this juncture the door opened and thames entered the room as the woollendrapers back was towards him he did not perceive him but continued his passionate addresses call as you please beloved girl he cried i will not stir till i am answered you say that you only love captain darrell as a brother mr kneebone that you would not accept him were he to offer be silent sir he then continued the woollendraper is no longer considered how sir cried thames advancing what is the meaning of your reference to my name have you dared to insult this lady if so insult her replied kneebone rising and endeavouring to hide his embarrassment under a look of defiance far from it sir i have made her an honourable proposal of marriage in compliance with the request of her lamented parent whose memory dare to utter that falsehood in my hearing again scoundrel interrupted thames fiercely and i will put it out of your power to repeat the offence leave the room leave the house sir and enter it again at your peril i shall do neither sir replied kneebone unless i am requested by this lady to withdrawin which case i shall comply with her request and you have to thank her presence hotheaded boy that i do not chastise your insolence as it deserves go mr kneebonepray go implored winifred thames i entreat your wishes are my laws beloved girl replied kneebone bowing profoundly captain darren he added sternly you shall hear from me when you please sir said thames coldly and the woollendraper departed what is all this dear winny inquired thames as soon as they were alone nothingnothing she answered bursting into tears dont ask me about it now winny said thames tenderly something which that selfsufficient fool has said has so far done me a service in enabling me to speak upon a subject which i have long had upon my lips but have not had courage to utter thames you seem to doubt my love he continuedyou seem to think that change of circumstances may produce some change in my affections hear me then now before i take one step to establish my origin or secure my rights whatever those rights may be whoever i am my heart is yours do you accept it dear thames forgive this illtimed avowal of my love but answer me am i mistaken is your heart mine it isit is and has ever been replied winifred falling upon his neck lovers confidences should be respected we close the chapter chapter vii jack sheppard warns thames darrell on the following nightnamely mondaythe family assembled together for the first time since the fatal event in the chamber to which thames had been introduced on his arrival at dollis hill as this had been mrs woods favourite sittingroom and her image was so intimately associated with it neither the carpenter nor his daughter could muster courage to enter it before determined however to conquer the feeling as soon as possible wood had given orders to have the evening meal served there but notwithstanding all his good resolutions upon his first entrance he had much ado to maintain his selfcommand his wifes portrait had been removed from the walls and the place it had occupied was only to be known by the cord by which it had been suspended the very blank however affected him more deeply than if it had been left then a handkerchief was thrown over the cage to prevent the bird from singing it was her favourite canary the flowers upon the mantelshelf were withered and droopingshe had gathered them all these circumstancesslight in themselves but powerful in their effecttouched the heart of the widowed carpenter and added to his depression supper was over it had been discussed in silence the cloth was removed and wood drawing the table as near the window as possiblefor it was getting duskput on his spectacles and opened that sacred volume from which the best consolation in affliction is derived and left the loversfor such they may now be fairly termedto their own conversation having already expressed our determination not to betray any confidences of this sort which however interesting to the parties concerned could not possibly be so to others we shall omit also the love passages and proceeding to such topics as may have general interest take up the discourse at the point when thames darrell expressed his determination of starting for manchester as soon as jack sheppards examination had taken place i am surprised we have received no summons for attendance today he remarked perhaps the other robber may be secured or jack have escaped remarked winny i dont think thats likely but this sad affair disposed of i will not rest till i have avenged my murdered parents the avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer said wood who was culling for himself certain texts from the scriptures it is the voice of inspiration said thames and i receive it as a solemn command the villain has enjoyed his security too long bloody and deceitful men shall not live half their days said wood reading aloud another passage and yet he has been spared thus long perhaps with a wise purpose rejoined thames but though the storm has spared him i will not no doubt said wood who had again turned over the leaves of the sacred volume no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he escaped the seas yet vengeance suffereth not to live no feelings of consanguinity shall stay my vengeance said thames sternly i will have no satisfaction but his life thou shalt take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer which is guilty of death but he shall surely be put to death said wood referring to another text do not steel your heart against him dear thames interposed winifred and thine eye shall not pity said her father in a tone of rebuke but life shall be for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot as these words were delivered by the carpenter with stern emphasis a female servant entered the room and stated that a gentleman was at the door who wished to speak with captain darell on business of urgent importance with me said thames who is it he didnt give his name sir replied the maid but hes a young gentleman dont go near him dear thames said winifred he may have some ill intention pshaw cried thames what refuse to see a person who desires to speak with me say i will come to him law miss observed the maid theres nothing mischievous in the persons appearance im sure hes as nice and civilspoken a gentleman as need be by the same token she added in an under tone that he gave me a span new crown piece the thief cometh in the night and the troop of robbers spoileth without said wood who had a text for every emergency lor ha mussy sirhow you do talk said the woman this is no robber im sure i should have known at a glance if it was hes more like a lord than as she spoke steps were heard approaching the door was thrown open and a young man marched boldly into the room the intruder was handsomely even richly attired in a scarlet ridingsuit embroidered with gold a broad belt to which a hanger was attached crossed his shoulders his boots rose above his knee and he carried a laced hat in his hand advancing to the middle of the chamber he halted drew himself up and fixed his dark expressive eyes on thames darrell his appearance excited the greatest astonishment and consternation amid the group winifred screamed thames sprang to his feet and half drew his sword while wood removing his spectacles to assure himself that his eyes did not deceive him exclaimed in a tone and with a look that betrayed the extremity of surprisejack sheppard jack sheppard echoed the maid is this jack sheppard oh la im undone we shall all have our throats cut oh oh and she rushed screaming into the passage where she fell down in a fit the occasion of all this confusion and dismay meanwhile remained perfectly motionless his figure erect and with somewhat of dignity in his demeanour he kept his keen eyes steadily fixed on thames as if awaiting to be addressed your audacity passes belief cried the latter as soon as his surprise would allow him utterance if you have contrived to break out of your confinement villain this is the last place where you ought to show yourself and therefore the first i would visit replied jack boldly but pardon my intrusion i was resolved to see you and fearing you might not come to me i forced my way hither even with certainty of discomposing your friends well villain replied thames i know not the motive of your visit but if you have come to surrender yourself to justice it is well you cannot depart hence cannot echoed jack a slight smile crossing his features but let that pass my motive in coming hither is to serve you and save your life if you choose to requite me by detaining me you are at liberty to do so i shall make no defence that i am not ignorant of the reward offered for my capture this will show he added taking a large placard headed murder from his pocket and throwing it on the floor my demeanour ought to convince you that i came with no hostile intention and to show you that i have no intention of flying i will myself close and lock the door there is the key are you now satisfied no interposed wood furiously i shall never be satisfied till i see you hanged on the highest gibbet at tyburn a time may come when you will be gratified mr wood replied jack calmly may comeit will comeit shall come cried the carpenter shaking his hand menacingly at him i have some difficulty in preventing myself from becoming your executioner oh that i should have nursed such a viper hear me sir said jack no i wont hear you murderer rejoined wood i am no murderer replied sheppard i had no thought of injuring your wife and would have died rather than commit so foul a crime think not to delude me audacious wretch cried the carpenter even if you are not a principal you are an accessory if you had not brought your companion here it would not have happened but you shall swing rascalyou shall swing my conscience acquits me of all share in the offence replied jack humbly but the past is irremediable and i did not come hither to exculpate myself i came to save your life he added turning to thames i was not aware it was in danger rejoined darrell then you ought to be thankful to me for the warning you are in danger from some of your associates from your uncle from my unclesir rowland trenchard what means this idle boasting villain said thames your uncle sir rowland it is no idle boasting replied the other you are cousin to the housebreaker jack sheppard if it were so he would have great reason to be proud of the relationship truly observed wood shrugging his shoulders it is easy to make an assertion like this said thames contemptuously and equally easy to prove it replied jack giving him the paper he had abstracted from wild read that thames hastily cast his eyes over it and transferred it with a look of incredulity to wood gracious heavens this is more wonderful than all the rest cried the carpenter rubbing his eyes thames this is no forgery you believe it father from the bottom of my heart i always thought mrs sheppard superior to her station so did i said winifred let me look at the paper poor soulpoor soul groaned wood brushing the tears from his vision well im glad shes spared this oh jack jack youve much to answer for i have indeed replied sheppard in a tone of contrition if this document is correct continued wood and i am persuaded it is soyou are as unfortunate as wicked see what your misconduct has deprived you ofsee what you might have been this is retribution i feel it replied jack in a tone of agony and i feel it more on my poor mothers account than my own she has suffered enough for you said wood she has she has said jack in a broken voice weep on reprobate cried the carpenter a little softened those tears will do you good do not distress him dear father said winifred he suffers deeply oh jack repent while it is yet time of your evil conduct i will pray for you i cannot repenti cannot pray replied jack recovering his hardened demeanour i should never have been what i am but for you how so inquired winifred i loved you replied jackdont startit is over nowi loved you i say as a boy hopelessly and it made me desperate and now i find when it is too late that i might have deserved youthat i am as well born as thames darrell but i mustnt think of these things or i shall grow mad i have said your life is in danger thames do not slight my warning sir rowland trenchard is aware of your return to england i saw him last night at jonathan wilds after my escape from the new prison he had just arrived from manchester whence he had been summoned by that treacherous thieftaker i overheard them planning your assassination it is to take place tonight o heavens screamed winifred while her father lifted up his hands in silent horror and when i further tell you continued jack that after yourself and my mother i am the next heir to the estates of my grandfather sir montacute trenchard you will perhaps own that my caution is sufficiently disinterested could i credit your wild story i might do so returned thames with a look of perplexity here are jonathan wilds written instructions to quilt arnold rejoined sheppard producing the pocketbook he had found in the janizarys clothes this letter will vouch for me that a communication has taken place between your enemies thames glanced at the despatch and after a moments reflection inquired in what way is the attempt upon my life to be made that i couldnt ascertain replied jack but i advise you to be upon your guard for aught i know they may be in the neighbourhood at this moment here ejaculated wood with a look of alarm oh lord i hope not this i do know continued jackjonathan wild superintends the attack jonathan wild repeated the carpenter trembling then its all over with us oh dearhow sorry i am i ever left wych street we may be all murdered in this unprotected place and nobody be the wiser theres some one in the garden at this moment cried jack i saw a face at the window wherewhere cried thames dont stir replied jack i will at once convince you of the truth of my assertions and ascertain whether the enemy really is at hand so saying he advanced towards the window threw open the sash and called out in the voice of thames darrell whos there he was answered by a shot from a pistol the ball passed over his head and lodged in the ceiling i was right replied jack returning as coolly as if nothing had happened it is jonathan your uncleour uncle is with him i saw them both may i trust you cried thames eagerly you may replied jack ill fight for you to the last gasp follow me then cried thames drawing his sword and springing through the window to the worlds end answered jack darting after him thamesthames cried winifred rushing to the window he will be murderedhelp my childmy love cried wood dragging her forcibly back two shots were fired and presently the clashing of swords was heard below after some time the scuffle grew more and more distant until nothing could be heard wood meanwhile had summoned his menservants and having armed them with such weapons as could be found they proceeded to the garden where the first object they encountered was thames darrell extended on the ground and weltering in his blood of jack sheppard or the assailants they could not discover a single trace as the body was borne to the house in the arms of the farmingmen mr wood fancied he heard the exulting laugh of jonathan wild chapter viii old bedlam when thames darrell and jack sheppard sprang through the window they were instantly assailed by wild trenchard and their attendants jack attacked jonathan with such fury that he drove him into a shrubbery and might perhaps have come off the victor if his foot had not slipped as he made a desperate lunge in this state it would have been all over with him as being stunned by the fall it was some moments before he could recover himself if another party had not unexpectedly come to his rescue this was blueskin who burst through the trees and sword in hand assaulted the thieftaker as soon as jack gained his legs he perceived blueskin lying as he thought dead in the plantation with a severe cut across his temples and while he was stooping to assist him he heard groans at a little distance hastening in the direction of the sound he discovered thames darrell stretched upon the ground are you hurt thames asked jack anxiously not dangerously i hope returned thames but flysave yourself where are the assassins cried sheppard gone replied the wounded man they imagine their work is done but i may yet live to thwart them i will carry you to the house or fetch mr wood urged jack no no rejoined thames flyor i will not answer for your safety if you desire to please me you will go and leave you thus rejoined jack i cannot do it go i insist cried thames or take the consequences upon yourself i cannot protect you thus urged jack reluctantly departed hastening to the spot where he had tied his horse to a tree he vaulted into the saddle and rode off across the fieldsfor he was fearful of encountering the hostile partytill he reached the edgeware road arrived at paddington he struck across marylebone fieldsfor as yet the new road was undreamed ofand never moderated his speed until he reached the city his destination was the new mint at this place of refuge situated in the heart of wapping near the riverside he arrived in less than an hour in a complete state of exhaustion in consequence of the infamous abuse of its liberties an act for the entire suppression of the old mint was passed in the ninth year of the reign of george the first not many months before the date of the present epoch of this history and as after the destruction of whitefriars which took place in the reign of charles the second owing to the protection afforded by its inmates to the levellers and fifthmonarchymen when the inhabitants of alsatia crossed the water and settled themselves in the borough of southwarkso now driven out of their fastnesses they again migrated and recrossing the thames settled in wapping in a miserable quarter between artichoke lane and nightingale lane which they termed the new mint ousted from his old retreat the cross shovels baptist kettleby opened another tavern conducted upon the same plan as the former which he denominated the seven cities of refuge his subjects however were no longer entirely under his control and though he managed to enforce some little attention to his commands it was evident his authority was waning fast aware that they would not be allowed to remain long unmolested the new minters conducted themselves so outrageously and with such extraordinary insolence that measures were at this time being taken for their effectual suppression to the seven cities of refuge jack proceeded having disposed of his steed and swallowed a glass of brandy without taking any other refreshment he threw himself on a couch where he sank at once into a heavy slumber when he awoke it was late in the day and he was surprised to find blueskin seated by his bedside watching over him with a drawn sword on his knee a pistol in each hand and a bloodstained cloth bound across his brow dont disturb yourself said his follower motioning him to keep still its all right what time is it inquired jack past noon replied blueskin i didnt awake you because you seemed tired how did you escape asked sheppard who as he shook off his slumber began to recall the events of the previous night oh easily enough rejoined the other i suppose i must have been senseless for some time for on coming to myself i found this gash in my head and the ground covered with blood however no one had discovered me so i contrived to drag myself to my horse i thought if you were living and not captured i should find you hereand i was right i kept watch over you for fear of a surprise on the part of jonathan but whats to be done the first thing i do replied jack will be to visit my poor mother in bedlam youd better take care of your mothers son instead rejoined blueskin its runnin a great risk risk or no risk i shall go replied jack jonathan has threatened to do her some mischief i am resolved to see her without delay and ascertain if its possible to remove her its a hopeless job grumbled blueskin and harm will come of it what are you to do with a mad mother at a time when you need all your wits to take care of yourself dont concern yourself further about me returned jack once for all i shall go wont you take me no you must await my return here then i must wait a long time grumbled blueskin youll never return we shall see replied jack but if i should not return take this purse to edgeworth bess youll find her at black marys hole and having partaken of a hasty breakfast he set out taking his way along east smithfield mounting little towerhill and threading the minories and hounsditch he arrived without accident or molestation at moorfields old bethlehem or bedlamevery trace of which has been swept away and the hospital for lunatics removed to saint georges fieldwas a vast and magnificent structure erected in moorfields in upon the model of the tuileries it is said that louis the fourteenth was so incensed at the insult offered to his palace that he had a counterpart of st jamess built for offices of the meanest description the size and grandeur of the edifice indeed drew down the ridicule of several of the wits of the age by one of whomthe facetious tom brownit was said bedlam is a pleasant place and abounds with amusementsthe first of which is the building so stately a fabric for persons wholly insensible of the beauty and use of it the outside being a perfect mockery of the inside and admitting of two amusing querieswhether the persons that ordered the building of it or those that inhabit it were the maddest and whether the name and thing be not as disagreeable as harp and harrow by anotherthe no less facetious ned wardit was termed a costly college for a crackbrained society raised in a mad age when the chiefs of the city were in a great danger of losing their senses and so contrived it the more noble for their own reception or they would never have flung away so much money to so foolish a purpose the cost of the building exceeded seventeen thousand pounds however the taste of the architecture may be questioned which was the formal french style of the period the general effect was imposing including the wings it presented a frontage of five hundred and forty feet each wing had a small cupola and in the centre of the pile rose a larger dome surmounted by a gilded ball and vane the asylum was approached by a broad gravel walk leading through a garden edged on either side by a stone balustrade and shaded by tufted trees a wide terrace then led to large iron gates over which were placed the two celebrated figures of raving and melancholy madness executed by the elder cibber and commemorated by pope in the dunciad in the wellknown lines close to those walls where folly holds her throne and laughs to think monroe would take her down where oer the gates by his famed fathers hand great cibbers brazen brainless brothers stand internally it was divided by two long galleries one over the other these galleries were separated in the middle by iron grates the wards on the right were occupied by male patients on the left by the female in the centre of the upper gallery was a spacious saloon appropriated to the governors of the asylum but the besetting evil of the place and that which drew down the severest censures of the writers abovementioned was that this spotwhich of all others should have been most free from such intrusionwas made a public exhibition there all the loose characters thronged assignations were openly made and the spectators diverted themselves with the vagaries of its miserable inhabitants entering the outer gate and traversing the broad gravel walk beforementioned jack ascended the steps and was admitted on feeing the porter by another iron gate into the hospital here he was almost stunned by the deafening clamour resounding on all sides some of the lunatics were rattling their chains some shrieking some singing some beating with frantic violence against the doors altogether it was the most dreadful noise he had ever heard amidst it all however there were several lighthearted and laughing groups walking from cell to cell to whom all this misery appeared matter of amusement the doors of several of the wards were thrown open for these parties and as jack passed he could not help glancing at the wretched inmates here was a poor halfnaked creature with a straw crown on his head and a wooden sceptre in his hand seated on the ground with all the dignity of a monarch on his throne there was a mad musician seemingly rapt in admiration of the notes he was extracting from a childs violin here was a terrific figure gnashing his teeth and howling like a wild beastthere a lover with hands clasped together and eyes turned passionately upward in this cell was a huntsman who had fractured his skull while hunting and was perpetually hallooing after the houndsin that the most melancholy of all the grinning gibbering lunatic the realization of moody madness laughing wild hastening from this heartrending spectacle jack soon reached the grating that divided the mens compartment from that appropriated to the women inquiring for mrs sheppard a matron offered to conduct him to her cell youll find her quiet enough today sir observed the woman as they walked along but she has been very outrageous latterly her nurse says she may live some time but she seems to me to be sinking fast heaven help her sighed jack i hope not her release would be a mercy pursued the matron oh sir if youd seen her as ive seen her youd not wish her a continuance of misery as jack made no reply the woman proceeded they say her sons taken at last and is to be hanged im glad of it im sure for its all owing to him his poor mothers here see what crime does sir those who act wickedly bring misery on all connected with them and so gentle as the poor creature is when shes not in her wild fitsit would melt a heart of stone to see her she will cry for days and nights together if jack sheppard could behold his mother in this state hed have a lesson hed never forgetay and a severer one than even the hangman could read him hardened as he may be that would touch him but he has never been near hernever rambling in this way the matron at length came to a halt and taking out a key pointed to a door and said this is mrs sheppards ward sir leave us together my good woman said jack putting a guinea into her hand as long as you please sir answered the matron dropping a curtsey there sir she added unlocking the door you can go in dont be frightened of her shes not mischievousand besides shes chained and cant reach you so saying she retired and jack entered the cell prepared as he was for a dreadful shock and with his nerves strung to endure it jack absolutely recoiled before the appalling object that met his gaze cowering in a corner upon a heap of straw sat his unfortunate mother the complete wreck of what she had been her eyes glistened in the darknessfor light was only admitted through a small grated windowlike flames and as she fixed them on him their glances seemed to penetrate his very soul a piece of old blanket was fastened across her shoulders and she had no other clothing except a petticoat her arms and feet were uncovered and of almost skeleton thinness her features were meagre and ghastly white and had the fixed and horrible stamp of insanity her head had been shaved and around it was swathed a piece of rag in which a few straws were stuck her thin fingers were armed with nails as long as the talons of a bird a chain riveted to an iron belt encircling her waist bound her to the wall the cell in which she was confined was about six feet long and four wide the walls were scored all over with fantastic designs snatches of poetry short sentences and namesthe work of its former occupants and of its present inmate when jack entered the cell she was talking to herself in the muttering unconnected way peculiar to her distracted condition but after her eye had rested on him some time the fixed expression of her features relaxed and a smile crossed them this smile was more harrowing even than her former rigid look you are an angel she cried with a look beaming with delight rather a devil groaned her son to have done this you are an angel i say continued the poor maniac and my jack would have been like you if he had lived but he died when he was a childlong agolong agolong ago would he had done so cried jack old van told me if he grew up he would be hanged he showed me a black mark under his ear where the noose would be tied and so ill tell you what i did and she burst into a laugh that froze jacks blood in his veins what did you do he asked in a broken voice i strangled himha ha hastrangled him while he was at my breastha haand then with a sudden and fearful change of look she added thats what has driven me mad i killed my child to save him from the gallowsoh oh one man hanged in a family is enough if id not gone mad they would have hanged me poor soul ejaculated her son ill tell you a dream i had last night continued the unfortunate being i was at tyburn there was a gallows erected and a great mob round itthousands of people and all with white faces like corpses in the midst of them there was a cart with a man in itand that man was jackmy son jackthey were going to hang him and opposite to him with a book in his handbut it couldnt be a prayerbooksat jonathan wild in a parsons cassock and band i knew him in spite of his dress and when they came to the gallows jack leaped out of the cart and the hangman tied up jonathan insteadha ha how the mob shouted and huzzaedand i shouted tooha ha ha mother cried jack unable to endure this agonizing scene longer dont you know me mother ah shrieked mrs sheppard whats thatjacks voice it is replied her son the ceiling is breaking the floor is opening he is coming to me cried the unhappy woman he stands before you rejoined her son where she cried i cant see him where is he here answered jack are you his ghost then nono answered jack i am your most unhappy son let me touch you then let me feel if you are really flesh and blood cried the poor maniac creeping towards him on all fours jack did not advance to meet her he could not move but stood like one stupified with his hands clasped together and eyes almost starting out of their sockets fixed upon his unfortunate parent come to me cried the poor maniac who had crawled as far as the chain would permit hercome to me she cried extending her thin arm towards him jack fell on his knees beside her who are you inquired mrs sheppard passing her hands over his face and gazing at him with a look that made him shudder your son replied jackyour miserable repentant son it is false cried mrs sheppard you are not jack was not half your age when he died they buried him in willesden churchyard after the robbery oh god cried jack she does not know me motherdear mother he added clasping her in his arms look at me again off she exclaimed breaking from his embrace with a scream dont touch me ill be quiet ill not speak of jack or jonathan i wont dig their graves with my nails dont strip me quite leave me my blanket im very cold at night or if you must take off my clothes dont dash cold water on my head it throbs cruelly horror cried jack dont scourge me she cried trying to hide herself in the farthest corner of the cell the lash cuts to the bone i cant bear it spare me and ill be quietquietquiet mother said jack advancing towards her off she cried with a prolonged and piercing shriek and she buried herself beneath the straw which she tossed above her head with the wildest gestures i shall kill her if i stay longer muttered her son completely terrified while he was considering what would be best to do the poor maniac over whose bewildered brain another change had come raised her head from under the straw and peeping round the room asked in a low voice if they were gone who inquired jack the nurses she answered do they treat you ill asked her son hush she said putting her lean fingers to her lips hushcome hither and ill tell you jack approached her sit beside me continued mrs sheppard and now ill tell you what they do stop we must shut the door or theyll catch us see she added tearing the rag from her headi had beautiful black hair once but they cut it all off i shall go mad myself if i listen to her longer said jack attempting to rise i must go dont stir or theyll chain you to the wall said his mother detaining him now tell me why they brought you here i came to see you dear mother answered jack mother she echoedmother why do you call me by that name because you are my mother what she exclaimed staring eagerly in his face are you my son are you jack i am replied jack heaven be praised she knows me at last oh jack cried his mother falling upon his neck and covering him with kisses motherdear mother said jack bursting into tears you will never leave me sobbed the poor woman straining him to her breast nevernever the words were scarcely pronounced when the door was violently thrown open and two men appeared at it they were jonathan wild and quilt arnold ah exclaimed jack starting to his feet just in time said the thieftaker you are my prisoner jack you shall take my life first rejoined sheppard and as he was about to put himself into a posture of defence his mother clasped him in her arms they shall not harm you my love she exclaimed the movement was fatal to her son taking advantage of his embarrassed position jonathan and his assistant rushed upon him and disarmed him thank you mrs sheppard cried the thieftaker as he slipped a pair of handcuffs over jacks wrists for the help you have given us in capturing your son without you we might have had some trouble aware apparently in some degree of the mistake she had committed the poor maniac sprang towards him with frantic violence and planted her long nails in his cheek keep off you accursed jade roared jonathan off i say or and he struck her a violent blow with his clenched hand the miserable woman staggered uttered a deep groan and fell senseless on the straw devil cried jack that blow shall cost you your life itll not need to be repeated at all events rejoined jonathan looking with a smile of malignant satisfaction at the body and nowto newgate chapter ix old newgate at the beginning of the twelfth centurywhether in the reign of henry the first or stephen is uncertaina fifth gate was added to the four principal entrances of the city of london then it is almost needless to say surrounded by ramparts moats and other defences this gate called newgate as being latelier builded than the rest continued for upwards of three hundred years to be used as a place of imprisonment for felons and trespassers at the end of which time having grown old ruinous and horribly loathsome it was rebuilt and enlarged by the executors of the renowned sir richard whittington the lord mayor of london whence it afterwards obtained amongst a certain class of students whose examinations were conducted with some strictness at the old bailey and their highest degrees taken at hydeparkcorner the appellation of whittingtons college or more briefly the whit it may here be mentioned that this gate destined to bequeath its namea name which has since acquired a terrible significanceto every successive structure erected upon its site was granted in by charter by henry the sixth to the citizens of london in return for their royal services and thenceforth became the common jail to that city and the county of middlesex nothing material occurred to newgate until the memorable year when it was utterly destroyed by the great fire it is with the building raised after this direful calamity that our history has to deal though by no means so extensive or commodious as the modern prison old newgate was a large and stronglybuilt pile the body of the edifice stood on the south side of newgate street and projected at the western extremity far into the area opposite saint sepulchres church one small wing lay at the north of the gate where giltspur street compter now stands and the press yard which was detached from the main building was situated at the back of phoenix court the south or principal front looking down the old bailey and not upon it as is the case of the present structure with its massive walls of roughened freestonein some places darkened by the smoke in others blanched by exposure to the weatherits heavy projecting cornice its unglazed doublygrated windows its gloomy porch decorated with fetters and defended by an enormous iron door had a stern and striking effect over the lodge upon a dial was inscribed the appropriate motto venio sicut fur the gate which crossed newgate street had a wide arch for carriages and a postern on the north side for footpassengers its architecture was richly ornamental and resembled the style of a triumphal entrance to a capital rather than a dungeon having battlements and hexagonal towers and being adorned on the western side with a triple range of pilasters of the tuscan order amid the intercolumniations of which were niches embellished with statues the chief of these was a figure of liberty with a cat at her feet in allusion to the supposed origin of the fortunes of its former founder sir richard whittington on the right of the postern against the wall was affixed a small grating sustaining the debtors box and any pleasure which the passerby might derive from contemplating the splendid structure above described was damped at beholding the pale faces and squalid figures of the captives across the bars of its stronglygrated windows some years after the date of this history an immense ventilator was placed at the top of the gate with the view of purifying the prison which owing to its insufficient space and constantlycrowded state was never free from that dreadful and contagious disorder now happily unknown the jailfever so frightful indeed were the ravages of this malady to which debtors and felons were alike exposed that its miserable victims were frequently carried out by cartloads and thrown into a pit in the burialground of christchurch without ceremony old newgate was divided into three separate prisonsthe masters side the common side and the press yard the first of these situated a the south of the building with the exception of one ward over the gateway was allotted to the better class of debtors whose funds enabled them to defray their chamberrent fees and garnish the second comprising the bulk of the jail and by many degrees worse in point of accommodation having several dismal and noisome wards under ground was common both to debtors and malefactorsan association little favourable to the morals or comforts of the former who if they were brought there with any notions of honesty seldom left with untainted principles the lastin all respects the best and airiest of the three standing as has been before observed in phoenix court at the rear of the main fabricwas reserved for stateoffenders and such persons as chose to submit to the extortionate demands of the keeper from twenty to five hundred pounds premium according to the rank and means of the applicant in addition to a high weekly rent being required for accommodation in this quarter some excuse for this rapacity may perhaps be found in the fact that five thousand pounds was paid for the purchase of the press yard by mr pitt the then governor of newgate this gentleman tried for high treason in on suspicion of aiding mr forster the rebel generals escape but acquitted reaped a golden harvest during the occupation of his premises by the preston rebels when a larger sum was obtained for a single chamber than in the words of a sufferer on the occasion would have paid the rent of the best house in saint jamess square or piccadilly for several years nor was this all other and more serious impositions inasmuch as they affected a poorer class of persons were practised by the underlings of the jail on his first entrance a prisoner if unable or unwilling to comply with the exactions of the turnkeys was thrust into the condemned hold with the worst description of criminals and terrified by threats into submission by the old regulations the free use of strong liquors not being interdicted a taphouse was kept in the lodge and also in a cellar on the common sideunder the superintendence of mrs spurling formerly it may be remembered the hostess of the dark house at queenhithewhence wine ale and brandy of inferior quality were dispensed in false measures and at high prices throughout the prison which in noise and debauchery rivalled if it did not surpass the lowest tavern the chief scene of these disgusting orgiesthe cellar just referred towas a large lowroofed vault about four feet below the level of the street perfectly dark unless when illumined by a roaring fire and candles stuck in pyramidal lumps of clay with a range of butts and barrels at one end and benches and tables at the other where the prisoners debtors and malefactors male and female assembled as long as their money lasted and consumed the time in drinking smoking and gaming with cards and dice above was a spacious hall connected with it by a flight of stone steps at the further end of which stood an immense grated door called in the slang of the place the jigger through the bars of which the felons in the upper wards were allowed to converse with their friends or if they wished to enter the room or join the revellers below they were at liberty to do so on payment of a small fine thus the same system of plunder was everywhere carried on the jailers robbed the prisoners the prisoners robbed one another two large wards were situated in the gate one of which the stone ward appropriated to the master debtors looked towards holborn the other called the stone hall from a huge stone standing in the middle of it upon which the irons of criminals under sentence of death were knocked off previously to their being taken to the place of execution faced newgate street here the prisoners took exercise and a quaint but striking picture has been left of their appearance when so engaged by the author of the english rogue at my first being acquainted with the place says this writer in the miseries of a prison the prisoners methought walking up and down the stone hall looked like so many wrecks upon the sea here the ribs of a thousand pounds beating against the needlesthose dangerous rocks credulity here floated to and fro silks stuffs camlets and velvet without giving place to each other according to their dignity here rolled so many pipes of canary whose bungholes lying open were so damaged that the merchant may go hoop for his money a less picturesque but more truthful and therefore more melancholy description of the same scene is furnished by the shrewd and satirical ned ward who informs us in the delectable history of whittingtons college that when the prisoners are disposed to recreate themselves with walking they go up into a spacious room called the stone hall where when you see them taking a turn together it would puzzle one to know which is the gentleman which the mechanic and which the beggar for they are all suited in the same garb of squalid poverty making a spectacle of more pity than executions only to be out at the elbows is in fashion here and a great indecorum not to be threadbare in an angle of the stone hall was the iron hold a chamber containing a vast assortment of fetters and handcuffs of all weights and sizes four prisoners termed the partners had charge of this hold their duty was to see who came in or went out to lock up and open the different wards to fetter such prisoners as were ordered to be placed in irons to distribute the allowances of provision and to maintain some show of decorum for which latter purpose they were allowed to carry whips and truncheons when any violent outrage was committedand such matters were of daily sometimes hourly occurrencea bell the rope of which descended into the hall brought the whole of the turnkeys to their assistance a narrow passage at the north of the stone hall led to the bluebeards room of this enchanted castle a place shunned even by the reckless crew who were compelled to pass it it was a sort of cookingroom with an immense fireplace flanked by a couple of cauldrons and was called jack ketchs kitchen because the quarters of persons executed for treason were there boiled by the hangman in oil pitch and tar before they were affixed on the city gates or on london bridge above this revolting spot was the female debtors ward below it a gloomy cell called tangier and lower still the stone hold a most terrible and noisome dungeon situated underground and unvisited by a single ray of daylight built and paved with stone without beds or any other sort of protection from the cold this dreadful hole accounted the most dark and dismal in the prison was made the receptacle of such miserable wretches as could not pay the customary fees adjoining it was the lower wardthough in what degree of latitude it was situated observes ned ward i cannot positively demonstrate unless it lay ninety degrees beyond the north pole for instead of being dark there but half a year it is dark all the year round it was only a shade better than the stone hold here were imprisoned the fines and perhaps adds the beforecited authority if he behaved himself an outlawed person might creep in among them ascending the gate once more on the way back we find over the stone hall another large room called debtors hall facing newgate street with very good air and light a little too much of the former perhaps as the windows being unglazed the prisoners were subjected to severe annoyance from the weather and easterly winds of the women felons rooms nothing has yet been said there were two one called watermans hall a horrible place adjoining the postern under the gate whence through a small barred aperture they solicited alms from the passengers the other a large chamber denominated my ladys hold was situated in the highest part of the jail at the northern extremity neither of these wards had beds and the unfortunate inmates were obliged to take their rest on the oaken floor the condition of the rooms was indescribably filthy and disgusting nor were the habits of the occupants much more cleanly in other respects they were equally indecorous and offensive it is with no small concern writes an anonymous historian of newgate that i am obliged to observe that the women in every ward of this prison are exceedingly worse than the worst of the men not only in respect to their mode of living but more especially as to their conversation which to their great shame is as profane and wicked as hell itself can possibly be there were two condemned holdsone for each sex that for the men lay near the lodge with which it was connected by a dark passage it was a large room about twenty feet long and fifteen broad and had an arched stone roof in fact it had been anciently the right hand postern under the gate leading towards the city the floor was planked with oak and covered with iron staples hooks and ringbolts with heavy chains attached to them there was only one small grated window in this hold which admitted but little light over the gateway towards snow hill were two strong wards called the castle and the red room they will claim particular attention hereafter many other wardsespecially on the master debtors sidehave been necessarily omitted in the foregoing hasty enumeration but there were two places of punishment which merit some notice from their peculiarity the first of these the press room a dark close chamber near watermans hall obtained its name from an immense wooden machine kept in it with which such prisoners as refused to plead to their indictments were pressed to deatha species of inquisitorial torture not discontinued until so lately as the early part of the reign of george the third when it was abolished by an express statute into the second denominated the bilbowesalso a dismal placerefractory prisoners were thrust and placed in a kind of stocks whence the name the chapel was situated in the southeast angle of the jail the ordinary at the time of this history being the reverend thomas purney the deputy chaplain mr wagstaff much has been advanced by modern writers respecting the demoralising effect of prison society and it has been asserted that a youth once confined in newgate is certain to come out a confirmed thief however this may be now it was unquestionably true of old newgate it was the grand nursery of vicea famous university observes ned ward in the london spy where if a man has a mind to educate a hopeful child in the daring science of padding the lightfingered subtlety of shoplifting the excellent use of jack and crow for the silently drawing bolts and forcing barricades with the knack of sweetening or the most ingenious dexterity of picking pockets let him but enter in this college on the common side and confine him close to his study but for three months and if he does not come out qualified to take any degree of villainy he must be the most honest dunce that ever had the advantage of such eminent tutors to bring down this imperfect sketch of newgate to the present time it may be mentioned that being found inadequate to the purpose required the old jail was pulled down in just at the completion of the new jail in it was assailed by the mob during the gordon riots fired and greatly damaged the devastations however were speedily made good and in two years more it was finished it is a cheering reflection that in the present prison with its clean wellwhitewashed and wellventilated wards its airy courts its infirmary its improved regulations and its humane and intelligent officers many of the miseries of the old jail are removed for these beneficial changes society is mainly indebted to the unremitting exertions of the philanthropic howard chapter x how jack sheppard got out of the condemned hold monday the st of august a day long afterwards remembered by the officers of newgatewas distinguished by an unusual influx of visitors to the lodge on that morning the death warrant had arrived from windsor ordering sheppard for execution since his capture by jonathan wild in bedlam as related in a former chapter jack had been tried convicted and sentenced to death together with three other malefactors on the following friday up to this moment hopes had been entertained of a respite strong representations in his favour having been made in the highest quarter but now that his fate seemed sealed the curiosity of the sightseeing public to behold him was redoubled the prison gates were besieged like the entrance of a booth at a fair and the condemned hold where he was confined and to which visitors were admitted at the moderate rate of a guinea ahead had quite the appearance of a showroom as the day wore on the crowds diminishedmany who would not submit to the turnkeys demands were sent away ungratifiedand at five oclock only two strangers mr shotbolt the head turnkey of clerkenwell prison and mr griffin who held the same office in westminster gatehouse were left in the lodge jack who had formerly been in the custody of both these gentlemen gave them a very cordial welcome apologized for the sorry room he was compelled to receive them in and when they took leave insisted on treating them to a double bowl of punch which they were now discussing with the upper jailer mr ireton and his two satellites austin and langley at a little distance from the party sat a tall sinisterlooking personage with harsh inflexible features a gaunt but muscular frame and large bony hands he was sipping a glass of cold gin and water and smoking a short black pipe his name was marvel and his avocation which was as repulsive as his looks was that of public executioner by his side sat a remarkably stout dame to whom he paid as much attention as it was in his iron nature to pay she had a nutbrown skin a swarthy upper lip a merry black eye a prominent bust and a tunlike circumference of waist a widow for the fourth time mrs spurling for she it was either by her attractions of purse or person had succeeded in moving the stony heart of mr marvel who as he had helped to deprive her of her former husbands thought himself in duty bound to offer to supply their place but the lady was not so easily won and though she did not absolutely reject him gave him very slight hopes mr marvel therefore remained on his probation behind mrs spurling stood her negro attendant caliban a hideous misshapen malicious monster with broad hunched shoulders a flat nose and ears like those of a wild beast a head too large for his body and a body too long for his legs this horrible piece of deformity who acted as drawer and cellarman and was a constant butt to the small wits of the jail was nicknamed the black dog of newgate in the general survey of the prison taken in the preceding chapter but little was said of the lodge it may be well therefore before proceeding farther to describe it more minutely it was approached from the street by a flight of broad stone steps leading to a ponderous door plated with iron and secured on the inner side by huge bolts and a lock with wards of a prodigious size a little within stood a second door or rather wicket lower than the first but of equal strength and surmounted by a row of sharp spikes as no apprehension was entertained of an escape by this outletnothing of the kind having been attempted by the boldest felon ever incarcerated in newgateboth doors were generally left open during the daytime at six oclock the wicket was shut and at nine the jail was altogether locked up not far from the entrance on the left was a sort of screen or partitionwall reaching from the floor to the ceiling formed of thick oaken planks riveted together by iron bolts and studded with broadheaded nails in this screen which masked the entrance of a dark passage communicating with the condemned hold about five feet from the ground was a hatch protected by long spikes set six inches apart and each of the thickness of an elephants tusk the spikes almost touched the upper part of the hatch scarcely space enough for the passage of a hand being left between their points and the beam here as has already been observed condemned malefactors were allowed to converse with such of their guests as had not interest or money enough to procure admission to them in the hold beyond the hatch an angle formed by a projection in the wall of some three or four feet served to hide a door conducting to the interior of the prison at the farther end of the lodge the floor was raised to the height of a couple of steps whence the whole place with the exception of the remotest corner of the angle beforementioned could be commanded at a single glance on this elevation a table was now placed around which sat the turnkeys and their guests regaling themselves on the fragrant beverage provided by the prisoner a brief description will suffice for them they were all stout illfavoured men attired in the regular jaillivery of scratch wig and snuffcoloured suit and had all a strong family likeness to each other the only difference between the officers of newgate and their brethren was that they had enormous bunches of keys at their girdles while the latter had left their keys at home well ive seen many a gallant fellow in my time mr ireton observed the chief turnkey of westminster gatehouse as he helped himself to his third glass of punch but i never saw one like jack sheppard nor i returned ireton following his example and ive had some experience too ever since he came here three months ago he has been the life and soul of the place and now the death warrant has arrived instead of being cast down as most men would be and as all others are hes gayer than ever well i shall be sorry to lose him mr griffin weve made a pretty penny by himsixty guineas this blessed day no more cried griffin incredulously i should have thought you must have made double that sum at least not a farthing more i assure you rejoined ireton pettishly were all on the square here i took the money myself and ought to know oh certainly answered griffin certainly i offered jack five guineas as his share continued ireton but he wouldnt take it himself and gave it to the poor debtors and felons who are now drinking it out in the cellar on the common side jacks a noble fellow exclaimed the headjailer of clerkenwell prison raising his glass and though he played me a scurvy trick ill drink to his speedy deliverance at tyburn eh mr shotbolt rejoined the executioner ill pledge you in that toast with all my heart well for my part observed mrs spurling i hope he may never see tyburn and if id my own way with the secretary of state he never should its a thousand pities to hang so pretty a fellow there havent been so many ladies in the lodge since the days of claude du val the gentleman highwayman and they all declare itll break their hearts if hes scragged bah ejaculated marvel gruffly you think our sex has no feeling i suppose sir cried mrs spurling indignantly but i can tell you we have and whats more i tell you if captain sheppard is hanged you need never hope to call me mrs marvel zounds cried the executioner in astonishment do you know what you are talking about mrs spurling why if captain sheppard should get off it ud be fifty guineas out of my way theres the grand laced coat he wore at his trial which i intend for my weddingdress dont mention such a thing sir interrupted the tapstress i couldnt bear to see you in it your speaking of the trial brings the whole scene to my mind ah i shall never forget the figure jack cut on that occasion what a buzz of admiration ran round the court as he appeared and how handsome and composed he looked everybody wondered that such a stripling could commit such desperate robberies his firmness never deserted him till his old master mr wood was examined then he did give way a bit and when mr woods daughterto whom ive heard tell he was attached years agowas brought up his courage forsook him altogether and he trembled and could scarcely stand poor young lady she trembled too and was unable to give her evidence when sentence was passed there wasnt a dry eye in the court yes there was one observed ireton i guess who you mean rejoined shotbolt mr wilds right answered ireton its strange the antipathy he bears to sheppard i was standing near jack at that awful moment and beheld the look wild fixed on him it was like the grin of a fiend and made my flesh creep on my bones when the prisoner was removed from the dock we met jonathan as we passed through the yard he stopped us and addressing jack in a taunting tone said well ive been as good as my wordtrue replied sheppard and ill be as good as mine and so they parted and i hope he will if its anything to jonathans disadvantage muttered mrs spurling half aside im surprised mr wild hasnt been to inquire after him today observed langley its the first time hes missed doing so since the trial hes gone to enfield after blueskin who has so long eluded his vigilance rejoined austin quilt arnold called this morning to say so certain information it seems has been received from a female that blueskin would be at a flashken near the chase at five oclock today and theyre all set out in the expectation of nabbing him mr wild had a narrow escape lately in that affair of captain darrell observed shotbolt i dont exactly know the rights of that affair rejoined griffin with some curiosity nor any one else i suspect answered ireton winking significantly its a mysterious transaction altogether but as much as is known is this captain darrell who resides with mr wood at dollis hill was assaulted and halfkilled by a party of ruffians headed he swore by mr wild and his uncle sir rowland trenchard mr wild however proved on the evidence of his own servants that he was at the old bailey at the time and sir rowland proved that he was in manchester so the charge was dismissed another charge was then brought against them by the captain who accused them of kidnapping him when a boy and placing him in the hands of a dutch skipper named van galgebrok with instructions to throw him overboard which was done though he afterwards escaped but this accusation for want of sufficient evidence met with the same fate as the first and jonathan came off victorious it was thought however if the skipper could have been found that the result of the case would have been materially different this was rather too much to expect for we all know if mr wild wishes to keep a man out of the way hell speedily find the means to do so ay ay cried the jailers laughing i could have given awkward evidence in that case if id been so inclined said mrs spurling ay and found van galgebrok too but i never betray an old customer mr wild is a great man said the hangman replenishing his pipe and we owe him much and ought to support him were any thing to happen to him newgate wouldnt be what it is nor tyburn either mr wild has given you some employment mr marvel remarked shotbolt a little sir replied the executioner with a grim smile out of the twelve hundred subjects ive tucked up i may safely place half to his account if ever he requires my services he shall find im not ungrateful and though i say it that shouldnt say it no man can tie a better knot mr wild gentlemen and the nubbin cheat fill your glasses gentlemen observed ireton and ill tell you a droll thing jack said this morning amongst others who came to see him was a mr kneebone a woollendraper in wych street with whose pockets it appears jack when a lad made a little too free as this gentleman was going away he said to jack in a jesting manner that he should be glad to see him tonight at supper upon which the other answered that he accepted his invitation with pleasure and would make a point of waiting upon him ha ha ha did he say so cried shotbolt then i advise you to look sharply after him mr ireton for may i be hanged myself if i dont believe hell be as good as his word at this juncture two women very smartly attired in silk hoods and cloaks appeared at the door of the lodge ah who have we here exclaimed griffin only jacks two wivesedgeworth bess and poll maggot replied austin laughing they cant go into the condemned hold said ireton consequentially its against mr wilds orders they must see the prisoner at the hatch very well sir replied austin rising and walking towards them well my pretty dears he added to see your husband eh you must make the most of your time you wont have him long youve heard the news i suppose that the death warrants arrived returned edgeworth bess bursting into a flood of tears oh yes weve heard it how does jack bear it inquired mrs maggot like a hero answered austin i knew he would replied the amazon come bessno whimpering dont unman him are we to see him here yes my love well then lose no time in bringing him to us said mrs maggot theres a guinea to drink our health she added slipping a piece of money into his hand here caliban shouted the underturnkey unlock captain sheppards padlock and tell him his wives are in the lodge waiting to see him iss massa austin replied the black and taking the keys he departed on the errand as soon as he was gone the two women divested themselves of their hoods and cloaks and threw them as if inadvertently into the farthest part of the angle in the wall their beautifully proportioned figures and rather overdisplayed shoulders attracted the notice of austin who inquired of the chief turnkey whether he should stand by them during the interview oh never mind them said mrs spurling who had been hastily compounding another bowl of punch sit down and enjoy yourself ill keep a look out that nothing happens by this time caliban had returned and jack appeared at the hatch he was wrapped in a loose dressinggown of light material and stood near the corner where the womens dresses had just been thrown down quite out of sight of all the party except mrs spurling who sat on the right of the table have you got jonathan out of the way he asked in an eager whisper yes yes replied edgeworth bess patience kite has lured him to enfield on a false scent after blueskin you need fear no interruption from him or any of his myrmidons thats well cried jack now stand before me poll ive got the watchspring saw in my sleeve pretend to weep both of you as loudly as you can this spike is more than half cut through i was at work at it yesterday and the day before keep up the clamour for five minutes and ill finish it thus urged the damsels began to raise their voices in loud lamentation what the devil are you howling about cried langley do you think we are to be disturbed in this way make less noise hussies or ill turn you out of the lodge for shame mr langley rejoined mrs spurling i blush for you sir to call yourself a man and interfere with the natural course of affection have you no feeling for the situation of those poor disconsolate creatures about to be bereaved of all they hold dear is it nothing to part with a husband to the gallows ive lost four in the same way and know what it is here she began to blubber loudly for sympathy comfort yourself my charmer said mr marvel in a tone intended to be consolatory ill be their substitute you cried the tapstress with a look of horror never confusion muttered jack suddenly pausing in his task the saw has broken just as i am through the spike cant we break it off replied mrs maggot i fear not replied jack despondingly lets try at all events returned the amazon and grasping the thick iron rod she pushed with all her force against it while jack seconded her efforts from within after great exertions on both parts the spike yielded to their combined strength and snapped suddenly off holloawhats that cried austin starting up only my darbies returned jack clinking his chains oh that was all was it said the turnkey quietly reseating himself now give me the woollen cloth to tie round my fetters whispered sheppard quick here it is replied edgeworth bess give me your hand poll to help me through cried jack as he accomplished the operation keep a sharp look out bess stop interposed edgeworth bess mr langley is getting up and coming this way were lost help me through at all hazards poll cried jack straining towards the opening the dangers past whispered bess mrs spurling has induced him to sit down again ah she looks this way and puts her finger to her lips she comprehends what were about were all safe dont lose a moment then cried jack forcing himself into the aperture while the amazon assisted by bess pulled him through it illustration there cried mrs maggot as she placed him without noise upon the ground youre safe so far come my disconsolate darlings cried austin it only wants five minutes to six i expect mr wild here presently cut it as short as you can only two minutes more sir intreated edgeworth bess advancing towards him in such a manner as to screen jack who crept into the farthest part of the angleonly two minutes and weve done well well im not within a minute rejoined the turnkey we shall never be able to get you out unseen jack whispered poll maggot you must make a bold push impossible replied sheppard in the same tone that would be certain destruction i cant run in these heavy fetters no i must face it out tell bess to slip out and ill put on her cloak and hood meanwhile the party at the table continued drinking and chatting as merrily as before i cant help thinking of jack sheppards speech to mr kneebone observed shotbolt as he emptied his tenth tumbler im sure hes meditating an escape and hopes to accomplish it tonight poh poh rejoined ireton it was mere idle boasting i examined the condemned hold myself carefully this morning and didnt find a nail out of its place recollect hes chained to the ground by a great horsepadlock and is never unloosed except when he comes to that hatch if he escapes at all it must be before our faces it wouldnt surprise me if he did remarked griffin hes audacity enough for anything he got out in much the same way from the gatehousestole the keys and passed through a room where i was sitting halfasleep in a chair caught you napping eh rejoined ireton with a laugh well he wont do that here ill forgive him if he does and so will i said austin were too wide awake for that aint we partner he added appealing to langley whom punch had made rather dozy i should think so responded the lethargic turnkey with a yawn during this colloquy jack had contrived unobserved to put on the hood and cloak and being about the size of the rightful owner presented a very tolerable resemblance to her this done edgeworth bess who watched her opportunity slipped out of the lodge halloa exclaimed austin who had caught a glimpse of her departing figure one of the women is gone nono hastily interposed mrs spurling theyre both here dont you see theyre putting on their cloaks thats false rejoined marvel in a low tone i perceive what has taken place oh goodness ejaculated the tapstress in alarm you wont betray him say the word and im mum returned the executioner will you be mine its a very unfair advantage to takevery replied mrs spurling however i consent then ill lend a helping hand i shall lose my fees and the laced coat but its better to have the bride without the weddin dress than the weddin dress without the bride at this moment saint sepulchres clock struck six close the wicket austin vociferated ireton in an authoritative tone good bye cried jack as if taking leave of his mistresses tomorrow at the same time well be punctual replied mrs maggot good bye jack keep up your spirits now for itlife or death exclaimed jack assuming the gait of a female and stepping towards the door as austin rose to execute his principals commands and usher the women to the gate mrs spurling and marvel rose too the latter walked carelessly towards the hatch and leaning his back against the place whence the spike had been removed so as completely to hide it continued smoking his pipe as coolly as if nothing had happened just as jack gained the entrance he heard a mans footstep behind him and aware that the slightest indiscretion would betray him he halted uncertain what to do stop a minute my dear cried austin you forget that you promised me a kiss the last time you were here wont one from me do as well interposed mrs maggot much better said mrs spurling hastening to the rescue i want to speak to edgeworth bess myself so saying she planted herself between jack and the turnkey it was a moment of breathless interest to all engaged in the attempt comethe kiss cried austin endeavouring to pass his arm familiarly round the amazons waist hands off she exclaimed or youll repent it why whatll you do demanded the turnkey teach you to keep your distance retorted mrs maggot dealing him a buffet that sent him reeling several yards backwards there off with you whispered mrs spurling squeezing jacks arm and pushing him towards the door and dont come here again before austin could recover himself jack and mrs maggot had disappeared bolt the wicket shouted ireton who with the others had been not a little entertained by the gallant turnkeys discomfiture this was done and austin returned with a crestfallen look to the table upon which mrs spurling and her now accepted suitor resumed their seats youll be as good as your word my charmer whispered the executioner of course responded the widow heaving a deep sigh oh jack jackyou little know what a price ive paid for you well im glad those women are gone remarked shotbolt coupling their presence with jacks speech i couldnt help fearing some mischief might ensue that reminds me hes still at large returned ireton here caliban go and fasten his padlock iss massa ireton replied the black stop caliban interposed mrs spurling who wished to protract the discovery of the escape as long as possible before you go bring me the bottle of pineapple rum i opened yesterday i should like mr ireton and his friends to taste it it is in the lower cupboard oh you havent got the keythen i must have it i suppose how provoking she added pretending to rummage her pockets one never can find a thing when one wants it never mind it my dear mrs spurling rejoined ireton we can taste the rum when he returns we shall have mr wild here presently and i wouldnt for the worldzounds he exclaimed as the figure of the thieftaker appeared at the wicket here he is off with you caliban fly you rascal mr wild here exclaimed mrs spurling in alarm oh gracious hes lost whos lost demanded ireton the key replied the widow all the turnkeys rose to salute the thieftaker whose habituallysullen countenance looked gloomier than usual ireton rushed forward to open the wicket for him no blueskin i perceive sir he observed in a deferential tone as wild entered the lodge no replied jonathan moodily ive been deceived by false information but the wench who tricked me shall bitterly repent it i hope this is all i begin to fear i might be purposely go out of the way nothing has gone wrong here nothing whatever replied ireton jack is just gone back to the condemned hold his two wives have been here ha exclaimed jonathan with a sudden vehemence that electrified the chief turnkey whats this a spike gone sdeath the women you say have been here he has escaped impossible sir replied ireton greatly alarmed impossible echoed wild with a fearful imprecation no sir its quite possiblemore than possible its certain ill lay my life hes gone come with me to the condemned hold directly and if i find my fears confirmed ill he was here interrupted by the sudden entrance of the black who rushed precipitately into the room letting fall the heavy bunch of keys in his fright o massa ireton massa wild ejaculated caliban shack sheppart gone gone you black devilgone cried ireton iss massa caliban sarch ebery hole in de place but shack no dere only him big hoss padlocknoting else i knew it rejoined wild with concentrated rage and he escaped you all in broad day before your faces you may well say its impossible his majestys jail of newgate is admirably guarded i must say ireton you are in league with him sir said the chief turnkey indignantly you are sir thundered jonathan and unless you find him you shant hold your place a week i dont threaten idly as you know and you austin and you langley i say the same thing to you but mr wild implored the turnkeys ive said it rejoined jonathan peremptorily and you marvel you must have been a party i sir if hes not found ill get a new hangman zounds cried marvel i hush whispered the tapstress or i retract my promise mrs spurling said jonathan who overheard the whisper you owe your situation to me if you have aided jack sheppards escape you shall owe your discharge to me also as you please sir replied the tapstress coolly and the next time captain darrell wants a witness i promise you he shant look for one in vain ha hussy dare you threaten cried wild but checking himself he turned to ireton and asked how long have the women been gone scarcely five minutes replied the latter one of you fly to the market returned jonathan another to the river a third to the new mint disperse in every direction well have him yet a hundred pounds to the man who takes him so saying he rushed out followed by ireton and langley a hundred pounds exclaimed shotbolt thats a glorious reward do you think hell pay it im sure of it replied austin then ill have it before tomorrow morning said the keeper of the new prison to himself if jack sheppard sups with mr kneebone ill make one of the party end volume ii
