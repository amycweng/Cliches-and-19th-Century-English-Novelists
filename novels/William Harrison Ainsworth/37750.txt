against the roman catholics in the early part of the reign of james the first when the severe penal enactments against recusants were revived and with additional rigour and which led to the remarkable conspiracy about to be related have been so forcibly and faithfully described by doctor lingard that the following extract from his history will form a fitting introduction to the present work the oppressive and sanguinary code framed in the reign of elizabeth was reenacted to its full extent and even improved with additional severities every individual who had studied or resided or should afterwards study or reside in any college or seminary beyond the sea was rendered incapable of inheriting or purchasing or enjoying lands annuities chattels debts or sums of money within the realm and as missionaries sometimes eluded detection under the disguise of tutors it was provided that no man should teach even the rudiments of grammar in public or in private without the previous approbation of the diocesan the execution of the penal laws enabled the king by an ingenious comment to derive considerable profit from his past forbearance it was pretended that he had never forgiven the penalties of recusancy he had merely forbidden them to be exacted for a time in the hope that this indulgence would lead to conformity but his expectations had been deceived the obstinacy of the catholics had grown with the lenity of the sovereign and as they were unworthy of further favour they should now be left to the severity of the law to their dismay the legal fine of twenty pounds per lunar month was again demanded and not only for the time to come but for the whole period of the suspension a demand which by crowding thirteen payments into one reduced many families of moderate incomes to a state of absolute beggary nor was this all james was surrounded by numbers of his indigent countrymen their habits were expensive their wants many and their importunities incessant to satisfy the more clamorous a new expedient was devised the king transferred to them his claims on some of the more opulent recusants against whom they were at liberty to proceed by law in his name unless the sufferers should submit to compound by the grant of an annuity for life or the immediate payment of a considerable sum this was at a time when the jealousies between the two nations had reached a height of which at the present day we have but little conception had the money been carried to the royal coffers the recusants would have had sufficient reason to complain but that englishmen should be placed by their king at the mercy of foreigners that they should be stripped of their property to support the extravagance of his scottish minions this added indignity to injustice exacerbated their already wounded feelings and goaded the most moderate almost to desperation from this deplorable state of things which is by no means overcoloured in the above description sprang the gunpowder plot the county of lancaster has always abounded in catholic families and at no period were the proceedings of the ecclesiastical commissioners more rigorous against them than at that under consideration manchester the goshen of this egypt as it is termed by the fiery zealot warden heyrick being the place where all the recusants were imprisoned the scene of the early part of this history has been laid in that town and its immediate neighbourhood for the introduction of the munificent founder of the blue coat hospital into a tale of this description i ought perhaps to apologize but if i should succeed by it in arousing my fellowtownsmen to a more lively appreciation of the great benefits they have derived from him i shall not regret what i have written in viviana

list they lock up the servants and the mistress of the house and the whole family in a room by themselves while they like young princes go rifling the house at their will letter to versegan ap stonyhurst mss what a thing is it for a catholic gentleman to have his house suddenly beset on all sides with a number of men in arms both horse and foot and not only his house and gardens and such enclosed places all beset but all highways laid for some miles near unto him that none shall pass but they shall be examined then are these searchers ofttimes so rude and barbarous that if the doors be not opened in the instant they would enter they break open the doors with all violence as if they were to sack a town of enemies won by the sword father gerards ms chapter i an execution in manchester at the beginning of the seventeenth century more than two hundred and thirtyfive years ago or to speak with greater precision in at the latter end of june it was rumoured one morning in manchester that two seminary priests condemned at the late assizes under the severe penal enactments then in force against the papists were about to suffer death on that day attracted by the report large crowds flocked towards the place of execution which in order to give greater solemnity to the spectacle had been fixed at the southern gate of the old collegiate church where a scaffold was erected near it was a large bloodstained block the use of which will be readily divined and adjoining the block upon a heap of blazing coals smoked a caldron filled with boiling pitch intended to receive the quarters of the miserable sufferers the place was guarded by a small band of soldiers fully accoutred in corslets and morions and armed with swords halfpikes and calivers upon the steps of the scaffold stood the executionera squarebuilt illfavoured personage busied in arranging a bundle of straw upon the boards he was dressed in a buff jerkin and had a longbladed twoedged knife thrust into his girdle besides these persons there was a pursuivantan officer appointed by the privy council to make search throughout the provinces for recusants popish priests and other religious offenders he was occupied at this moment in reading over a list of suspected persons neither the executioner nor his companions appeared in the slightest degree impressed by the butcherly business about to be enacted for the former whistled carelessly as he pursued his task while the latter laughed and chatted with the crowd or jestingly pointed their matchlocks at the jackdaws wheeling above them in the sunny air or perching upon the pinnacles and tower of the neighbouring fane not so the majority of the assemblage most of the older and wealthier families in lancashire still continuing to adhere to the ancient faith of their fathers it will not be wondered that many of their dependents should follow their example and even of those who were adverse to the creed of rome there were few who did not murmur at the rigorous system of persecution adopted towards its professors at nine oclock the hollow rolling of a muffled drum was heard at a distance the deep bell of the church began to toll and presently afterwards the mournful procession was seen advancing from the marketplace it consisted of a troop of mounted soldiers equipped in all respects like those stationed at the scaffold with their captain at their head and followed by two of their number with hurdles attached to their steeds on which were tied the unfortunate victims both were young menboth apparently prepared to meet their fate with firmness and resignation they had been brought from radcliffe hallan old moated and fortified mansion belonging to a wealthy family of that name situated where the close called pool fold now stands and then recently converted into a place of security for recusants the two other prisons in manchesternamely the new fleet on hunts bank and the gaol on salford bridgenot being found adequate to the accommodation of the numerous religious offenders by this time the cavalcade had reached the place of execution the soldiers drove back the throng with their pikes and cleared a space in front of the scaffold when just as the cords that bound the limbs of the priests were unfastened a woman in a tattered woollen robe with a hood partially drawn over her facethe features of which so far as they could be discerned were sharp and attenuateda rope girded round her waist bare feet and having altogether the appearance of a sister of charity sprang forward and flung herself on her knees beside them clasping the hem of the garment of the nearest priest she pressed it to her lips and gazed earnestly at him as if imploring a blessing you have your wish daughter said the priest extending his arms over her heaven and our lady bless you the woman then turned towards the other victim who was audibly reciting the miserere back spawn of antichrist interposed a soldier rudely thrusting her aside dont you see you disturb the fathers devotions he has enough to do to take care of his own soul without minding yours take this daughter cried the priest who had been first addressed offering her a small volume which he took from his vest and fail not to remember in your prayers the sinful soul of robert woodroofe a brother of the order of jesus the woman put out her hand to take the book but before it could be delivered to her it was seized by the soldier your priests have seldom anything to leave behind them he shouted with a brutal laugh except some worthless and superstitious relic of a saint or martyr whats this ah a breviarya massbook ive too much regard for your spiritual welfare to allow you to receive it he added about to place it in his doublet give it her exclaimed a young man snatching it from him and handing it to the woman who disappeared as soon as she had obtained possession of it the soldier eyed the newcomer as if disposed to resent the interference but a glance at his apparel which though plain and of a sober hue was rather above the middle class as well as a murmur from the crowd who were evidently disposed to take part with the young man induced him to stay his hand he therefore contented himself with crying a recusant a papist i am neither recusant nor papist knave replied the other sternly and i counsel you to mend your manners and show more humanity or you shall find i have interest enough to procure your dismissal from a service which you disgrace this reply elicited a shout of applause from the mob who is that bold speaker demanded the pursuivant from one of his attendants humphrey chetham of crumpsall answered the man son to one of the wealthiest merchants of the town and a zealous upholder of the true faith he has a strange way of showing his zeal rejoined the pursuivant entering the answer in his notebook and who is the woman he befriended a halfcrazed being called elizabeth orton replied the attendant she was scourged and tortured during queen elizabeths reign for pretending to the gift of prophecy and was compelled to utter her recantation within yonder church since then she has never opened her lips indeed exclaimed the pursuivant i will engage to make her speak and to some purpose where does she live in a cave on the banks of the irwell near ordsall hall replied the attendant she subsists on the chance contributions of the charitable but she solicits nothingand indeed is seldom seen her cave must be searched observed the pursuivant it may be the hidingplace of a priest father campion was concealed in such another spot at stonor park near henleyonthames where he composed his decem rationes and for a long time eluded the vigilance of the commissioners we shall pass it in our way to ordsall hall tonight shall we not the attendant nodded in the affirmative if we surprise father oldcorne continued the pursuivant and can prove that sir william radcliffe and his daughter both of whom are denounced in my list are harbourers and shelterers of recusants we shall have done a good nights work at this moment an officer advanced and commanded the priests to ascend the scaffold as father woodroofe who was the last to mount reached the uppermost step he turned round and cried in a loud voice good people i take you all to witness that i die in the true catholic religion and that i rejoice and thank god with all my soul that he hath made me worthy to testify my faith therein by shedding my blood in this manner he then advanced towards the executioner who was busied in adjusting the cord round his companions throat and said god forgive theedo thine office quickly adding in a lower tone asperge me domine domine miserere mei and amid the deep silence that ensued the executioner performed his horrible task the execution over the crowd began to separate slowly and various opinions were expressed respecting the revolting and sanguinary spectacle just witnessed many who condemnedand the majority did sothe extreme severity of the laws by which the unfortunate priests had just suffered uttered their sentiments with extreme caution but there were some whose feelings had been too much excited for prudence and who inveighed loudly and bitterly against the spirit of religious persecution then prevailing while a few others of an entirely opposite persuasion looked upon the rigorous proceedings adopted against the papists and the punishment now inflicted upon their priesthood as a just retribution for their own severities during the reign of mary in general the common people entertained a strong prejudice against the catholic partyfor as it has been shrewdly observed they must have some object to hate heretofore it was the welsh the scots or the spaniards but now in these latter times only the papists but in manchester near which as has been already stated so many old and important families professing that religion resided the case was widely different and the mass of the inhabitants were favourably inclined towards them it was the knowledge of this feeling that induced the commissioners appointed to superintend the execution of the enactments against recusants to proceed with unusual rigour in this neighbourhood the state of the roman catholic party at the period of this history was indeed most grievous the hopes they had indulged of greater toleration on the accession of james the first had been entirely destroyed the persecutions suspended during the first year of the reign of the new monarch were now renewed with greater severity than ever and though their present condition was deplorable enough it was feared that worse remained in store for them they bethought themselves writes bishop goodman that now their case was far worse than in the time of queen elizabeth for they did live in some hope that after the old womans life they might have some mitigation and even those who did then persecute them were a little more moderate as being doubtful what times might succeed and fearing their own case but now that they saw the times settled having no hope of better days but expecting that the uttermost rigour of the law should be executed they became desperate finding that by the laws of the kingdom their own lives were not secured and for the carrying over of a priest into england it was no less than high treason a gentlewoman was hanged only for relieving and harbouring a priest a citizen was hanged only for being reconciled to the church of rome besides the penal laws were such and so executed that they could not subsist what was usually sold in shops and usually bought this the pursuivant would take away from them as being popish and superstitious one knight did affirm that in one term he gave twenty nobles in rewards to the doorkeeper of the attorneygeneral another did affirm that his third part which remained unto him of his estate did hardly serve for his expense in law to defend him from other oppressions besides their children to be taken from home to be brought up in another religion so they did every way conclude that their estate was desperate they could die but once and their religion was more precious unto them than their lives they did further consider their misery how they were debarred in any course of life to help themselves they could not practise lawthey could not be citizensthey could have no office they could not breed up their sonsnone did desire to match with them they had neither fit marriages for their daughters nor nunneries to put them into for those few which are beyond seas are not considerable in respect of the number of recusants and none can be admitted into them without great sums of money which they being exhausted could not supply the spiritual court did not cease to molest them to excommunicate them then to imprison them and thereby they were utterly disenabled to sue for their own such is a faithful picture of the state of the catholic party at the commencement of the reign of james the first pressed down by these intolerable grievances is it to be wondered at that the papists should repineor that some among their number when all other means failed should seek redress by darker measures by a statute of elizabeth all who refused to conform to the established religion were subjected to a fine of twenty pounds a lunar month and this heavy penalty remitted or rather suspended on the accession of the new sovereign was again exacted and all arrears claimed added to this james whose court was thronged by a host of needy scottish retainers assigned to them a certain number of wealthy recusants and empowered them to levy the finesa privilege of which they were not slow to avail themselves there were other pains and penalties provided for by the same statute which were rigorously inflicted to withdraw or seek to withdraw another from the established religion was accounted high treason and punished accordingly to hear mass involved a penalty of one hundred marks and a years imprisonment and to harbour a priest under the denomination of a tutor rendered the latter liable to a years imprisonment and his employer to a fine of ten pounds amonth impressed with the belief that in consequence of the unremitting persecutions which the catholics underwent in elizabeths time the religion would be wholly extirpated doctor allen a lancashire divine who afterwards received a cardinals hat founded a college at douay for the reception and education of those intending to take orders from this university a number of missionary priests or seminarists as they were termed were annually sent over to england and it was against these persons who submitted to every hardship and privation to danger and death itself for the welfare of their religion and in the hope of propagating its doctrines that the utmost rigour of the penal enactments was directed among the number of seminarists despatched from douay and capitally convicted under the statute abovementioned were the two priests whose execution has just been narrated as a portion of the crowd passed over the old bridge across the irwell connecting manchester with salford on which stood an ancient chapel erected by thomas de booth in the reign of edward the third and recently converted into a prison for recusants they perceived the prophetess elizabeth orton seated upon the stone steps of the desecrated structure earnestly perusing the missal given her by father woodroofe a mob speedily collected round her but unconscious seemingly of their presence the poor woman turned over leaf after leaf and pursued her studies her hood was thrown back and discovered her bare and withered neck over which her dishevelled hair streamed in long sable elflocks irritated by her indifference several of the bystanders who had questioned her as to the nature of her studies began to mock and jeer her and endeavoured by plucking her robe and casting little pebbles at her to attract her attention roused at length by these annoyances she arose and fixing her large black eyes menacingly upon them was about to stalk away when they surrounded and detained her speak to us bess cried several voices prophesyprophesy i will speak to you replied the poor woman shaking her hand at them i will prophesy to you and mark me though ye believe not my words shall not fall to the ground a miracle a miracle shouted the bystanders bess orton who has been silent for twenty years has found her tongue at last i have seen a vision and dreamed a dream continued the prophetess as i lay in my cell last night meditating upon the forlorn state of our religion and of its professors methought nineteen shadowy figures stood before meay nineteenfor i counted them thriceand when i questioned them as to their comingfor my tongue at first clove to the roof of my mouth and my lips refused their officeone of them answered in a voice which yet rings in my ears we are the chosen deliverers of our fallen and persecuted church to us is intrusted the rebuilding of her templesto our hands is committed the destruction of our enemies the work will be done in darkness and in secretwith toil and travailbut it will at length be made manifest and when the hour is arrived our vengeance will be terrible and exterminating with these words they vanished from my sight ah she exclaimed suddenly starting and passing her hand across her brow as if to clear her sight it was no dreamno vision i see one of them now where where cried several voices the prophetess answered by extending her skinny arm towards some object immediately before her all eyes were instantly turned in the same direction when they beheld a spanish soldierfor such his garb proclaimed himstanding at a few paces distance from them he was wrapped in an ample cloak with a broadleaved steeplecrowned hat decorated with a single green feather pulled over his brows and wore a polishedsteel brigandine trunk hose and buff boots drawn up to the knees his arms consisted of a brace of petronels thrust into his belt whence a long rapier depended his features were dark as bronze and wellformed though strongly marked and had an expression of settled sternness his eyes were grey and penetrating and shaded by thick beetlebrows and his physiognomy was completed by a black peaked beard his person was tall and erect and his deportment soldierlike and commanding perceiving he had become an object of notice the stranger cast a compassionate look at the prophetess who still remained gazing fixedly at him and throwing her a few pieces of money strode away watching his retreating figure till it disappeared from view the crazed woman tossed her arms wildly in the air and cried in a voice of exultation did i not speak the truthdid i not tell you i had seen him he is the deliverer of our church and is come to avenge the righteous blood which hath been this day shed peace woman and fly while there is yet time cried the young man who had been designated as humphrey chetham the pursuivant and his myrmidons are in search of you then they need not go far to find me replied the prophetess i will tell them what i told these people that the day of bloody retribution is at handthat the avenger is arrived i have seen him twiceonce in my cave and once again hereeven where you stand if you do not keep silence and fly my poor creature rejoined humphrey chetham you will have to endure what you suffered years agostripes and perhaps torture be warned by meah it is too late he is approaching let him come replied elizabeth orton i am ready for him can none of you force her away cried humphrey chetham appealing to the crowd i will reward you i will not stir from this spot rejoined the prophetess obstinately i will testify to the truth the kindhearted young merchant finding any further attempt to preserve her fruitless drew aside by this time the pursuivant and his attendants had come up seize her cried the former and let her be placed within this prison till i have reported her to the commissioners if you will confess to me woman he added in a whisper to her that you have harboured a priest and will guide us to his hidingplace you shall be set free i know of no priests but those you have murdered returned the prophetess in a loud voice but i will tell you something that you wot not of the avenger of blood is at hand i have seen him all here have seen him and you shall see himbut not nownot now what is the meaning of this raving demanded the pursuivant pay no heed to her talk interposed humphrey chetham she is a poor crazed being who knows not what she says i will be surety for her inoffensive conduct you must give me surety for yourself sir replied the pursuivant i have just learnt that you were last night at ordsall hall the seat of that dangerous temporiserfor so he is designated in my warrantsir william radcliffe and if report speaks truly you are not altogether insensible to the charms of his fair daughter viviana what is this to thee thou malapert knave cried humphrey chetham reddening partly from anger partly it might be from another emotion much as you shall presently find good master wolfinsheepsclothing retorted the pursuivant if you prove not a rank papist at heart then do i not know a true man from a false this angry conference was cut short by a piercing scream from the prophetess breaking from the grasp of her captors who were about to force her into the prison she sprang with a single bound upon the parapet of the bridge and utterly regardless of her dangerous position turned and faced the soldiers who were struck mute with astonishment tremble she cried in a loud voicetremble ye evildoers ye who have despoiled the house of godhave broken his altarsscattered his incenseslain his priests tremble i say the avenger is arrived the bolt is in his hand it shall strike king lords commonsall these are my last wordstake them to heart drag her off roared the pursuivant furiously use careuse gentleness if ye are men cried humphrey chetham think not you can detain me cried the prophetess avaunt and tremble so saying she flung herself from the parapet the height from which she fell was about fifty feet dashed into the air like jets from a fountain by the weight and force of the descending body the water instantly closed over her but she rose to the surface of the stream about twenty yards below the bridge she may yet be saved cried humphrey chetham who with the bystanders had hurried to the side of the bridge you will only preserve her for the gallows observed the pursuivant your malice shall not prevent my making the attempt replied the young merchant ha assistance is at hand the exclamation was occasioned by the sudden appearance of the soldier in the spanish dress who rushed towards the left bank of the river which was here as elsewhere formed of red sandstone rock and following the course of the current awaited the next appearance of the drowning woman it did not occur till she had been carried a considerable distance down the stream when the soldier swiftly divesting himself of his cloak plunged into the water and dragged her ashore follow me cried the pursuivant to his attendants i will not lose my prey but before he gained the bank of the river the soldier and his charge had disappeared nor could he detect any traces of them chapter ii ordsall cave after rescuing the unfortunate prophetess from a watery grave in the manner just related the soldier snatched up his cloak and taking his dripping burthen in his arms hurried swiftly along the bank of the river until he came to a large cleft in the rock into which he crept taking the prophetess with him and thus eluded observation in this retreat he continued upwards of two hours during which time the poor creature to whom he paid every attention that circumstances would admit had so far recovered as to be able to speak but it was evident that the shock had been too much for her and that she was sinking fast she was so faint that she could scarcely move but she expressed a strong desire to reach her cell before she breathed her last having described its situation as accurately as she could to the soldierwho before he ventured forth peeped out to reconnoitrehe again raised her in his arms and by her direction struck into a narrow lane skirting the bank of the river pursuing this road for about half a mile he arrived at the foot of a small knoll covered by a clump of magnificent beechtrees and still acting under the guidance of the dying woman whose voice grew more feeble each instant he mounted it and from its summit took a rapid survey of the surrounding country on the opposite bank of the river stood an old hall while further on at some distance he could perceive through the trees the gables and chimneys of another ancient mansion raise me up said elizabeth orton as he lingered on this spot for a moment in that old house which you see yonder hulme hall i was born i would willingly take one look at it before i die illustration guy fawkes in ordsall cave and the other hall which i discern through the trees is ordsall is it not inquired the soldier it is replied the prophetess and now let us make what haste we can we have not far to go and i feel i shall not last long descending the eminence and again entering the lane which here made a turn the soldier approached a grassy space walled in on either side by steep sandstone rocks at the further extremity of the enclosure after a moments search by the direction of his companion he found artfully concealed by overhanging brushwood the mouth of a small cave he crept into the excavation and found it about six feet high and of considerable depth the roof was ornamented with runic characters and other grotesque and halfeffaced inscriptions while the sides were embellished with gothic tracery amid which the letters ihs carved in ancient church text could be easily distinguished tradition assigned the cell to the priests of odin but it was evident that worshippers at other and holier altars had more recently made it their retreat its present occupant had furnished it with a straw pallet and a small wooden crucifix fixed in a recess in the wall gently depositing her upon the pallet the soldier took a seat beside her on a stone slab at the foot of the bed he next at her request as the cave was rendered almost wholly dark by the overhanging trees struck a light and set fire to a candle placed within a lantern after a few moments passed in prayer the recluse begged him to give her the crucifix that she might clasp it to her breast this done she became more composed and prepared to meet her end suddenly as if something had again disturbed her she opened wide her glazing eyes and starting up with a dying effort stretched out her hands i see him before them she cried they examine himthey adjudge him ah he is now in a dungeon see the torturers advance he is placed on the rackoncetwicethricethey turn the levers his joints snap in their socketshis sinews crack mercy he confesses he is led to execution i see him ascend the scaffold whom do you behold inquired the soldier listening to her in astonishment his face is hidden from me replied the prophetess but his figure is not unlike your own ha i hear the executioner pronounce his name how are you called guy fawkes replied the soldier it is the name i heard rejoined elizabeth orton and sinking backward she expired guy fawkes gazed at her for some time till he felt assured that the last spark of life had fled he then turned away and placing his hand upon his chin became lost in deep reflection chapter iii ordsall hall soon after sunset on the evening of the events previously related the inmates of ordsall hall were disturbed and alarmed for in those times of trouble any casual disturbance at night was sufficient to occasion alarm to a catholic family by a loud clamour for admittance from some one stationed at the farther side of the moat then as now surrounding that ancient manorial residence the drawbridge being raised no apprehension was entertained of an attempt at forcible entrance on the part of the intruder who so far as he could be discerned in the deepening twilight rendered yet more obscure by the shade of the trees under which he stood appeared to be a solitary horseman still for fear of a surprise it was judged prudent by those inside the hall to turn a deaf ear to the summons nor was it until it had been more than once repeated in a peremptory tone that any attention was paid to it the outer gate was then cautiously opened by an old steward and a couple of servingmen armed with pikes and swords who demanded the strangers business and were answered that he desired to speak with sir william radcliffe the steward rejoined that his master was not at home having set out the day before for chester but that even if he were he would take upon himself to affirm that no audience would be given on any pretence whatever to a stranger at such an unseasonable hour to this the other replied in a haughty and commanding voice that he was neither a stranger to sir william radcliffe nor ignorant of the necessity of caution though in this instance it was altogether superfluous and as notwithstanding the stewards assertion to the contrary he was fully persuaded his master was at home he insisted upon being conducted to him without further parley as his business would not brook delay in vain the steward declared he had spoken the truth the stranger evidently disbelieved him but as he could obtain no more satisfactory answer to his interrogations he suddenly shifted his ground and inquired whether sir williams daughter mistress viviana was likewise absent from home before i reply to the question i must know by whom and wherefore it is put returned the steward evasively trouble not yourself further friend but deliver this letter to her rejoined the horseman flinging a packet across the moat it is addressed to her father but there is no reason why she should not be acquainted with its contents take it up olin birtwissel cried the steward eyeing the packet which had fallen at his feet suspiciously take it up i say and hold it to the light that i may consider it well before i carry it to our young mistress i have heard of strange treacheries practised by such means and care not to meddle with it neither do i good master heydocke replied birtwissel i would not touch it for a twelvemonths wages it may burst and spoil my good looks and so ruin my fortunes with the damsels but here is jeff gellibronde who having no beauty to lose and being moreover afraid of nothing will pick it up for you speak for yourself olin rejoined gellibronde in a surly tone i have no more fancy for a shattered limb or a scorched face than my neighbours dolts cried the stranger who had listened to these observations with angry impatience if you will not convey my packet which has nothing more dangerous about it than an ordinary letter to your mistress at least acquaint her that mr robert catesby of ashby st legers is without and craves an instant speech with her mr catesby exclaimed the steward in astonishment if it be indeed your worship why did you not declare yourself at once i may have as good reason for caution as yourself master heydocke returned catesby laughing true rejoined the steward but methinks it is somewhat strange to find your worship here when i am aware that my master expected to meet you and certain other honourable gentlemen that you wot of at a place in a clean opposite direction holywell in flintshire the cause of my presence since you desire to be certified of the matter is simply this replied catesby urging his steed towards the edge of the moat while the steward advanced to meet him on the opposite bank so that a few yards only lay between them i came round by manchester he continued in a lower tone to see if any assistance could be rendered to the unfortunate fathers woodroofe and forshawe but found on my arrival this morning that i was too late as they had just been executed heaven have mercy on their souls ejaculated heydocke shuddering and crossing himself yours was a pious mission mr catesby would it had been availing i would so too with all my soul rejoined the other fervently but fate ordained it otherwise while i was in the town i accidentally learnt from one who informed me he had just parted with him that your master was at home and fearing he might not be able to attend the meeting at holywell i resolved to proceed hither at nightfall when my visit was not likely to be observed having motives which you may readily conjecture for preserving the strictest secrecy on the occasion the letter was prepared in case i should fail in meeting with him and now that i have satisfied your scruples good master steward if sir william be really within i pray you lead me to him forthwith if not your young mistress may serve my turn for i have that to say which it imports one or other of them to know in regard to my master replied the steward he departed yesterday for chester on his way to join the pilgrimage to st winifreds well as i have already assured your worship and whoever informed you to the contrary spoke falsely but i will convey your letter and message to my young mistress and on learning her pleasure as to receiving you will instantly return and report it these are dangerous times your worship dangerous times a good catholic knows not whom to trust there are so many spoilers abroad how sirrah cried catesby angrily do you apply that observation to me far be it from me answered heydocke respectfully to apply any observation that may sound offensive to your worship whom i know to be a most worthy gentleman and as free from heresy as any in the kingdom i was merely endeavouring to account for what may appear my overcaution in detaining you where you are till i learn my ladys pleasure it is a rule in this house not to lower the drawbridge without orders after sunset and i dare not for my place disobey it young mr humphrey chetham of crumpsall was detained in the like manner no later than last night and he is a visitor he added in a significant tone who is not altogether unwelcome to my mistressahem but duty is no respecter of persons and in my masters absence my duty is to protect his household your worship will pardon me i will pardon anything but your loquacity and tediousness rejoined catesby impatiently about your errand quickly i am gone your worship returned the steward disappearing with his companions throwing the bridle over his horses neck and allowing him to drink his fill from the water of the moat and afterwards to pluck a few mouthfuls of the long grass that fringed its brink catesby abandoned himself to reflection in a few moments as the steward did not return he raised his eyes and fixed them upon the ancient habitation before himancient indeed it was not at this time having been in a great measure rebuilt by its possessor sir william radcliffe during the latter part of the reign of elizabeth in the rich and picturesque style of that period little could be distinguished of its projecting and retiring wings its walls decorated with black and white chequerwork the characteristic of the class of architecture to which it belonged or of its magnificent embayed windows filled with stained glass but the outline of its heavy roof with its numerous gables and groups of tall and elaboratelyornamented chimneys might be distinctly traced in strong relief against the warm and stillglowing western sky though much gone to decay grievously neglected and divided into three separate dwellinghouses ordsall hall still retains much of its original character and beauty and viewed at the magic hour above described when the changes produced by the lapse of years cannot be detected it presents much the same striking appearance that it offered to the gaze of catesby situated on the north bank of the irwell which supplies the moat with a constant stream of fresh water it commands on the southwest a beautiful view of the winding course of the river here almost forming an island of trafford park and its hall of the woody uplands beyond it and of the distant hills of cheshire the mansion itself is an irregular quadrangle covering a considerable tract of ground the gardens once exquisitely laid out in the formal taste of elizabeths days are also enclosed by the moat surrounding except in the intervals where it is filled up a space of some acres in extent at the period of this history it was approached on the northeast by a noble avenue of sycamores leading to within a short distance of its gates as catesby surveyed this stately structure and pondered upon the wealth and power of its owner his meditations thus found vent in wordsif i could but link radcliffe to our cause or win the hand of his fair daughter and so bind him to me the great attempt could not fail she has refused me once no matter i will persevere till she yields with father oldcorne to back my suit i am assured of success she is necessary to my purpose and shall be mine descended from an ancient northamptonshire family and numbering among his ancestry the wellknown minister of the same name who flourished in the reign of richard the third robert catesbyat this time about fortyhad in his youth led a wild and dissolute life and though bred in the faith of rome he had for some years abandoned its worship in when the jesuits campion and persons visited england he was reconciled to the church he had quitted and thenceforth became as zealous a supporter and promoter of its doctrines as he had heretofore been their bitter opponent he was now actively engaged in all the popish plots of the period and was even supposed to be connected with those designs of a darker dye which were set on foot for elizabeths destructionwith somervilles conspiracywith that of arden and throckmortonthe latter of whom was his uncle on the maternal sidewith the plots of bury and savageof ballardand of babington after the execution of the unfortunate queen of scots he devoted himself to what was termed the spanish faction and endeavoured carry out the schemes of a party who distrusting the vague promises of james were anxious to secure the succession to a catholicthe infanta of spain or the duke of parma on the insurrection of the earl of essex he took part with that illfated nobleman and though he escaped condign punishment for the offence he was imprisoned and heavily fined from this time his career ran in darker channels hungerstarved for innovation as he is finely described by camdenimbued with the fiercest religious fanaticismeloquent wily resoluteable alike to delude the powerful and intimidate the weakhe possessed all the ingredients of a conspirator associating with men like himself of desperate character and broken fortunes he was ever on the look out for some means of retrieving his own condition and redressing the wrongs of his church well informed of the actual state of jamess sentiments when on that monarchs accession confident hopes were entertained by the romanists of greater toleration for their religion catesby was the first to point out their mistake and to foretel the season of terrible persecution that was at hand on this persecution he grounded his hopeshopes never realized for the sufferers amid all the grievances they endured remained constant in their fidelity to the throneof exciting a general insurrection among the catholics disappointed in this expectationdisappointed also in his hopes of spain of france and of aid from rome he fell back upon himself and resolved upon the execution of a dark and dreadful project which he had long conceived and which he could execute almost singlehanded without aid from foreign powers and without the cooperation of his own party the nature of this project which if it succeeded would he imagined accomplish all or more than his wildest dreams of ambition or fanaticism had ever conceived it will be the business of this history to develope without going further into detail at present it may be mentioned that the success of the plot depended so entirely on its secrecy and so well aware was its contriver of the extraordinary system of espionage carried on by the earl of salisbury and the privy council that for some time he scarcely dared to trust it out of his keeping at length after much deliberation he communicated it to five others all of whom were bound to silence by an oath of unusual solemnity and as it was necessary to the complete success of the conspiracy that its outbreak should be instantaneously followed by a rise on the part of the catholics he darkly hinted that a plan was on foot for their deliverance from the yoke of their oppressors and counselled them to hold themselves in readiness to fly to arms at a moments notice but here again he failed few were disposed to listen to him and of those who did the majority returned for answer that their part was endurance and that the only arms which christians could use against lawful powers in their severity were prayers and tears among the popish party of that period as in our own time were ranked many of the oldest and most illustrious families in the kingdomfamilies not less remarkable for their zeal for their religion than as has before been observed for their loyaltya loyalty afterwards approved in the disastrous reign of james the second by their firm adherence to what they considered the indefeasible right of inheritance plots indeed were constantly hatched throughout the reigns of elizabeth and james by persons professing the religion of rome but in these the mass of the catholics had no share and even in the seasons of the bitterest persecution when every fresh act of treason perpetrated by some lawless and disaffected individual was visited with additional rigour on their headswhen the scaffold reeked with their blood and the stake smoked with their asheswhen their quarters were blackening on the gates and marketcrosses of every city in the realmwhen their hearths were invaded their religion proscribed and the very name of papist had become a bywordeven in those terrible seasons as in the season under consideration they remained constant in their fidelity to the crown from the troubled elements at work some fierce and turbulent spirits were sure to arisesome gloomy fanatics who having brooded over their wrongs real or imaginary till they had lost all scruples of conscience hesitated at no means of procuring redress but it would be unjust to hold up such persons as representatives of the whole body of catholics among the conspirators themselves there were redeeming shades all were not actuated by the same atrocious motives mixed feelings induced catesby to adopt the measure not so guy fawkes who had already been leagued with the design one idea alone ruled him a soldier of fortune but a stern religious enthusiast he supposed himself chosen by heaven for the redemption of his church and cared not what happened to himself provided he accomplished his as he conceived holy design in considering the causes which produced the conspiracy about to be related and in separating the disaffected party of the papists from the temperate due weight must be given to the influence of the priesthood of the romish clergy there were two classesthe secular priests and the jesuits and missionaries while the former like the more moderate of the laity would have been wellcontented with toleration for their religion the latter breathed nothing but revenge and desired the utter subversion of the existing governmenttemporal as well as ecclesiastical men for the most part of high intellectual powers of untiring energy and unconquerable fortitude they were enabled by their zeal and ability to make many proselytes by their means secret correspondence was carried on with the different courts of europe and they were not without hope that taking advantage of some favourable crisis they should yet restore their church to its former supremacy to these personswho held as a maxim qui religionem catholicam deserit regnandi jus omne amisitcatesby and his associates proved ready and devoted agents through their instrumentality they hoped to accomplish the great work of their restoration to father garnet the provincial of the english jesuits of whom it will be necessary to speak more fully hereafter the plot had been revealed by catesby under the seal of confession and though it subsequently became a question whether he was justified in withholding a secret of such importance to the state it is sufficient for the present purpose to say that he did withhold it for the treasonable practices of the jesuits and their faction some palliation may perhaps be found in the unrelenting persecution to which they were subjected but if any excuse can be admitted for them what opinion must be formed of the conduct of their temperate brethren surely while the one is condemned admiration may be mingled with the sympathy which must be felt for the unmerited sufferings of the other from the foregoing statement it will be readily inferred that sir william radcliffe a devout catholic and a man of large possessions though somewhat reduced by the heavy fines imposed upon him as a recusant must have appeared an object of importance to the conspirators nor will it be wondered at that every means were used to gain him to their cause acting however upon the principles that swayed the welldisposed of his party the knight resisted all these overtures and refused to take any share in proceedings from which his conscience and loyalty alike revolted baffled but not defeated catesby returned to the charge on a new point of assault himself a widower or supposed to be so he solicited the hand of the lovely viviana radcliffe sir williams only child and the sole heiress of his possessions but his suit in this quarter was also unsuccessful the knight rejected the proposal alleging that his daughter had no inclination to any alliance inasmuch as she entertained serious thoughts of avowing herself to heaven thus foiled catesby ostensibly relinquished his design shortly before the commencement of this history a pilgrimage to saint winifreds well in flintshire was undertaken by father garnet the provincial of the jesuits before mentioned in company with several distinguished catholic personages of both sexes and to this ceremonial sir william and his daughter were urgently bidden the invitation was declined on the part of viviana but accepted by the knight who though unwilling to leave home at a period of so much danger or to commit his daughter to any care but his own even for so short a space felt it to be his duty to give countenance by his presence to the ceremonial accordingly he departed for chester on the previous day as stated by the steward and though catesby professed ignorance on the subject and even affirmed he had heard to the contrary it may be doubted whether he was not secretly informed of the circumstance and whether his arrival at this particular conjuncture was not preconcerted thus much in explanation of what is to follow the course of catesbys reflections was cut short by the return of the steward who informing him that he had his mistresss commands to admit him immediately lowered the drawbridge for that purpose dismounting and committing his steed to one of the servingmen who advanced to take it catesby followed his conductor through a stone gateway and crossing the garden was ushered into a spacious and lofty hall furnished with a long massy oak table at the upper end of which was a raised dais at one side of the chamber yawned a huge arched fireplace garnished with enormous andirons on which smouldered a fire composed of mixed turf and wood above the chimneypiece hung a suit of chainarmour with the battleaxe helmet and gauntlets of sir john radcliffe the first possessor of ordsall who flourished in the reign of edward the first on the right masking the entrance stood a magnificent screen of carved oak traversing this hall heydocke led the way to another large apartment and placing lights on a gothicshaped table offered a seat to the newcomer and departed the room in which catesby was left was termed the starchambera name retained to this dayfrom the circumstance of its ceiling being moulded and painted to resemble the heavenly vault when studded with the luminaries of night it was terminated by a deeplyembayed window filled with stained glass of the most gorgeous colours the walls in some places were hung with arras in others wainscoted with dark lustrous oak embellished with scrolls ciphers and fanciful designs the mantelpiece was of the same solid material curiously carved and of extraordinary size it was adorned with the armorial bearings of the familytwo bends engrailed and in chief a label of threeand other devices and inscriptions the hearth was considerably raised above the level of the floor and there was a peculiarity in the construction of the massive wooden pillars flanking it that attracted the attention of catesby who rose with the intention of examining them more narrowly when he was interrupted by the entrance of the lady of the mansion advancing at a slow and dignified pace viviana radcliffe courteously but gravely saluted her guest and without offering him her hand motioned him to a chair while she seated herself at a little distance catesby had seen her twice before and whether the circumstances under which they now met might have caused some change in her demeanour he could not tell but he thought her singularly altered a year ago she had been a lively laughing girl of seventeen with a bright brown skin dark flowing tresses and eyes as black and radiant as those of a gipsy she was now a grave collected woman infinitely more beautiful but wholly changed in character her complexion had become a clear transparent white and set off to great advantage her large luminous eyes and jetty brows her figure was tall and majestic her features regular delicately formed and of the rarest and proudest class of beauty she was attired in a dress of black wrought velvet entirely without ornament except the rosary at her girdle with a small ebony crucifix attached to it she wore a closefitting cap likewise of black velvet edged with pearls beneath which her raven tresses were gathered in such a manner as to display most becomingly the smooth and snowy expanse of her forehead the gravity of her manner not less than her charms of person seem to have struck catesby mute he gazed on her in silent admiration for a brief space utterly forgetful of the object of his visit and the part he intended to play during this pause she maintained the most perfect composure and fixing her dark eyes full upon him appeared to await the moment when he might choose to open the conversation notwithstanding his age and the dissolute and distracted life he had led catesby was still goodlooking enough to have produced a favourable impression upon any woman easily captivated by manly beauty the very expression of his marked and peculiar physiognomyin some degree an index to his characterwas sufficient to rivet attention and the mysterious interest generally inspired by his presence was not diminished on further acquaintance with him though somewhat stern in their expression his features were strikingly handsome cast in an oval mould and clothed with the pointed beard and trimmed mustaches invariably met with in the portraits of vandyck his frame was strongly built but well proportioned and seemed capable of enduring the greatest fatigue his dress was that of an ordinary gentleman of the period and consisted of a doublet of quilted silk of sober colour and stout texture large trunkhose swelling out at the hips and buff boots armed with spurs with immense rowels he wore a high and stifflystarched ruff round his throat and his apparel was completed by a short cloak of brown cloth lined with silk of a similar colour his arms were rapier and poniard and his highcrowned plumed hat of the peculiar form then in vogue and looped on the leerside with a diamond clasp was thrown upon the table some little time having elapsed during which he made no effort to address her viviana broke silence i understood you desired to speak with me on a matter of urgency mr catesby she remarked i did so he replied as if aroused from a reverie and i can only excuse my absence of mind and ill manners on the plea that the contemplation of your charms has driven all other matter out of my head mr catesby returned viviana rising if the purpose of your visit be merely to pay unmerited compliments i must at once put an end to it i have only obeyed the impulse of my heart resumed the other passionately and uttered what involuntarily rose to my lips but he added checking himself i will not offend you with my admiration if you have read my letter to your father you will not require to be informed of the object of my visit i have not read it replied viviana returning him the packet with the seal unbroken i can give no opinion on any matter of difficulty and i have no desire to know any secret with which my father might not desire me to be acquainted are we overheard inquired catesby glancing suspiciously at the fireplace by no one whom you would care to overhear us returned the maiden then it is as i supposed rejoined catesby father oldcorne is concealed behind that mantelpiece viviana smiled an affirmative let him come forth i pray you returned catesby what i have to say concerns him as much as yourself or your father and i would gladly have his voice in the matter you shall have it my son replied a reverend personage clad in a priestly garb stepping from out one side of the mantelpiece which flew suddenly open disclosing a recess curiously contrived in the thickness of the wall you shall have it said father oldcorne for he it was approaching and extending his arms over him accept my blessing and my welcome catesby received the benediction with bowed head and bended knee and now continued the priest what has the bravest soldier of our church to declare to its lowliest servant catesby then briefly explained as he had before done to the steward why he had taken manchester in his route to north wales and after lamenting his inability to render any assistance to the unfortunate priests he went on to state that he had accidentally learnt from a few words let fall by the pursuivant to his attendant that a warrant had been sent by the earl of salisbury for sir william radcliffes arrest my fathers arrest exclaimed viviana trembling violently whatwhat is laid to his charge felony rejoined catesby sternlyfelony without benefit of clergyfor so it is accounted by the present execrable laws of our landin harbouring a jesuit priest if he is convicted of the offence his punishment will be deathdeath on the gibbet accompanied by indignities worse than those shown to a common felon holy virgin ejaculated father oldcorne lifting up his hands and raising his eyes to heaven from what i gathered the officers will visit this house tonight continued catesby our lady be praised they will not find him cried viviana who had been thrown into an agony of distress what is to be done in this frightful emergency holy father she added turning to the priest with a supplicating look heaven only knows dear daughter replied oldcorne you had better appeal for counsel to one who is more able to afford it than i ammr catesby well aware of the crafty devices of our enemies and having often eluded their snares himself he may enable you to escape them my own course is clear i shall quit this roof at once deeply and bitterly regretting that by entering it i have placed those whom i hold so dear and from whom i have experienced so much kindness in such fearful jeopardy oh no father exclaimed viviana you shall not go daughter replied oldcorne solemnly i have long borne the cross of christhave long endured the stripes inflicted upon me by the adversaries of our faith in patience and my last actions and last breath shall testify to the truth of our holy religion but though i could endure aught on my own account i cannot consent to bring misery and destruction upon others hinder me not dear daughter i will go at once hold father interposed catesby the step you would take may bring about what you are most anxious to avoid if you are discovered and apprehended in this neighbourhood suspicion will still attach to your protectors and the secret of your departure will be wrung from some of the more timid of the household tarry where you are let the pursuivant make his search i will engage to baffle his vigilance he speaks the truth dear father returned viviana you must notshall not depart there are plenty of hidingplaces as you know within the mansion let them be as rigorous as they may in their search they will not discover you whatever course you adjudge best for the security of others i will pursue rejoined oldcorne turning to catesby put me out of the question my opinion has already been given father replied catesby remain where you are but if the officers should ascertain that my father is at chester and pursue him thither cried viviana suddenly struck by a new cause of alarm a messenger must be immediately despatched after him to give him warning returned catesby will you be that messenger asked the maiden eagerly i would shed my hearts best blood to pleasure you returned catesby then i may count upon this service for which rest assured i will not prove ungrateful she rejoined you may answered catesby and yet i would on father oldcornes account that my departure might be delayed till tomorrow the delay might be fatal cried viviana you must be in chester before that time doubt it not returned catesby charged with your wishes the wind shall scarcely outstrip my speed so saying he marched irresolutely towards the door as if about to depart when just as he had reached it he turned sharply round and threw himself at vivianas feet forgive me miss radcliffe he cried if i once again even at a critical moment like the present dare to renew my suit i fancied i had subdued my passion for you but your presence has awakened it with greater violence than ever rise sir i pray rejoined the maiden in an offended tone hear me i beseech you continued catesby seizing her hand before you reject my suit consider well that in these perilous seasons when no true catholic can call his life his own you may need a protector in the event you describe mr catesby answered viviana i would at once fulfil the intention i have formed of devoting myself to heaven and retire to the convent of benedictine nuns founded by lady mary percy at brussels you would much more effectually serve the cause of your religion by acceding to my suit observed catesby rising how so she inquired listen to me miss radcliffe he rejoined gravely and let my words be deeply graven upon your heart in your hands rests the destiny of the catholic church in mine exclaimed viviana in yours returned catesby a mighty blow is about to be struck for her deliverance ay marry is it cried oldcorne with sudden fervour redemption draweth nigh the year of visitation approacheth to an end and jubilation is at hand england shall again be called a happy realm a blessed country a religious people those who knew the former glory of religion shall lift up their hands for joy to see it returned again righteousness shall prosper and infidelity be plucked up by the root false error shall vanish like smoke and they which saw it shall say where is it become the daughters of babylon shall be cast down and in the dust lament their ruin proud heresy shall strike her sail and groan as a beast crushed under a cartwheel the memory of novelties shall perish with a crack and as a ruinous house falling to the ground repent ye seducers with speed and prevent the dreadful wrath of the powerable he will come as flame that burneth out beyond the furnace his fury shall fly forth as thunder and pitch upon their tops that malign him they shall perish in his fury and melt like wax before the fire amen ejaculated catesby as the priest concluded you have spoken prophetically father i have but recited a prayer transmitted to me by father garnet rejoined oldcorne do you discern any hidden meaning in it demanded catesby yea verily my son returned the priest in the false error vanishing like smokein the house perishing with a crackand in the fury flying forth as thunderi read the mode the great work shall be brought about and you applaud the design asked catesby eagerly non vero factum probo sed eventum amo rejoined the priest the secret is safe in your keeping father asked catesby uneasily as if it had been disclosed to me in private confession replied oldcorne hum muttered catesby confessions of as much consequence to the state have ere now been revealed father a decree has been passed by his holiness clement viii forbidding all such revelations replied oldcorne and the question has been recently propounded by a learned brother of our order father antonio delrio who in his magical disquisitions putteth it thussupposing a malefactor shall confess that he himself or some other has laid gunpowder or the like combustible matter under a building ha exclaimed catesby starting and unless it be taken away proceeded the priest regarding him fixedly the whole house will be burnt the prince destroyed and as many as go into or out of the city will come to great mischief or peril well exclaimed catesby the point then arises continued oldcorne whether the priest may make use of the secret thus obtained for the good of the government and the averting of such danger and after fully discussing it father delrio decides in the negative enough returned catesby by whom is the blow to be struck asked viviana who had listened to the foregoing discourse in silent wonder by me answered catesby it is for you to nerve my arm you speak in riddles she replied i understand you not question father oldcorne then as to my meaning rejoined catesby he will tell you that allied to you i could not fail in the enterprise on which i am engaged it is the truth dear daughter oldcorne asseverated i will not inquire further into this mystery returned viviana for such it is to me but believing what you both assert i answer that willingly as i would lay down my life for the welfare of our holy religion persuading myself as i do that i have constancy enough to endure martyrdom for its sakei cannot consent to your proposal nay if i must avouch the whole truth she continued blushing deeply my affections are already engaged though to one with whom i can never hope to be united you have your answer my son observed the priest catesby replied with a look of the deepest mortification and disappointment and bowing coldly to viviana said i now depart to obey your behests miss radcliffe commend me in all duty to my dear father replied viviana and believe that i shall for ever feel bound to you for your zeal neglect not all due caution father observed catesby glancing significantly at oldcorne forewarned forearmed doubt me not my son rejoined the jesuit my prayers shall be for you gentem auferte perfidam credentium de finibus ut christo laudes debitas persolvamus alacriter after receiving a parting benediction from the priest catesby took his leave his steed was speedily brought to the door by the old steward and mounting it he crossed the drawbridge which was immediately raised behind him and hastened on his journey confitetur maleficus se vel alium posuisse pulverem vel quid aliud sub tali limine et nisi tollantur domum comburendam principem interiturum quotquot urbem egredienturque in magnam perniciem aut periculum venturosdelrio disq mag lib vi cap i edit chapter iv the search immediately after catesbys departure heydocke was summoned to his mistresss presence he found her with the priest and was informed that in all probability the house would be visited that night by the messengers of the privy council the old steward received the intelligence as he might have done his deathwarrant and looked so bewildered and affrighted that viviana half repented having acquainted him with it compose yourself master heydocke she said trying to reason him out of his fears the search may not take place and if it does there is nothing to be alarmed at i am not afraid you perceive nothing to be alarmed at my dear young lady gasped the steward you have never witnessed a midnight search for a priest by these ruffianly catchpoles as i have or you would not say so father oldcorne will comprehend my uneasiness and excuse it the miscreants break into the house like robbers and treat its inmates worse than robbers would treat them they have no regard for decencyno consideration for sexno respect for persons not a chamber is sacred from them if a door is bolted they burst it open a cabinet locked they tarry not for the key they pull down the hangings thrust their rapierpoints into the crevices of the wainscot discharge their firearms against the wall and sometimes threaten to pull down the house itself if the object of their quest be not delivered to them their oaths abominations and menaces are horrible and their treatment of females even of your degree honoured mistress too barbarous to relate poor lady nevil died of the fright she got by such a visit at dead of night to her residence in holborn mrs vavasour of york lost her senses and many others whom i could mention have been equal sufferers nothing to be alarmed at heaven grant my dear dear young lady that you may never be fatally convinced to the contrary suppose my apprehensions are as great as your own master heydocke replied viviana who though somewhat infected by his terrors still maintained her firmness i do not see how the danger is to be averted by idle lamentations and misgivings we must meet it boldly and trust to him who is our only safeguard in the hour of peril for protection do not alarm the household but let all retire to rest as usual right daughter observed the priest preparations for resistance would only excite suspicion can you depend on the servants in case they are examined asked viviana of the steward who by this time had partially recovered his composure i think so returned heydocke but the threats of the officers are so dreadful and their conduct so violent and outrageous that i can scarcely answer for myself i would not advise your reverence to remain in that hidingplace he added pointing to the chimneypiece they are sure to discover it if not here where shall i conceal myself rejoined oldcorne uneasily there are many nooks in which your reverence might hide replied the steward but the knaves are so crafty and so well experienced in their vocation that i dare not recommend any of them as secure i would advise you to remain on the watch and in case of alarm i will conduct you to the oratory in the north gallery adjoining mistress vivianas sleepingchamber where there is a panel in the wall known only to myself and my master opening upon a secret passage running many hundred yards underground and communicating with a small outbuilding on the other side of the moat there is a contrivance in this passage which i will explain to your reverence if need be which will cut off any possibility of pursuit in that quarter be it so replied the priest i place myself in your hands good master heydocke well assured of your fidelity i shall remain throughout the night in this chamber occupied in my devotions you will suffer me to pray with you father i trust said viviana if you desire it assuredly dear daughter rejoined oldcorne but i am unwilling you should sacrifice your rest it will be no sacrifice father for i should not slumber even if i sought my couch she returned go good heydocke keep vigilant watch and if you hear the slightest noise without fail not to give us warning the steward bowed and departed some hours elapsed during which nothing occurred to alarm viviana and her companion who consumed the time in prayer and devout conversation when just at the stroke of twoas the former was kneeling before her spiritual adviser and receiving absolution for the slight offences of which a being so pureminded could be supposed capablea noise like the falling of a bar of iron was heard beneath the window the priest turned pale and cast a look of uneasiness at the maiden who said nothing but snatching up the light and motioning him to remain quiet hurried out of the room in search of the steward he was nowhere to be found in vain she examined all the lower roomsin vain called to him by name no answer was returned greatly terrified she was preparing to retrace her steps when she heard the sound of muttered voices in the hall extinguishing her light she advanced to the door which was left ajar and taking care not to expose herself to observation beheld several armed figures some of whom bore dark lanterns while others surrounded and menaced with their drawn swords the unfortunate steward from their discourse she ascertained that having thrown a plank across the moat and concealed themselves within the garden until they had reconnoitred the premises they had contrived to gain admittance unperceived through the window of a small back room in which they had surprised heydocke who had fallen asleep on his post and captured him one amongst their number who appeared to act as leader and whom from his garb and the white wand he carried viviana knew must be a pursuivant now proceeded to interrogate the prisoner to every question proposed to him the steward shook his head and in spite of the threats of the examinant and the blows of his followers he persisted in maintaining silence if we cannot make this contumacious rascal speak we will find others more tractable observed the pursuivant i will not leave any corner of the house unvisited nor a soul within it unquestioned ah here they come as he spoke several of the servingmen with some of the female domestics who had been alarmed by the noise rushed into the hall and on seeing it filled with armed men were about to retreat when they were instantly seized and detained a scene of great confusion now ensued the women screamed and cried for mercy while the men struggled and fought with their captors commanding silence at length the pursuivant proclaimed in the kings name that whoever would guide him to the hidingplace of father oldcorne a jesuit priest whom it was known and could be proved was harboured within the mansion should receive a free pardon and reward while those who screened him or connived at his concealment were liable to fine imprisonment and even more severe punishment each servant was then questioned separately but though all were more or less rudely dealt with no information could be elicited meanwhile viviana was a prey to the most intolerable anxiety unable to reach father oldcorne without crossing the hall which she did not dare to attempt she gave him up for lost her sole hope being that on hearing the cries of the domestics he would provide for his own safety her anxiety was still farther increased when the pursuivant having exhausted his patience by fruitless interrogatories and satisfied his malice by frightening two of the females into fits departed with a portion of his band to search the house leaving the rest as a guard over the prisoners viviana then felt that if she would save father oldcorne the attempt must be made without a moments delay and at any hazard watching her opportunity when the troopers were occupiedsome in helping themselves to such viands and liquors as they could lay hands uponsome in searching the persons of the prisoners for amulets and relicswhile others more humane were trying to revive the swooning women she contrived to steal unperceived across the lower end of the hall having gained the passage she found to her horror that the pursuivant and his band were already within the starchamber they were sounding the walls with hammers and mallets and from their exclamations she learnt that they had discovered the retreat behind the fireplace and were about to break it open we have him roared the pursuivant in a voice of triumph the old owls roost is here viviana who stood at the door drew in her breath expecting that the next moment would inform her that the priest was made captive instead of this she was delighted to find from the oaths of rage and disappointment uttered by the troopers that he had eluded them he must be in the house at all events growled the pursuivant nor is it long since he quitted his hidingplace as this cushion proves we will not go away without him and now let us proceed to the upper chambers hearing their footsteps approach viviana darted off and quickly ascending the principal staircase entered a long corridor uncertain what to do she was about to proceed to her own chamber and bar the door when she felt her arm grasped by a man with difficulty repressing a shriek she strove to disengage herself when a whisper told her it was the priest heaven be praised cried viviana you are safe howhow did you escape i flew upstairs on hearing the voices replied oldcorne but what has happened to the steward he is a prisoner replied viviana all then is lost unless you are acquainted with the secret panel he spoke of in the oratory rejoined oldcorne alas father i am wholly ignorant of it she answered but come with me into my chamber they will not dare to invade it i know not that returned the priest despairingly these sacrilegious villains would not respect the sanctity of the altar itself they come cried viviana as lights were seen at the foot of the stairs take my handthis way father they had scarcely gained the room and fastened the door when the pursuivant and his attendants appeared in the corridor the officer it would seem had been well instructed where to search or was sufficiently practised in his duty for he proceeded at once to several hidingplaces in the different chambers which he visited in one room he detected a secret staircase in the wall which he mounted and discovered a small chapel built in the roof stripping it of its altar its statue of the virgin its crucifix pix chalice and other consecrated vessels he descended and continued his search vivianas chamber was now the only one unvisited trying the door and finding it locked he tapped against it with his wand who knocks asked the maiden a statemessenger was the reply i demand entrance in the kings name you cannot have it she replied it is my sleepingchamber my duty allows me no alternative rejoined the pursuivant harshly if you will not admit me quietly i must use force do you know to whom you offer this rudeness returned viviana i am the daughter of sir william radcliffe i know it replied the pursuivant but i am not exceeding my authority i hold a warrant for your fathers arrest and if he had not been from home i should have carried him to prison along with the jesuit priest whom i suspect is concealed within your chamber open the door i command you and do not hinder me in the execution of my duty as no answer was returned to the application the pursuivant commanded his men to burst open the door and the order was promptly obeyed the chamber was empty on searching it however the pursuivant found a door concealed by the hangings of the bed it was bolted on the other side but speedily yielded to his efforts passing through it he entered upon a narrow gallery at the extremity of which his progress was stopped by another door likewise fastened on the further side on bursting it open he entered a small oratory wainscoted with oak and lighted by an oriel window filled with stained glass through which the newlyrisen moon was pouring its full radiance and discovered the object of his search father oldcorne i arrest you as a jesuit and a traitor shouted the pursuivant in a voice of exultation seize him he added calling to his men you shall not take him cried viviana clinging despairingly to the priest who offered no resistance but clasped a crucifix to his breast leave go your hold young mistress rejoined the pursuivant grasping oldcorne by the collar of his vestment and dragging him along and rest thankful that i make you not also my prisoner take me but spare himin mercy spare him shrieked viviana you solicit mercy from one who knows it not daughter observed the priest lead on sir i am ready to attend you your destination is the new fleet father retorted the pursuivant in a tone of bitter raillery unless you prefer the cell in radcliffe hall lately vacated by your saintly predecessor father woodroofe help help shrieked viviana you may spare your voice fair lady sneered the pursuivant no help is at hand your servants are all prisoners the words were scarcely uttered when a sliding panel in the wall flew open and guy fawkes followed by humphrey chetham and another personage sprang through the aperture and presented a petronel at the head of the pursuivant chapter v chat moss the pursuivant was taken so completely unawares by the sudden appearance of guy fawkes and his companions that he made no attempt at resistance nor were his attendants less confounded before they recovered from their surprise humphrey chetham seized viviana in his arms and darting through the panel called to the priest to follow him father oldcorne was about to comply when one of the soldiers grasping the surcingle at his waist dragged him forcibly backwards the next moment however he was set free by guy fawkes who felling the man to the ground and interposing himself between the priest and the other soldier enabled the former to make good his retreat this done he planted himself in front of the panel and with a petronel in each hand menaced his opponents fly for your lives he shouted in a loud voice to the others not a moment is to be lost i have taken greater odds and in a worse cause and have not been worsted heed me not i say i will defend the passage till you are beyond reach of danger flyfly after them vociferated the pursuivant stamping with rage and vexation after them instantly hew down that bold traitor show him no quarter his life is forfeit to the king slay him as you would a dog but the men having no firearms were so much intimidated by the fierce looks of guy fawkes and the deadly weapons he pointed at their heads that they hesitated to obey their leaders injunctions do you hear what i say to you cravens roared the pursuivant cut him down without mercy they dare not move a footstep rejoined guy fawkes in a decisive tone recreants cried the pursuivant foaming with rage is my prey to be snatched from me at the very moment i have secured it through your cowardice obey me instantly or as heaven shall judge me i will denounce you to my lord derby and the commissioners as aiders and abettors in father oldcornes escapeand you well know what your punishment will be if i do so whatare you afraid of one man our pikes are no match for his petronels observed the foremost soldier sullenly they are not rejoined guy fawkes and you will do well not to compel me to prove the truth of your assertion as to you master pursuivant he continued with a look so stern that the other quailed before it unwilling as i am to shed blood i shall hold your life if i am compelled to take it but just retribution for the fate you have brought upon the unfortunate elizabeth orton ha exclaimed the pursuivant starting i thought i recognised you you are the soldier in the spanish garb who saved that false prophetess from drowning i saved her only for a more lingering death rejoined guy fawkes i know it retorted the pursuivant i found her dead body when i visited her cell on my way hither and gave orders to have it interred without coffin or shroud in that part of the burialground of the collegiate church in manchester reserved for common felons i know not what stays my hand rejoined guy fawkes fiercely but i am strongly tempted to give you a grave beside her i will put your daring to the proof cried the pursuivant snatching a pike from one of his followers and brandishing it over his head throw down your arms or you die back exclaimed guy fawkes presenting a petronel at him or i lodge a bullet in your brain be advised by me and rush not on certain destruction good master pursuivant said the foremost soldier plucking his mantle i see by his bloodthirsty looks that the villain is in earnest i hear footsteps cried the other soldier our comrades are at hand then it is time for me to depart cried guy fawkes springing through the secret door and closing it after him confusion exclaimed the pursuivant but he shall not escape break open the panel the order was promptly obeyed the men battered the stout oak board which was of great thickness with their pikes but it resisted every effort nor was it until the arrival of a fresh band of soldiers with lights mallets chisels and other implements suitable to the purpose that it could be forced open this accomplished the pursuivant commanding his attendants to follow him dashed through the aperture as they proceeded singly along the narrow passage the roof became so low that they were compelled to adopt a stooping posture in this manner they hurried on until their further progress was stopped by a massive stone door which appeared to descend from above by some hidden contrivance no trace of bolt or other fastening being discernible the flag fitted closely in channels in the walls and had all the appearance of solid masonry after examining this obstacle for a moment the pursuivant was convinced that any attempt to move it would be impracticable and muttering a deep execration he gave the word to return from the course it appears to take he observed this passage must communicate with the gardenperhaps with the further side of the moat we may yet secure them if we use despatch to return to the fugitives on arriving at the point where the stone door was situated which he discovered by the channels in the wall abovementioned guy fawkes searched for an iron ring and having found it drew it towards him and the ponderous flag slowly dropped into its place he then groped his way cautiously along in the dark until his foot encountered the top of a ladder down which he crept and landed on the floor of a damp deep vault having taken the precaution to remove the ladder he hastened onwards for about fifty yards when he came to a steep flight of stone steps distinguishable by a feeble glimmer of light from above and mounting them emerged through an open trapdoor into a small building situated at the western side of the moat where to his surprise and disappointment he found the other fugitives how comes it you are here he exclaimed in a reproachful tone i kept the wolves at bay thus long to enable you to make good your retreat miss radcliffe is too weak to move replied humphrey chetham and i could not persuade father oldcorne to leave her i care not what becomes of me said the priest the sooner my painful race is run the better but i cannotwill not abandon my dear charge thus think not of me father i implore you rejoined viviana who had sunk overpowered with terror and exhaustion i shall be better soon master chetham i am assured will remain with me till our enemies have departed and i will then return to the hall command me as you please miss radcliffe replied humphrey chetham you have but to express a wish to insure its fulfilment on my part oh that you had suffered mr catesby to tarry with us till the morning as he himself proposed dear daughter observed the priest turning to viviana has catesby been here inquired guy fawkes with a look of astonishment he has replied oldcorne he came to warn us that the hall would be this night searched by the officers of state and he also brought word that a warrant had been issued by the privy council for the arrest of sir william radcliffe where is he now demanded fawkes hastily on the way to chester whither he departed in all haste at vivianas urgent request to apprise her father of his danger rejoined the priest this is strange muttered guy fawkes catesby here and i not know it he had a secret motive for his visit my son whispered oldcorne significantly so i conclude father replied fawkes in the same tone viviana radcliffe murmured humphrey chetham in low and tender accents something tells me that this moment will decide my future fate emboldened by the mysterious manner in which we have been brought together and you as it were have been thrown upon my protection i venture to declare the passion i have long indulged for youa passion which though deep and fervent as ever agitated human bosom has hitherto from the difference of our rank and yet more from the difference of our religious opinions been without hope what has just occurredadded to the peril in which your worthy father stands and the difficulties in which you yourself will necessarily be involvedmakes me cast aside all misgiving and perhaps with too much presumption but with a confident belief that the sincerity of my love renders me not wholly undeserving of your regard earnestly solicit you to give me a husbands right to watch over and defend you viviana was silent but even by the imperfect light the young merchant could discern that her cheek was covered with blushes your answer he cried taking her hand you must take it from my lips master chetham interposed the priest viviana radcliffe never can be yours be pleased to let her speak for herself reverend sir rejoined the young merchant angrily i represent her father and have acquainted you with his determination rejoined the priest appeal to her and she will confirm my words viviana is this true asked chetham does your father object to your union with me viviana answered by a deep sigh and gently withdrew her hand from the young merchants grasp then there is no hope for me cried chetham alas no replied viviana nor for meof earthly affection i am already dead to the world how so he asked i am about to vow myself to heaven she answered viviana exclaimed the young man throwing himself at her feet reflectoh reflect before you take this fatalthis irrevocable step rise sir interposed the priest sternly you plead in vain sir william radcliffe will never wed his daughter to a heretic in his name i command you to desist from further solicitation i obey replied chetham rising we lose time here observed guy fawkes who had been lost for a moment in reflection i will undertake to provide for your safety father but what must be done with viviana she cannot be left here and her return to the hall would be attended with danger i will not return till the miscreants have quitted it said viviana their departure is uncertain replied fawkes when they are baulked of their prey they sometimes haunt a dwelling for weeks what will become of me cried viviana distractedly it were vain i fear to entreat you to accept an asylum with my father at clayton hall or at my own residence at crumpsall said humphrey chetham your offer is most kind sir replied oldcorne and is duly appreciated but viviana will see the proprietyon every accountof declining it i do i do she acquiesced will you entrust yourself to my protection observed fawkes willingly replied the priest answering for her we shall find some place of refuge he added turning to viviana where your father can join us and where we can remain concealed till this storm has blown over i know many such rejoined fawkes both in this county and in yorkshire and will guide you to one my horses are at your service said humphrey chetham they are tied beneath the trees in the avenue my servant shall bring them to the door and turning to his attendant he gave him directions to that effect i was riding hither an hour before midnight he continued addressing viviana to offer you assistance having accidentally heard the pursuivant mention his meditated visit to ordsall hall to one of his followers when as i approached the gates this person pointing to guy fawkes crossed my path and seizing the bridle of my steed demanded whether i was a friend to sir william radcliffe i answered in the affirmative and desired to know the motive of his inquiry he then told me that the house was invested by a numerous band of armed men who had crossed the moat by means of a plank and were at that moment concealed within the garden this intelligence besides filling me with alarm disconcerted all my plans as i hoped to have been beforehand with themtheir inquisitorial searches being generally made at a late hour when all the inmates of a house intended to be surprised are certain to have retired to rest while i was bitterly reproaching myself for my dilatoriness and considering what course it would be best to pursue my servant martin heydocke son to your fathers old steward who had ridden up at the strangers approach informed me that he was acquainted with a secret passage communicating beneath the moat with the hall upon this i dismounted and fastening my horse to a tree ordered him to lead me to it without an instants delay the stranger who gave his name as guy fawkes and professed himself a stanch catholic and a friend of father oldcorne begged permission to join us in a tone so earnest that i at once acceded to his request we then proceeded to this building and after some search discovered the trapdoor much time was lost owing to our being unprovided with lights in the subterranean passage and it was more than two hours before we could find the ring connected with the stone door the mystery of which martin explained to us this delay we feared would render our scheme abortive when just as we reached the panel we heard your shrieks the spring was touched andyou know the rest and shall never forget it replied viviana in a tone of the deepest gratitude at this juncture the tramp of horses was heard at the door and the next moment it was thrown open by the younger heydocke who with a look and in a voice of the utmost terror exclaimed they are comingthey are coming the pursuivant cried guy fawkes not him alone but the whole gang rejoined martin some of them are lowering the drawbridge while others are crossing the plank several are on horseback and i think i discern the pursuivant amongst the number they have seen me and are hurrying in this direction as he spoke a loud shout corroborated his statement we are lost exclaimed oldcorne do not despair father rejoined guy fawkes heaven will not abandon its faithful servants the lord will deliver us out of the hands of these amalekites to horse then if you would indeed avoid them urged humphrey chetham the shouts grow louder your enemies are fast approaching viviana said guy fawkes are you willing to fly with us i will do anything rather than be left to those horrible men she answered guy fawkes then raised her in his arms and sprang with his lovely burthen upon the nearest charger his example was quickly followed by humphrey chetham who vaulting on the other horse assisted the priest to mount behind him while this took place martin heydocke darted into the shed and instantly bolted the door it was a beautiful moonlight night almost as bright as day and the movements of each party were fully revealed to the other guy fawkes perceived at a glance that they were surrounded and though he had no fears for himself he was full of apprehension for the safety of his companion while he was debating with himself as to the course it would be best to pursue humphrey chetham shouted to him to turn to the left and started off in that direction grasping his fair charge whom he had placed before him on the saddle firmly with his left arm and wrapping her in his ample cloak guy fawkes drew his sword and striking spurs into his steed followed in the same track the little fabric which had afforded them temporary shelter it has already been mentioned was situated on the west of the hall at a short distance from the moat and was screened from observation by a small shrubbery no sooner did the fugitives emerge from this cover than loud outcries were raised by their antagonists and every effort was made to intercept them on the right galloping towards them on a light but swift courser taken from sir william radcliffes stables came the pursuivant attended by halfadozen troopers who had accommodated themselves with horses in the same manner as their leader between them and the road leading to manchester were stationed several armed men on foot at the rear voices proclaimed that others were in full pursuit while in front a fourth detachment menaced them with their pikes thus beset on all sides it seemed scarcely possible to escape nothing daunted however by the threats and vociferations with which they were received the two horsemen boldly charged this party the encounter was instantaneous guy fawkes warded off a blow which if it had taken effect must have robbed viviana of life and struck down the fellow who aimed it at the same moment his career was checked by another assailant who catching his bridle with the hook of his pike commanded him to surrender fawkes replied by cleaving the mans staff asunder and having thus disembarrassed himself was about to pursue his course when he perceived that humphrey chetham was in imminent danger from a couple of soldiers who had stopped him and were trying to unhorse his companion riding up to them guy fawkes by a vigorous and welldirected attack speedily drove them off and the fugitives being now unimpeded were enabled to continue their career the foregoing occurrences were witnessed by the pursuivant with the utmost rage and vexation pouring forth a torrent of threats and imprecations he swore he would never rest till he had secured them and urging his courser to its utmost speed commanded his men to give chase skirting a sluice communicating between the irwell and the moat humphrey chetham who as better acquainted with the country than his companions took the lead proceeded along its edge for about a hundred yards when he suddenly struck across a narrow bridge covered with sod and entered the open fields hitherto viviana had remained silent though fully aware of the risk she had run she gave no sign of alarmnot even when the blow was aimed against her life and it was only on conceiving the danger in some degree past that she ventured to express her gratitude you have displayed so much courage said guy fawkes in answer to her speech that it would be unpardonable to deceive you our foes are too near us and too well mounted to make it by any means certain we shall escape themunless by stratagem they are within a hundred yards of us cried humphrey chetham glancing fearfully backwards they have possessed themselves of your fathers fleetest horses and if i mistake not the rascally pursuivant has secured your favourite barb my gentle zayda exclaimed viviana then indeed we are lost she has not her match for speed if she bring her rider to us alone she will do us good service observed guy fawkes significantly the same notion almost at the same moment occurred to the pursuivant having witnessed the prowess displayed by guy fawkes in his recent attack on the soldiers he felt no disposition to encounter so formidable an opponent singlehanded and finding that the highmettled barb on which he was mounted by its superior speed and fiery temper would inevitably place him in such a dilemma he prudently resolved to halt and exchange it for a more manageable steed this delay was of great service to the fugitives and enabled them to get considerably ahead they had now gained a narrow lane and tracking it speedily reached the rocky banks of the irwell galloping along a footpath that followed the serpentine course of the stream for a quarter of a mile they arrived at a spot marked by a bed of osiers where humphrey chetham informed them there was a ford accordingly they plunged into the river and while stemming the current which here ran with great swiftness and rose up above the saddles the neighing of a steed was heard from the bank they had quitted turning at the sound viviana beheld her favourite courser on the summit of a high rock the soldier to whom zayda was intrusted had speedily as the pursuivant foresaw distanced his companions and chose this elevated position to take sure aim at guy fawkes against whom he was now levelling a caliver the next moment a bullet struck against his brigandine but without doing him any injury the soldier however did not escape so lightly startled by the discharge the fiery barb leaped from the precipice into the river and throwing her rider who was borne off by the rapid stream swam towards the opposite bank which she reached just as the others were landing at the sound of her mistresss voice she stood still and allowed humphrey chetham to lay hold of her bridle and viviana declaring she was able to mount her guy fawkes who felt that such an arrangement was most likely to conduce to her safety and who was moreover inclined to view the occurrence as a providential interference in their behalf immediately assisted her into the saddle before this transfer could be effected the pursuivant and his attendants had begun to ford the stream the former had witnessed the accident that had befallen the soldier from a short distance and while he affected to deplore it internally congratulated himself on his prudence and foresight but he was by no means so well satisfied when he saw how it served to benefit the fugitives that unlucky beast he exclaimed some fiend must have prompted me to bring her out of the stable would she had drowned herself instead of poor dickon duckesbury whom she hath sent to feed the fishes with her aid miss radcliffe will doubtless escape no matter if i secure father oldcorne and that blackvisaged trooper in the spanish garb who ill be sworn is a secret intelligencer of the pope if not of the devil i shall be well contented ill hang them both on a gibbet higher than hamans and muttering other threats to the same effect he picked his way to the opposite shore long before he reached it the fugitives had disappeared but on climbing the bank he beheld them galloping swiftly across a wellwooded district steeped in moonlight and spread out before his view and inflamed by the sight he shouted to his attendants and once more started in pursuit cheered by the fortunate incident above related which in presenting her with her own steed in a manner so surprising and unexpected seemed almost to give her assurance of deliverance viviana inspirited by the exercise felt her strength and spirits rapidly revive at her side rode guy fawkes who ever and anon cast an anxious look behind to ascertain the distance of their pursuers but suffered no exclamation to escape his lips indeed throughout the whole affair he maintained the reserve belonging to his sombre and taciturn character and neither questioned humphrey chetham as to where he was leading them nor proposed any deviation from the route he had apparently chosen to such remarks as were addressed to him fawkes answered in monosyllables and it was only when occasion required that he volunteered any observation or advice he seemed to surrender himself to chance and perhaps if his bosom could have been examined it would have been found that he considered himself a mere puppet in the hands of destiny in other and calmer seasons he might have dwelt with rapture on the beautiful and varied country through which they were speeding and which from every knoll they mounted every slope they descended every glade they threaded intricacy pierced or tangled dell tracked presented new and increasing attractions this charming district since formed into a park by the traffords from whom it derives its present designation was at this timethough part of the domain of that ancient familywholly unenclosed old trafford hall lies for it is still in existence more than a mile nearer to manchester a little to the east of ordsall hall but the modern residence of the family is situated in the midst of the lovely region through which the fugitives were riding but though the charms of the scene heightened by the gentle medium through which they were viewed produced little effect upon the iron nature of guy fawkes they were not without influence on his companions especially viviana soothed by the stillness of all around her she almost forgot her danger and surrendering herself to the dreamy enjoyment generally experienced in contemplating such a scene at such an hour suffered her gaze to wander over the fair woody landscape before her till it was lost in the distant moonlit wolds from the train of thought naturally awakened by this spectacle she was roused by the shouts of the pursuers and glancing timorously behind her beheld them hurrying swiftly along the valley they had just quitted from the rapidity with which they were advancing it was evident they were gaining upon them and she was about to urge her courser to greater speed when humphrey chetham laid his hand upon the rein to check her reserve yourself till we gain the brow of this hill he remarked and then put zayda to her mettle we are not far from our destination indeed exclaimed viviana where is it i will show it to you presently he answered arrived at the summit of the high ground which they had been for some time gradually ascending the young merchant pointed out a vast boggy tract about two miles off in the vale beneath them that is our destination he said did i not hold it impossible you could trifle with me at such a time as this i should say you were jesting rejoined viviana the place you indicate unless i mistake you is chat moss the largest and most dangerous marsh in lancashire you do not mistake me neither am i jesting viviana replied the young merchant gravely chat moss is the mark at which i aim if we are to cross it we shall need a willothewisp to guide us and some friendly elf to make firm the ground beneath our steeds rejoined viviana in a slightlysarcastic tone trust to me and you shall traverse it in safety resumed humphrey chetham i would sooner trust myself to the pursuivant and his band than venture upon its treacherous surface she replied how is this young sir interposed guy fawkes sternly is it from heedlessness or rashness that you are about to expose us to this new dangerwhich if viviana judges correctly and my own experience of such places inclines me to think she does sois greater than that which now besets us if there is any danger i shall be the first to encounter it for i propose to act as your guide returned humphrey chetham in an offended tone but the treacherous character of the marsh constitutes our safety i am acquainted with a narrow path across it from which the deviation of a foot will bring certain death if our pursuers attempt to follow us their destruction is inevitable viviana may rest assured i would not needlessly expose so dear a life as hers but it is our best chance of safety humphrey chetham is in the right observed the priest i have heard of the path he describes and if he can guide us along it we shall effectually baffle our enemies i cry you mercy sir said viviana i did not apprehend your meaning but i now thankfully resign myself to your care forward then cried the young merchant and they dashed swiftly down the declivity chat moss towards which they were hastening though now drained in part cultivated and traversed by the busiest and mostfrequented railroad in england or the world was within the recollection of many of the youngest of the present generation a dreary and almost impassable waste surveyed from the heights of dunham whence the writer has often gazed upon it envying the plover her wing to skim over its broad expanse it presented with its black boggy soil striped like a motley garment with patches of grey tawny and dunnish red a singular and mysterious appearance conjecture fixes this morass as the site of a vast forest whose immemorial and druidhaunted groves were burnt by the roman invaders and seeks to account for its present condition by supposing that the charred treesstill frequently found within its depthsbeing left where the conflagration had placed them had choked up its brooks and springs and so reduced it to a general swamp drayton however in the following lines from the faerie land places its origin as far back as the deluge great chat moss at my fall lies fall of turf and marl her unctuous mineral and blocks as black as pitch with boring augers found there at the general flood supposed to be drownd but the former hypothesis appears the more probable a curious description of chat moss as it appeared at the time of this history is furnished by camden who terms it a swampy tract of great extent a considerable part of which was carried off in the last age by swollen rivers with great danger whereby the rivers were infected and great quantities of fish died instead thereof is now a valley watered by a small stream and many trees were discovered thrown down and lying flat so that one may suppose when the ground lay neglected and the waste water of brooks was not drained off into the open valleys or their courses stopped by neglect or desolation all the lower grounds were turned into swamps which we call mosses or into pools if this was the case no wonder so many trees are found covered and as it were buried in such places all over england but especially here for the roots being loosened by too excessive wet they must necessarily fall down and sink in so soft a soil the people hereabouts search for them with poles and spits and after marking the place dig them up and use them for firing for they are like torches equally fit to burn and to give light which is probably owing to the bituminous earth that surrounds them whence the common people suppose them firs though caesar denies that there were such trees in britain but though vast masses of the bog had been carried off by the irwell and the mersey as related by camden the general appearance of the wastewith the exception of the valley and the small streamwas much the same as it continued to our own time its surface was more broken and irregular and black gaping chasms and pits filled with water and slime as darkcoloured as the turf whence it flowed pointed out the spots where the swollen and heaving swamp had burst its bondage narrow paths known only to the poor turfcutters and other labourers who dwelt upon its borders and gathered fuel with poles and spits in the manner above described intersected it at various points but as they led in many cases to dangerous and deep gulfs to dismal quagmires and fathomless pits and moreover as the slightest departure from the proper track would have whelmed the traveller in an oozy bed from which as from a quicksand he would have vainly striven to extricate himselfit was never crossed without a guide except by those familiar with its perilous courses one painful circumstance connected with the history of chat moss remains to be recordednamely that the attempt made to cultivate it by the great historian roscoean attempt since carried out as has already been shown with complete successended in a result ruinous to the fortunes of that highlygifted person who up to the period of this luckless undertaking was as prosperous as he was meritorious by this time the fugitives had approached the confines of the marsh an accident however had just occurred which nearly proved fatal to viviana and owing to the delay it occasioned brought their pursuers into dangerous proximity with them in fording the irwell which from its devious course they were again compelled to cross about a quarter of a mile below barton her horse missed its footing and precipitated her into the rapid current in another instant she would have been borne away if guy fawkes had not flung himself into the water and seized her before she sank her affrighted steed having got out of its depth began to swim off and it required the utmost exertion on the part of humphrey chetham embarrassed as he was by the priest to secure it in a few minutes all was set to rights and viviana was once more placed on the saddle without having sustained further inconvenience than was occasioned by her dripping apparel but those few minutes as has been just stated sufficed to bring the pursuivant and his men close upon them and as they scrambled up the opposite bank the plunging and shouting behind them told that the latter had entered the stream yonder is baysnape exclaimed humphrey chetham calling vivianas attention to a ridge of high ground on the borders of the waste below it lies the path by which i propose to enter the moss we shall speedily be out of the reach of our enemies the marsh at least will hide us answered viviana with a shudder it is a terrible alternative fear nothing dear daughter observed the priest the saints who have thus marvellously protected us will continue to watch over us to the end and will make the path over yon perilous waste as safe as the ground on which we tread i like not the appearance of the sky observed guy fawkes looking uneasily upwards before we reach the spot you have pointed out the moon will be obscured will it be safe to traverse the moss in the dark it is our only chance replied the young merchant speaking in a low tone that his answer might not reach vivianas ears and after all the darkness may be serviceable our pursuers are so near that if it were less gloomy they might hit upon the right track it will be a risk to us to proceed but certain destruction to those who follow and now let us make what haste we can every moment is precious the dreary and fast darkening waste had now opened upon them in all its horrors far as the gaze could reach appeared an immense expanse flat almost as the surface of the ocean and unmarked so far as could be discerned in that doubtful light by any trace of human footstep or habitation it was a stern and sombre prospect and calculated to inspire terror in the stoutest bosom what effect it produced on viviana may be easily conjectured but her nature was brave and enduring and though she trembled so violently as scarcely to be able to keep her seat she gave no utterance to her fears they were now skirting that part of the morass since denominated from the unfortunate speculation previously alluded to roscoes improvements this tract was the worst and most dangerous portion of the whole moss soft slabby and unsubstantial its treacherous beds scarcely offered secure footing to the heron that alighted on them the ground shook beneath the fugitives as they hurried past the edge of the groaning and quivering marsh the plover scared from its nest uttered its peculiar and plaintive cry the bittern shrieked other nightfowl poured forth their doleful notes and the bullfrog added its deep croak to the ominous concert behind them came the thundering tramp and loud shouts of their pursuers guy fawkes had judged correctly before they reached baysnape the moon had withdrawn behind a rack of clouds and it had become profoundly dark arrived at this point humphrey chetham called to them to turn off to the right follow singly he said and do not swerve a hairs breadth from the path the slightest deviation will be fatal do you sir he added to the priest mount behind guy fawkes and let viviana come next after me if i should miss my way do not stir for your life the transfer effected the fugitives turned off to the right and proceeded at a cautious pace along a narrow and shaking path the ground trembled so much beneath them and their horses feet sank so deeply in the plashy bog that viviana demanded in a tone of some uneasiness if he was sure he had taken the right course if i had not replied humphrey chetham we should ere this have found our way to the bottom of the morass as he spoke a floundering plunge accompanied by a horrible and quicklystifled cry told that one of their pursuers had perished in endeavouring to follow them the poor wretch is gone to his account observed viviana in a tone of commiseration have a carehave a care lest you share the same fate if i can save you i care not what becomes of me replied the young merchant since i can never hope to possess you life has become valueless in my eyes quicken your pace shouted guy fawkes who brought up the rear our pursuers have discovered the track and are making towards us let them do so replied the young merchant they can do us no farther injury that is false cried the voice of a soldier from behind and as the words were uttered a shot was fired which though aimed against chetham took effect upon his steed the animal staggered and his rider had only time to slide from his back when he reeled off the path and was ingulfed in the marsh hearing the plunge of the steed the man fancied he had hit his mark and hallooed in an exulting voice to his companions but his triumph was of short duration a ball from the petronel of guy fawkes pierced his brain and dropping from his saddle he sank together with his horse which he dragged along with him into the quagmire waste no more shot cried humphrey chetham the swamp will fight our battles for us though i grieve for the loss of my horse i may be better able to guide you on foot with this he seized vivianas bridle and drew her steed along at a quick pace but with the greatest caution as they proceeded a light like that of a lantern was seen to rise from the earth and approach them heaven be praised exclaimed viviana some one has heard us and is hastening to our assistance not so replied humphrey chetham the light you behold is an ignis fatuus were you to trust yourself to its delusive gleam it would lead you to the most dangerous parts of the moss and as if to exhibit its real character the little flame which hitherto had burnt as brightly and steadily as a waxcandle suddenly appeared to dilate and assuming a purple tinge emitted a shower of sparks and then flitted rapidly over the plain woe to him that follows it cried humphrey chetham it has a strange unearthly look observed viviana crossing herself i have much difficulty in persuading myself it is not the work of some malignant sprite it is only an exhalation of the marsh replied chetham but see others are at hand their approach indeed seemed to have disturbed all the weird children of the waste lights were seen trooping towards them in every direction sometimes stopping sometimes rising in the air now contracting now expanding and when within a few yards of the travellers retreating with inconceivable swiftness it is a marvellous and incomprehensible spectacle remarked viviana the common folk hereabouts affirm that these jackolanterns as they term them always appear in greater numbers when some direful catastrophe is about to take place rejoined the young merchant heaven avert it from us ejaculated viviana it is an idle superstition returned chetham but we must now keep silence he continued lowering his voice and stopping near the charred stump of a tree left it would seem as a mark the road turns here and unless our pursuers know it we shall now quit them for ever we must not let a sound betray the course we are about to take having turned this dangerous corner in safety and conducted his companions as noiselessly as possible for a few yards along the cross path which being much narrower was consequently more perilous than the first humphrey chetham stood still and imposing silence upon the others listened to the approach of their pursuers his prediction was speedily and terribly verified hearing the movement in advance but unable to discover the course taken by the fugitives the unfortunate soldiers fearful of losing their prey quickened their pace in the expectation of instantly overtaking them they were fatally undeceived four only of their number besides their leader remainedtwo having perished in the manner heretofore described the first of these disregarding the caution of his comrade laughingly urged his horse into a gallop and on passing the mark sunk as if by magic and before he could utter a single warning cry into the depths of the morass his disappearance was so instantaneous that the next in order though he heard the sullen plunge was unable to draw in the rein and was likewise ingulfed a third followed and a fourth in his efforts to avoid their fate backed his steed over the slippery edge of the path only one now remained it was the pursuivant who with the prudence that characterized all his proceedings had followed in the rear he was so dreadfully frightened that adding his shrieks to those of his attendants he shouted to the fugitives imploring assistance in the most piteous terms and promising never again to molest them if they would guide him to a place of safety but his cries were wholly unheeded and he perhaps endured in those few minutes of agony as much suffering as he had inflicted on the numerous victims of his barbarity it was indeed an appalling moment three of the wretched men had not yet sunk but were floundering about in the swamp and shrieking for help the horses as much terrified as their riders added their piercing cries to the halfsuffocated yells and as if to make the scene more ghastly myriads of dancing lights flitted towards them and throwing an unearthly glimmer over this part of the morass fully revealed their struggling figures moved by compassion for the poor wretches viviana implored humphrey chetham to assist them and finding him immovable she appealed to guy fawkes they are beyond all human aid the latter replied heaven have mercy on their souls ejaculated the priest pray for them dear daughter pray heartily as i am about to do and he recited in an audible voice the romish formula of supplication for those in extremis averting her gaze from the spectacle viviana joined fervently in the prayer by this time two of the strugglers had disappeared the third having freed himself from his horse contrived for some moments during which he uttered the most frightful cries to keep his head above the swamp his efforts were tremendous but unavailing and served only to accelerate his fate making a last desperate plunge towards the bank where the fugitives were standing he sank above the chin the expression of his face shown by the ghastly glimmer of the fenfires as he was gradually swallowed up was horrible requiem aeternam dona eis domine exclaimed the priest all is over cried humphrey chetham taking the bridle of vivianas steed and leading her onwards we are free from our pursuers there is one left she rejoined casting a look backwards it is the pursuivant returned guy fawkes sternly he is within shot he added drawing his petronel oh nonoin pity spare him cried viviana too many lives have been sacrificed already he is the cause of all the mischief answered guy fawkes unwillingly replacing the petronel in his belt and may live to injure you and your father i will hope not rejoined viviana but spare himoh spare him be it as you please replied guy fawkes the marsh i trust will not be so merciful with this they slowly resumed their progress on hearing their departure the pursuivant renewed his cries in a more piteous tone than ever but in spite of the entreaties of viviana nothing could induce her companions to lend him assistance for some time they proceeded in silence and without accident as they advanced the difficulties of the path increased and it was fortunate that the moon emerging from the clouds in which up to this moment she had been shrouded enabled them to steer their course in safety at length after a tedious and toilsome march for nearly half a mile the footing became more secure the road widened and they were able to quicken their pace another half mile landed them upon the western bank of the morass vivianas first impulse was to give thanks to heaven for their deliverance nor did she omit in her prayer a supplication for the unfortunate beings who had perished arrived at the point now known as rawson nook they entered a lane and proceeded towards astley green where perceiving a cluster of thatched cottages among the trees they knocked at the door of the first and speedily obtained admittance from its inmates a turfcutter and his wife the man conveyed their steeds to a neighbouring barn while the good dame offered viviana such accommodation and refreshment as her humble dwelling afforded here they tarried till the following evening as much to recruit miss radcliffes strength as for security at the young merchants request the turfcutter went in the course of the day to see what had become of the pursuivant he was nowhere to be found but he accidentally learned from another hind who followed the same occupation as himself that a person answering to the officers description had been seen to emerge from the moss near baysnape at daybreak and take the road towards manchester of the unfortunate soldiers nothing but a steel cap and a pike which the man brought away with him could be discovered after much debate it was decided that their safest plan would be to proceed to manchester where humphrey chetham undertook to procure them safe lodgings at the seven starsan excellent hostel kept by a worthy widow who he affirmed would do anything to serve him accordingly they set out at nightfallviviana taking her place before guy fawkes and relinquishing zayda to the young merchant and the priest shaping their course through worsley by monton green and pendleton they arrived in about an hour within sight of the town which thennot a tithe of its present size and unpolluted by the smoky atmosphere in which it is now constantly envelopedwas not without some pretensions to a picturesque appearance crossing salford bridge they mounted smithybank as it was then termed and proceeding along cateatonstreet and hanging ditch struck into whithing now withy grove at the right of which just where a few houses were beginning to straggle up shude hill stood and still stands the comfortable hostel of the seven stars here they stopped and were warmly welcomed by its buxom mistress dame sutcliffe muffled in guy fawkess cloak the priest gained the chamber to which he was ushered unobserved and dame sutcliffe though her protestant notions were a little scandalized at her dwelling being made the sanctuary of a popish priest promised at the instance of master chetham whom she knew to be no favourer of idolatry in a general way to be answerable for his safety chapter vi the disinterment having seen every attention shown to viviana by the hostesswho as soon as she discovered that she had the daughter of sir william radcliffe of ordsall under her roof bestirred herself in right earnest for her accommodationhumphrey chetham notwithstanding the lateness of the hourit was past midnightexpressed his determination to walk to his residence at crumpsall to put an end to any apprehension which might be entertained by the household at his prolonged absence with this view he set forth and guy fawkes who seemed to be meditating some project which he was unwilling to disclose to the others quitted the hostel with him bidding the chamberlain sit up for him as he should speedily return they had not gone far when he inquired the nearest way to the collegiate church and was answered that they were then proceeding towards it and in a few moments should arrive at its walls he next asked the young merchant whether he could inform him which part of the churchyard was allotted to criminals humphrey chetham somewhat surprised by the question replied at the northwest near the charnel adding i shall pass within a short distance of the spot and will point it out to you entering fennel street at the end of which stood an ancient cross they soon came in sight of the church the moon was shining brightly and silvered the massive square tower of the fane the battlements pinnacles buttresses and noble eastern window with its gorgeous tracery while guy fawkes paused for a moment to contemplate this reverend and beautiful structure two venerable personages having long snowy beards and wrapped in flowing mantles edged with sable fur passed the end of the street one of them carried a lantern though it was wholly needless as it was bright as day and as they glided stealthily along there was something so mysterious in their manner that it greatly excited the curiosity of guy fawkes who inquired from his companion if he knew who they were the foremost is the warden of manchester the famous doctor dee replied humphrey chetham divine mathematician astrologerand if report speaks truly conjuror is that doctor dee cried guy fawkes in astonishment it is replied the young merchant and the other in the polish cap is the noless celebrated edward kelley the doctors assistant or as he is ordinarily termed his seer they have entered the churchyard remarked guy fawkes i will follow them i would not advise you to do so rejoined the other strange tales are told of them you may witness that it is not safe to look upon the caution however was unheeded guy fawkes had already disappeared and the young merchant shrugging his shoulders proceeded on his way towards hunts bank on gaining the churchyard guy fawkes perceived the warden and his companion creeping stealthily beneath the shadow of a wall in the direction of a low fabric which appeared to be a bonehouse or charnel situated at the northwestern extremity of the church before this building grew a black and stunted yewtree arrived at it they paused and looked round to see whether they were observed they did not however notice guy fawkes who had concealed himself behind a buttress kelley then unlocked the door of the charnel and brought out a pickaxe and mattock having divested himself of his cloak he proceeded to shovel out the mould from a newmade grave at a little distance from the building doctor dee stood by and held the lantern for his assistant determined to watch their proceedings guy fawkes crept towards the yewtree behind which he ensconced himself kelley meanwhile continued to ply his spade with a vigour that seemed almost incomprehensible in one so far stricken in years and of such infirm appearance at length he paused and kneeling within the shallow grave endeavoured to drag something from it doctor dee knelt to assist him after some exertion they drew forth the corpse of a female which had been interred without coffin and apparently in the habiliments worn during life a horrible suspicion crossed guy fawkes resolving to satisfy his doubts at once he rushed forward and beheld in the ghastly lineaments of the dead the features of the unfortunate prophetess elizabeth orton chapter vii doctor dee how now ye impious violators of the tomb ye worse than faminestricken wolves that rake up the dead in churchyards cried guy fawkes in a voice of thunder to doctor dee and his companion who startled by his sudden appearance dropped the body and retreated to a short distance what devilish rites are ye about to enact that ye thus profane the sanctity of the grave illustration guy fawkes discovers doctor dee edward kelley disintering the body of elizabeth orton and who art thou that darest thus to interrupt us demanded dee sternly it matters not rejoined fawkes striding towards them suffice it you are both known to me you john dee warden of manchester who deserve to be burnt at the stake for your damnable practices rather than hold the sacred office you fill and you edward kelley his associate who boast of familiar intercourse with demons and unless fame belies you have purchased the intimacy at the price of your souls salvation i know you both i know also whose body you have disinterredit is that of the illfated prophetess elizabeth orton and if you do not instantly restore it to the grave whence you have snatched it i will denounce you to the authorities of the town knowing thus much you should know still more retorted doctor dee namely that i am not to be lightly provoked you have no power to quit the churchyardnay not so much as to move a limb without my permission as he spoke he drew from beneath his cloak a small phial the contents of which he sprinkled over the intruder its effect was wonderful and instantaneous the limbs of guy fawkes stiffened where he stood his hand remained immovably fixed upon the pommel of his sword and he seemed transformed into a marble statue you will henceforth acknowledge and respect my power he continued were it my pleasure i could bury you twenty fathoms deep in the earth beneath our feet or by invoking certain spirits convey you to the summit of yon lofty tower pointing to the church and hurl you from it headlong but i content myself with depriving you of motion and leave you in possession of sight and speech that you may endure the torture of witnessing what you cannot prevent so saying he was about to return to the corpse with kelley when guy fawkes exclaimed in a hollow voice set me free and i will instantly depart will you swear never to divulge what you have seen demanded dee pausing solemnly he replied i will trust you then rejoined the doctorthe rather that your presence interferes with my purpose taking a handful of loose earth from an adjoining grave and muttering a few words that sounded like a charm he scattered it over fawkes the spell was instantly broken a leaden weight seemed to be removed from his limbs his joints regained their suppleness and with a convulsive start like that by which a dreamer casts off a nightmare he was liberated from his preternatural thraldom and now begone cried doctor dee authoritatively suffer me to tarry with you a few moments said guy fawkes in a deferential tone heretofore i will freely admit i regarded you as an impostor but now i am convinced you are deeply skilled in the occult sciences and would fain consult you on the future i have already said that your presence troubles me replied doctor dee but if you will call upon me at the college tomorrow it may be i will give you further proofs of my skill why not now reverend sir urged fawkes the question i would ask is better suited to this dismal spot and witching hour than to daylight and the walls of your study indeed exclaimed dee your name guy fawkes replied the other guy fawkes echoed the doctor starting nay then i guess the nature of the question you would ask am i then known to you reverend sir inquired fawkes uneasily as well as to yourselfnay better answered the doctor bring the lantern hither kelley he continued addressing his companion look he added elevating the light so as to throw it upon the countenance of fawkes it is the very facethe bronzed and stronglymarked featuresthe fierce black eyethe iron frame and foreign garb of the figure we beheld in the showstone it is replied kelley i could have singled him out amid a thousand he looked thus as we tracked his perilous course with his three companions the priest chetham and viviana radcliffe across chat moss how have you learned this cried guy fawkes in amazement by the art that reveals all things answered kelley in proof that your thoughts are known to me observed dee i will tell you the inquiry you would make before it is uttered you would learn whether the enterprise on which you are engaged will succeed i would replied fawkes yet more continued dee i am aware of the nature of the plot and could name to you all connected with it your power is indeed wonderful rejoined fawkes in an altered tone but will you give me the information i require hum muttered dee i am too poor to purchase it proceeded fawkes unless a relic i have brought from spain has any value in your eyes illustration doctor dee in conjunction with his seer edward kelley exhibiting his magical skill to guy fawkes tush exclaimed dee angrily do you suppose i am a common juggler and practise my art for gain by no means reverend sir said fawkes but i would not willingly put you to trouble without evincing my gratitude well then replied dee i will not refuse your request and yet i would caution you to beware how you pry into the future you may repent your rashness when it is too late i have no fear rejoined fawkes let me know the worst enough answered dee and now listen to me that carcass having been placed in the ground without the holy rites of burial being duly performed i have power over it and as the witch of endor called up samuel as is recorded in holy writas erichtho raised up a corpse to reveal to sextus pompeius the event of the pharsalian waras elisha breathed life into the nostrils of the shunamites sonas alcestis was invoked by herculesand as the dead maid was brought back to life by apollonius thyaneusso i by certain powerful incantations will allure the soul of the prophetess for a short space to its former tenement and compel it to answer my questions dare you be present at this ceremony i dare replied fawkes follow me then said dee you will need all your courage muttering a hasty prayer and secretly crossing himself guy fawkes strode after him towards the grave by the doctors directions he with some reluctance assisted kelley to raise the corpse and convey it to the charnel dee followed bearing the lantern and on entering the building closed and fastened the door the chamber in which guy fawkes found himself was in perfect keeping with the horrible ceremonial about to be performed in one corner lay a mouldering heap of skulls bones and other fragments of mortality in the other a pile of broken coffins emptied of their tenants and reared on end but what chiefly attracted his attention was a ghastly collection of human limbs blackened with pitch girded round with iron hoops and hung like meat in a shambles against the wall there were two heads and though the features were scarcely distinguishable owing to the liquid in which they had been immersed they still retained a terrific expression of agony seeing his attention directed to these revolting objects kelley informed him they were the quarters of the two priests who had recently been put to death which had been left there previously to being placed on the churchgates the implements and some part of the attire used by the executioner in his butcherly office were scattered about and mixed with the tools of the sexton while in the centre of the room stood a large wooden frame supported by trestles on this frame stained with blood and smeared with pitch showing the purpose to which it had been recently put the body was placed this done doctor dee set down the lantern beside it and as the light fell upon its livid features sullied with earth and exhibiting traces of decay guy fawkes was so appalled by the sight that he half repented of what he had undertaken noticing his irresolution doctor dee said you may yet retire if you think proper no replied fawkes rousing himself i will go through with it it is well replied dee and he extinguished the light an awful silence now ensued broken only by a low murmur from doctor dee who appeared to be reciting an incantation as he proceeded his tones became louder and his accents those of command suddenly he paused and seemed to await a response but as none was made greatly to the disappointment of guy fawkes whose curiosity notwithstanding his fears was raised to the highest pitch he cried blood is wanting to complete the charm if that is all i will speedily supply the deficiency replied guy fawkes and drawing his rapier he bared his left arm and pricked it deeply with the point of the weapon i bleed now he cried sprinkle the corpse with the ruddy current rejoined doctor dee your commands are obeyed replied fawkes i have placed my hand on its breast and the blood is flowing upon it upon this the doctor began to mutter an incantation in a louder and more authoritative tone than before presently kelley added his voice and they both joined in a sort of chorus but in a jargon wholly unintelligible to guy fawkes all at once a blue flame appeared above their heads and slowly descending settled upon the brow of the corpse lighting up the sunken cavities of the eyes and the discoloured and distorted features the charm works shouted doctor dee she moves she moves exclaimed guy fawkes she is alive take off your hand cried the doctor or mischief may ensue and he again continued his incantation down on your knees he exclaimed at length in a terrible voice the spirit is at hand there was a rushing sound and a stream of dazzling lightning shot down upon the corpse which emitted a hollow groan in obedience to the doctors commands guy fawkes had prostrated himself on the ground but he kept his gaze steadily fixed on the body which to his infinite astonishment slowly arose until it stood erect upon the frame there it remained perfectly motionless with the arms close to the sides and the habiliments torn and dishevelled the blue light still retained its position upon the brow and communicated a horrible glimmer to the features the spectacle was so dreadful that guy fawkes would fain have averted his eyes but he was unable to do so doctor dee and his companion meanwhile continued their invocations until as it seemed to fawkes the lips of the corpse moved and an awful voice exclaimed why have you called me daughter replied doctor dee rising in life thou wert endowed with the gift of prophecy in the grave that which is to come must be revealed to thee we would question thee speak and i will answer replied the corpse interrogate her my son said dee addressing fawkes and be brief for the time is short so long only as that flame burns have i power over her spirit of elizabeth orton cried guy fawkes if indeed thou standest before me and some demon hath not entered thy frame to delude meby all that is holy and by every blessed saint i adjure thee to tell me whether the scheme on which i am now engaged for the advantage of the catholic church will prosper thou art mistaken guy fawkes returned the corpse thy scheme is not for the advantage of the catholic church i will not pause to inquire wherefore continued fawkes but grant that the means are violent and wrongful will the end be successful the end will be death replied the corpse to the tyrantto the oppressors demanded fawkes to the conspirators was the answer ha ejaculated fawkes proceed if you have aught more to ask cried dr dee the flame is expiring shall we restore the fallen religion demanded fawkes but before the words could be pronounced the light vanished and a heavy sound was heard as of the body falling on the frame it is over said doctor dee can you not summon her again asked fawkes in a tone of deep disappointment i had other questions to ask impossible replied the doctor the spirit is fled and will not be recalled we must now commit the body to the earth and this time it shall be more decently interred my curiosity is excitednot satisfied said guy fawkes would it were to occur again it is ever thus replied doctor dee we seek to know that which is interdictedand quench our thirst at a fountain that only inflames our curiosity the more be warned my son you are embarked on a perilous enterprise and if you pursue it it will lead you to certain destruction i cannot retreat rejoined fawkes and would not if i could i am bound by an oath too terrible to be broken i will absolve you of your oath my son said dr dee eagerly you cannot reverend sir replied fawkes by no sophistry could i clear my conscience of the ties imposed upon it i have sworn never to desist from the execution of this scheme unless those engaged in it shall give me leave nay so resolved am i that if i stood alone i would go on as he spoke a deep groan issued from the corpse you are again warned my son said dee come forth said guy fawkes rushing towards the door and throwing it open this place stifles me the night has already been described as bright and beautiful before him stood the collegiate church bathed in moonlight he gazed abstractedly at this venerable structure for a few moments and then returned to the charnel where he found doctor dee and kelley employed in placing the body of the prophetess in a coffin which they had taken from a pile in the corner he immediately proffered his assistance and in a short space the task was completed the coffin was then borne towards the grave at the edge of which it was laid while the burialservice was recited by doctor dee this ended it was lowered into its shallow restingplace and speedily covered with earth when all was ready for their departure the doctor turned to fawkes and bidding him farewell observed if you are wise my son you will profit by the awful warning you have this night received before we part reverend sir replied fawkes i would ask if you know of other means whereby an insight may be obtained into the future many my son replied dee i have a magic glass in which with due preparation you may behold exact representations of coming events i am now returning to the college and if you will accompany me i will show it to you the offer was eagerly accepted and the party quitted the churchyard chapter viii the magic glass the old college of manchester occupied as is well known the site of the existing structure called after the benevolent individual by whom that admirable charity was founded and whom we have ventured to introduce in this historythe chetham hospital much indeed of the ancient building remains for though it was considerably repaired and enlarged being very ruinous and in great decay at the time of its purchase in by the feoffees under humphrey chethams will from the sequestrators of the earl of derbys estates still the general character of the fabric has been preserved and several of its chambers retained originally built on the foundation of a manorhouse denominated the barons hallthe abode of the grelleys and the de la warrs lords of manchesterthe college continued to be used as the residence of the warden and fellows of the collegiate church until the reign of edward the first when that body was dissolved on the accession however of mary the college was reestablished but the residence of the ecclesiastical body being removed to a house in deansgate the building was allowed to become extremely dilapidated and was used partly as a prison for recusants and other offenders and partly as a magazine for powder in this state dr dee found it when he succeeded to the wardenship in and preferring it notwithstanding its ruinous condition to the house appointed for him elsewhere took up his abode within it situated on a high rock overhanging the river irkat that time a clear stream remarkable for the excellence of its fishand constructed entirely of stone the old college had then and still has to a certain extent a venerable and monastic appearance during dees occupation of it it became a sort of weird abode in the eyes of the vulgar and many a timorous look was cast at it by those who walked at eventide on the opposite bank of the irk sometimes the curiosity of the watchers was rewarded by beholding a few sparks issue from the chimney and now and then the red reflection of a fire might be discerned through the window but generally nothing could be perceived and the building seemed as dark and mysterious as its occupant one night however a loud explosion took placeso loud indeed that it shook the whole pile to its foundation dislodged one or two of the chimneys and overthrew an old wall the stones of which rolled into the river beneath alarmed by the concussion the inhabitants of hunts bank rushed forth and saw to their great alarm that the wing of the college occupied by doctor dee was in flames though many of them attributed the circumstance to supernatural agency and were fully persuaded that the enemy of mankind was at that instant bearing off the conjuror and his assistant and refused to interfere to stop the conflagration others more humane and less superstitious hastened to lend their aid to extinguish the flames on reaching the college they could scarcely credit their senses on finding that there was no appearance of fire and they were met by the doctor and his companion at the gates who informed them that their presence was unnecessary as all danger was over from that night doctor dees reputation as a wizard was firmly established at the period of this history doctor dee was fast verging on eighty having passed a long life in severe and abstruse study he had travelled much had visited most of the foreign courts where he was generally well received and was profoundly versed in mathematics astronomy the then popular science of judicial astrology and other occult learning so accurate were his calculations esteemed that he was universally consulted as an oracle for some time he resided in germany where he was invited by the emperor charles the fifth and retained by his brother and successor ferdinando he next went to louvain where his reputation had preceded him and from thence to paris where he lectured at the schools on geometry and was offered a professorship of the university but declined it on his return to england in he was appointed one of the instructors of the youthful monarch edward the sixth who presented him with an annual pension of a hundred marks this he was permitted to commute for the rectory of uptonuponsevern which he retained until the accession of mary when being charged with devising her majestys destruction by enchantmentscertain waxen images of the queen having been found within his abodehe was thrown into prison rigorously treated and kept in durance for a long period at length from want of sufficient proof against him he was liberated dee shared the common fate of all astrologers he was alternately honoured and disgraced his next patron was lord robert dudley afterwards the celebrated earl of leicester who it is wellknown was a firm believer in the superstitious arts to which dee was addicted and by whom he was employed on the accession of elizabeth to erect a scheme to ascertain the best day for her coronation his prediction was so fortunate that it procured him the favour of the queen from whom he received many marks of regard as it is not needful to follow him through his various wanderings it may be sufficient to mention that in he proceeded to germany on a visit to the emperor maximilian to whom he dedicated his monas hieroglyphica that in he fell grievously sick in lorrain whither two physicians were despatched to his aid by elizabeth and that on his recovery he returned to his own country and retired to mortlake where he gathered together a vast library comprising the rarest and most curious works on all sciences together with a large collection of manuscripts while thus living in retirement he was sought out by edward kelley a native of worcestershire who represented himself as in possession of an old book of magic containing forms of invocation by which spirits might be summoned and controlled as well as a ball of ivory found in the tomb of a bishop who had made great progress in hermetic philosophy which was filled with the powder of projection these treasures kelley offered to place in the hands of the doctor on certain conditions which were immediately acquiesced in and thenceforth kelley became a constant inmate in his house and an assistant in all his practices shortly afterwards they were joined by a polish nobleman albert de laski palatine of suabia whom they accompanied to prague at the instance of the emperor rodolph the second who desired to be initiated into their mysteries their reception at this court was not such as to induce a long sojourn at it and dee having been warned by his familiar spirits to sell his effects and depart complied with the intimation and removed to poland the same fate attended him here the nuncio of the pope denounced him as a sorcerer and demanded that he should be delivered up to the inquisition this was refused by the monarch but dee and his companion were banished from his dominions and compelled to fly to bohemia where they took refuge in the castle of trebona belonging to count rosenberg shortly afterwards dee and kelley separated the magical instruments being delivered to the former who bent his course homewards and on his arrival in london was warmly welcomed by the queen during his absence his house at mortlake had been broken open by the populace under the pretence of its being the abode of a wizard and rifled of its valuable library and manuscriptsa loss severely felt by its owner some years were now passed by dee in great destitution during which he prosecuted his studies with the same ardour as before until at length in when he was turned seventy fortune again smiled upon him and he was appointed to the wardenship of the college at manchester whither he repaired and was installed in great pomp but his residence in this place was not destined to be a tranquil one his reputation as a dealer in the black art had preceded him and rendered him obnoxious to the clergy with whom he had constant disputes and a feud subsisted between him and the fellows of his church it has already been mentioned that he refused to occupy the house allotted him but preferred taking up his quarters in the old dilapidated college various reasons were assigned by his enemies for this singular choice of abode they affirmedand with some reasonthat he selected it because he desired to elude observationand that his mode of life sufficiently improper in a layman was altogether indecorous in an ecclesiastic by the common people he was universally regarded as a conjurorand many at first came to consult him but he peremptorily dismissed all such applicants and when seven females supposed to be possessed were brought to him that he might exercise his power over the evil spirits he refused to interfere he also publicly examined and rebuked a juggler named hartley who pretended to magical knowledge but these things did not blind his enemies who continued to harass him to such a degree that he addressed a petition to james the first entreating to be brought to trial when the accusations preferred against him might be fully investigated and his character cleared the application and another to the like effect addressed to parliament were disregarded dee had not been long established in manchester when he was secretly joined by kelley and they recommenced their search after the grand secretpassing the nights in making various alchymical experiments or in fancied conferences with invisible beings among other magical articles possessed by doctor dee was a large globe of crystal which he termed the holy stone because he believed it had been brought him by angelical ministry and in which according to meric casaubon and out of which by persons qualified for it and admitted to the sight of it all shapes and figures mentioned in every action were seen and voices heard the same writer informs us it was roundshaped of a pretty bigness and most like unto crystal dee himself declared to the emperor rodolph that the spirits had brought him a stone of that value that no earthly kingdom was of such worthiness as to be compared to the virtue and dignity thereof he was in the habit of daily consulting this marvellous stone and recording the visions he saw therein and the conferences he held through it with the invisible world followed by guy fawkes and kelley the doctor took his way down long mill gate and stopping at an arched gateway on the left near which on the site of the modern structure stood the public school founded a century before by hugh oldham bishop of exeterhe unlocked a small wicket and entered a spacious court surrounded on one side by high stone walls and on the other by a wing of the college conducting his guest to the principal entrance of the building which lay at the farther end of the court doctor dee ushered him into a large chamber panelled with oak and having a curiouslymoulded ceiling ornamented with grotesque sculpture this room still in existence and now occupied by the master of the school formed doctor dees library offering fawkes a chair the doctor informed him that when all was ready kelley should summon him and accompanied by his assistant he withdrew half an hour elapsed before kelley returned motioning guy fawkes to follow him he led the way through several intricate passages to a chamber which was evidently the magicians sacred retreat in a recess on one side stood a table covered with cabalistic characters and figures referring to the celestial influences on it was placed the holy stone diffusing such a glistening radiance as is emitted by the pebble called catseye on the floor a wide circle was described in the rings of which magical characters resembling those on the table were traced in front stood a brasier filled with flaming coals and before it hung a heavy black curtain appearing to shroud some mystery from view desiring fawkes to place himself in the centre of the circle doctor dee took several ingredients from a basket handed him by kelley and cast them into the brasier as each herb or gum was ignited the flame changed its colour now becoming crimson now green now blue while fragrant or noxious odours loaded the atmosphere these suffumigations ended dee seated himself on a chair near the table whither he was followed by kelley and commanding fawkes not to move a footstep as he valued his safety he waved his wand and began in a solemn tone to utter an invocation as he continued a hollow noise was heard overhead which gradually increased in loudness until it appeared as if the walls were tumbling about their ears the spirits are at hand cried dee do not look behind you or they will tear you in pieces as he spoke a horrible din was heard as of mingled howling shrieking and laughter it was succeeded by a low faint strain of music which gradually died away and then all was silent all is prepared cried dee now what would you behold the progress of the great enterprise replied fawkes doctor dee waved his wand the curtains slowly unfolded and guy fawkes perceived as in a glass a group of dark figures amongst which he noticed one in all respects resembling himself a priest was apparently proposing an oath which the others were uttering do you recognise them said doctor dee perfectly replied fawkes look again said dee as he spoke the figures melted away and a new scene was presented on the glass it was a gloomy vault filled with barrels partly covered with fagots and billets of wood have you seen enough demanded dee no replied fawkes firmly i have seen what is past i would behold that which is to come look again then rejoined the doctor waving his wand for an instant the glass was darkened and nothing could be discerned except the lurid flame and thick smoke arising from the brasier the next moment an icy chill shot through the frame of guy fawkes as he beheld a throng of skeletons arranged before him the bony fingers of the foremost of the grisly assemblage were pointed towards an indistinct object at its feet as this object gradually became more defined guy fawkes perceived that it was a figure resembling himself stretched upon the wheel and writhing in the agonies of torture he uttered an exclamation of terror and the curtains were instantly closed half an hour afterwards guy fawkes quitted the college and returned to the seven stars chapter ix the prison on salford bridge on the following morning guy fawkes had a long and private conference with father oldcorne the priest appeared greatly troubled by the communication made to him but he said nothing and was for some time lost in reflection and evidently weighing within himself what course it would be best to pursue his uneasiness was not without effect on viviana radcliffe and she ventured at last to inquire whether he apprehended any new danger i scarcely know what i apprehend dear daughter he answered but circumstances have occurred which render it impossible we can remain longer in our present asylum with safety we must quit it at nightfall is our retreat then discovered inquired viviana in alarm not as yet i trust replied oldcorne but i have just ascertained from a messenger that the pursuivant who we thought had departed for chester is still lingering within the town he has offered a large reward for my apprehension and having traced us to manchester declares he will leave no house unsearched till he finds us he has got together a fresh band of soldiers and is now visiting every place he thinks likely to afford us shelter if this is the case rejoined viviana why remain here a single moment let us fly at once that would avail nothingor rather it would expose us to fresh risk dear daughter replied oldcorne every approach to the town is guarded and soldiers are posted at the corners of the streets who stop and examine each suspected person heaven protect us exclaimed viviana but this is not all continued the priest by some inexplicable and mysterious means the designs of certain of the most assured friends of the catholic cause have come to the knowledge of our enemies and the lives and safeties of many worthy men will be endangered amongst others that of your father you terrify me cried viviana the rack shall force nothing from me father said fawkes sternly nor from me my son rejoined oldcorne i have that within me which will enable me to sustain the bitterest agonies that the persecutors of our church can inflict nor shall it force aught from me added viviana for though you have trusted me with nothing that can implicate others i plainly perceive some plot is in agitation for the restoration of our religion and i more than suspect mr catesby is its chief contriver daughter exclaimed oldcorne uneasily fear nothing father she rejoined as i have said the rack shall not force me to betray you neither should it keep me silent when i feel that my counselsuch as it ismay avail you the course you are pursuing is a dangerous and fatal one dangerous to yourselves and fatal to the cause you would serve do not deceive yourselves you are struggling hopelessly and unrighteously and heaven will never assist an undertaking which has its aim in the terrible waste of life you meditate father oldcorne made no reply but walked apart with guy fawkes and viviana abandoned herself to sorrowful reflection shortly after this the door was suddenly thrown open and humphrey chetham rushed into the room his looks were full of apprehension and viviana was at no loss to perceive that some calamity was at hand what is the matter she cried rising the pursuivant and his men are below he replied they are interrogating the hostess and are about to search the house i managed to pass them unperceived we will resist them to the last said guy fawkes drawing a petronel resistance will be in vain rejoined humphrey chetham they more than treble our number is there no means of escape asked viviana none whatever replied chetham i hear them on the stairs the terrified hostess has not dared to deny you and is conducting them hither stand back cried guy fawkes striding towards the door and let me alone confront them that accursed pursuivant has escaped me once but he shall not do so a second time my son said oldcorne advancing towards him preserve yourself if possible your life is of consequence to the great cause think not of usthink not of revenging yourself upon this caitiff but think of the high destiny for which you are reserved that window offers a means of retreat avail yourself of it flyfly ay fly repeated viviana and you humphrey chethamyour presence here can do no good quickthey come nothing should induce me to quit you at such a moment viviana replied chetham but the conviction that i may be able to liberate you should these miscreants convey you to prison flyfly my son cried oldcorne they are at the door thus urged guy fawkes reluctantly yielded to oldcornes entreaties and sprang through the window he was followed by chetham viviana darted to the casement and saw that they had alighted in safety on the ground and were flying swiftly up shude hill meanwhile the pursuivant had reached the door which chetham had taken the precaution to fasten and was trying to burst it open the bolts offered but a feeble resistance to his fury and the next moment he dashed into the room at the head of a band of soldiers seize them he cried ha he added glancing round the room with a look of disappointment where are the others where is the soldier in the spanish garb where is humphrey chetham confess at once dog he continued seizing the priest by the throat or i will pluck the secret from your breast do not harm him interposed viviana i will answer the question they are fled fled echoed the pursuivant in consternation how through that window replied viviana after them cried the pursuivant to some of his attendants take the soldier dead or alive and now he continued as his orders were obeyed you father oldcorne jesuit and traitor and you viviana radcliffe his shelterer and abettor i shall convey you both to the prison on salford bridge seize them and bring them along touch me not rejoined viviana pushing the men aside who rudely advanced to obey their leaders command you have no warrant for this brutality i am ready to attend you take my arm father abashed at this reproof the pursuivant stalked out of the room surrounded by the soldiers viviana and the priest followed the sad procession was attended by crowds to the very door of the prison where by the pursuivants commands they were locked in separate cells the cell in which viviana was confined was a small chamber at the back of the prison and on the upper story it had a small grated window overlooking the river it has already been mentioned that this prison was originally a chapel built in the reign of edward the third and had only recently been converted into a place of security for recusants the chamber allotted to viviana was contrived in the roof and was so low that she could scarcely stand upright in it it was furnished with a chair a small table and a straw pallet the hours passed wearily with viviana as they were marked by the deeptoned clock of the collegiate church the tall tower of which fronted her window oppressed by the most melancholy reflections she was for some time a prey almost to despair on whatever side she looked the prospect was equally cheerless and her sole desire was that she might find a refuge from her cares in the seclusion of a convent for this she prayedand she prayed also that heaven would soften the hearts of her oppressors and enable those who suffered to endure their yoke with patience in the evening provisions were brought her and placed upon the table together with a lamp by a surly looking gaoler but viviana had no inclination to eat and left them untouched neither could she prevail upon herself to lie down on the wretched pallet and she therefore determined to pass the night in the chair after some hours of watchfulness her eyelids closed and she continued to slumber until she was aroused by a slight noise at the window starting at the sound she flew towards it and perceived in the gloom the face of a man she would have uttered a loud cry when the circumstances of her situation rushed to her mind and the possibility that it might be a friend checked her the next moment satisfied her that she had acted rightly a voice which she recognised as that of humphrey chetham called to her by name in a low tone bidding her fear nothing as he was come to set her free how have you managed to reach this window asked viviana by a rope ladder he answered i contrived in the darkness to clamber upon the roof of the prison from the parapets of the bridge and after securing the ladder to a projection dropped the other end into a boat rowed by guy fawkes and concealed beneath the arches of the bridge if i can remove this bar so as to allow you to pass through the window dare you descend the ladder no replied viviana shuddering my brain reels at the mere idea think of the fate you will escape urged chetham and what will become of father oldcorne asked viviana where is he in the cell immediately beneath you replied chetham can you not liberate him she continued assuredly if he will risk the descent answered chetham reluctantly free him first rejoined viviana and at all hazards i will accompany you the young merchant made no reply but disappeared from the window viviana strained her gaze downwards but it was too dark to allow her to see anything she however heard a noise like that occasioned by a file and shortly afterwards a few muttered words informed her that the priest was passing through the window the cords of the ladder shook against the bars of her windowand she held her breath for fear from this state of suspense she was relieved in a few minutes by humphrey chetham who informed her that oldcorne had descended in safety and was in the boat with guy fawkes i will fulfil my promise replied viviana trembling but i fear my strength will fail me you had better find death below than tarry here replied humphrey chetham who as he spoke was rapidly filing through the iron bar in a few minutes this impediment will be removed the young merchant worked hard and in a short time the stout bar yielded to his efforts now then he cried springing into the room you are free i dare not make the attempt said viviana my strength utterly fails me nay then he replied i will take the risk upon myself you must not remain here so saying he caught her in his arms and bore her through the window with some difficulty and no little risk he succeeded in gaining a footing on the ladder this accomplished he began slowly to descend when half way down he found he had overrated his strength and he feared he should be compelled to quit his hold but nerved by his passion he held on and making a desperate effort completed the descent in safety chapter x the fate of the pursuivant assisted by the stream and plying his oars with great rapidity guy fawkes soon left the town far behind him nor did he relax his exertions until checked by humphrey chetham he then ceased rowing and directed the boats towards the left bank of the river here we propose to land observed the young merchant to viviana we are not more than a hundred yards from ordsall cave where you can take refuge for a short time while i proceed to the hall and ascertain whether you can return to it with safety i place myself entirely in your hands she replied but i fear such a course will be to rush into the very face of danger oh that i could join my father at holywell with him i should feel secure means may be found to effect your wishes returned humphrey chetham but after the suffering you have recently endured it will scarcely be prudent to undertake so long a journey without a few hours repose tomorrowor the next dayyou may set out i am fully equal to it now rejoined viviana eagerly and any fatigue i may undergo will not equal my present anxiety you have already done so much for me that i venture to presume still further upon your kindness provide some means of conveyance for me and for father oldcorne to chester and i shall for ever be beholden to you i will not only do what you desire viviana if it be possible answered chetham but if you will allow me i will serve as your escort and i also added guy fawkes all i fear is that your strength may fail you continued the young merchant in a tone of uneasiness fear nothing then replied viviana i am made of firmer material than you imagine think only of what you can do and doubt not my ability to do it also i ever deemed you of a courageous nature daughter observed oldcorne but your resolution surpasses my belief by this time the boat had approached the shore leaping upon the rocky bank the young merchant assisted viviana to land and then performed the same service for the priest guy fawkes was the last to disembark and having pulled the skiff aground he followed the others who waited for him at a short distance the night was profoundly dark and the path they had taken being shaded by large trees was scarcely discernible carefully guiding viviana who leaned on him for support the young merchant proceeded at a slow pace and with the utmost caution suddenly they were surprised and alarmed by a vivid blaze of light bursting through the trees on the left some building must be on fire exclaimed viviana it is ordsall hallit is your fathers residence cried humphrey chetham it is the work of that accursed pursuivant i will be sworn said guy fawkes if it be so may heavens fire consume him rejoined oldcorne alas alas cried viviana bursting into tears i thought myself equal to every calamity but this new stroke of fate is more than i can bear as she spoke the conflagration evidently increased the sky was illumined by the red reflection of the flames and as the party hurried forward to a rising ground whence a better view could be obtained of the spectacle they saw the dark walls of the ancient mansion apparently wrapped in the devouring element let us hasten thither cried viviana distractedly i and guy fawkes will fly there replied the young merchant and render all the assistance in our power but first let me convey you to the cave more dead than alive viviana suffered herself to be borne in that direction making his way over every impediment chetham soon reached the excavation and depositing his lovely burthen upon the stone couch and leaving her in charge of the priest he hurried with guy fawkes towards the hall on arriving at the termination of the avenue they found to their great relief that it was not the main structure but an outbuilding which was in flames and from its situation the young merchant conceived it to be the stables as soon as they made this discovery they slackened their pace being apprehensive from the shouts and other sounds that reached them that some hostile party might be among the assemblage crossing the drawbridgewhich was fortunately loweredthey were about to shape their course towards the stables which lay at the further side of the hall when they perceived the old steward heydocke standing at the doorway and wringing his hands in distraction humphrey chetham immediately called to him i should know that voice cried the old man stepping forward ah mr chetham is it you you are arrived at a sad time sira sad timeto see the old house where i have dwelt man and boy sixty years and more in flames but one calamity has trodden upon the heels of another ever since sir william departed for holywell nothing has gone rightnothing whatever first the house was searched by the pursuivant and his gang then my young mistress disappeared then it was rifled by these plunderers and now to crown all it is on fire and will speedily be burnt to the ground say not so replied the young merchant the flames have not yet reached the hall and if exertion is used they may be extinguished without further mischief let those who have kindled them extinguish them replied heydocke sullenly i will not raise hand more who are the incendiaries demanded fawkes the pursuivant and his myrmidons replied heydocke they came here tonight and after ransacking the house under pretence of procuring further evidence against my master and carrying off everything valuable they could collectplate jewels ornaments money and even wearingapparelthey ended by locking up all the servantsexcept myself who managed to elude their vigilancein the cellar and setting fire to the stables wretches exclaimed humphrey chetham wretches indeed repeated the steward but this is not all the villany they contemplate i had concealed myself in the storeroom under a heap of lumber and in searching for me they chanced upon a barrel of gunpowder well interrupted guy fawkes well sir pursued heydocke i heard the pursuivant remark to one of his comrades this is a lucky discovery if we cant find the steward well blow him and the old house to the devil just then some one came to tell him i was hidden in the stables and the whole troop adjourned thither but being baulked of their prey i suppose they wreaked their vengeance in the way you perceive no doubt rejoined humphrey chetham but they shall bitterly rue it i will myself represent the affair to the commissioners it will be useless groaned heydocke there is no law to protect the property of a catholic where is the barrel of gunpowder you spoke of asked guy fawkes as if struck by a sudden idea the villains took it with them when they quitted the storeroom replied the steward i suppose they have got it in the yard they have lighted a fire which shall be quenched with their blood rejoined fawkes fiercely follow me i may need you both so saying he darted off and turning the corner came in front of the blazing pile occupying one side of a large quadrangular court the stables were wholly disconnected with the hall and though the fire burnt furiously yet as the wind carried the flames and sparks in a contrary direction it was possible the latter building might escape if due precaution were taken so far however from this being the case it seemed the object of the bystanders to assist the progress of the conflagration several horses saddled and bridled had been removed from the stable and placed within an open cowhouse to these guy fawkes called chethams attention and desired him and the old steward to secure some of them hastily giving directions to heydocke the young merchant obeyedsprang on the back of the nearest courser and seizing the bridles of two others rode off with them his example was followed by heydocke and one steed only was left such was the confusion and clamour prevailing around that the above proceeding passed unnoticed guy fawkes meanwhile ensconcing himself behind the courtgate looked about for the barrel of gunpowder for some time he could discover no trace of it at length beneath a shed not far from him he perceived a soldier seated upon a small cask which he had no doubt was the object he was in search of so intent was the man upon the spectacle before him that he was wholly unaware of the approach of an enemy and creeping noiselessly up to him guy fawkes felled him to the ground with a blow from the heavy buttend of his petronel the action was not perceived by the others and carrying the cask out of the yard fawkes burst in the lid and ascertained that the contents were what they had been represented he then glanced around to see how he could best execute his purpose on the top of the wall adjoining the stables he beheld the pursuivant with three or four soldiers giving directions and issuing orders another and lower wall forming the opposite side of the quadrangle and built on the edge of the moat approached the scene of the fire and on this guy fawkes with the barrel of gunpowder on his shoulder mounted concealing himself behind a tree which overshadowed it he watched a favourable moment for his enterprise he had not to wait long prompted by some undefinable feeling which caused him to rush upon his destruction the pursuivant ventured upon the roof of the stables and was followed by his companions no sooner did this occur than guy fawkes dashed forward and hurled the barrel with all his force into the midst of the flames throwing himself at the same moment into the moat the explosion was instantaneous and tremendousso loud as to be audible even under the water its effects were terrible the bodies of the pursuivant and his companions were blown into the air and carried to the further side of the moat of those standing before the building several were destroyed and all more or less injured the walls were thrown down by the concussion and the roof and its fiery fragments projected into the moat an effectual stop was put to the conflagration and when guy fawkes rose to the boiling and agitated surface of the water the flames were entirely extinguished hearing groans on the opposite bank of the moat he forced his way through the blazing beams which were hissing near him and snatching up a still burning fragment hastened in the direction of the sound in the blackened and mutilated object that met his gaze he recognised the pursuivant the dying wretch also recognised him and attempted to speak but in vainhis tongue refused its office and with a horrible attempt at articulation he expired alarmed by the explosion the domesticswho it has already been mentioned were confined in the cellarwere rendered so desperate by their fears that they contrived to break out of their prison and now hastened to the stables to ascertain the cause of the report leaving them to assist the sufferers whose dreadful groans awakened some feelings of compunction in his iron breast guy fawkes caught the steedwhich had broken its bridle and rushed off and now stood shivering shaking and drenched in moisture near the drawbridgeand mounting it galloped towards the cave at its entrance he was met by humphrey chetham and oldcorne who eagerly inquired what had happened guy fawkes briefly explained it is the hand of heaven manifested by your arm my son observed the priest would that it had stricken the tyrant and apostate prince by whom our church is persecuted but his turn will speedily arrive peace father cried guy fawkes sternly i do not lament the fate of the pursuivant observed humphrey chetham but this is a frightful waste of human lifeand in such a cause it is the cause of heaven young sir rejoined the priest angrily i do not think so returned chetham and but for my devotion to viviana i would have no further share in it you are at liberty to leave us if you think proper retorted the priest coldly nay say not so father interposed viviana who had been an unobserved listener to the foregoing discourse you owe your lifeyour liberty to mr chetham true daughter replied the priest i have been too hasty and entreat his forgiveness you have it reverend sir rejoined the young merchant and now master heydocke he added turning to the steward you may return to the hall with safety no one will molest you more and your presence may be needed but my young mistress said heydocke i am setting out for holywell to join my father replied viviana you will receive our instructions from that place it is well returned the old man bowing respectfully heaven shield us from further misfortune humphrey chetham having assisted viviana into the saddle and the rest of the party having mounted they took the road to chester while heydocke returned to the hall chapter xi the pilgrimage to st winifreds well early on the following morning the party who had ridden hard and had paused only for a short time at knutsford to rest their steeds approached the ancient and picturesque city of chester skirting its high and then partly fortified walls above which appeared the massive tower of the venerable cathedral they passed through the eastgate and proceeding along the street deriving its name from that entrance were about to halt before the door of a large hostel called the saint werburghs abbey when to their great surprise they perceived catesby riding towards them i thought i could not be mistaken cried the latter as he drew near and saluted viviana i was about to set out for manchester with a despatch to you from your father miss radcliffe when this most unexpected and fortunate encounter spares me the journey but may i ask why i see you here and thus attended he added glancing uneasily at humphrey chetham a few words from father oldcorne explained all catesby affected to bend his brow and appear concerned at the relation but he could scarcely repress his satisfaction sir william radcliffe must join us now he whispered to the priest he musthe shall replied oldcorne in the same tone your father wishes you to join him at holt miss radcliffe remarked catesby turning to her whence the pilgrimage starts tomorrow for saint winifreds well there are already nearly thirty devout persons assembled indeed replied viviana may i inquire their names sir everard and lady digby replied catesby the lady anne vaux and her sister mrs brooksby mr ambrose rookwood and his wife the two winters tresham wright fathers garnet and fisher and many others in all probability unknown to you the procession started ten days ago from gothurst in buckinghamshire sir everard digbys residence and proceeded from thence by slow stages to norbrook and haddington at each of which houses it halted for some days yesterday it reached holt and starts as i have just told you tomorrow for holywell if you are so disposed you will be able to attend it i will gladly do so replied viviana and since i find it is not necessary to hurry forward i will rest myself for a short time here so saying she dismounted and the whole party entered the hostel viviana withdrew to seek a short repose and glance over her fathers letter while catesby guy fawkes and oldcorne were engaged in deep consultation humphrey chetham perceiving that his attendance was no further required and that he was an object of suspicion and dislike to catesbyfor whom he also entertained a similar aversionprepared to return and when viviana made her appearance he advanced to bid her farewell i can be of no further service to you viviana he said in a mournful tone and as my presence might be as unwelcome to your father as it seems to be to others of your friends i will now take my leave farewell mr chetham she replied i will not attempt to oppose your departure for much as i grieve to lose youand that i do so these tears will testifyi feel that it is for the best i owe you muchmorefar more than i can ever repay it would be unworthy in me and unfair to you to say that i do not and shall not ever feel the deepest interest in you that next to my father there is no one whom i regardnay whom i love so much love viviana echoed the young merchant trembling love mr chetham she continued turning very pale since you compel me to repeat the word i avow it boldly because and her voice falteredi would not have you suppose me ungrateful and because i never can be yours i will not attempt to dissuade you from the fatal determination you have formed of burying your charms in a cloister rejoined humphrey chetham but oh if you do love me why condemn yourselfwhy condemn me to hopeless misery i will tell you why replied viviana because you are not of my faith and because i never will wed a heretic i am answered replied the young merchant sadly mr chetham interposed oldcorne who had approached them unperceived it is in your power to change vivianas determination how asked the young merchant starting by being reconciled to the church of rome then it will remain unaltered replied chetham firmly and if mr chetham would consent to this proposal i would not said viviana farewell she added extending her hand to him which he pressed to his lips do not let us prolong an interview so painful to us both the best wish i can desire for you is that we may never meet again without another word and without hazarding a look at the object of his affections chetham rushed out of the room and mounting his horse rode off in the direction of manchester daughter observed oldcorne as soon as he was gone i cannot too highly approve of your conduct or too warmly applaud the mastery you display over your feelings but and he hesitated but what father cried viviana eagerly do you think i have done wrong in dismissing him by no means dear daughter replied the priest you have acted most discreetly but you will forgive me if i urge younay implore you not to take the veil but rather to bestow your hand upon some catholic gentleman such as mr catesby interrupted viviana glancing in the direction of the individual she mentioned who was watching them narrowly from the further end of the room ay mr catesby repeated oldcorne affecting not to notice the scornful emphasis laid on the name none more fitting could be found nor more worthy of you our church has not a more zealous servant and upholder and he will be at once a father and a husband to you such a union would be highly profitable to our religion and though it is well for those whose hearts are burthened with affliction and who are unable to render any active service to their faith to retire from the world it behoves every sister of the romish church to support it at a juncture like the present at any sacrifice of personal feeling urge me no more father replied viviana firmly i will make every sacrifice for my religion consistent with principle and feeling but i will not make this neither am i required to make it and i beg you will entreat mr catesby to desist from further importunity oldcorne bowed and retired nor was another syllable exchanged between them prior to their departure crossing the old bridge over the dee then defended at each extremity by a gate and tower the party took the road to holt where they arrived in about an hour the recent conversation had thrown a restraint over them which was not removed during the journey habitually taciturn as has already been remarked guy fawkes seemed gloomier and more thoughtful than ever and though he rode by the side of viviana he did not volunteer a remark and scarcely appeared conscious of her presence catesby and oldcorne kept aloof and it was not until they came in sight of the little town which formed their destination that the former galloped forward and striking into the path on the right begged viviana to follow him a turn in the road shortly afterwards showed them a large mansion screened by a grove of beechtrees that is the house to which we are going observed catesby and as he spoke they approached a lodge the gates of which being opened by an attendant admitted them to the avenue vivianas heart throbbed with delight at the anticipated meeting with her father but she could not repress a feeling of anxiety at the distressing intelligence she had to impart to him as she drew near the house she perceived him walking beneath the shade of the trees with two other persons and quickening her pace sprang from her steed and almost before he was aware of it was in his arms why do i see you here so unexpectedly my dear child cried sir william radcliffe as soon as he had recovered from the surprise which her sudden appearance occasioned him mr catesby only left this morning charged with a letter entreating you to set out without delayand now i behold you what has happened viviana then recounted the occurrences of the last few days it is as i feared replied sir william in a desponding tone our oppressors will never cease till they drive us to desperation they will not rejoined a voice behind him well may we exclaim with the prophethow long o lord shall i cry and thou wilt not hear shall i cry out to thee suffering violence and thou wilt not save why hast thou showed me iniquity and grievance to see rapine and injustice before me why lookest thou upon them that do unjust things and holdest thy peace when the wicked devoureth the man that is more just than himself viviana looked in the direction of the speaker and beheld a man in a priestly garb whose countenance struck her forcibly he was rather under the middle height of a slight spare figure and in age might be about fifty his features which in his youth must have been pleasing if not handsome and which were still regular were pale and emaciated but his eye was dark and of unusual brilliancy a single glance at this person satisfied her it was father garnet the provincial of the english jesuits nor was she mistaken in her supposition of this remarkable person so intimately connected with the main events of the history about to be related it may be proper to offer some preliminary account born at nottingham in in the reign of queen mary and of obscure parentage henry garnet was originally destined to the protestant church and educated with a view to taking orders at winchester school whence it was intended he should be removed in due course to oxford but this design was never carried into effect influenced by motives into which it is now scarcely worth while inquiring and which have been contested by writers on both sides of the question garnet proceeded from winchester to london where he engaged himself as corrector of the press to a printer of lawbooks named tottel in which capacity he became acquainted with sir edward coke and chief justice pophamone of whom was afterwards to be the leading counsel against him and the other his judge after continuing in this employment for two years during which he had meditated a change in his religion he went abroad and travelling first to madrid and then to rome saw enough of the catholic priesthood to confirm his resolution and in he assumed the habit of a jesuit pursuing his studies with the utmost zeal and ardour at the jesuits college under the celebrated bellarmine and the no less celebrated clavius he made such progress that upon the indisposition of the latter he was able to fill the mathematical chair nor was he less skilled in philosophy metaphysics and divinity and his knowledge of hebrew was so profound that he taught it publicly in the roman schools to an enthusiastic zeal in the cause of the religion he had espoused garnet added great powers of persuasion and eloquencea combination of qualities well fitting him for the office of a missionary priest and undismayed by the dangers he would have to encounter and eager to propagate his doctrines he solicited to be sent on this errand to his own country at the instance of father persons he received an appointment to the mission in and he secretly landed in england in the same year braving every danger and shrinking from no labour he sought on all hands to make proselytes to the ancient faith and to sustain the wavering courage of its professors two years afterwards on the imprisonment of the superior of the jesuits being raised to that important post he was enabled to extend his sphere of action and redoubling his exertions in consequence he so well discharged his duties that it was mainly owing to him that the catholic party was kept together during the fierce persecutions of the latter end of elizabeths reign compelled to personate various characters as he travelled from place to place garnet had acquired a remarkable facility for disguise and such was his address and courage that he not unfrequently imposed upon the very officers sent in pursuit of him up to the period of elizabeths demise he had escaped arrest and though involved in the treasonable intrigue with the king of spain and other conspiracies he procured a general pardon under the great seal his office and profession naturally brought him into contact with the chief catholic families throughout the kingdom and he maintained an active correspondence with many of them by means of his various agents and emissaries the great object of his life being the restoration of the fallen religion to accomplish this as he conceived great and desirable end he was prepared to adopt any means however violent or obnoxious when under the seal of confession catesby revealed to him his dark designs so far from discouraging him all he counselled was caution having tested the disposition of the wealthier romanists to rise against their oppressors and finding a general insurrection as has before been stated impracticable he gave every encouragement and assistance to the conspiracy forming among the more desperate and discontented of the party at his instigation the present pilgrimage to saint winifreds well was undertaken in the hope that when so large a body of the catholics were collected together some additional aid to the project might be obtained one of the most mysterious and inexplicable portions of garnets history is that relating to anne vaux this lady the daughter of lord vaux of harrowden a rigid catholic nobleman and one of garnets earliest patrons and friends on the death of her father in attached herself to his fortunesaccompanied him in all his missionsshared all his privations and dangersand regardless of calumny or reproach devoted herself entirely to his service what is not less singular her sister who had married a catholic gentleman named brooksby became his equally zealous attendant their enthusiasm produced a similar effect on mr brooksby and wherever garnet went all three accompanied him by his side on the present occasion stood sir everard digby accounted one of the handsomest most accomplished and bestinformed men of his time sir everard at the period of this history only twentyfour had married when scarcely sixteen maria heiress of the ancient and honourable family of mulshoe with whom he obtained a large fortune and the magnificent estate of gothurst or gaythurst in buckinghamshire knighted by james the first at belvoir castle on his way from scotland to london digby who had once formed one of the most brilliant ornaments of the court had of late in a great degree retired from it notwithstanding writes father greenway that he had dwelt much in the queens court and was in the way of obtaining honours and distinction by his graceful manners and rare parts he chose rather to bear the cross with the persecuted catholics et vivere abjectus in domo domini than to sail through the pleasures of a palace and the prosperities of the world to the shipwreck of his conscience and the destruction of his soul having only when he completed his minority professed the catholic religion he became deeply concerned at its fallen state and his whole thoughts were bent upon its restoration this change in feeling was occasioned chiefly if not altogether by garnet by whom his conversion had been accomplished sir everard digby was richly attired in a black velvet doublet with sleeves slashed with white satin and wore a short mantle of the same material similarly lined he had the enormous trunk hose heretofore mentioned as the distinguishing peculiarity of the costume of the period and wore black velvet shoes ornamented with white roses an ample ruff encircled his throat his hat was steeplecrowned and somewhat broader in the leaf than was ordinarily worn and shaded with a plume of black feathers his hair was raven black and he wore a pointed beard and moustaches his figure was tall and stately and his features grave and finely formed by this time the group had been joined by the others and a friendly greeting took place guy fawkes was presented by catesby to sir william radcliffe and sir everard digby to garnet he required no introduction and father oldcorne was known to all after a little further conversation the party adjourned to the house which belonged to a welsh catholic gentleman named griffiths who though absent at the time had surrendered it to the use of sir everard digby and his friends on their entrance viviana was introduced by her father to lady digby who presided as hostess and welcomed her with great cordiality she was then conducted to her own room where she was speedily joined by sir william and they remained closeted together till summoned to the principal meal of the day at the table which was most hospitably served viviana found in addition to her former companions a large assemblage to most of whom she was a stranger consisting of anne vaux mr brooksby and his wife ambrose rookwood two brothers named winter two wrights francis treshampersons of whom it will be necessary to make particular mention hereafterand several others in all amounting to thirty the meal over the company dispersed and viviana and her father passing through an open window wandered forth upon a beautiful and spreading lawn and thence under the shade of the beechtrees they had not been long here anxiously conferring on recent events when they perceived garnet and catesby approaching father dear father cried viviana hastily i was about to warn you but i have not time to do so now some dark and dangerous plot is in agitation to restore our religion mr catesby is anxious to league you with it do notdo not yield to his solicitations fear nothing on that score viviana replied sir william i have already perplexities enow without adding to them i will leave you then she replied and as soon as the others came up she made some excuse for withdrawing and returned to the house the window of her chamber commanded the avenue and from it she watched the group they remained for a long time pacing up and down in earnest conversation by and by they were joined by oldcorne and fawkes then came a third party consisting of the winters and wrights and lastly sir everard digby and tresham swelled the list the assemblage was then harangued by catesby and the most profound attention paid to his address viviana kept her eye fixed upon her fathers countenance and from its changing expression inferred what effect the speech produced upon him at its conclusion the assemblage separated in little groups and she perceived with great uneasiness that father garnet passed his arm through that of her father and led him away some time elapsed and neither of them reappeared my warning was in vain he has joined them she exclaimed no viviana cried her fathers voice behind her i have not joined them nor shall i do so heaven be praised she exclaimed flinging her arms around his neck neither of them were aware that they were overheard by garnet who had noiselessly followed sir william into the room and muttered to himself for all this he shall join the plot and she shall wed catesby he then coughed slightly to announce his presence and apologizing to viviana for the intrusion told her he came to confess her previously to the celebration of mass which would take place that evening in a small chapel in the house wholly obedient to the command of her spiritual advisers viviana instantly signified her assent and her father having withdrawn she laid open the inmost secrets of her heart to the jesuit severely reprobating her love for a heretic before he would give her absolution garnet enjoined her as a penance to walk barefoot to the holy well on the morrow and to make a costly offering at the shrine of the saint compliance being promised to his injunction he pronounced the absolution and departed soon after this mass was celebrated by garnet and the sacrament administered to the assemblage an hour before daybreak the party again assembled in the chapel where matins were performed after which the female devotees who were clothed in snowwhite woollen robes with wide sleeves and hoods and having large black crosses woven in front retired for a short time and reappeared with their feet bared and hair unbound each had a large rosary attached to the cord that bound her waist catesby thought viviana had never appeared so lovely as in this costume and as he gazed at her white and delicately formed feet her small rounded ankles her dark and abundant tresses falling in showers almost to the ground he became more deeply enamoured than before his passionate gaze was however unnoticed as the object of it kept her eyes steadily fixed on the ground lady digby who was a most beautiful woman scarcely appeared to less advantage and as she walked side by side with viviana in the procession the pair attracted universal admiration from all who beheld them everything being at last in readiness and the order of march fully arranged two youthful choristers in surplices chanting a hymn to saint winifred set forth they were followed by two men bearing silken banners on one of which was displayed the martyrdom of the saint whose shrine they were about to visit and on the other a lamb carrying a cross next came fathers oldcorne and fisher each sustaining a large silver crucifix next garnet alone in the full habit of his order next the females in the attire before described and walking two and two next sir everard digby and sir william radcliffe and lastly the rest of the pilgrims to the number of fourteen these were all on foot but at the distance of fifty paces behind them rode guy fawkes and catesby at the head of twenty wellarmed and wellmounted attendants intended to serve as a guard in case of need in such order this singular procession moved forward at a slow pace taking its course along a secluded road leading to the ridge of hills extending from the neighbourhood of wrexham to mold and from thence in an almost unbroken chain to holywell along these heights whence magnificent views were obtained of the broad estuary of the dee and the more distant ocean the train proceeded without interruption and though the road selected was one seldom traversed and through a country thinly peopled still the rumour of the pilgrimage having gone abroad hundreds were stationed at different points to behold it some expressions of disapprobation were occasionally manifested by the spectators but the presence of the large armed force effectually prevented any interference whenever such a course could be pursued the procession took its way over the sward still the sufferings of the females were severe in the extreme and before viviana had proceeded a mile her white tender feet were cut and bruised by the sharp flints over which she walked every step she took leaving a bloody print behind it lady digby was in little better condition but such was the zeal by which they in common with all the other devotees following them were animated that not a single murmur was uttered proceeding in this way they reached at midday a small stone chapel on the summit of the hill overlooking plasnewydd where they halted and devotions being performed the females bathed their lacerated limbs in a neighbouring brook after which they were rubbed with a cooling and odorous ointment thus refreshed they again set forward and halting a second time at plasisaf where similar religious ceremonies were observed they rested for the day at a lodging prepared for their reception in the vicinity of mold the night being passed in prayer early in the morning they commenced their march in the same order as before when viviana first set her feet to the ground she felt as if she were treading on hot iron and the pain was so excruciating that she could not repress a cry heed not your sufferings dear daughter observed garnet compassionately the waters of the holy fountain will heal the wounds both of soul and body overcoming her agony by a powerful effort she contrived to limp forward and the whole party was soon after in motion halting for two hours at pentreterfyn and again at skeviog the train towards evening reached the summit of the hill overlooking holywell at the foot of which could be seen the ruins of basingwerk abbey and the roof of the ancient chapel erected over the sacred spring at this sight those who were foremost in the procession fell on their knees and the horsemen dismounting imitated their example an earnest supplication to saint winifred was then poured forth by father garnet in which all the others joined and a hymn in her honour chanted by the choristers their devotions ended the whole train arose and walked slowly down the steep descent as they entered the little town which owes its name and celebrity to the miraculous spring rising within it they were met by a large concourse of people who had flocked from flint and the other neighbouring places to witness the ceremonial most of the inhabitants of holywell holding their saintly patroness in the deepest veneration viewed this pilgrimage to her shrine as a proper tribute of respect while those of the opposite faith were greatly impressed by it as the procession advanced the crowd divided into two lines to allow it passage and many fell on their knees imploring a blessing from garnet which he in no instance refused when within a hundred yards of the sacred well they were met by a priest followed by another small train of pilgrims a latin oration having been pronounced by this priest and replied to in the same language by garnet the train was once more put in motion and presently reached the ancient fabric built over the sacred fountain the legend of saint winifred is so well known that it is scarcely necessary to repeat it for the benefit of the uninformed however it may be stated that she flourished about the middle of the seventh century and was the daughter of thewith one of the chief lords of wales devoutly educated by a monk named beuno who afterwards received canonization she took the veil and retired to a small monastery the ruins of which still exist built by her father near the scene of her subsequent martyrdom persecuted by the addresses of caradoc son of alan prince of wales she fled from him to avoid his violence he followed and inflamed by fury at her resistance struck off her head for this atrocity the earth instantly opened and swallowed him alive while from the spot where the head had fallen gushed forth a fountain of unequalled force and purity producing more than a hundred tons a minute the bottom of this miraculous well is strewn with pebbles streaked with red veins in memory of the virgin saint from whose blood it sprung on its margin grows an odorous moss while its gelid and translucent waters are esteemed a remedy for many disorders winifreds career did not terminate with her decapitation resuscitated by the prayers of saint beuno she lived many years a life of the utmost sanctity bearing as a mark of the miracle performed in her behalf a narrow crimson circle round her throat passing the chapel adjoining the well built in the reign of henry the seventh by his mother the pious countess of richmond the pilgrims came to the swift clear stream rushing from the well instead of ascending the steps leading to the edifice built over the spring they plunged into the stream and crossing it entered the structure by a doorway on the further side erected by the countess of richmond at the same period as the chapel this structure quadrangular in form and of great beauty consists of light clustered pillars and mouldings supporting the most gorgeous tracery and groining the whole being ornamented with sculptured bosses pendent capitals fretwork niches and tabernacles in the midst is a large stone basin to receive the water of the fountain around which the procession now grouped and as soon as all were assembled at the command of father garnet they fell on their knees it was a solemn and striking sight to see this large group prostrated around that beautiful fountain and covered by that ancient structurea touching thing to hear the voice of prayer mingling with the sound of the rushing water after this they all arose a hymn was then chanted and votive offerings made at the shrine of the saint the male portion of the assemblage then followed garnet to the chapel where further religious rites were performed while the female devotees remaining near the fountain resigned themselves to the care of several attendants of their own sex who having bathed their feet in the water applied some of the fragrant moss above described to the wounds and such was the faith of the patients or the virtue of the application that in a short time they all felt perfectly restored and able to join their companions in the chapel in this way the evening was spent and it was not until late that they finished their devotions and departed to the lodgings provided for them in the town impressed with a strange superstitious feeling which he could scarcely acknowledge to himself guy fawkes determined to pass the night near the well accordingly without communicating his intention to his companions he threw a small knapsack over his shoulder containing a change of linen and a few articles of attire and proceeded thither it was a brilliant moonlight night and as the radiance streaming through the thin clustered columns of the structure lighted up its fairy architecture and fell upon the clear cold waves of the fountain revealing the bloodstreaked pebbles beneath the effect was inexpressibly beautiful so charmed was guy fawkes by the sight that he remained for some time standing near the edge of the basin as if fascinated by the marvellous spring that boiled up and sparkled at his feet resolved to try the efficacy of the bath he threw off his clothes and plunged into it the water was cold as ice but on emerging from it he felt wonderfully refreshed having dressed himself he wrapped his cloak around him and throwing himself on the stone floor placed the knapsack under his head and grasping a petronel in his right hand to be ready in case of a surprise disposed himself to slumber illustration vision of guy fawkes at saint winifreds well accustomed to a soldiers couch he soon fell asleep he had not long closed his eyes when he dreamed that from out of the well a female figure slight and unsubstantial as the element from which it sprang arose it was robed in what resembled a nuns garb but so thin and vapoury that the very moonlight shone through it from the garments of the figure as well as from the crimson circle round its throat he knew that it must be the patroness of the place the sainted winifred that he beheld he felt no horror but the deepest awe the arm of the figure was raisedits benignant regards fixed upon himand as soon as it gained the level of the basin it glided towards him chapter xii the vision before daybreak on the following morning garnet who had been engaged in earnest conference with catesby during the whole of the night repaired to the sacred spring for the purpose of bathing within it and performing his solitary devotions at the shrine of the saint on ascending the steps of the structure he perceived guy fawkes kneeling beside the fountain apparently occupied in prayer and being unwilling to disturb him he paused finding however after the lapse of a few minutes that he did not move he advanced towards him and was about to lay his hand upon his shoulder when he was arrested by the very extraordinary expression of his countenance his lips were partly open but perfectly motionless and his eyes almost starting from their sockets were fixed upon the boiling waters of the spring his hands were clasped and his look altogether was that of one whose faculties were benumbed by awe or terror aware of the fanatical and enthusiastical character of fawkes garnet had little doubt that by keeping long vigil at the fountain he had worked himself into such a state of overexcitement as to imagine he beheld some preternatural appearance and it was with some curiosity that he awaited the result glancing in the same direction his eye rested upon the bottom of the well but he could discern nothing except the glittering and bloodstreaked pebbles and the reflection of the early sunbeams that quivered on its steaming surface at length a convulsion passed over the frame of the kneeler and heaving a deep sigh he arose turning to quit the spring he confronted garnet and demanded in a low voice have you likewise seen the vision father garnet made no reply but regarded him steadfastly has the blessed winifred appeared to you i say continued fawkes no answered garnet i am but just come hither it is for you my sonthe favoured of heavenfor whom such glorious visions are reserved i have seen nothing how did the saint manifest herself to you in her earthly form replied fawkes or rather i should say in the semblance of the form she bore on earth listen to me father i came hither last night to make my couch beside the fountain after plunging into it i felt marvellously refreshed and disposed myself to rest on that stone scarcely had my eyes closed when the saintly virgin appeared to me oh father it was a vision of seraphic beauty such as the eye of man hath seldom seen and such only as it is permitted the elect of heaven to see observed garnet alas father rejoined guy fawkes i can lay little claim to such an epithet nay i begin to fear that i have incurred the displeasure of heaven think not so my son replied garnet uneasily relate your vision and i will interpret it to you thus then it was father returned fawkes the figure of the saint arose from out the well and gliding towards me laid its finger upon my brow my eyes opened but i was as one oppressed with a nightmare unable to move i then thought i heard my name pronounced by a voice so wondrously sweet that my senses were quite ravished fain would i have prostrated myself but my limbs refused their office neither could i speak for my tongue was also enchained proceed my son observed garnet i am curious to know what ensued father replied guy fawkes if the form i beheld was that of saint winifredand that it was so i cannot doubtthe enterprise on which we are engaged will fail it is not approved by heaven the vision warned me to desist you cannot desist my son rejoined garnet sternly your oath binds you to the project true replied fawkes and i have no thought of abandoning it but i am well assured it will not be successful your thinking so my son will be the most certain means of realizing your apprehensions replied garnet gravely but let me hear the exact words of the spirit you may have misunderstood them i cannot repeat them precisely father replied fawkes but i could not misapprehend their import which was the deepest commiseration for our forlorn and fallen church but a positive interdiction against any attempt to restore it by bloodshed suffer on said the spirit bear the yoke patiently and in due season god will avenge your wrongs and free you from oppression you are thus afflicted that your faith may be purified but if you resort to violence you will breed confusion and injure not serve the holy cause on which you are embarked such father was the language of the saint it was uttered in a tone so tender and sympathizing that every word found an echo in my heart and i repented having pledged myself to the undertaking but when i tell you that she added that all concerned in the conspiracy should perish perhaps you may be deterred from proceeding further never returned garnet nor will i suffer any one engaged in it to retreat what matter if a few perish if the many survive our blood will not be shed in vain if the true religion of god is restored nay as strongly as the blessed winifred herself resisted the impious ravisher caradoc will i resist all inducements to turn aside from my purpose it may be that the enterprise will fail it may be that we shall perish but if we die thus we shall die as martyrs and our deaths will be highly profitable to the catholic religion i doubt it observed fawkes my son said garnet solemnly i have ever looked upon you as one destined to be the chief agent in the great work of redemption i have thought that like judith you were chosen to destroy the holofernes who oppresses us having noted in you a religious fervour and resolution admirably fitting you for the task i thought and still think you expressly chosen by heaven for it but if you have any misgiving i beseech you to withdraw from it i will absolve you from your oath and enjoining you only to strictest secrecy will pray you to depart at once lest your irresolution should be communicated to the others fear nothing from me father rejoined fawkes i have no irresolution no wavering nor shall any engaged with us be shaken by my apprehension you have asked me what i saw and heard and i have told you truly but i will speak of it no more it will be well to observe silence my son answered garnet for though you like myself are unnerved its effect on others might be injurious but you have not yet brought your relation to an end how did the figure disappear as it arose father replied fawkes uttering in a sweet but solemn voice which yet rings in my cars the words be warned it glided back to the fountain whose waves as it approached grew still and gradually melted from my view but when i came hither you appeared to be gazing at the spring said garnet what did you then behold my first impulse on awakening about an hour ago replied fawkes was to prostrate myself before the fountain and to entreat the intercession of the saint who had thus marvellously revealed herself to me as i prayed methought its clear lucid waters became turbid and turned to the colour of blood it is a type of the blood of slaughtered brethren of our faith which has been shed by our oppressors rejoined garnet rather of our own which shall be poured forth in this cause retorted fawkes no matter i am prepared to lose the last drop of mine and i said garnet and i doubt not like those holy men who have suffered for their faith that we shall both win a crown of martyrdom amen exclaimed fawkes and you think the sacrifice we are about to offer will prove acceptable to god i am convinced of it my son answered garnet and i take the sainted virgin from whose blood this marvellous spring was produced to witness that i devote myself unhesitatingly to the project and that i firmly believe it will profit our church as he spoke a singular circumstance occurred which did not fail to produce an impression on both partiesespecially guy fawkes a violent gust of wind apparently suddenly aroused whistled through the slender columns of the structure and catching the surface of the water dashed it in tiny waves against their feet the saint is offended observed fawkes it would almost seem so replied garnet after a pause let us proceed to the chapel and pray at her shrine we will confer on this matter hereafter meantime swear to me that you will observe profound secrecy respecting this vision i swear replied guy fawkes at this moment another and more violent gust agitated the fountain we will tarry here no longer said garnet i am not proof against these portents of ill so saying he led the way to the chapel here they were presently joined by several of the female devotees including viviana anne vaux and lady digby matins were then said after which various offerings were made at the shrine of the saint lady digby presented a small tablet set in gold representing on one side the martyrdom of saint winifred and on the other the salutation of our lady anne vaux gave a small enamelled cross of gold viviana a girdle of the same metal with a pendant sustaining a small saint johns head surrounded with pearls mine will be a poor soldiers offering said guy fawkes approaching the shrine which was hung around with the crutches staves and bandages of those cured by the healing waters of the miraculous spring this small silver scallopshell given me by a pilgrim who died in my arms near the chapel of saint james of compostella in spain is the sole valuable i possess it will be as acceptable as a more costly gift my son replied garnet placing it on the shrine of all the offerings then made that silver scallopshell is the only one preserved chapter xiii the conspirators on vivianas return from her devotions she found her father in the greatest perturbation and alarm the old steward heydocke who had ridden express from ordsall hall had just arrived bringing word that the miserable fate of the pursuivant and his crew had aroused the whole country that officers attended by a strong force and breathing vengeance were in pursuit of sir william radcliffe and his daughter that large sums were offered for the capture of guy fawkes and father oldcorne that most of the servants were imprisoned that he himself had escaped with great difficulty and that to sum up this long catalogue of calamities master humphrey chetham was arrested and placed in the new fleet in short my dear young mistress concluded the old man as i have just observed to sir william all is over with us and there is nothing left but the grave what course have you resolved upon dear father inquired viviana turning anxiously to him i shall surrender myself he answered i am guilty of no crime and can easily clear myself from all imputation you are mistaken she replied do not hope for justice from those who know it not but while the means of escape are allowed you avail yourself of them no viviana replied sir william radcliffe firmly my part is taken i shall abide the arrival of the officers for you i shall intrust you to the care of mr catesby you cannot mean this dear father she cried with a look of distress and if you do i will never consent to such an arrangement mr catesby is strongly attached to you child replied sir william and will watch over your safety as carefully as i could do myself he may be attached to me rejoined viviana though i doubt the disinterestedness of his love but nothing can remove my repugnance to him forgive me therefore if in this one instance i decline to obey your commands i dare not trust myself with mr catesby how am i to understand you inquired sir william do not ask me to explain dear father she answered but imagine i must have good reason for what i say since you are resolved upon surrendering yourself i will go into captivity with you the alternative is less dreadful than that you have proposed you distract me child cried the knight rising and pacing the chamber in great agitation i cannot bear the thought of your imprisonment yet if i fly i appear to confess myself guilty if your worship will intrust mistress viviana with me interposed the old steward i will convey her whithersoever you directwill watch over her day and nightand if need be die in her defence thou wert ever a faithful servant good heydocke rejoined sir william extending his hand kindly to him and art as true in adversity as in prosperity shame to me if i were not replied heydocke pressing the knights fingers to his lips and bathing them in his tears shame to me if i hesitated to lay down my life for a master to whom i owe so much if it is your pleasure dear father observed viviana i will accompany master heydocke but i would far rather be permitted to remain with you it would avail nothing replied sir william we should be separated by the officers retire to your chamber and prepare for instant departure and in the mean while i will consider what is best to be done your worships decision must be speedy observed heydocke i had only a few hours start of the officers they will be here ere long take this purse replied sir william and hire three of the fleetest horses you can procure and station yourself at the outskirts of the town on the road to saint asaph you understand perfectly replied heydocke and he departed to execute his masters commands while viviana withdrew to her own chamber left alone the knight was perplexing himself as to where he should shape his course when he was interrupted by the sudden entrance of catesby and garnet we have just met your servant sir william said the former and have learnt the alarming intelligence he has brought what is your counsel in this emergency father said radcliffe appealing to garnet flightinstant flight my son was the answer my counsel is resistance said catesby we are here assembled in large numbers and are well armed let us await the arrival of the officers and see whether they will venture to arrest you they will arrest us all if they have force sufficient to do so replied garnet and there are many reasons as you well know why it is desirable to avoid any disturbance at present true replied catesby what say you then he continued addressing radcliffe to our immediate return to holt where means may be found to screen you till this storm is blown over sir william having assented to the proposal catesby instantly departed to acquaint the others and as soon as preparations could be made and horses procured the whole party composing the pilgrimage quitted holywell and ascending the hill at the back of the town took the direction of mold where they arrived having ridden at a swift pace in about half an hour from thence they proceeded without accident or interruption to the mansion they had recently occupied near holt on reaching it all the domestics were armed and certain of their number stationed at the different approaches to the house to give the alarm in case of the enemys appearance but as nothing occurred during the night the fears of sir william and his friends began in some degree to subside about noon on the following day as guy fawkes who ever since the vision at saint winifreds well had shunned all companionship walked forth beneath the avenue alone he heard a light step behind him and turning beheld viviana gravely bowing he was about to pursue his course when quickening her pace she was instantly by his side i have a favour to solicit she said there is none i would refuse you answered fawkes halting but though i have the will i may not have the power to grant your request hear me then she replied hurriedly of all my fathers friendsof all who are here assembled you are the only one i dare trustthe only one from whom i can hope for assistance i am at once flattered and perplexed by your words viviana he rejoined nor can i guess whither they tend but speak freely if i cannot render you aid i can at least give you counsel i must premise then said viviana that i am aware from certain obscure hints let fall by father oldcorne that you mr catesby and others are engaged in a dark and dangerous conspiracy viviana radcliffe returned guy fawkes sternly you have once before avowed your knowledge of this plot i will not attempt disguise with you a project is in agitation for the deliverance of our fallen church and since you have become acquainted with its existenceno matter howyou must be bound by an oath of secrecy or and his look grew darker and his voice sterner i will not answer for your life i will willingly take the oath on certain conditions said viviana you must take it unconditionally rejoined fawkes hear me out said viviana knowing that mr catesby and father garnet are anxious to induce my father to join this conspiracy i came hither to implore you to prevent him from doing so were i even willing to do thiswhich i am not replied fawkes i have not the power sir william radcliffe would be justly indignant at any interference on my part heed not that replied viviana you i fear are linked to this fearful project beyond the possibility of being set free but he is not save him save him i will take no part in urging him to join it replied fawkes but i can promise nothing further then mark me she returned if further attempts are made by any of your confederates to league him with their plot i myself will disclose all i know of it viviana rejoined fawkes in a threatening tone i again warn you that you endanger your life i care not she rejoined i would risk twenty lives if i possessed them to preserve my father you are a noblehearted lady replied fawkes unable to repress the admiration inspired by her conduct and if i can accomplish what you desire i will but i see not how it can be done everything is possible to one of your resolution replied viviana well well replied fawkes a slight smile crossing his rugged features the effort at least shall be made thanks thanks ejaculated viviana and overcome by her emotion she sank halffainting into his arms while he held her thus debating within himself whether he should convey her to the house garnet and catesby appeared at the other end of the avenue their surprise at the sight was extreme nor was it less when viviana opening her eyes as they drew near uttered a slight cry and disappeared this requires an explanation said catesby glancing fiercely at fawkes you must seek it then of the lady rejoined the latter moodily it will be easily explained i have no doubt interposed garnet miss radcliffe was seized with a momentary weakness and her companion offered her support that will scarcely suffice for me cried catesby let the subject be dropped for the present rejoined garnet authoritatively more important matter claims our attention we came to seek you my son he continued addressing fawkes all those engaged in the great enterprise are about to meet in a summerhouse in the garden i am ready to attend you replied fawkes will sir william radcliffe be there no replied garnet he has not yet joined us none will be present at this meeting but the sworn conspirators with this the trio took their way towards the garden and proceeding along a walk edged with clipped yewtrees came to the summerhousea small circular building overrun with ivy and creepers and ornamented in front by two stone statues on pedestals here they found sir everard digby ambrose rookwood francis tresham thomas and robert winter john and christopher wright awaiting their arrival the door being closed and bolted garnet placing himself in the midst of the assemblage said before we proceed further i will again administer the oath to all present drawing from his vest a primer and addressing sir everard digby he desired him to kneel and continued thus in a solemn tone you shall swear by the blessed trinity and by the sacrament you propose to receive never to disclose directly nor indirectly by word or circumstance the matter that shall be proposed to you to keep secret nor desist from the execution thereof until the rest shall give you leave i swear replied digby kissing the primer the oath was then taken in like manner by the others this done catesby was about to address the meeting when tresham glancing uneasily at the door remarked are you assured we have no eavesdroppers i will keep watch without rejoined fawkes if you have any fears it were better replied robert winter we cannot be too cautious but if you go forth you will not be able to take part in the discussion my part is to act not talk rejoined fawkes marching towards the door and shutting it after him he took up his position outside upon this catesby commenced a long and inflammatory harangue in which he expatiated with great eloquence and fervour on the wrongs of the catholic party and the deplorable condition of their church it were easy to slay the tyrant by whom we are oppressed he said in conclusion but his destruction would be small gain to us we must strike deeper to hew down the baneful stock of heresy all our adversaries must perish with him and in such a manner as shall best attest the vengeance of heaven placed beneath the parliamenthouse a mine of powder shall hurl its heretical occupants into the airnor shall any one survive the terrible explosion are we all agreed to this plan all the conspirators expressed their assent except sir everard digby before i give my concurrence to the measure observed the latter i would fain be resolved by father garnet whether it is lawful to destroy some few of our own faith with so many heretics unquestionably my son replied garnet as in besieging a city we have a right to kill all within it whether friends or enemies so in this case we are justified in destroying the innocent with the guilty because their destruction will be advantageous to the catholic cause i am satisfied replied digby as to the tyrant and apostate james continued garnet he is excommunicated and his subjects released from their allegiance i have two breves sent over by his holiness pope clement viii three years ago one directed to the clergy and the other to the nobility of this realm wherein alluding to queen elizabeth it is expressly declared that so soon as that miserable woman should depart out of this life none shall be permitted to ascend the throne how near soever in proximity of blood unless they are such as will not only tolerate the catholic faith but in every way support it by this brief james is expressly excluded he has betrayed not supported the church of rome having broken his word with us and oppressed our brethren more rigorously even than his predecessor the remorseless elizabeth he is unworthy longer to reign and must be removed he must reiterated the conspirators the parliamenthouse being the place where all the mischief done us has been contrived by our adversaries it is fitting that it should be the place of their chastisement remarked catesby doubtless rejoined ambrose rookwood yet if the blow we meditate should miscarry observed thomas winter the injury to the catholic religion will be so great that not only our enemies but our very friends will condemn us there is no chance of miscarriage if we are true to each other returned catesby confidently and if i suspected any one of treachery i would plunge my sword into his bosom were he my brother you would do wrong to act thus on mere suspicion remarked tresham who stood near him in a case like this he who gives the slightest ground for doubt would merit death replied catesby sternly and i would slay him hum exclaimed tresham uneasily mr catesby will now perhaps inform us what has been done to carry the project into effect inquired sir everard digby a small habitation has been taken by one of our confederates mr thomas percy immediately adjoining the parliamenthouse replied catesby from the cellar of which it is proposed to dig a mine through the wall of the devoted building and to deposit within it a sufficient quantity of gunpowder and other combustibles to accomplish our purpose this mine must be digged by ourselves as we can employ no assistants and will be a laborious and dangerous task but i for one will cheerfully undertake it and i said the elder wright and i cried several others supposing the mine digged and the powder deposited observed ambrose rookwood whose hand will fire the train mine cried guy fawkes throwing open the door as soon as he had spoken he retired and closed it after him he will keep his word remarked garnet he is of a nature so resolute that he would destroy himself with the victims rather than fail catiline was not a bolder conspirator than guy fawkes well gentlemen observed catesby we are now at the latter end of july all must be ready against the meeting of parliament in november there is some likelihood i hear that the meeting of the house will be prorogued till february remarked tresham so much the better rejoined catesby it will give us more time for preparation so much the worse i think cried ambrose rookwood delays are ever dangerous and doubly dangerous in a case like ours i am far from desiring to throw any impediment in the way of our design observed sir everard digby but i would recommend before we proceed to this terrible extremity that one last effort should be made to move the king in our behalf it is useless replied catesby so far from toleration he meditates severer measures against us and i am well assured if parliament is allowed to meet such laws will be passed as will bring all of us within premunire no no we have no hope from james nor his ministers nor yet from france or spain observed thomas winter in my conference with the constable velasco at bergen i received assurances of the goodwill of philip towards us but no distinct promise of interference in our behalf the archduke albert is well disposed but he can render no assistance we must depend upon ourselves ay marry must we replied catesby and fortunate is it that we have devised a plan by which we can accomplish our purpose unaided we only require funds to follow up with effect the blow we shall strike my whole fortune shall be placed at your disposal replied sir everard digby part of mine has already been given said tresham and the rest shall follow would i had aught to peril in the matter except my life said catesby i would throw everything upon the stake you do enough in venturing thus much my son rejoined garnet to you the whole conduct of the enterprise is committed i live for nothing else replied catesby and if i see it successful i shall have lived long enough cannot sir william radcliffe be induced to join us asked rookwood he would be an important acquisition and his wealth would prove highly serviceable i have sounded him answered catesby but he appears reluctant be not satisfied with one attempt urged christopher wright the jeopardy in which he now stands may make him change his mind i am loth to interrupt the discussion returned garnet but i think we have tarried here long enough we will meet again at midnight when i hope to introduce sir william radcliffe to you as a confederate the party then separated and garnet went in search of the knight ascertaining that he was in his own chamber he proceeded thither and found him alone entering at once upon the subject in hand garnet pleaded his cause with so much zeal that he at last wrung a reluctant consent from the listener scarcely able to conceal his exultation he then proposed to sir william to adjourn with him to the private chapel in the house where having taken the oath and received the sacrament upon it he should forthwith be introduced to the conspirators and the whole particulars of the plot revealed to him to this the knight with some hesitation agreed as they traversed a gallery leading to the chapel they met viviana for the first time in his life radcliffes gaze sank before his daughter and he would have passed her without speaking had she not stopped him father dear father she cried i know whither you are goingand for what purpose do notdo not join them illustration guy fawkes preventing sir william radcliffe from joining the conspiracy sir william radcliffe made no reply but endeavoured gently to push her aside she would not however be repulsed but prostrating herself before him clasped his knees and besought him not to proceed making a significant gesture to sir william garnet walked forward viviana cried the knight sternly my resolution is taken i command you to retire to your chamber so saying he broke from her and followed garnet clasping her hands to her brow viviana gazed for a moment with a frenzied look after him and then rushed from the gallery on reaching the chapel sir william who had been much shaken by this meeting was some minutes in recovering his composure garnet employed the time in renewing his arguments and with so much address that he succeeded in quieting the scruples of conscience which had been awakened in the knights breast by his daughters warning and now my son he said since you have determined to enrol your name in the list of those sworn to deliver their church from oppression take this primer in your hand and kneel down before the altar while i administer the oath which is to unite you to us garnet then advanced towards the altar and sir william was about to prostrate himself upon a cushion beside it when the door was suddenly thrown open and guy fawkes strode into the chapel hold he exclaimed grasping radcliffes right arm and fixing his dark glance upon him you shall not take that oath what mean you cried garnet who as well as the knight was paralyzed with astonishment at this intrusion sir william radcliffe is about to join us i know it replied fawkes but it may not be he has no heart in the business and will lend it no efficient assistance we are better without him than with him as he spoke he took the primer from the knights hand and laid it upon the altar this conduct is inexplicable cried garnet angrily you will answer for it to others as well as to me i will answer for it to all replied guy fawkes let sir william radcliffe declare before me and before heaven that he approves the measure and i am content he should take the oath i cannot belie my conscience by saying so replied the knight who appeared agitated by conflicting emotions yet you have promised to join us cried garnet reproachfully better break that promise than a solemn oath rejoined guy fawkes sternly sir william radcliffe there are reasons why you should not join this conspiracy examine your inmost heart and it will tell you what they are i understand you replied the knight get hence cried garnet unable to control his indignation or i will pronounce our churchs most terrible malediction against you i shall not shrink from it father rejoined fawkes humbly but firmly seeing i am acting rightly undeceive yourself then at once returned garnet and learn that you are thwarting our great and holy purpose on the contrary replied fawkes i am promoting it by preventing one from joining it who will endanger its success you are a traitor cried garnet furiously a traitor exclaimed guy fawkes his eye blazing with fierce lustre though his voice and demeanour were unalteredi who have been warned thricetwice by the deadand lastly by a vision from heaven yet still remain firm to my purposei who have voluntarily embraced the most dangerous and difficult part of the enterprisei who would suffer the utmost extremity of torture rather than utter a word that should reveal ita traitor no father i am none if you think so take this sword and at once put an end to your doubts there was something so irresistible in the manner of guy fawkes that garnet remained silent do with me what you please continued fawkes but do not compel sir william radcliffe to join the conspiracy he will be fatal to it no one shall compel me to join it replied the knight perhaps it is better thus returned garnet after a pause during which he was buried in reflection i will urge you no further my son but before you depart you must swear not to divulge what you have just learnt willingly replied the knight there is another person who must also take that oath said guy fawkes having accidentally become acquainted with as much as yourself and stepping out of the chapel he immediately afterwards returned with viviana you will now understand why i would not allow sir william to join the conspiracy he observed to garnet i do replied the latter gloomily the oath administered the knight and his daughter quitted the chapel accompanied by guy fawkes viviana was profuse in her expressions of gratitude nor was her father less earnest in his acknowledgments a few hours after this sir william radcliffe informed sir everard digby that it was his intention to depart immediately and though the latter attempted to dissuade him by representing the danger to which he would be exposed he continued inflexible the announcement surprised both catesby and garnet who were present when it was made and added their entreaties to those of digbybut without effect catesbys proposal to serve as an escort was likewise refused by sir william who said he had no fears and when questioned as to his destination he returned an evasive answer this sudden resolution of the knight coupled with his refusal to join the plot alarmed the conspirators and more than one expressed fears of treachery sir everard digby however was not of the number but asserted that radcliffe was a man of the highest honour and he would answer for his secrecy with his life will you answer for that of his daughter demanded tresham i will replied fawkes to put the matter beyond a doubt observed catesby i will set out shortly after him and follow him unobserved till he halts for the night and ascertain whether he stops at any suspicious quarter do so my son replied garnet it is needless observed sir everard digby but do as you please by this time radcliffes horses being brought round by heydocke he and his daughter took a hasty leave of their friends when they had been gone a few minutes catesby called for his steed and after exchanging a word or two with garnet rode after them he had proceeded about a couple of miles along a crossroad leading to nantwich which he learnt from some cottagers was the route taken by the party before him when he heard the tramp of a horse in the rear and turning at the sound beheld guy fawkes drawing in the bridle he halted till the latter came up and angrily demanded on what errand he was bent my errand is the same as your own replied fawkes i intend to follow sir william radcliffe and if need be defend him whatever catesbys objections might be to this companionship he did not think fit to declare them and though evidently much displeased suffered guy fawkes to ride by his side without opposition having gained the summit of the mountainous range extending from malpas to tottenhall whence they beheld the party whose course they were tracking enter a narrow lane at the foot of the hill catesby fearful of losing sight of them set spurs to his steed guy fawkes kept close beside him and they did not slacken their pace until they reached the lane having proceeded along it for a quarter of a mile they were alarmed by the sudden report of firearms followed by a loud shriek which neither of them doubted was uttered by viviana again dashing forward on turning a corner of the road they beheld the party surrounded by halfadozen troopers sir william radcliffe had shot one of his assailants and assisted by heydocke was defending himself bravely against the others with loud shouts catesby and guy fawkes galloped towards the scene of strife but they were too late a bullet pierced the knights brain and he no sooner fell than regardless of himself the old steward flung away his sword and threw himself with the most piteous lamentations on the body viviana meanwhile had been compelled to dismount and was in the hands of the troopers on seeing her fathers fate her shrieks were so heartpiercing that even her captors were moved to compassion fighting his way towards her catesby cut down one of the troopers and snatching her from the grasp of the other who was terrified by the furious assault placed her on the saddle beside him and striking spurs into his charger at the same moment leapt the hedge and made good his retreat this daring action however could not have been accomplished without the assistance of guy fawkes who warded off with his rapier all the blows aimed at him and his lovely charge while thus engaged he received a severe cut on the head which stretched him senseless and bleeding beneath his horses feet chapter xiv the packet on recovering from the effects of the wound he had received from the trooper guy fawkes found himself stretched upon a small bed in a cottage with viviana and catesby watching beside him a thick fold of linen was bandaged round his head and he was so faint from the great effusion of blood he had sustained that after gazing vacantly around him for a few minutes and but imperfectly comprehending what he beheld his eyes closed and he relapsed into insensibility restoratives being applied he revived in a short time and in answer to his inquiries how he came thither was informed by catesby that he had been left for dead by his assailants who contenting themselves with making the old steward prisoner had ridden off in the direction of chester what has become of sir william radcliffe asked the wounded man in a feeble voice catesby raised his finger to his lips and fawkes learnt the distressing nature of the question he had asked by the agonizing cry that burst from viviana unable to control her grief she withdrew and catesby then told him that the body of sir william radcliffe was lying in an adjoining cottage whither it had been transported from the scene of the conflict adding that it was vivianas earnest desire that it should be conveyed to manchester to the family vault in the collegiate church but that he feared her wish could not be safely complied with a messenger however had been despatched to holt and sir everard digby and fathers garnet and oldcorne were momentarily expected when some course would be decided upon for the disposal of the unfortunate knights remains poor viviana groaned fawkes she has now no protector rest easy on that score rejoined catesby she shall never want one while i live the wounded man fixed his eyes now blazing with red and unnatural light inquiringly upon him but he said nothing i know what you mean continued catesby you think i shall wed her and you are in the right i shall the marriage is essential to our enterprise and the only obstacle to it is removed fawkes attempted to reply but his parched tongue refused its office catesby arose and carefully raising his head held a cup of water to his lips the sufferer eagerly drained it and would have asked for more but seeing that the request would be refused he left it unuttered have you examined my wound he said after a pause catesby answered in the affirmative and do you judge it mortal continued fawkes not that i have any fear of death i have looked him in the face too often for that but i have somewhat on my mind which i would fain discharge before my earthly pilgrimage is ended do not delay it then rejoined the other knowing i speak to a soldier and a brave one i do not hesitate to tell you your hours are numbered heavens will be done exclaimed fawkes in a tone of resignation i thought myself destined to be one of the chief instruments of the restoration of our holy religion but i find i was mistaken when father garnet arrives i beseech you let me see him instantly or if he should not come speedily entreat miss radcliffe to grant me a few moments in private why not unburthen yourself to me returned catesby distrustfully in your circumstances i should desire no better confessor than a brother soldierno other crucifix than a swordhilt nor i rejoined fawkes but this is no confession i am about to make what i have to say relates to others not to myself indeed exclaimed catesby then there is the more reason why it should not be deferred i hold it my duty to tell you that the fever of your wound will in all probability produce delirium make your communication while your senses remain to you and whatever you enjoin shall be rigorously fulfilled will you swear this cried fawkes eagerly but before an answer could be returned he added in an altered tone nonoit cannot be this is no time for anger rejoined catesby sternly or i should ask whether you doubt the assurance i have given you i doubt nothing but your compliance with my request returned fawkes and oh if you hope to be succoured at your hour of need tell miss radcliffe i desire to speak with her the message will not need to be conveyed said viviana who had noiselessly entered the room she is here guy fawkes turned his gaze in the direction of the voice and notwithstanding his own deplorable condition he was filled with concern at the change wrought in her appearance by the terrible shock she had undergone her countenance was as pale as deathher eyes from which no tears would flow as is ever the case with the deepest distress were glassy and lustrelessher luxuriant hair hung in dishevelled masses over her shouldersand her attire was soiled and disordered you desire to speak with me she continued advancing towards the couch of the wounded man it must be alone he replied viviana glanced at catesby who reluctantly arose and closed the door after him we are alone now she said water water gasped the sufferer or i perish his request being complied with he continued in a low solemn voice viviana you have lost the dearest friend you had on earth and you will soon lose one who if he had been spared would have endeavoured as far as he could to repair the loss i say not this to aggravate your distress but to prove the sincerity of my regard let me conjure you with my dying breath not to wed mr catesby fear it not replied viviana i would rather endure death than consent to do so be upon your guard against him then continued fawkes when an object is to be gained he suffers few scruples to stand in his way i am well aware of it replied viviana and on the arrival of sir everard digby i shall place myself under his protection should you be driven to extremity said fawkes taking a small packet from the folds of his doublet break open this it will inform you what to do only promise me you will not have recourse to it till all other means have failed viviana took the packet and gave the required promise conceal it about your person and guard it carefully continued fawkes for you know not when you may require it and now having cleared my conscience i can die easily let me have your prayers viviana knelt down by the bedside and poured forth the most earnest supplications in his behalf perhaps she said as she arose and it is some consolation to think soyou may be saved by death from the commission of a great crime which would for ever have excluded you from the joys of heaven say rather cried guy fawkes whose brain began to wander which would have secured them to me others will achieve it but i shall have no share in their glory or their reward their reward will be perdition in this world and in the next rejoined viviana i repeat that though i deeply deplore your condition i rejoice in your delivery from this sin it is betterfar betterto die thus than by the hands of the common executioner what do i see cried guy fawkes trying to raise himself and sinking back again instantly upon the pillow elizabeth orton rises before me she beckons me after heri comei come heaven pity him cried viviana his senses have left him she leads me into a gloomy cavern continued fawkes more wildly but my eyes are like the wolfs and can penetrate the darkness it is filled with barrels of gunpowder i see them ranged in tiers one above another ah i know where i am now it is the vault beneath the parliamenthouse the king and his nobles are assembled in the hall above lend me a torch that i may fire the train and blow them into the air quick quick i have sworn their destruction and will keep my oath what matter if i perish with them give me the torch i say or it will be too late is the powder damp that it will not kindle and see the torch is expiringit is gone out distractionto be baffled thus why do you stand and glare at me with your stony eyes who are those with you fiendsno they are armed men they seize methey drag me before a grave assemblage what is that hideous engine the rackbind me on itbreak every limbye shall not force me to confessha ha i laugh at your threatsha ha mother of mercy release him from this torture cried viviana so ye have condemned me continued fawkes and will drag me to execution well well i am prepared but what a host is assembled to see me ten thousand faces are turned towards me and all with one abhorrent bloodthirsty expression and what a scaffold get it done quickly thou butcherly villain the rope is twisted round my throat in serpent folds it strangles meah horror exclaimed viviana i can listen to this no longer help mr catesby help the knife is at my breastit pierces my fleshmy heart is torn forthi die i die and he uttered a dreadful groan what has happened cried catesby rushing into the room is he dead i fear so replied viviana and his end has been a fearful one nono said catesby his pulse still beatsbut fiercely and feverishly you had better not remain here longer miss radcliffe i will watch over him all will soon be over aware that she could be of no further use viviana cast a look of the deepest commiseration at the sufferer and retired the occupant of the cottage an elderly female had surrendered all the apartments of her tenement except one small room to her guests and she was therefore undisturbed the terrible event which had recently occurred and the harrowing scene she had just witnessed were too much for viviana and her anguish was so intense that she began to fear her reason was deserting her she stood stillgazed fearfully round as if some secret danger environed herclasped her hands to her temples and found them burning like hot ironand then alarmed at her own state knelt down prayed and wept yes she wept for the first time since her fathers destruction and the relief afforded by those scalding tears was inexpressible from this piteous state she was aroused by the tramp of horses at the door of the cottage and the next moment father garnet presented himself how uncertain are human affairs he said after a sorrowful greeting had passed between them i little thought when we parted yesterday we should meet again so soon and under such afflicting circumstances it is the will of heaven father replied viviana and we must not murmur at its decrees but bear our chastening as we best may i am happy to find you in such a comfortable frame of mind dear daughter i feared the effect of the shock upon your feelings but i am glad to find you bear up against it so well i am surprised at my own firmness father replied viviana but i have been schooled in affliction i have no tie left to bind me to the world and shall retire from it not only without regret but with eagerness say not so dear daughter replied garnet you have i trust much happiness in store for you and when the sharpness of your affliction is worn off you will view your condition in a more cheering light impossible she cried mournfully hope is wholly extinct in my breast but i will not contest the point is not sir everard digby with you he is not daughter replied garnet and i will explain to you wherefore soon after your departure yesterday the mansion we occupied at holt was attacked by a band of soldiers headed by miles topcliffe one of the most unrelenting of our persecutors and though they were driven off with some loss yet as there was every reason to apprehend they would return with fresh force sir everard judged it prudent to retreat and accordingly he and his friends with all their attendants except those he has sent with me have departed for buckinghamshire where then is father oldcorne inquired viviana alas daughter rejoined garnet i grieve to say he is a prisoner imprudently exposing himself during the attack he was seized and carried off by topcliffe and his myrmidons how true is the saying that misfortunes never come single sighed viviana i seem bereft of all i hold dear sir everard has sent four of his trustiest servants with me remarked garnet they are well armed and will attend you wherever you choose to lead them he has also furnished me with a sum of money for your use he is most kind and considerate replied viviana and now father she faltered there is one subject which it is necessary to speak upon and though i shrink from it it must not be postponed i guess what you mean daughter said garnet sympathizingly you allude to the interment of sir william radcliffe is the body here it is in an adjoining cottage replied viviana in a broken voice i have already expressed my wish to mr catesby to have it conveyed to manchester to our family vault i see not how that can be accomplished dear daughter replied garnet but i will confer with mr catesby on the subject where is he in the next room by the couch of guy fawkes who is dying said viviana dying echoed garnet starting i heard he was dangerously hurt but did not suppose the wound would prove fatal here is another grievous blow to the good cause at this moment the door was opened by catesby how is the sufferer asked garnet a slight change for the better appears to have taken place answered catesby his fever has in some decree abated and he has sunk into a gentle slumber can he be removed with safety inquired garnet for i fear if he remains here he will fall into the hands of topcliffe and his crew who are scouring the country in every direction and he recapitulated all he had just stated to viviana catesby was for some time lost in reflection i am fairly perplexed as to what course it will be best to pursue he said dangers and difficulties beset us on every side i am inclined to yield to vivianas request and proceed to manchester that will be rushing into the very face of danger observed garnet and therefore may be the safest plan replied catesby our adversaries will scarcely suspect us of so desperate a step perhaps you are in the right my son returned garnet after a moments reflection at all events i bow to your judgment the plan is too much in accordance with my own wishes to meet with any opposition on my part observed viviana will you accompany us father asked catesby or do you proceed to gothurst i will go with you my son viviana will need a protector and till i have seen her in some place of safety i will not leave her since we have come to this determination rejoined catesby as soon as the needful preparations can be made and guy fawkes has had some hours repose we will set out under cover of night we can travel with security and by using some exertion may reach ordsall hall whither i presume viviana would choose to proceed in the first instance before daybreak i am well mounted and so are my attendants replied garnet and by the provident care of sir everard digby each of them has a led horse with him that is well said catesby and now viviana may i entreat you to take my place for a short time by the couch of the sufferer in a few hours everything shall be in readiness he then retired with garnet while viviana proceeded to the adjoining chamber where she found guy fawkes still slumbering tranquilly as the evening advanced he awoke and appeared much refreshed while he was speaking garnet and catesby approached his bedside and he seemed overjoyed at the sight of the former the subject of the journey being mentioned to him he at once expressed his ready compliance with the arrangement and only desired that the last rites of his church might be performed for him before he set out garnet informed him that he had come for that very purpose and as soon as they were left alone he proceeded to the discharge of his priestly duties confessed and absolved him giving him the viaticum and the extreme unction and lastly he judged it expedient to administer a powerful opiate to lull the pain of his wound on the journey this done he summoned catesby who with two of the attendants raised the couch on which the wounded man was stretched and conveyed him to the litter so well was this managed that fawkes sustained no injury and little inconvenience from the movement two strong country vehicles had been procured the one containing the wounded mans litter the other the shell which had been hastily put together to hold the remains of the unfortunate sir william radcliffe viviana being placed in the saddle and catesby having liberally rewarded the cottagers who had afforded them shelter the little cavalcade was put in motion in this way they journeyed through the night and shaping their course through tarporley northwich and altringham arrived at daybreak in the neighbourhood of ordsall hall chapter xv the elixir on beholding the wellremembered roof and gables of the old mansion peeping from out the grove of trees in which it was embosomed vivianas heart died away within her the thought that her father who had so recently quitted it in the full enjoyment of health and of every worldly blessing should be so soon brought back a corpse was almost too agonizing for endurance reflecting however that this was no season for the indulgence of grief but that she was called upon to act with firmness she bore up resolutely against her emotion arrived within a short distance of the hall catesby caused the little train to halt under the shelter of the trees while he rode forward to ascertain that they could safely approach it as he drew near everything proclaimed that the hand of the spoiler had been there crossing the drawbridge he entered the court which bore abundant marks of the devastation recently committed various articles of furniture broken burnt or otherwise destroyed were lying scattered about the glass in the windows was shivered the doors forced from their hinges the stonecopings of the walls pushed off the flowerbeds trampled upon the moat itself was in some places choked up with rubbish while in others its surface was covered with floating pieces of timber led by curiosity catesby proceeded to the spot where the stables had stood nothing but a heap of blackened ruins met his gaze scarcely one stone was standing on another the appearance of the place was so desolate and disheartening that he turned away instantly leaving his horse in a shed he entered the house here again he encountered fresh ravages the oakpanels and skirtingboards were torn from the walls the ceilings pulled down and the floor lay inchdeep in broken plaster and dust on ascending to the upper rooms he found the same disorder the banisters of the stairs were broken the bedsteads destroyed the roof partially untiled every room was thickly strewn with leaves torn from valuable books with fragments of apparel and other articles which the searchers not being able to carry off had wantonly destroyed having contemplated this scene of havoc for some time with feelings of the bitterest indignation catesby descended to the lowest story and after searching ineffectually for the domestics was about to depart when turning suddenly he perceived a man watching him from an adjoining room catesby instantly called to him but seeing that the fellow disregarded his assurances and was about to take to his heels he drew his sword and threatened him with severe punishment if he attempted to fly thus exhorted the manwho was no other than the younger heydockeadvanced towards him and throwing himself at his feet begged him in the most piteous terms to do him no injury i have already told you i am a friend replied catesby sheathing his sword ah mr catesby is it you i behold cried martin heydocke whose fears had hitherto prevented him from noticing the features of the intruder what brings your worship to this illfated house first let me know if there is any enemy about replied catesby none that i am aware of rejoined martin having ransacked the premises and done all the mischief they could as you perceive the miscreants departed the day before yesterday and i have seen nothing of them since though i have been constantly on the watch the only alarm i have had was that occasioned by your worship just now are you alone here demanded catesby no your worship answered martin there are several of the servants concealed in a secret passage under the house but they are so terrified by what has lately happened that they never dare show themselves except during the nighttime i do not wonder at it replied catesby and now may i inquire whether your worship brings any tidings of sir william radcliffe and mistress viviana rejoined martin i hope no ill has befallen them my father old jerome heydocke set out to holywell a few days ago to apprise them of their danger and i have not heard of them since sir william radcliffe is dead replied catesby the villains have murdered him your father is a prisoner alas alas cried the young man bursting into tears these are fearful times to live in what will become of us all we must rise against the oppressor replied catesby sternly bite the heel that tramples upon us we must rejoined martin and if my poor arm could avail it should not be slow to strike manfully resolved cried catesby who never lost an opportunity of gaining a proselyte i will point out to you a way by which you may accomplish what you desire but we will talk of this hereafter hoard up your vengeance till the fitting moment for action arrives he then proceeded to explain to the young man who was greatly surprised by the intelligence that viviana was at hand and that the body of sir william had been brought thither for interment in the family vault at the collegiate church having ascertained that there was a chamber which having suffered less than the others might serve for vivianas accommodation catesby returned to the party a more melancholy cavalcade has been seldom seen than now approached the gates of ordsall hall first rode viviana in an agony of tears for her grief had by this time become absolutely uncontrollable with catesby on foot leading her horse next came garnet greatly exhausted and depressed his eyes cast dejectedly on the ground then came the litter containing guy fawkes and lastly the vehicle with the body of sir william radcliffe on arriving at the gate viviana was met by two female servants whom martin heydocke had summoned from their hidingplaces and as soon as she had dismounted she was supported for she was scarcely able to walk unaided to the chamber destined for her reception this done catesby proceeded with some anxiety to superintend the removal of fawkes who was perfectly insensible his wound had bled considerably during the journey but the effusion had stopped when the faintness supervened he was placed in one of the lower rooms till a sleepingchamber could be prepared for him the last task was to attend to the remains of the late unfortunate possessor of the mansion by catesbys directions a large oak table once occupying the great hall was removed to the star chamber already described as the principal room of the house and being securely propped upfor like the rest of the furniture it had been much damaged by the spoilers though being of substantial material it offered greater resistance to their effortsthe shell containing the body was placed upon it better he should lie thus exclaimed catesby when the melancholy office was completed than live to witness the wreck around him fatal as are these occurrences he added pursuing the train of thought suggested by the scene they are yet favourable to my purpose the only person who could have prevented my union with viviana radcliffeher fatherlies there who would have thought when she rejected my proposal a few days ago in this very room how fortune would conspireand by what dark and inscrutable meansto bring it about fallen as it is this house is not yet fallen so low but i can reinstate it its young mistress mine her estates minefor she is now inheritress of all her fathers possessionsthe utmost reach of my ambition were gained and all but one object of my lifefor which i have dared so much and struggled so longachieved what are you thinking of my son asked garnet who had watched the changing expression of his sombre countenancewhat are you thinking of he said tapping him on the shoulder of that which is never absent from my thoughts fatherthe great design replied catesby and of the means of its accomplishment which this sad scene suggests i do not understand you my son rejoined the other does not radcliffes blood cry aloud for vengeance continued catesby and think you his child will be deaf to the cry no father she will no longer tamely submit to wrongs that would steel the gentlest bosom and make firm the feeblest arm but will go hand and heart with us in our project viviana must be mine he added altering his tone ours i should sayfor if she is mine all the vast possessions that have accrued to her by her fathers death shall be devoted to the furtherance of the mighty enterprise i cannot think she will refuse you now my son replied garnet she shall not refuse me father rejoined catesby the time is gone by for idle wooing i will be no party to forcible measures my son returned garnet gravely as far as persuasion goes i will lend you every assistance in my power but nothing further persuasion is all that will be required i am assured father answered catesby hastily perceiving he had committed himself too far but let us now see what can be done for guy fawkes would there was any hope of his life exclaimed garnet sighing deeply in losing him we lose the bravest of our band we do returned catesby and yet he has been subject to strange fancies of late he has been appalled but never shaken rejoined garnet of all our number you and he were the only two upon whom i could rely when he is gone you will stand alone catesby made no reply but led the way to the chamber where the wounded man lay he had regained his consciousness but was too feeble to speak after such restoratives as were at hand had been administered catesby was about to order a room to be fitted up for him when viviana whose anxiety for the sufferer had overcome her affliction made her appearance on learning catesbys intentions she insisted upon fawkes being removed to the room allotted to her which had not been dismantled like the rest seeing it was in vain to oppose her catesby assented and the sufferer was accordingly carried thither and placed within the beda large antique piece of furniture hung with faded damask curtains the room was one of the oldest in the house and at the further end stood a small closet approached by an arched doorway and fitted up with a hassock and crucifix which strange to say had escaped the ravages of the searchers placed within the couch guy fawkes began to ramble as before about the conspiracy and fearing his ravings might awaken the suspicion of the servants catesby would not suffer any of them to come near him but arranged with garnet to keep watch over him by turns by degrees he became more composed and after dozing a little opened his eyes and looking round inquired anxiously for his sword at first catesby who was alone with him at the time hesitated in his answer but seeing he appeared greatly disturbed he showed him that his hat gauntlets and rapier were lying by the bedside i am content replied the wounded man smiling faintly that sword has never left my side waking or sleeping for twenty years let me grasp it once moreperhaps for the last time catesby handed him the weapon he looked at it for a few moments and pressed the blade to his lips farewell old friend he said a tear gathering in his eye farewell catesby he added as he resigned the weapon to him i have one request to make let my sword be buried with me it shall replied catesby in a voice suffocated by emotion for the request touched him where his stern nature was most accessible i will place it by you myself thanks exclaimed fawkes and soon after this he again fell into a slumber his sleep endured for some hours but his breathing grew fainter and fainter so that at the last it was scarcely perceptible a striking change had likewise taken place in his countenance and these signs convinced catesby he had not long to live while he was watching him with great anxiety viviana appeared at the door of the chamber and beckoned him out noiselessly obeying the summons and following her along the gallery he entered a room where he found garnet i have called you to say that a remedy has been suggested to me by martin heydocke observed viviana by which i trust guy fawkes may yet be saved how asked catesby eagerly doctor dee the warden of manchester of whom you must have heard she continued is said to possess an elixir of such virtue that a few drops of it will snatch him who drinks them from the very jaws of death i should not have suspected you of so much credulity viviana replied catesby but grant that doctor dee possesses this marvellous elixirwhich for my own part i doubthow are we to obtain it if you will repair to the college and see him i doubt not he will give it you rejoined viviana catesby smiled incredulously i have a claim upon doctor dee she persisted which i have never enforced i will now use it show him this token she continued detaching a small ornament from her neck tell him you bring it from me and i am sure he will comply with your request your commands shall be obeyed viviana replied catesby but i frankly confess i have no faith in the remedy it is at least worth the trial my son observed garnet doctor dee is a wonderful person and has made many discoveries in medicine as in other sciences and this marvellous specific may for aught we know turn out no imposture if such is your opinion replied catesby i will set out at once if it is to be tried at all it must be without delay the poor sufferer is sinking fast go then cried viviana and heaven speed your mission if you could prevail upon doctor dee to visit the wounded man in person i should prefer it besides i have another request to make of himbut that will do hereafter lose not a moment now i will fly on the wings of the wind replied catesby heaven grant that when i return the object of our solicitude may not be past all human aid with this he hurried to an outbuilding in which the horses were placed and choosing the strongest and fleetest from out their number mounted and started at full gallop in the direction of manchester nor did he relax his speed until he reached the gates of the ancient college hanging the bridle of his smoking steed to a hook in the wall he crossed the large quadrangular court and finding the principal entrance open passed the lofty room now used as the refectory ascended the flight of stone stairs that conducts the modern visitor to the library and was traversing the long galleries communicating with it and now crowded with the learning of ages bequeathed by the benevolence of his rival humphrey chetham when he encountered a grave but craftylooking personage in a loose brown robe and polish cap who angrily demanded his business apologizing for the intrusion catesby was about to explain when a small oak door near them was partly opened and an authoritative voice from within exclaimed do not hinder him kelley i know his business and will see him the seer made no further remark but pointing to the door catesby at once comprehended that it was dees voice he had heard and though somewhat startled by the intimation that he was expected entered the room he found the doctor surrounded by his magical apparatus and slowly returning to the chair he had just quitted without looking behind him to see whom he addressed dee continued i have just consulted my showstone and know why you are come hither you bring a token from viviana radcliffe i do replied catesby in increased astonishment it is here it is needless to produce it replied dee still keeping his back towards him i have seen it already kelley he continued i am about to set out for ordsall hall immediately you must accompany me amazement cried catesby is the purpose of my visit then really known to your reverence you shall hear rejoined dee facing him you have a friend who is at the point of death and having heard that i possess an elixir of wonderful efficacy are come in quest of it true replied catesby utterly confounded the name of that friend pursued dee regarding him fixedly is guy fawkesyour own robert catesby i need no more to convince me reverend sir rejoined catesby trembling in spite of himself that all i have heard of your wonderful powers falls far short of the truth you are but just in time replied dee bowing gravely in acknowledgment of the compliment another hour and it would have been too late then you think he will live cried catesby eagerly i am sure of it replied dee provided provided what interrupted catesby is there aught i can do to ensure his recovery no replied dee sternly i am debating within myself whether it is worth while reviving him for a more dreadful fate what mean you reverend sir asked catesby a shade passing over his countenance you understand my meaning and therefore need no explanation replied dee return to ordsall hall and tell miss radcliffe i will be there in an hour bid her have no further fear if the wounded man breathes when i arrive i will undertake to cure him add further that i know the other request she desires to make of me and that it is granted before it is asked farewell sir for a short time on reaching the court catesby expanded his chest shook his limbs and exclaimed at length i breathe freely the atmosphere of that infernal chamber smelt so horribly of sulphur that it almost stifled me well if doctor dee has not dealings with the devil man never had however if he cures guy fawkes i care not whence the medicine comes from as he descended smithy bank and was about to cross the old bridge over the irwell he perceived a man riding before him who seemed anxious to avoid him struck by this persons manner he urged his horse into a quicker pace and being better mounted of the two soon overtook him when to his surprise he found it was martin heydocke what are you doing here sirrah he demanded i have been sent by mistress viviana with a message to mr humphrey chetham replied the young man in great confusion indeed exclaimed catesby angrily and how dared you convey a message to him without consulting me on the subject i was not aware you were my master replied martin sulkily if i owe obedience to any one it is to mr chetham whose servant i am but if mistress viviana gives me a message to deliver i will execute her commands whoever may be pleased or displeased i did but jest thou saucy knave returned catesby who did not desire to offend him here is a piece of money for thee now if it be no secret what was miss radcliffes message to thy master i know not what her letter contained replied martin but his answer was that he would come to the hall at midnight it is well i ascertained this thought catesby and he added aloud i understood your master had been arrested and imprisoned so he was replied martin but he had interest enough with the commissioners to procure his liberation enough replied catesby and striking spurs into his charger he dashed off a quarter of an hours hard riding brought him to the hall and on arriving there he proceeded at once to the wounded mans chamber where he found viviana and garnet have you succeeded in your errand cried the former eagerly will doctor dee come or has he sent the elixir he will bring it himself replied catesby viviana uttered an exclamation of joy and the sound appeared to reach the ears of the sufferer for he stirred and groaned faintly doctor dee desired me to tell you continued catesby drawing viviana aside and speaking in a low tone that your other request was granted viviana looked surprised and as if she did not clearly understand him might he not refer to humphrey chetham remarked catesby somewhat maliciously ah you have learnt from martin heydocke that i have written to him returned viviana blushing deeply what i was about to ask of doctor dee had no reference to humphrey chetham it was to request permission to privately inter my fathers remains in our family vault in the collegiate church but how did he know i had any request to make that passes my comprehension replied catesby unless he obtained his information from his familiar spirits shortly after this dr dee and kelley arrived at the hall catesby met them at the gate and conducted them to the wounded mans chamber coldly saluting garnet whom he eyed with suspicion and bowing respectfully to viviana the doctor slowly advanced to the bedside he gazed for a short time at the wounded man and folded his arms thoughtfully upon his breast the eyes of the sufferer were closed and his lips slightly apart but no breath seemed to issue from them his bronzed complexion had assumed the ghastly hue of death and his stronglymarked features had become fixed and rigid his black hair stiffened and caked with blood escaped from the bandages around his head and hung in elf locks on the pillow it was a piteous spectacle and doctor dee appeared much moved by it the worst is over he muttered why recall the spirit to its wretched tenement if you can save him reverend sir do not hesitate implored viviana i am come hither for that purpose replied dee but i must have no other witness to the experiment except yourself and my attendant kelley i do not desire to be present reverend sir replied viviana but i will retire into that closet and pray that your remedy may prevail my prayers for the same end shall be offered in the adjoining room observed garnet and taking catesbys arm who seemed spellbound by curiosity he dragged him away the door closed and viviana withdrew into the closet where she knelt down before the crucifix doctor dee seated himself on the bedside and taking a gourdshaped bottle filled with a clear sparkling liquid from beneath his robe he raised it to his eyes with his left hand while he placed his right on the wrist of the wounded man in this attitude he continued for a few seconds while kelley with his arms folded likewise kept his gaze fixed on the phial at the expiration of that time dee who had apparently counted the pulsations of the sufferer took out the glass stopper from the bottle the contents of which diffused a pungent odour around and wetting a small piece of linen with it applied it to his temples he then desired kelley to raise his head and poured a few drops down his throat this done he waited a few minutes and repeated the application look he cried to kelley the elixir already begins to operate his chest heaves his limbs shiver that flush upon the cheek and that dampness upon the brow denote that the animal heat is restored a third draught will accomplish the cure i can already feel his heart palpitate observed kelley placing his hand on the patients breast heaven be praised ejaculated viviana who had suspended her devotions to listen hold him tightly cried dee to his assistant while i administer the last draught he may injure himself by his struggles kelley obeyed and twined his arms tightly round the wounded man and fortunate it was that the precaution was taken for the elixir was no sooner poured down his throat than his chest began to labour violently his eyes opened and raising himself boltupright he struggled violently to break from the hold imposed upon him this he would have effected if dee had not likewise lent his aid to prevent him this is indeed a wonderful sight cried viviana who had quitted the closet and now gazed on in awe and astonishment i can never be sufficiently thankful to you reverend sir give thanks to him to whom alone they are due replied dee summon your friends they may now resume their posts my task is accomplished catesby and garnet being called into the room could scarcely credit their senses when they beheld guy fawkes who by this time had ceased struggling reclining on kelleys shoulder and except a certain wildness in the eye and cadaverousness of hue looking as he was wont to do illustration doctor dee resuscitating guy fawkes chapter xvi the collegiate church at manchester bidding kelley remain with guy fawkes doctor dee signified to viviana that he had a few words to say to her in private before his departure and leading the way to an adjoining room informed her that he was aware of her desire to have her fathers remains interred in the collegiate church and that so far from opposing her inclinations he would willingly accede to them only recommending as a measure of prudence that the ceremonial should be performed at night and with as much secrecy as possible viviana thanked him in a voice of much emotion for his kindness and entirely acquiesced in his suggestion of caution at the same time she could not help expressing her surprise that her thoughts should be known to him though indeed she added after the wonderful exhibition i have just witnessed of your power i can scarcely suppose that any limits are to be placed to it few things are hidden from me replied dee with a gratified smile even the lighter matters of the heart in which i might be supposed to take little interest do not altogether elude my observation in reference to this you will not i am sure be offended with me viviana if i tell you i have noticed with some concern the attachment that has arisen between you and humphrey chetham viviana uttered an exclamation of surprise and a deep blush suffused her pallid cheeks i am assuming the privilege of an old man with you viviana continued dee in a graver tone and i may add of an old friendfor your lamented mother was one of my dearest and best friends as you perchance called to mind when you sent me today by mr catesby the token i gave her years ago you have done unwisely in inviting humphrey chetham to come hither tonight how so she faltered because if he keeps his appointment fatal consequences may ensue answered dee your message has reached the ears of one from whommost of allyou should have concealed it mr catesby has heard of it i know replied viviana but you do not apprehend any danger from him he is chethams mortal foe rejoined dee and will slay him if he finds an opportunity you alarm me she cried i will speak to mr catesby on the subject and entreat him as he values my regard to offer no molestation to his fancied rival fancied rival echoed dee raising his brows contemptuously do you seek to persuade me that you do not love humphrey chetham assuredly not replied viviana i freely acknowledge my attachment to him it is as strong as my aversion to mr catesby but the latter is aware that the suit of his rival is as hopeless as his own explain yourself i pray you said dee my destiny is the cloisterand this he well knows she rejoined as soon as my worldly affairs can be arranged i shall retire to the english nunnery at brussels where i shall vow myself to heaven such is your present intention replied dee but you will never quit your own country what shall hinder me asked viviana uneasily many things returned dee amongst others this meeting with your lover call him not by that name i beseech you reverend sir she rejoined humphrey chetham will never be other to me than a friend it may be answered dee but your destiny is not the cloister for what am i reserved then demanded viviana trembling all i dare tell you he returned all it is needful for you to know is that your future career is mixed up with that of guy fawkes but do not concern yourself about what is to come the present is sufficient to claim your attention true replied viviana and my first object shall be to despatch a messenger to humphrey chetham to prevent him from coming hither trouble yourself no further on that score returned dee i will convey the message to him as regards the funeral it must take place without delay i will be at the south porch of the church with the keys at midnight and robert burnell the sexton and another assistant on whom i can depend shall be in attendance though it is contrary to my religious opinions and feelings to allow a romish priest to perform the service i will not interfere with father garnet i owe your mother a deep debt of gratitude and will pay it to her husband and her child thanksin her name thanks cried viviana in a voice suffocated by emotion and now continued dee i would ask you one further question my art has made me acquainted that a plot is hatching against the king and his government by certain of the catholic party are you favourable to the design i am not replied viviana firmly nor can you regard it with more horror than myself i was sure of it returned dee nevertheless i am glad to have my supposition confirmed from your own mouth with this he moved towards the door but viviana arrested his departure stay reverend sir she cried with a look of great uneasiness if you are in possession of this dread secret the lives of my companions are in your power you will not betray them or if you deem it your duty to reveal the plot to those endangered by it you will give its contrivers timely warning fear nothing rejoined dee i cannot were i so disposed interfere with the fixed purposes of fate the things revealed by my familiar spirits never pass my lips they are more sacred than the disclosures made to a priest of your faith at the confessional the bloody enterprise on which these zealots are bent will fail i have warned fawkes but my warning though conveyed by the lips of the dead and by other means equally terrible was unavailing i would warn catesby and garnet but they would heed me not viviana radcliffe he continued in a solemn voice you questioned me just now about the future have you courage to make the same demand from your dead father if so i will compel his corpse to answer you oh nono cried viviana horrorstricken not for worlds would i commit so impious an act gladly as i would know what fate has in store for me nothing should induce me to purchase the knowledge at so dreadful a price farewell then rejoined dee at midnight at the south porch of the collegiate church i shall expect you so saying he took his departure and on entering the gallery he perceived catesby hastily retreating aha he muttered we have had a listener here well no matter what he has heard may prove serviceable to him he then returned to the chamber occupied by guy fawkes and finding he had dropped into a deep and tranquil sleep motioned kelley who was standing by the bedside watching his slumbers with folded arms to follow him and bowing gravely to garnet quitted the hall as he crossed the court on his way to the drawbridge catesby suddenly threw himself in his path and laying his hand upon his sword cried in a menacing voicedoctor dee neither you nor your companion shall quit the hall till you have solemnly sworn not to divulge aught pertaining to the plot of which you have so mysteriously obtained information is this my recompence for rescuing your comrade from the jaws of death sir replied dee sternly the necessity of the case must plead its excuse rejoined catesby my own safety and the safety of those leagued with me require that i should be peremptory in my demand did i not owe you a large debt of gratitude for your resuscitation of guy fawkes i would have insured your secrecy with your life as it is i will be content with your oath fool exclaimed dee stand aside or i will compel you to do so think not to terrify me by idle threats returned catesby i willingly acknowledge your superior skillas indeed i have good reason to doin the science of medicine but i have no faith in your magical tricks a little reflection has shown me how the knowledge i at first thought so wonderful was acquired you obtained it by means of martin heydocke who mounted on a swift steed reached the college before me he told you of the object of my visitof vivianas wish to have her father interred in the collegiate churchof her message to humphrey chetham you were therefore fully prepared for my arrival and at first i must confess completely imposed upon me nay had i not overheard your conversation just now with viviana i might have remained your dupe still but your allusion to chethams visit awakened my suspicions and on reconsidering the matter the whole trick flashed upon me what more demanded dee his brow lowering and his eyes sparkling with rage thus much returned catesby i have your secret and you have mine and though the latter is the more important inasmuch as several lives hang upon it whereas a conjurors worthless reputation is alone dependent on the other yet both must be kept swear then not to reveal the plot and in my turn i will take any oath you choose to dictate not to disclose the jugglery i have detected i will make no terms with you returned dee and if i do not reveal your damnable plot it is not from consideration of you or your associates but because the hour for its disclosure is not yet arrived when full proof of your guilt can be obtained then rest assured it will be made knownthough not by me not one of your number shall escapenot one catesby again laid his hand upon his sword and seemed from his looks to be meditating the destruction of the doctor and his assistant but they appeared wholly unconcerned at his glances what you have said concerning martin heydocke is falseas false as your own foul and bloody scheme pursued dee i have neither seen nor spoken with him but your assistant edward kelley has retorted catesby and that amounts to the same thing for the third and last time i command you to stand aside cried dee in a tone of concentrated anger catesby laughed aloud what if i refuse he said in a jeering voice doctor dee made no answer but suddenly drawing a small phial from beneath his robe cast its contents in his opponents face blinded by the spirit catesby raised his hand to his eyes and while in this condition a thick cloth was thrown over his head from behind and despite his resistance he was borne off and bound with a strong cord to an adjoining tree half an hour elapsed during which he exhausted his fury in vain outcries for assistance and execrations and menaces against dee and his companion at the expiration of that time hearing steps approaching he called loudly to be released and was answered by the voice of martin heydocke what is it your worship i behold cried martin in a tone of affected commiseration mercy on us what has happened have the rascally searchers been here again hold your peace knave and unbind me rejoined catesby angrily i shrewdly suspect he added as his commands were obeyed and the cord twined around his arms unfastened and the cloth removedi shrewdly suspect he said fixing a stern glance upon martin which effectually banished the smile from his demure countenance that you have had some share in this business what i your worship exclaimed martin not the slightest i assure you it was by mere chance i came this way and perceiving some one tied to a tree was about to take to my heels when fancying i recognised your worships wellformed legs i ventured forward you shall become more intimately acquainted with my worships boots rascal if i find my suspicions correct rejoined catesby have you the effrontery to tell me you have never seen this rope and this cloth before certes i have your worship replied martin may the first hang me and the last serve as my windingsheet if i speak not the truth ah now i look again he added pretending to examine them it must be a horsecloth and halter from the stable peradventure i have seen them that i will be sworn you have and used them too rejoined catesby i am half inclined to tie you to the tree in my place but where is your employerwhere is doctor dee doctor dee is not my employer answered martin neither do i serve him mr humphrey chetham as i have already told your worship is my master as to the doctor he left the hall some time since father garnet thought you had accompanied him on the road i have seen nothing of him of a truth i have not catesby reflected a moment and then strode towards the hall while martin with a secret smile picked up the halter and cloth and withdrew to the stable repairing to the chamber of the wounded man catesby found garnet seated by his couch and related what had occurred the jesuit listened with profound attention to the recital and on its conclusion observed i am sorry you have offended doctor dee my son he might have proved a good friend as it is you have made him a dangerous enemy he was not to be trusted father returned catesby but if you have any fears of him or kelley i will speedily set them at rest no violence my son rejoined garnet you will only increase the mischief you have already occasioned i do not think dee will betray us but additional circumspection will be requisite tarry here while i confer with viviana on this subject she has apparently some secret influence with the doctor and may be prevailed upon to exert it in our behalf it was long before garnet returned when he reappeared his looks convinced catesby that the interview had not proved satisfactory your imprudence has placed us in a perilous position my son he observed viviana refuses to speak to doctor dee on the subject and strongly reprobates your conduct catesbys brow lowered there is but one course to pursue he muttered rising our lives or his must be sacrificed i will act at once hold exclaimed garnet authoritatively wait till tomorrow and if aught occurs in the interim to confirm your suspicions do as you think proper i will not oppose you if i forbear so long returned catesby it will not be safe to remain here i will risk it said garnet and i counsel you to do the same you will not leave viviana at this strait i have no such thoughts replied catesby if i go she goes too then it will be in vain i am sure to endeavour to induce her to accompany you till her father is interred observed garnet true replied catesby i had forgotten that we shall meet the hoary juggler at the church and an opportunity may occur for executing my purpose there unless he will swear at the altar not to betray us he shall die by my hand an oath in such a case would be no security my son returned garnet and his slaughter and that of his companion would be equally inefficacious and greatly prejudicial to our cause if he means to betray us he has done so already but i have little apprehension i do not think him well affected towards the government and i cannot but think if you had not thus grossly insulted him he would have favoured rather than opposed our design if he was aware of the plot and adverse to it what need was there to exert his skill in behalf of our dying friend who but for him would have been ere this a lump of lifeless clay no no my son you are far too hasty in your judgment nor am i less surprised at your injustice overlooking the great benefit conferred upon us because some trifling scheme has been thwarted you would requite our benefactor by cutting his throat your rebuke is just father returned catesby i have acted heedlessly but i will endeavour to repair my error enough my son replied garnet it will be advisable to go well armed to the church tonight for fear of a surprise but i shall not absent myself on that account nor i rejoined catesby the conversation was then carried on on other topics when they were interrupted by the entrance of viviana who came to consult them about the funeral it was arrangedsince better could not be foundthat the vehicle used to bring thither the body of the unfortunate knight should transport it to its last home no persuasions of garnet could induce viviana to relinquish the idea of attending the ceremony and catesby though he affected the contrary secretly rejoiced at her determination night came and all was in readiness viviana to the last indulged a hope that humphrey chetham would arrive in time to attend the funeral with her but as he did not appear she concluded he had received doctor dees warning martin heydocke was left in charge of guy fawkes who still continued to slumber deeply and when within half an hour of the appointed time the train set out they were all well mounted and proceeded at a slow pace along the lane skirting the west bank of the irwell the night was profoundly dark and as it was not deemed prudent to carry torches some care was requisite to keep in the right road catesby rode first and was followed by garnet and viviana after whom came the little vehicle containing the body the rear was brought up by three of the servants sent by sir everard digby a fourth acting as driver of the sorry substitute for a hearse not a word was uttered by any of the party in this stealthy manner was the oncepowerful and wealthy sir william radcliffe the owner of the whole district through which they were passing conveyed to the burialplace of his ancestors in shorter time than they had allowed themselves for the journey the melancholy cavalcade reached salford bridge and crossing it at a quick pace as had been previously arranged by catesby arrived without molestation or notice for no one was abroad in the town at that hour at the southern gate of the collegiate church where it may be remembered guy fawkes had witnessed the execution of the two seminary priests and on the spikes of which their heads and dismembered bodies were now fixed an old man here presented himself and unlocking the gate informed them he was robert burnell the sexton the shell was then taken out and borne on the shoulders of the servants towards the church burnell leading the way garnet followed and as soon as catesby had committed the horses to the care of the driver of the carriage he tendered his arm to viviana who could scarcely have reached the sacred structure unsupported doctor dee met them at the church porch as he had appointed and as soon as they had passed through it the door was locked addressing a few words in an under tone to viviana but not deigning to notice either of her companions dee directed the bearers of the body to follow him and proceeded towards the choir the interior of the reverend and beautiful fane was buried in profound gloom and the feeble light diffused by the sextons lantern only made the darkness more palpable on entering the broad and noble nave nothing could be seen of its clustered pillars or of the exquisite pointed arches enriched with cinquefoil and quatrefoil inclosing blank shields which they supported neither could its sculptured cornice its clerestory windows its upper range of columns supporting demiangels playing on musical instruments its moulded roof crossed by transverse beams enriched in the interstices with sculptured ornaments be distinguished most of these architectural glories were invisible but the very gloom in which they were shrouded was imposing as the dim light fell upon pillar after pillar as they passed revealing their mouldings piercing a few feet into the side aisles and falling upon the grotesque heads the embattled ornaments and grotesque tracery of the arches the effect was inexpressibly striking nor were the personages inappropriate to the sombre scene the reverend figure of dee with his loose flowing robe and long white beard the priestly garb and grave aspect of garnet the soldierlike bearing of catesby his armed heel and rapierpoint clanking upon the pavement the drooping figure of viviana whose features were buried in her kerchief and whose sobs were distinctly audible the strangelyfashioned coffin and the attendants by whom it was borneall constituted a singular and at the same time deeplyinteresting picture approaching the magnificent screen terminating the nave they passed through an arched gateway within it and entered the choir the westend of this part of the church was assigned as the burialplace of the ancient and honourable family the head of which was about to be deposited within it and was designated from the circumstance the radcliffe chancel a long slab of grey marble in which a brass plate displaying the armorial bearings of the radcliffes was inserted had been removed and the earth thrown out of the cavity beneath it kelley who had assisted in making the excavation was standing beside it leaning on a spade with a lantern at his feet he drew aside as the funeral train approached and the shell was deposited at the edge of the grave picturesque and striking as was the scene in the nave it fell far short of that now exhibited the choir of the collegiate church at manchester may challenge comparison with any similar structure its thirty elaboratelycarved stalls covered with canopies of the richest tabernacle work surmounted by niches mouldings pinnacles and perforated tracery and crowned with a richlysculptured cornice its side aisles with their pillars and arches its moulded ceiling rich in the most delicate and fairy tracery its gorgeous altarscreen of carved oak and its magnificent eastern window then filled with stained glass form a coupdoeil of almost unequalled splendour and beauty few of these marvels could now be seen but such points of the pinnacles and hanging canopies of the stalls of the facades of the sideaisles and of the fretted roof as received any portion of the light came in with admirable effect all is prepared you perceive observed dee to viviana i will retire while the ceremony is performed and gravely inclining his head he passed through an arched door in the south aisle and entered the chapterhouse garnet was about to proceed with the service appointed by the romish church for the burial of the dead when viviana uttering a loud cry would have fallen if catesby had not flown to her assistance and borne her to one of the stalls recovering her selfpossession the next moment she entreated him to leave her and while the service proceeded she knelt down and prayed fervently for the soul of the departed placing himself at the foot of the body garnet sprinkled it with holy water which he had brought with him in a small silver consecrated vessel he then recited the de profundis the miserere and other antiphons and prayers placed incense in a burner which he had likewise brought with him and having lighted it bowed reverently towards the altar sprinkled the body thrice with holy water at the sides at the head and the feet and then walking round it with the incenseburner dispersed its fragrant odour over it this done he recited another prayer pronounced a solemn benediction over the place of sepulture and the body was lowered into it the noise of the earth falling upon the shell aroused viviana from her devotions she looked towards the grave but could see nothing but the gloomy group around it prominent among which appeared the tall figure of catesby the sight was too much for her and unable to control her grief she fainted meanwhile the grave was rapidly filled all lending their aid to the task and nothing was wanting but to restore the slab to its original position by the united efforts of catesby kelley and the sexton this was soon accomplished and the former unaware of what had happened was about to proceed to viviana to tell her all was over when he was arrested by a loud knocking at the church door accompanied by a clamorous demand for admittance we are betrayed exclaimed catesby it is as i suspected take care of viviana father i will after the hoary impostor and cleave his skull extinguish the lightsquick quick garnet hastily complied with these injunctions and the choir was plunged in total darkness he then rushed to the stalls but could nowhere find viviana he called her by name but received no answer and was continuing his fruitless search when he heard footsteps approaching and the voice of catesby exclaimed follow me with your charge father alas my son she is not here replied garnet i have searched each stall as carefully as i could in the dark i fear she has been spirited away impossible cried catesby and he ran his hand along the row of sculptured seats but without success she is indeed gone he exclaimed distractedly it was here i left hernay here i beheld her at the very moment the lights were extinguished vivianaviviana but all was silent it is that cursed magicians handiwork he continued striking his forehead in despair did you find him demanded garnet no replied catesby the door of the chapterhouse was locked inside the treacherous villain did well to guard against my fury you provoked his resentment my son rejoined garnet but this is not a season for reproaches something must be done where is kelley at the suggestion catesby instantly darted to the spot where the seer had stood he was not there he then questioned the servants whose teeth were chattering with fright but they had neither heard him depart nor could tell anything about him and perceiving plainly from their trepidation that these men would lend no aid even if they did not join the assailants he returned to communicate his apprehensions to garnet during all this time the knocking and vociferations at the door had continued with increased violence and reverberated in hollow peals along the roof and aisles of the church the emergency was a fearful one catesby however had been too often placed in situations of peril and was too constitutionally brave to experience much uneasiness for himself but his apprehensions lest garnet should be captured and the sudden and mysterious disappearance of viviana almost distracted him persuading himself she might have fallen to the ground or that he had overlooked the precise spot where he had left her he renewed his search but with no better success than before and he was almost beginning to believe that some magic might have been practised to cause her disappearance when it occurred to him that she had been carried off by kelley fool that i was not to think of that before he exclaimed i have unintentionally aided their project by extinguishing the lights but now that i am satisfied she is gone i can devote my whole energies to the preservation of garnet they shall not capture us so easily as they anticipate with this he approached the priest and grasping his hand drew him noislessly along they had scarcely passed through the arched doorway in the screen and set foot within the nave when the clamour without ceased the next moment a thundering crash was heard the door burst open and a number of armed figures bearing torches with drawn swords in their hands rushed with loud vociferations into the church we must surrender my son cried garnet it will be useless to contend against that force but we may yet escape them rejoined catesby and glancing hastily round he perceived a small open door in the wall at the right and pointing it out to the priest hurried towards it on reaching it they found it communicated with a flight of stone steps evidently leading to the roof saved saved cried catesby triumphantly mount first father i will defend the passage the pursuers who saw the course taken by the fugitives set up a loud shout and ran as swiftly as they could in the same direction and by the time the latter had gained the door they were within a few yards of it garnet darted up the steps but catesby lingered to make fast the door and thus oppose some obstacle to the hostile party his efforts however were unexpectedly checked and on examination he found it was hooked to the wall at the back undoing the fastening the door swung to and he instantly bolted it overjoyed at his success and leaving his pursuers who at this moment arrived to vent their disappointment in loud menaces he hastened after garnet calling loudly to him he was answered from a small dark chamber on the right into which the priest had retreated we have but prolonged our torture groaned garnet i can find no outlet our foes will speedily force an entrance and we must then fall into their hands there must be some door opening upon the roof father rejoined catesby mount as high as you can and search carefully i will defend the stairs and will undertake to maintain my post against the whole rout thus urged garnet ascended the steps after the lapse of a few minutes during which the thundering at the door below increased and the heavy blows of some weighty implement directed against it were distinctly heard he cried i have found a door but the bolts are rustyi cannot move them use all your strength father shouted catesby who having planted himself with his drawn sword at an advantageous point was listening with intense anxiety to the exertions of the assailing party do not relax your efforts for a moment it is in vain my son rejoined garnet in accents of despair my hands are bruised and bleeding but the bolts stir not distraction cried catesby gnashing his teeth with rage let me try and he was about to hasten to the priests assistance when the door below was burst open with a loud crash and the assailants rushed up the steps the passage was so narrow that they were compelled to mount singly and catesbys was scarcely a vain boast when he said he could maintain his ground against the whole host shouting to garnet to renew his efforts he prepared for the assault reserving his petronels to the last he trusted solely to his rapier and leaning against the newel or circular column round which the stairs twined he was in a great measure defended from the weapons of his adversaries while they were completely exposed to his attack the darkness moreover in which he was enveloped offered an additional protection whereas the torches they carried made his mark certain as soon as the foremost of the band came within reach catesby plunged his sword into his breast and pushed him back with all his force upon his comrades the man fell heavily backwards dislodging the next in advance who in his turn upset his successor and so on till the whole band was thrown into confusion a discharge of firearms followed but sheltered by the newel catesby sustained no injury at this moment he was cheered by a cry from garnet that he had succeeded in forcing back the bolts terror having supplied him with a strength not his own and making another sally upon his assailants amid the disorder that ensued catesby retreated and rapidly tracking the steps reached the door through which the priest had already passed when within a short distance of the outlet catesby felt from the current of fresh air that saluted him that it opened upon the roof of the church nor was he deceived a few steps placed him upon the leads where he found garnet it is you my son cried the latter on beholding him i thought from the shouts you had fallen into the hands of the enemy no heaven be praised i am as yet safe and trust to deliver you out of their hands come with me to the battlements the battlements exclaimed garnet a leap from such a height as that were certain destruction it were so replied catesby dragging him along but trust to me and you shall yet reach the ground uninjured arrived at the battlements catesby leaned over them and endeavoured to ascertain what was beneath it was still so dark that he could scarcely discern any objects but those close to him but as far as he could trust his vision he thought he perceived a projecting building some twelve or fourteen feet below and calling to mind the form of the church which he had frequently seen and admired he remembered its chantries and had no doubt but it was the roof of one of them that he beheld if he could reach it the descent from thence would be easy and he immediately communicated the idea to garnet who shrank aghast from it little time however was allowed for consideration their pursuers had already scaled the stairs and were springing one after another upon the leads uttering the most terrible threats against the destroyer of their comrade hastily divesting himself of his cloak catesby clambered over the battlements and impelled by fear garnet threw off his robe and followed his example clinging to the grotesque stone waterspouts which projected below the battlements and placing the points of his feet upon the arches of the clerestory windows and thence upon the mullions and transom bars catesby descended in safety and then turned to assist his companion who was quickly by his side the most difficult and dangerous part of the descent had yet to be accomplished they were now nearly thirty feet from the ground and the same irregularities in the walls which had favoured them in the upper structure did not exist in the lower but their present position exposed as it was to their pursuers who having reached the point immediately overhead were preparing to fire upon them was too dangerous to allow of its occupation for a moment and garnet required no urging to make him clamber over the low embattled parapet descending a flying buttress that defended an angle of the building catesby who was possessed of great strength and activity was almost instantly upon the ground garnet was not so fortunate missing his footing he fell from a considerable height and his groans proclaimed that he had received some serious injury catesby instantly flew to him and demanded in a tone of the greatest anxiety whether he was much hurt my right arm is broken gasped the sufferer raising himself with difficulty what other injuries i have sustained i know not but every joint seems dislocated and my face is covered with blood heaven have pity on me as he spoke a shout of exultation arose from the hostile party who having heard garnets fall and the groans that succeeded it at once divined the cause and made sure of a capture a deep silence followed proving that they had quitted the roof and were hastening to secure their prey aware that it would take them some little time to descend the winding staircase and traverse the long aisle of the church catesby felt certain of distancing them but he could not abandon garnet who had become insensible from the agony of his fractured limb and lifting him carefully in his arms he placed him upon his shoulder and started at a swift pace towards the further extremity of the churchyard at the period of this history the western boundary of the collegiate church was formed by a precipitous sandstone rock of great height the base of which was washed by the waters of the irwell while its summit was guarded by a low stone wall in after years a range of small habitations was built upon this spot but they have been recently removed and the rock having been lowered a road now occupies their site nerved by desperation catesby who was sufficiently well acquainted with the locality to know whither he was shaping his course determined to hazard a descent which under calmer circumstances he would have deemed wholly impracticable his pursuers who issued from the church porch a few seconds after he had passed it saw him hurry towards the low wall edging the precipice and encumbered as he was with the priest vault over it not deeming it possible he would dare to spring from such a height they darted after him but they were deceived and could scarcely credit their senses when they found him gone by the light of their torches they perceived him shooting down the almost perpendicular side of the rock and the next moment a hollow plunge told that he had reached the water they stared at each other in mute astonishment will you follow him dick haughton observed one as soon as he had recovered his speech not i replied the fellow addressed i have no fancy for a broken neck follow him thyself if thou hast a mind to try the soundness of thy pate i warrant that rock will put it to the proof yet the feat has just been done and by one burthened with a wounded comrade into the bargain remarked the first speaker he must be the devil thats certain rejoined haughton and doctor dee himself is no match for him he has the devils luck thats certain cried a third soldier but hark he is swimming across the river we may yet catch him on the opposite bank come along comrades with this they rushed out of the churchyard made the best of their way to the bridge and crossing it flew to the bank of the river where they dispersed in every direction in search for the fugitive but they could not discover a trace of him or his wounded companion chapter xvii the rencounter catesby himself could scarcely tell how he accomplished his hairbreadth escape reckless almost of the result he slided down the rock catching at occasional irregularities as he descended the river was of great depth at this point and broke the force of his fall on rising he struck out a few yards and suffered himself to be carried down the stream he had never for one moment relinquished his hold of garnet and being an admirable swimmer found little difficulty in sustaining him with one arm while with the other he guided his course in the water in this way he reached the shore in safety about a hundred yards below the bridge by which means he avoided his pursuers who as has just been stated searched for him above it after debating with himself for a short time as to what course he should pursue he decided upon conveying garnet to the hall where he could procure restoratives and assistance and though he was fully sensible of the danger of this plan not doubting the mansion would be visited and searched by his pursuers before morning yet the necessity of warning guy fawkes outweighed every other consideration accordingly again shouldering the priest who though he had regained his sensibility was utterly unable to move he commenced his toilsome march and being frequently obliged to pause and rest himself more than an hour elapsed before he reached his destination it was just growing light as he crossed the drawbridge and seeing a horse tied to a tree and the gate open he began to fear the enemy had preceded him full of misgiving he laid garnet upon a heap of straw in an outbuilding and entered the house he found no one below though he glanced into each room he then noiselessly ascended the stairs with the intention of proceeding to guy fawkess chamber as he traversed the gallery he heard voices in one of the chambers the door of which was ajar and pausing to listen distinguished the tones of viviana filled with astonishment he was about to enter the room to inquire by what means she had reached the hall when he was arrested by the voice of her companion it was that of humphrey chetham maddened by jealousy catesbys first impulse was to rush into the room and stab his rival in the presence of his mistress but he restrained his passion by a powerful effort after listening for a few minutes intently to their conversation he found that chetham was taking leave and creeping softly downstairs stationed himself in the hall through which he knew his rival must necessarily pass chetham presently appeared his manner was dejected his looks downcast and he would have passed catesby without observing him if the latter had not laid his hand upon his shoulder mr catesby exclaimed the young merchant starting as he beheld the stern glance fixed upon him i thought you thought i was a prisoner no doubt interrupted catesby bitterly but you are mistaken i am here to confound you and your juggling and treacherous associate i do not understand you replied chetham i will soon make myself intelligible retorted catesby follow me to the garden i perceive your purpose mr catesby replied chetham calmly but it is no part of my principles to expose my life to ruffianly violence if you choose to lay aside this insolent demeanour which is more befitting an alsatian bully than a gentleman i will readily give you such explanation of my conduct as will fully content you and satisfy you that any suspicions you may entertain of me are unfounded coward exclaimed catesby striking him i want no explanation defend yourself or i will treat you with still greater indignity lead on then cried chetham i would have avoided the quarrel if i could but this outrage shall not pass unpunished as they quitted the hall viviana entered it and though she was greatly surprised by the appearance of catesby his furious gestures left her in no doubt as to his purpose she called to him to stop but no attention was paid by either party to her cries illustration guy fawkes protecting humphrey chetham from catesby on gaining a retired spot beneath the trees catesby without giving his antagonist time to divest himself of the heavy horsemans cloak with which he was encumbered and scarcely to draw his sword assaulted him the combat was furious on both sides but it was evident that the young merchant was no match for his adversary he maintained his ground however for some time with great resolution but being hotly pressed in retreating to avoid a thrust his foot caught in the long grass and he fell catesby would have passed his sword through his body if it had not been turned aside by another weapon it was that of guy fawkes who followed by martin heydocke had staggered towards the scene of strife reaching it just in time to save the life of humphrey chetham heaven be praised i am not too late he exclaimed put up your blade catesby or turn it against me chapter xviii the explanation uttering an exclamation of rage catesby turned fiercely upon fawkes and for a moment appeared disposed to accept his invitation to continue the combat with him but as he regarded the others haggard features and perceived in them the traces of his recent struggle with deathas he saw he was scarcely able to wield the blade he opposed against himhis wrath changed to compassion and he sheathed his sword by this time humphrey chetham had sprung to his feet and picking up his fallen weapon stood on his defence but finding that catesby meditated no further hostilities he returned it to the scabbard i owe my life to you he said to guy fawkes in a tone of deep gratitude you owe it to viviana radcliffe not to me returned fawkes feebly and leaning upon his sword for support had it not been for her cries i should have known nothing of this quarrel and i would now gladly learn what has occasioned it so would i added chetham for i am as ignorant as yourself how i have offended mr catesby i will tell you then returned catesby sternly you were a party to the snare set for us by dr dee from which i narrowly escaped with life and father garnet at the expense of a broken limb is garnet hurt demanded fawkes anxiously grievously replied catesby but he is out of the reach of his enemies of whom he added pointing to chetham one of the most malignant and treacherous now stands before you i am quite in the dark as to what has happened observed fawkes having only a few minutes ago been roused from my slumbers by the shrieks of viviana who entreated me to come and separate you but i cannot believe humphrey chetham so treacherous as you represent him so far from having any enmity towards father garnet observed chetham my anxious desire was to preserve him and with that view i was repairing to dr dee when i encountered mr catesby in the hall and before i could offer any explanation i was forced by his violence and insults into this combat is this the truth catesby asked fawkes something near it rejoined the latter but perhaps mr chetham will likewise inform you by whose agency viviana was transported hither from the collegiate church that inquiry ought rather to be made of the lady herself sir rejoined chetham coldly but as i am assured she would have no objection to my answering it i shall not hesitate to do so she was conveyed hither by kelley and an assistant who departed as soon as their task was completed indeed exclaimed catesby between his ground teeth but how chanced it sir that you arrived here so opportunely i might well refuse to answer a question thus insolently put rejoined chetham but to prevent further misunderstanding i will tell you that i came by vivianas invitation at midnight and ascertaining from my servant martin heydocke whom i found watching by the couch of guy fawkes the melancholy business on which she was engaged i determined to await her return which occurred about an hour afterwards in the manner i have just related i was in the courtyard when mistress viviana was brought back interposed martin heydocke who was standing at a respectful distance from the group and after kelley had delivered her to my charge i heard him observe in an under tone to his companion let us ride back as fast as we can and see what they have done with the prisoners they made sure of their prey before it was captured observed catesby bitterly but we have disappointed them dee and his associate may yet have reason to repent their perfidy you will do well not to put yourself again in their power observed humphrey chetham if you will be counselled by me you and guy fawkes will seek safety in instant flight and leave you with viviana rejoined catesby sarcastically she is in no present danger replied chetham but if it is thought fitting or desirable i will remain with her i do not doubt it returned catesby with a sneer but it is neither fitting nor desirable and hark ye young sir if you have indulged any expectations with regard to viviana radcliffe it is time you were undeceived she will never wed one of your degree nor of your faith i have her own assurance she will never wed at all replied chetham in an offended tone but had she not crushed my hopes by declaring she was vowed to a convent no menaces of yours who have neither right nor title thus to interfere should induce me to desist from my suit either resign all pretensions to her hand or prepare to renew the combat cried catesby fiercely no more of this interposed guy fawkes let us return to the house and adjust our differences there i have no further business here observed humphrey chetham having taken leave of viviana he added with much emotion i do not desire to meet her again it is well sir rejoined catesby yet stayyou mean us no treachery if you suspect me i will remain replied humphrey chetham on no account interposed guy fawkes i will answer for him with my life perhaps when i tell you i have procured the liberation of father oldcorne returned chetham and have placed him in security in ordsall cave you will admit that you have done me wrong i have been greatly mistaken in you sir i must own observed catesby advancing towards him and extending his hand but humphrey chetham folded his arms upon his breast and bowing coldly withdrew he was followed by martin heydocke and presently afterwards the tramp of his horses feet was heard crossing the drawbridge chapter xix the discovery tendering his arm to fawkes who was almost too feeble to walk unsupported catesby led him slowly to the hall on reaching it they met viviana in a state bordering upon distraction but her distress was speedily relieved by their assurances that the young merchant had departed unhurta statement immediately afterwards confirmed by the entrance of martin heydocke charged with a message from his master to her without communicating his design to the others and indeed almost shunning viviana catesby proceeded to the outbuilding where he had deposited garnet he found him in great pain and praying fervently to be released from his suffering do not despair father said catesby in as cheerful a tone as he could assume the worst is over viviana is in safety father oldcorne has escaped and is within a short distance of us and guy fawkes is fully able to undertake a journey of any distance you are our sole concern but i am assured if you will allow me to exercise the slight surgical skill i possess in your behalf that you will be able to accompany us do with me what you please my son groaned garnet but if my case is as desperate as i believe it i entreat you not to bestow any further care upon me and above all not to expose yourself to risk on my account our enemies are sure to pursue usand what matter if i am captured they will wreak their vengeance on a worthless carcassfor such i shall soon be but it would double the anguish i now endure if you and fawkes were to fall into their hands go then and leave me here to perish my dying moments will be cheered by the conviction that the great enterprisefor which alone i desire to livewill not be unaccomplished there is no need to leave you father replied catesby nor shall any consideration induce me to do so till i have rendered you every aid that circumstances will permit my son replied garnet faintly the most efficacious balm you can apply will be the certainty that you are in safety you say viviana is here fly with fawkes and leave me to her care she must go with us observed catesby uneasily not so my son returned garnet her presence will only endanger you she must not go and you must abandon all hopes of an union with her i would as soon abandon the great design itself returned catesby moodily if you persist in this you will ruin it rejoined garnet think of her no more bend your thoughts exclusively on the one grand object and be what you are chosen to be the defender and deliverer of our holy church i would gladly act as you advise me father replied catesby but i am spellbound by this maiden this is idle from you my son replied garnet reproachfully separate yourself from her and you will soon regain your former mastery over yourself well well father rejoined catesby the effort at least shall be made but her large possessions which would be so useful to our cause and which if i wedded her would be wholly devoted to itthink of what we lose father i have thought of it my son replied garnet but the consideration does not alter my opinion and if i possess any authority over you i strictly enjoin you not to proceed farther in the matter viviana never can be yours she shall be nevertheless muttered catesby and before many hours have elapsedif not by her own free will by force i have ever shown myself obedient to your commands father he added aloud and i shall not transgress them now heaven keep you in this disposition my dear son exclaimed garnet with a look of distrust and let me recommend you to remove yourself as soon as possible out of the way of temptation catesby muttered an affirmative and taking garnet in his arms conveyed him carefully to his own chamber and placing him on a couch examined his wounds which were not so serious as either he or the sufferer imagined and with no despicable skillfor the experiences of a soldiers life had given him some practicebandaged his broken arm and fomented his bruises this done garnet felt so much easier that he entreated catesby to send viviana to him and to make preparations for his own immediate departure feigning acquiescence catesby quitted the room but with no intention of complying with the request not a moment he felt must be lost if he would execute his dark design and after revolving many wild expedients an idea occurred to him it was to lure viviana to the cave where father oldcorne was concealed and he knew enough of the pliant disposition of the latter to be certain he would assent to his scheme no sooner did this plan occur to him than he hurried to the cell and found the priest as chetham had stated as he had foreseen it required little persuasion to induce oldcorne to lend his assistance to the forced marriage and he only feared the decided opposition they should encounter from viviana fear nothing then father said catesby in this solitary spot no one will hear her cries whatever resistance she may make perform the ceremony and leave the consequences to me the plan is desperate my son returned oldcorne but so are our fortunes and as viviana will not hear reason we have no alternative you swear that if you are once wedded to her all her possessions shall be devoted to the furtherance of the great cause all fatheri swear it rejoined catesby fervently enough replied oldcorne the sooner it is done the better it was then agreed between them that the plan least likely to excite suspicion would be for oldcorne to proceed to the hall and under some plea prevail upon viviana to return with him to the cave acting upon this arrangement they left the cell together shaping their course under the trees to avoid observation and while oldcorne repaired to the hall catesby proceeded to the stable and saddling the only steed left rode back to the cave and concealing the animal behind the brushwood entered the excavation some time elapsed before the others arrived and as in his present feverish state of mind moments appeared ages the suspense was almost intolerable at length he heard footsteps approaching and with a beating heart distinguished the voice of viviana the place was buried in profound darkness but oldcorne struck a light and set fire to a candle in a lantern the feeble glimmer diffused by it was not sufficient to penetrate the recesses of the cavern and catesby who stood at the farther extremity was completely sheltered from observation and now father observed viviana seating herself with her back towards catesby upon the stone bench once used by the unfortunate prophetess i would learn the communication you desire to make to me it must be something of importance since you would not disclose it at the hall it is daughter replied oldcorne who could scarcely conceal his embarrassment i have brought you hither where i am sure we shall be uninterrupted to confer with you on a subject nearest my heart your lamented father being taken from us i as his spiritual adviser aware of his secret wishes and intentions conceive myself entitled to assume his place i consider you in the light of a father dear sir replied viviana and will follow your advice as implicitly as i would that of him i have lost since i find you so tractable child returned oldcorne reassured by her manner i will no longer hesitate to declare the motive i had in bringing you hither you will recollect that i have of late strongly opposed your intention of retiring to a convent i know it father interrupted viviana but hear me out continued oldcorne recent events have strengthened my disapproval of the step you are now called upon to active duties and must take your share in the business of lifemust struggle and suffer like othersand not shrink from the burthen imposed upon you by heaven i do not shrink from it father replied viviana and if i were equal to the active life you propose i would not hesitate to embrace it but i feel i should sink under it not if you had one near you who could afford you that support which feeble woman ever requires returned oldcorne what mean you father inquired viviana fixing her dark eyes full upon him that you must marry daughter returned oldcorne unite yourself to some worthy man who will be to you what i have described and was it to tell me this that you brought me here asked viviana in a slightly offended tone it was daughter replied oldcorne but i have not yet done it is not only needful you should marry but your choice must be such as i who represent your father and have your welfare thoroughly at heart can approve you can find me a husband i doubt not remarked viviana coldly i have already found one returned oldcorne a gentleman suitable to you in rank religion yearsfor your husband should be older than yourself viviana i will not affect to misunderstand you father she replied you mean mr catesby you have guessed aright dear daughter rejoined oldcorne i thought i had made myself sufficiently intelligible on this point before father she returned true replied oldcorne but you are no longer as i have just laboured to convince you in the same position you were when the subject was formerly discussed to prevent further misunderstanding father rejoined viviana i now tell you that in whatever position i may be placed i will never under any circumstances wed mr catesby what are your objections to him daughter asked oldcorne they are numberless replied viviana but it is useless to particularize them i must pray you to change the conversation or you will compel me to quit you nay daughter if you thus obstinately shut your ears to reason i must use very different language towards you armed with parental authority i shall exact obedience to my commands i cannot obey you father replied viviana bursting into tearsindeed indeed i cannot my heart i have already told you is anothers he who has robbed you of it is a heretic rejoined oldcorne sternly and therefore your union with him is out of the question promise me you will wed mr catesby or in the name of your dead father i will invoke a curse upon your head promise me i say never replied viviana rising my father would never have enforced my compliance and i dread no curse thus impiously pronounced you are overstepping the bounds of your priestly office sir farewell as she moved to depart a strong grasp was laid on her arm and turning she beheld catesby you here sir she cried in great alarm ay replied catesby at last you are in my power viviana i would fain misunderstand you sir she rejoined trembling but your looks terrify me you mean no violence i mean that father oldcorne shall wed usand that too without a moments delay replied catesby sternly monster shrieked viviana you will notdare not commit this foul offence and if you dare father oldcorne will not assist you ah what means that sign i cannot be mistaken in you father you cannot be acting in concert with this wicked man save me from himsave me but the priest kept aloof and taking a missal from his vest hastily turned over the leaves viviana saw that her appeal to him was vain let me go she shrieked struggling with catesby you cannot force me to wed you whether i will or not and i will die rather than consent let me go i say helphelp and she made the cavern ring with her screams heed her not father shouted catesby who still held her fast but proceed with the ceremony oldcorne however appeared irresolute and viviana perceiving it redoubled her cries this will be no marriage father she said even if you proceed with it i will protest against it to all the world and you will be deprived of your priestly office for your share in so infamous a transaction you will think otherwise anon daughter replied oldcorne advancing towards them with the missal in his hand if it be no marriage observed catesby significantly the time will come when you may desire to have the ceremony repeated mr catesby cried viviana altering her manner as if she had taken a sudden resolution one word before you proceed with your atrocious purpose which must end in misery to us all there are reasons why you can never wed me ha exclaimed catesby starting is it so my son asked oldcorne uneasily pshaw exclaimed catesby she knows not what she says proceed father i have proofs that will confound you cried viviana breaking from him and darting towards the light she took from her bosom the packet given her by guy fawkes and tore it open a letter was within it and a miniature opening the letter she cast her eye rapidly over its contents and then looking up exclaimed in accents of delirious joy saved saved father oldcorne this man is married already catesby who had watched her proceedings in silent astonishment and was now advancing towards her recoiled as if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet can this be true cried the priest in astonishment let your own eyes convince you rejoined viviana handing him the letter i am satisfied returned oldcorne after he had glanced at it we have both been spared the commission of a great crime mr catesby it appears from this letter that you have a wife living in spain it is useless to deny it replied catesby but as you were ignorant of the matter the offence if any would have lain wholly at my door nor should i have repented of it if it had enabled me to achieve the object i have in view thank heaven it has gone no further exclaimed oldcorne daughter i humbly entreat your forgiveness how came that packet in your possession demanded catesby fiercely of viviana it was given me by guy fawkes she replied guy fawkes exclaimed catesby has he betrayed his friend he has proved himself your best friend by preventing you from committing a crime which would have entailed wretchedness on yourself and me returned viviana i have done with him and with all of you cried catesby with a fierce glance at oldcorne henceforth pursue your projects alone you shall have no further assistance from me i will serve the spaniard englishmen are not to be trusted so saying he rushed out of the cavern and seeking his horse mounted him and rode off at full speed how shall i obtain your forgiveness for my conduct in this culpable affair dear daughter said oldcorne with an imploring look at viviana by joining me in thanksgivings to the virgin for my deliverance replied viviana prostrating herself before the stone cross oldcorne knelt beside her and they continued for some time in earnest prayer they then arose and quitting the cave proceeded to the hall chapter xx the departure from the hall guy fawkes was as much surprised to hear of the sudden departure of catesby as he was concerned at the cause but he still thought it probable he would return in this expectation however he was disappointed the day wore on and no one came the uncertainty in which fawkes was kept added to his unwillingness to leave garnet still detained him in spite of the risk he ran at the hall and it was only when urged by viviana that he began seriously to reflect whither he should bend his steps towards evening garnet was so much better that he was able to sit up and he passed some hours in conference with oldcorne if i do not suffer a relapse he observed to the latter i will set out with guy fawkes tomorrow and we will proceed by easy stages to london i cannot but approve your resolution returned oldcorne for though so long a journey may be inconvenient and retard your recovery yet every hour you remain here is fraught with additional peril i will accompany you we shall both be safer in the capital and perhaps viviana now she will be no longer exposed to the persecutions of catesby will form one of the party i should not wonder replied garnet i shall be deeply concerned if catesby has really abandoned the enterprise but i cannot think it i did all i could to dissuade him from prosecuting this union knowing how hopeless it was and little thinking he would be rash enough to seek to accomplish it by force or that he would find an assistant in you say no more about it father i entreat you rejoined oldcorne the scheme failed as it deserved to do and i sincerely repent the share i was induced by catesbys artful representations to take in it if we have lost our leader we have still guy fawkes who is a host in himself and as true as the steel that hangs by his side we cannot spare catesby replied garnet with many faults he has one redeeming quality courage i am not sorry he has been thwarted in his present scheme as if he returns to us as i doubt not he will it will fix his mind steadily on the one object which should be ever before it give me your arm father i am glad to find i can walk though feebly that is well he added as they emerged upon the gallery i shall be able to reach vivianas chamber without further assistance do you descend and see that martin heydocke is on the watch in obedience to the injunctions of his superior oldcorne went in search of martin heydocke who had been stationed in the courtyard to give timely notice of any hostile approach but not finding him there he proceeded towards the drawbridge garnet meanwhile had reached the door of vivianas chamber which was slightly ajar and he was about to pass through it when he perceived that she was on her knees before guy fawkes whom she was addressing in the most passionate terms the latter was seated at a table with his head upon his hand in a thoughtful posture surprised at the sight and curious to hear what viviana could be saying garnet drew back to listen when you quit this house were the first words that caught the listeners ear we shall never meet again and oh let me have the consolation of thinking that in return for the devoted attachment you have shown me and the dangers from which you have preserved me i have preserved you from one equally imminent catesby from whatever motive has abandoned the conspiracy do you act likewise and the whole dreadful scheme will fall to the ground catesby cannot abandon it replied fawkes he is bound by ties that no human power can sunder and however he may estrange himself from us now when the time for action arrives rest assured he will not be absent illustration viviana radcliffe imploring guy fawkes to abandon the conspiracy it may be so replied viviana but i deny that the oath either he or you have taken is binding the deed you have sworn to do is evil and no vow however solemnly pronounced can compel you to commit crime avoid this sinavoid further connexion with those who would work your undoing and do not stain your soul with guilt from which it will never be cleansed you seek in vain to move me replied guy fawkes firmly my purpose is unalterable the tempest that clears away the pestilence destroys many innocent lives but it is not the less wholesome on that account our unhappy land is choked with the pestilence of heresy and must be freed from it cost what it will and suffer who may the wrongs of the english catholics imperatively demand redress and since it is denied us we must take it oppression can go no farther nor endurance hold out longer if this blow be not struck we shall have no longer a religion and how comes it viviana that you a zealous catholic whose father perished by these very oppressors and who are yourself in danger from them can seek to turn me from my purpose because i know it is wrongful she replied i have no desire to avenge the death of my slaughtered father still less to see our religion furthered by the dreadful means you propose in his own due season the lord will redress our wrongs the lord has appointed me one of the ministers of his vengeance cried fawkes in a tone of enthusiasm do not deceive yourself returned viviana it is not by heaven but by the powers of darkness that you are incited to this deed do not persevere in this fatal course she continued clasping her hands together and gazing imploringly in his face do notdo not guy fawkes continued in the same attitude as before with his gaze turned upwards and apparently lost in thought have i no power to move you cried viviana her eyes streaming with tears none whatever replied guy fawkes firmly then you are lost she rejoined if it is heavens will i am answered fawkes but at least i believe i am acting rightly and rest assured you are so my son cried garnet throwing open the door and stepping into the room i have overheard your conversation and i applaud your resolution you need have no fears of me father replied fawkes i do not lightly undertake a project but once embarked in it nothing can turn me aside in this case your determination is wisely formed my son returned garnet and if viviana will ever give me an opportunity of fully discussing the matter i am sure i can satisfy her you are in the right i will discuss it with you whenever you think proper she replied but no arguments will ever convince me that your project is approved by heaven let it pass now daughter rejoined garnet enough has been said on the subject i came hither to tell guy fawkes that if our enemies permit us to pass the night without molestation as heaven grant they may i think i shall be strong enough to set out with him tomorrow when i propose we should journey together to london agreed replied fawkes father oldcorne will accompany us pursued garnet and i too will go with you if you will permit me said viviana i cannot remain here and i have no further fears of mr catesby doctor dee told me my future fate was strangely mixed up with that of guy fawkes i know not how it may be but i will not abandon him while there is a hope to cling to viviana radcliffe rejoined guy fawkes coldly deeply as i feel the interest you take in me i think it right to tell you that no efforts you can use will shake me from my purpose if i live i will execute my design while i live i will urge you to it remarked garnet and while i live i will dissuade you from it added viviana we shall see who will obtain the victory we shall replied garnet smiling confidently hear me further continued viviana i do not doubt that your zeal is disinterested yet still your mode of life and the difficulties in which you are placed may not unnaturally influence your conduct that this may no longer be the case i here place part of my fortune at your disposal i require little or nothing myself but i would if possible save one to whom i owe so much and whom i value so much from destruction i fully appreciate your generosityto give it its lightest termviviana returned guy fawkes in a voice of deep emotion under any circumstances i should reject itunder the present i do so the more positively because the offer kind as it is seems to imply that my poverty leads me to act contrary to my principles gold has no power over me i regard it as dross and when i could easily have won it i neglected the opportunity as no reward would ever induce me to commit an action my conscience disapproved so none will deter me from a purpose which i regard as my duty enough replied viviana sadly i will no longer question your motives or oppose your plan but will pray heaven to open your eyes to the truth your conduct is in all respects worthy of you daughter observed garnet kindly you have rejected one offer continued viviana looking at fawkes but i trust you will not decline that i am about to propose to you what is it asked fawkes in some surprise it is that i may be permitted to regard you as a father replied viviana with some hesitation having lost my own father i feel i need some protector and i would gladly make choice of you if you will accept the office i willingly accede to your request and am much flattered by it viviana replied fawkes i am a homeless man and a friendless and the affection of such a being as yourself will fill up the only void in my heart but i am wedded to the great cause i can never be more to you than a father nay i ask nothing more she replied blushing deeply having thus arranged the terms upon which we shall travel observed garnet with a smile nothing is needed but to prepare for our journey we start early tomorrow morning i shall be ready at daybreak replied viviana and i am ready now added guy fawkes in my opinion we run great risk in remaining here another night but be it as you will at this moment they were interrupted by the entrance of father oldcorne who with a countenance of great alarm informed them he could nowhere find martin heydocke do you suspect any treachery on his part asked garnet of viviana i have always found him trustworthy she answered and his father was my fathers oldest servant i cannot think he would betray us at the same time i must admit his disappearance at this juncture looks suspicious if my strength were equal to it returned guy fawkes i would keep watch throughout the night but that might prevent me from accompanying you tomorrow my advice i repeat isto set out at once this opinion however was overruled by garnet and viviana who did not think the danger so urgent and attributed the absence of martin heydocke to some unimportant cause guy fawkes made no further remonstrance and it was agreed they should start as originally proposed at daybreak the party then separated and viviana wandered alone over the old house taking a farewell which she felt would be her last of every familiar object few things were as she had known them but even in their present forlorn state they were dear to her and the rooms she trod though dismantled were the same she had occupied in childhood there is no pang more acute to a sensitive nature than that occasioned by quitting an abode or spot endeared by early recollections and associations to which we feel a strong presentiment we shall never return viviana experienced this feeling in its full force and she lingered in each room as if she had not the power to leave it her emotions at length became so overpowering that to relieve them she strolled forth into the garden here new objects awakened her attention and recalled happier times with painful distinctness twilight was fast deepening and viewed through this dim and softened medium everything looked as of old and produced a tightening and stifling sensation in her breast that nothing but a flood of tears could remove the flowers yielded forth their richest scents and the whole scene was such as she had often beheld it in times long ago when sorrow was wholly unknown to her perfumes it is well known exercise a singular influence over the memory a particular odour will frequently call up an event and a long train of circumstances connected with the time when it was first inhaled without being aware whence it arose viviana felt a tide of recollections pressing upon her which she would have willingly repressed but which it was out of her power to control her tears flowed abundantly and at length with a heart somewhat lightened of its load she arose from the bench on which she had thrown herself and proceeded along a walk to gather a few flowers as memorials of the place in this way she reached the further end of the garden and was stooping to pluck a spray of some fragrant shrub when she perceived the figure of a man behind a tree at a little distance from her from his garb which was that of a soldier she instantly knew he was an enemy and though greatly alarmed she had the courage not to scream but breaking off the branch she uttered a careless exclamation and slowly retraced her steps she half expected to hear that the soldier was following her and prepared to start off at full speed to the house but deceived by her manner he did not stir on reaching the end of the walk she could not resist the inclination to look back and glancing over her shoulder perceived the man watching her but as she moved he instantly withdrew his head her first step on reaching the house was to close and fasten the door her next to hasten to guy fawkess chamber where she found him together with garnet and oldcorne all three were astounded at the intelligence agreeing that an attack was intended and that a large force was in all probability concealed in the garden awaiting only the arrival of night to surprise and seize them the disappearance of the younger heydocke was no longer a mystery he had been secured and carried off by the hostile party to prevent him from giving the alarm the emergency was a fearful one and it excited consternation amongst all except guy fawkes who preserved his calmness i foresaw we should be attacked tonight he said and i am therefore not wholly unprepared our only chance is to steal out unobserved for resistance would be in vain as their force is probably numerous and i am as helpless as an infant while father garnets broken arm precludes any assistance from him the subterranean passage leading from the oratory to the further side of the moat having been stopped up by the pursuivant and his band it will be necessary to cross the drawbridge and as soon as it grows sufficiently dark we must make the attempt we have no horses and must trust to our own exertions for safety catesby would now be invaluable it is not his custom to desert his friends at the season of their greatest need great as is my danger observed viviana i would rather so far as i am concerned that he were absent than owe my preservation to him i have no fears for myself and my only fears are for you rejoined fawkes half an hour of intense anxiety was now passed by the party garnet was restless and uneasy oldcorne betrayed his agitation by unavailing lamentations by listening to every sound and by constantly rushing to the windows to reconnoitre until he was checked by fawkes who represented to him the folly of his conduct viviana though ill at ease did not allow her terror to appear but endeavoured to imitate the immoveable demeanour of guy fawkes who always became more collected in proportion to the danger by which he was threatened at the expiration of the time above mentioned it had become quite dark and desiring his companions to follow him guy fawkes drew his sword and grasping vivianas hand led the way down stairs before opening the door he listened intently and hearing no sound issued cautiously forth the party had scarcely gained the centre of the court when a caliver was discharged at them which though it did no damage served as a signal to the rest of their foes guy fawkes who had never relinquished his hold of viviana now pressed forward as rapidly as his strength would permit and the two priests followed but loud shouts were raised on the drawbridge and it was evident it was occupied by the enemy uncertain what to do guy fawkes halted and was about to return to the house when a shout from behind told him their retreat was intercepted in this dilemma there was nothing for it but to attempt to force a passage across the drawbridge or to surrender at discretion and though guy fawkes would not at other seasons have hesitated to embrace the former alternative he knew that his strength was not equal to it now while he was internally resolving not to yield himself with life and supporting viviana who clung closely to him the clatter of hoofs was heard rapidly approaching along the avenue and presently afterwards two horsemen galloped at full speed toward the drawbridge the noise had likewise attracted the attention of the enemy who apprehensive of a rescue prepared to stop them but the tremendous pace of the riders rendered this impossible a few blows were exchanged a few shots fired and they had crossed the drawbridge who goes there shouted guy fawkes as the horsemen approached him it is the voice of guy fawkes cried the foremost whose tones proclaimed it was catesby they are here he cried reining in his steed where is viviana vociferated his companion who was no other than humphrey chetham herehere replied guy fawkes with the quickness of thought the young merchant was by her side and in another moment she was placed on the saddle before him and borne at a headlong pace across the drawbridge follow me cried catesby i will clear a passage for you once across the drawbridge you are safe a hundred yards down the avenue on the right you will find a couple of horses tied to a tree quick quick as he spoke a shot whizzed past his head and a tumultuous din in the rear told that their pursuers were close upon them striking spurs into his steed catesby dashed forward and dealing blows right and left cleared the drawbridge of its occupants many of whom leaped into the moat to escape his fury his companions were close at his heels and got over the bridge in safety flyfly cried catesbyto the horsesthe horses i will check all pursuit so saying and while the others flew towards the avenue he faced his opponents and making a desperate charge upon them drove them backwards in this conflict though several shots were fired and blows aimed at him on all sides he sustained no injury but succeeded in defending the bridge sufficiently long to enable his friends to mount he then rode off at full speed and found the party waiting for him at the end of the avenue father oldcorne was seated on the same steed as his superior after riding with them upwards of a mile humphrey chetham dismounted and resigning his horse to viviana bade her farewell and disappeared and now to london cried catesby striking into a road on the right and urging his steed to a rapid pace ay to londonto the parliament house echoed fawkes following him with the others end of the first book illustration guy fawkes and catesby landing the powder book the second the discovery the next point to be considered is the means to compass and work these designs these means were most cruel and damnableby mining and by thirtysix barrels of powder having crows of iron stones and wood laid upon the barrels to have made the breach the greater lord what a wind what a fire what a motion and commotion of earth and air would there have beensir edward cokes speech on the trial of the conspirators in the gunpowder plot chapter i the landing of the powder towards the close of the sixth day after their departure from ordsall hall the party approached the capital the sun was setting as they descended highgate hill and the view of the ancient and then most picturesque city was so enchanting that viviana who beheld it for the first time entreated her companions to pause for a few minutes to allow her to contemplate it from the spot where they halted the country was completely open to clerkenwell and only a few scattered habitations lay between them and the old grey ramparts of the city with their gates and fortifications which were easily discernible even at that distance above them rose the massive body and central tower of saint pauls cathedrala structure far surpassing that which has succeeded itwhile amid the innumerable gables pointed roofs and twisted chimneys of the houses sprang a multitude of lesser towers and spires lending additional beauty to the scene viviana was enraptured and while gazing on the prospect almost forgot her sorrows guy fawkes and catesby who were a little in advance of the others turned their gaze westward and the former observed to his companion the sun is setting over the parliament house the sky seems stained with blood it looks portentous of what is to follow i would gladly behold the explosion from this hill or from yon heights replied catesby pointing towards hampstead it will be a sight such as man has seldom seen i shall never live to witness it exclaimed guy fawkes in a melancholy tone what still desponding returned catesby reproachfully i thought since you had fully recovered from your wound you had shaken off your fears you misunderstand me replied fawkes i mean that i shall perish with our foes why so cried catesby there will be plenty of time to escape after you have fired the train i shall not attempt it rejoined fawkes in a sombre voice i will abide the result in the vault if i perish it will be a glorious death better live to see the regeneration of our faith and our restoration to our rights rejoined catesby but we will speak of this hereafter here comes garnet where do you propose we should lodge tonight asked the latter riding up at the house at lambeth where the powder is deposited returned catesby will it be safe asked garnet uneasily we shall be safer there than elsewhere father replied catesby if it is dark enough tonight fawkes and i will remove a portion of the powder but we are losing time we must pass through the city before the gates are closed in this suggestion garnet acquiesced and calling to viviana to follow themfor since his late atrocious attempt catesby had not exchanged a word or look with her but during the whole of the journey kept sedulously aloofthe whole party set forward and proceeding at a brisk pace soon reached the walls of the city passing through cripplegate they shaped their course towards london bridge viviana was filled with astonishment at all she saw the multitude and magnificence of the shops compared with such as she had previously seen the crowds in the streetsfor even at that hour they were thronged the varied dresses of the passengersthe sober garb of the merchant contrasting with the showy cloak the preposterous ruff swelling hose plumed cap and swaggering gait of the gallant or the ruffler the brawls that were constantly occurring the number of signs projecting from the dwellings all she witnessed or heard surprised and amused her and she would willingly have proceeded at a slower pace to indulge her curiosity had not her companions urged her onward as they were crossing eastcheap in the direction of crookedlane a man suddenly quitted the footpath and rushing towards garnet seized his bridle and cried i arrest you you are a romish priest it is false knave returned garnet i am as good a protestant as thyself and am just arrived with my companions from a long journey your companions are all rank papists rejoined the stranger you yourself are father garnet superior of the jesuits and if i am not deceived the person next you is father oldcorne also of that order if i am wrong you can easily refute the charge come with me to the council if you refuse i will call assistance from the passengers garnet saw he was lost if he did not make an immediate effort at selfpreservation and resolving to be beforehand with his assailant he shouted at the top of his voice help help my masters this villain would rob me of my purse he is a romish priest vociferated the stranger i call upon you to assist me to arrest him while the passengers scarcely knowing what to make of these contradictory statements flocked round them guy fawkes who was a little in advance of catesby rode back and seeing how matters stood instantly drew a petronel and with the buttend felled the stranger to the ground thus liberated garnet struck spurs into his steed and the whole party dashed off at a rapid pace shouts were raised by the bystanders a few of whom started in pursuit but the speed at which the fugitives rode soon bore them out of danger by this time they had reached london bridge and viviana in some degree recovered from the fright caused by the recent occurrence ventured to look around her she could scarcely believe she was crossing a bridge so completely did the tall houses give it the appearance of a street and if it had not been for occasional glimpses of the river caught between the openings of these lofty habitations she would have thought her companions had mistaken the road as they approached the ancient gateway afterwards denominated traitors tower at the southwark side of the bridge she remarked with a shudder the dismal array of heads garnishing its spikes and pointing them out to fawkes cried heaven grant yours may never be amongst the number fawkes made no answer but dashed beneath the low and gloomy arch of the gate striking into a street on the right the party skirted the walls of saint saviours church and presently drew near the globe theatre above which floated its banner adjoining it was the old beargardenthe savage inmates of which made themselves sufficiently audible garnet hastily pointed out the firstmentioned place of amusement to viviana as they passed it and her reading having made her well acquainted with the noble dramas produced at that unpretending establishmentlittle better than a barn in comparison with a modern playhouseshe regarded it with deep interest another theatrethe swanspeedily claimed her attention and leaving it behind they came upon the open country it was now growing rapidly dark and catesby turning off into a narrow lane on the right shouted to his companions to keep near him the tract of land they were traversing was flat and marshy the air was damp and unwholesomefor the swamp had not been drained as in later timesand the misty exhalations arising from it added to the obscurity catesby however did not relax his pace and his companions imitated his example another turn on the right seemed to bring them still nearer the river and involved them in a thicker fog all at once catesby stopped and cried we should be near the house and yet this fog perplexes me stay here while i search for it if you leave us we shall not readily meet again rejoined fawkes but the caution was unheeded catesby having already disappeared a few moments afterwards fawkes heard the sound of a horses hoofs approaching him and thinking it was catesby he hailed the rider the horseman made no answer but continued to advance towards them just then the voice of catesby was heard at a little distance shouting i was right it is here the party then hastened in the direction of the cry and perceived through the gloom a low building before the door of which catesby who had dismounted was standing a stranger is amongst us observed fawkes in an under tone as he rode up where is he demanded catesby hastily here replied a voice but fear nothing i am a friend i must have stronger assurance than that replied catesby who are you robert keyes replied the other do you not know my voice in good truth i did not rejoined catesby and you have spoken just in time your arrival is most opportune but what brings you here tonight the same errand as yourself i conclude catesby replied keyes i came here to see that all was in safety but who have you with you let us enter the house and you shall learn replied catesby with this he tapped thrice at the door in a peculiar manner and presently a light was seen through the windows and a voice from within demanded who knocked your master replied catesby upon this the door was instantly unbarred after a hasty greeting between catesby and his servant whom he addressed as thomas bates the former inquired whether aught had occurred during his absence and was answered that except an occasional visit from mr percy one of the conspirators no one had been near the house everything being in precisely the same state he had left it that is well replied catesby now then to dispose of the horses all the party having dismounted their steeds were led to a stable at the back of the premises by catesby and bates while the others entered the house it was a small meanlooking habitation standing at a short distance from the riverside on the skirts of lambeth marsh and its secluded situation and miserable appearance seldom induced any one to visit it on one side was a deep muddy sluice communicating with the river within it possessed but slight accommodation and only numbered four apartments one of the best of these was assigned to viviana and she retired to it as soon as it could be prepared for her reception garnet who still carried his arm in a sling but who was in other respects almost recovered from his accident tendered every assistance in his power and would have remained with her but she entreated to be left alone on descending to the lower room he found catesby who having left bates in care of the horses produced such refreshments as they had brought with them these were scanty enough but a few flasks of excellent wine which they found within the house made some amends for the meagre repast viviana was solicited by guy fawkes to join them but she declined alleging that she was greatly fatigued and about to retire to rest their meal ended catesby proposed that they should ascertain the condition of the powder as he feared it might have suffered from being so long in the vault before making this examination the door was carefully barred the shutters of the windows closed and guy fawkes placed himself as sentinel at the door a flag beneath the grate in which a fire was never kindled was then raised and disclosed a flight of steps leading to a vault beneath catesby having placed a light in a lantern descended with keyes but both garnet and oldcorne refused to accompany them the vault was arched and lofty and strange to say for its situation drya circumstance owing in all probability to the great thickness of the walls on either side were ranged twenty barrels filled with powder and at the further end stood a pile of arms consisting of pikes rapiers demilances petronels calivers corslets and morions removing one of the barrels from its station catesby forced open the lid and examined its contents which he found perfectly dry and uninjured it is fit for use he observed with a significant smile as he exhibited a handful of the powder to keyes who stood at a little distance with the lantern if it will keep as well in the cellar beneath the parliament house our foes will soon be nearer heaven than they would ever be if left to themselves when do you propose to transport it across the river asked keyes tonight replied catesby it is dark and foggy and fitting for the purpose bates he shouted and at the call his servant instantly descended is the wherry at her moorings she is your worship replied bates you must cross the river instantly then rejoined catesby and proceed to the dwelling adjoining the parliament house which we hired from ferris here is the key examine the premisesand bring word whether all is secure bates was about to depart when keyes volunteering to accompany him they left the house together having fastened down the lid of the cask catesby summoned fawkes to his assistance and by his help as many barrels as could be safely stowed in the boat were brought out of the vault more than two hours elapsed before bates returned he was alone and informed them that all was secure but that keyes had decided on remaining where he wasit being so dark and foggy that it was scarcely possible to cross the river i had some difficulty in landing he added and got considerably out of my course i never was out on so dark a night before it is the better for us rejoined catesby we shall be sure to escape observation in this opinion guy fawkes concurred and they proceeded to transport the powder to the boat which was brought up the sluice within a few yards of the door this done and the barrels covered with a piece of tarpaulin they embarked and fawkes seizing an oar propelled the skiff along the narrow creek as bates had stated the fog was so dense that it was wholly impossible to steer correctly and fawkes was therefore obliged to trust to chance as to the course he took however having fully regained his strength he rowed with great swiftness and as far as he could judge had gained the midstream when before he could avoid it he came in violent contact with another boat oversetting it and plunging its occupants in the stream disregarding the hints and even menaces of catesby who urged him to proceed fawkes immediately lay upon his oars and as the water was perfectly smooth succeeded without much difficulty in extricating the two men from their perilous situation their boat having drifted down the stream could not be recovered the chief of these personages was profuse in his thanks to his deliverers whom he supposed were watermen and they took care not to undeceive him you may rely upon my gratitude he said and when i tell you i am the earl of salisbury you will be satisfied i have the means of evincing it the earl of salisbury exclaimed catesby who was seated by fawkes having taken one of the oars is it possible i have been on secret state business replied the earl and did not choose to employ my own barge i was returning to whitehall when your boat struck against mine it is our bitterest enemy observed catesby in an under tone to fawkes fate has delivered him into our hands what are you about to do demanded fawkes observing that his companion no longer pulled at the oar shoot him replied catesby keep still while i disengage my petronel it shall not be returned fawkes laying a firm grasp upon his arm let him perish with the others if we suffer him to escape now we may never have such a chance again rejoined catesby i will shoot him i say you shall not rejoined fawkes his hour is not yet come what are you talking about my masters demanded the earl who was shivering in his wet garments nothing replied catesby hastily i will throw him overboard he whispered to fawkes again i say you shall not replied the latter i see what you are afraid of cried the earl you are smugglers you have got some casks of distilled waters on board and are afraid i may report you fear nothing land me near the palace and count upon my gratitude our course lies in a different direction replied catesby sternly if your lordship lands at all it must be where we choose but i have to see the king tonight i have some important papers to deliver to him respecting the papists replied salisbury indeed exclaimed catesby we must at least have those papers he observed in a whisper to fawkes that is a different affair replied fawkes they may prove serviceable to us my lord observed catesby by a strange chance you have fallen into the hands of catholics you will be pleased to deliver these papers to us ah villains would you rob me cried the earl you shall take my life sooner we will take both if you resist replied catesby in a menacing tone nay then returned salisbury attempting to draw his sword we will see who will obtain the mastery we are equally matched come on i fear you not but the waterman who had rowed the earl was not of equal courage with his employer and refused to take part in the conflict it will be useless to contend with us cried catesby relinquishing the oar to fawkes and springing forward i must have those papers he added seizing the earl by the throat or i will throw you overboard i am mistaken in you returned salisbury you are no common mariner it matters not who or what i am rejoined catesby fiercely your papers or you die finding it in vain to contend with his opponent the earl was fain to yield and reluctantly produced a packet from his doublet and delivered it to him you will repent this outrage villain he said your lordship will do well to recollect you are still in my power rejoined catesby one thrust of my sword will wipe off some of the injuries you have inflicted on our suffering party i have heard your voice before cried salisbury you shall not escape me your imprudence has destroyed you retorted catesby clutching the earls throat more tightly and shortening his sword with the intent to plunge it into his breast hold exclaimed fawkes grasping his arm and preventing the blow i have already said you shall not slay him you are in possession of his papers what more would you have his life replied catesby struggling to liberate his arm let him swear not to betray us rejoined fawkes if he refuses i will not stay your hand you hear what my companion says my lord cried catesby will you swear to keep silence as to what has just occurred after a moments hesitation salisbury assented and catesby relinquished his grasp during this time the boat had drifted considerably down the stream and in spite of the darkness catesby noticed with some uneasiness that they were approaching more than one vessel the earl of salisbury also perceived this and raised a cry for help but was instantly checked by catesby who took a seat beside him and placing the point of his rapier at his breast swore he would stab him if he made any further clamour the threat and the dangerous propinquity of his enemy effectually silenced the earl and catesby directed fawkes to make for the shore as quickly as he could his injunctions were obeyed and fawkes plied the oars with so much goodwill that in a few minutes the wherry struck against the steps which projected far into the water a little to the right of the star chamber precisely on the spot where westminster bridge now stands here the earl and his companion were allowed to disembark and they had no sooner set foot on land than guy fawkes pushed off the boat and rowed as swiftly as he could towards the centre of the stream he then demanded of catesby whether he should make for the parliament house or return i scarcely know what to advise replied catesby i do not think the earl will attempt pursuit and yet i know not the papers we have obtained may be important cease rowing for a moment and let us listen guy fawkes complied and they listened intently but could only hear the rippling of the current against the sides of the skiff we have nothing to fear observed catesby he will not pursue us or he cannot find a boat as he spoke the glimmer of torches was visible on the shore and the plunge of oars into the water convinced him his opinion was erroneous what course shall we take inquired fawkes i care not replied catesby sullenly if i had had my own way this would not have happened have no fears replied fawkes rowing swiftly down the stream we shall easily escape we will not be taken alive returned catesby seating himself on one of the barrels and hammering against the lid with the buttend of his petronel i will sooner blow us all to perdition than he shall capture us you are right replied fawkes by my patron saint james he is taking the same course as ourselves well let him board us replied catesby i am ready for him do as you think proper if the worst occurs returned fawkes but if we make no noise i am assured we shall not be perceived with this he ceased rowing and suffered the boat to drop down the stream as illluck would have it it seemed as if the hostile bark had struck completely into their track and aided by the current and four sturdy rowers was swiftly approaching the earl will be upon us in a few minutes replied catesby if you have any prayers to offer recite them quickly for i swear i will be as good as my word i am ever prepared for death replied fawkes ha we are saved this last exclamation was occasioned by his remarking a large barge towards which they were rapidly drifting what are you about to do cried catesbyleap on board and abandon the skiff together with its contents no replied fawkes sit still and leave the rest to me by this time they had approached the barge which was lying at anchor and guy fawkes grasping at a boathook fixed it in the vessel as they passed and drew their own boat close to its sideso close in fact that it could not be distinguished from it the next moment the chase came up and they distinctly perceived the earl of salisbury seated in the stern of the boat holding a torch as he approached the barge he held the light towards it but the skiff being on the offside entirely escaped notice when the chase had got to a sufficient distance to be out of hearing the fugitives rowed swiftly in the contrary direction not judging it prudent to land they continued to ply the oars until fatigue compelled them to desist and they had placed some miles between them and their pursuers long before this the earl must have given up the chase observed catesby we must return before daybreak and either land our powder near the parliament house or take it back to the vault at lambeth we shall run equal risk either way replied fawkes and having ventured thus far we may as well go through with it i am for landing at westminster and i rejoined catesby i do not like giving up a project when i have once undertaken it you speak my sentiments exactly returned fawkes westminster be it after remaining stationary for about an hour they rowed back again and aided by the stream in a short time reached their destination the fog had in a great degree cleared off and day began to break as they approached the stairs leading to the parliament house though this was not what they desired inasmuch as the light added to the risk they would have run in landing the powder it enabled them to ascertain that no one was on the watch running swiftly in towards a sort of wharf protected by a roofed building catesby leapt ashore and tied the skiff to a ring in the steps he then desired fawkes to hand out the powder as quickly as he could the order was promptly obeyed and in a few minutes several barrels were on the strand had you not better fetch keyes to help us while i get out the rest observed fawkes catesby assented and hurrying to the house found keyes who was in great alarm about them he instantly accompanied the other to the wharf and by their united efforts the powder was expeditiously and safely removed chapter ii the traitor the habitation to which the powder was conveyed adjoined as has already been stated the parliament house and stood at the southwest corner of that structure it was a small building two stories high with a little garden attached to it surrounded by lofty walls and belonged to whinneard the keeper of the royal wardrobe by whom it was let to a person named ferris from the latter it was hired by thomas percy one of the conspirators and a relative of the earl of northumberlandof whom it will be necessary to speak more fully hereafterfor the purpose to which it was now put having bestowed the barrels of powder carefully in the cellar and fastened the door of the house and the gardengate after them the trio returned to the boat and rowed back to lambeth where they arrived without being noticed they then threw themselves upon the floor and sought some repose after their fatigue it was late in the day before they awoke garnet and oldcorne had been long astir but viviana had not quitted her chamber catesbys first object was to examine the packet he had obtained from the earl of salisbury and withdrawing to a corner he read over the papers one by one carefully guy fawkes watched his countenance as he perused them but he asked no questions many of the documents appeared to have little interest for catesby tossed them aside with an exclamation of disappointment at length however a small note dropped from the bundle catesby picked it up opened it and his whole expression changed his brow grew contracted and springing to his feet he uttered an ejaculation of rage crying it is as i suspected we have traitors among us whom do you suspect cried fawkes tresham cried catesby in a voice of thunderthe fawning wily lying tresham fool that i was to league him with us he is your own kinsman observed garnet he is replied catesby but were he my own brother he should die here is a letter from him to lord mounteagle which has found its way to the earl of salisbury hinting that a plot is hatching against the state and offering to give him full information of it traitor false perjured traitor cried fawkes he must die he shall fall by my hand rejoined catesby stay a plan occurs to me he cannot be aware that this letter is in my possession i will send bates to bid him come hither we will then charge him with his criminality and put him to death he deserves severe punishment no doubt replied garnet but i am unwilling you should proceed to the last extremities with him there is no alternative father replied catesby our safety demands his destruction garnet returned no answer but bowed his head sorrowfully upon his breast bates was then despatched to tresham and preparations were made by the three lay conspirators for executing their fell design it was agreed that on his arrival tresham should be seized and disarmed and after being interrogated by catesby touching the extent of his treachery should be stabbed by guy fawkes this being resolved upon it became a question how they should act in the interim it was possible that after the loss of his papers some communication might take place between the earl of salisbury and lord mounteagle and through the latter with tresham thus prepared on the arrival of bates tresham seeing through their design instead of accompanying him might give information of their retreat to the officers the contingency was by no means improbable and it was urged so strongly by garnet that catesby began to regret his precipitancy in sending the message still his choler was so greatly roused against tresham that he resolved to gratify his vengeance at any risk if he betrays us and brings the officers here we shall know how to act he remarked to fawkes there is that below which will avenge us on them all true replied fawkes but i trust we shall not be obliged to resort to it soon after this bates returned with a message from tresham stating that he would be at the rendezvous at nightfall and that he had important disclosures to make to them he desired them moreover to observe the utmost caution and not to stir abroad he may perhaps be able to offer an explanation of his conduct observed keyes impossible returned catesby but he shall not die without a hearing that is all i desire returned keyes while the others were debating upon the interrogations they should put to tresham and further examining the earl of salisburys papers garnet repaired to vivianas chamber and informed her what was about to take place she was filled with consternation and entreated to be allowed to see guy fawkes for a few moments alone moved by her supplications garnet complied and presently afterwards fawkes entered the room you have sent for me viviana he said what would you i have just heard you are about to put one of your companions to death she replied it must not be viviana radcliffe returned fawkes by your own desire you have mixed yourself up with my fortunes i will not now discuss the prudence of the step you have taken but i deem it necessary to tell you once for all that any attempts to turn me from the line of conduct i have marked out to myself will fail tresham has betrayed us and he must pay the penalty of his treason but not with his life replied viviana do you not now perceive into what enormities this fatal enterprise will lead you it is not one crime alone that you are about to commit but many you constitute yourselves judges of your companion and without allowing him to defend himself take his life disguise it as you may it is assassinationcoldblooded assassination his life is justly forfeited replied guy fawkes sternly when he took the oath of secrecy and fidelity to our league he well knew what the consequences would be if he violated it he has done so he has compromised our safety nay he has sold us to our enemies and nothing shall save him if this is so replied viviana how much better would it be to employ the time now left in providing for your safety than in contriving means of vengeance upon one who will be sufficiently punished for his baseness by his own conscience even if you destroy him you will not add to your own security while you will commit a foul and needless crime equal if not exceeding in atrocity that you seek to punish viviana replied fawkes in an angry tone in an evil hour i consented to your accompanying me i now repent my acquiescence but having passed my word i cannot retract you waste time and exhaust my patience and your own by these unavailing supplications when i embarked in this enterprise i embraced all its dangers all its crimes if you will and i shall not shrink from them the extent of treshams treachery is not yet known to us there may beand god grant itextenuating circumstances in his conduct that may save his life but as the case stands at present his offence appears of that dye that nothing can wash it out but his blood and he turned to depart when do you expect this wretched man asked viviana arresting him at nightfall replied fawkes oh that there were any means of warning him of his danger she cried there are none rejoined fawkes fiercelynone that you can adopt and i must lay my injunctions upon you not to quit your chamber so saying he retired left alone viviana became a prey to the most agonizing reflections despite the strong and almost unaccountable interest she felt in guy fawkes she began to repent the step she had taken in joining him as calculated to make her a party to his criminal conduct but this feeling was transient and was succeeded by a firmer determination to pursue the good work she had undertaken though slight success has hitherto attended my efforts she thought that is no reason why i should relax them the time is arrived when i may exert a beneficial influence over him and it may be that what occurs tonight will prove the first step towards complete triumph in any case nothing shall be wanting to prevent the commission of the meditated atrocity with this she knelt down and prayed long and fervently and arose confirmed and strengthened in her resolution meanwhile no alteration had taken place in the purposes of the conspirators night came but with it came not tresham catesby who up to this time had managed to restrain his impatience now arose and signified his intention of going in search of him and was with difficulty prevented from carrying his threat into execution by guy fawkes who represented the folly and risk of such a course if he comes not before midnight we shall know what to think and how to act he observed but till then let us remain tranquil keyes and the others adding their persuasions to those of fawkes catesby sat sullenly down and a profound silence ensued in this way some hours were passed when just at the stroke of midnight viviana descended from her room and appeared amongst them her countenance was deathly pale and she looked anxiously around the assemblage all however with the exception of fawkes avoided her gaze is he come she exclaimed at length i have listened intently but have heard nothing you cannot have murdered him and yet your looks alarm me father garnet answer meis the deed done no my daughter replied garnet sternly then he has escaped she cried joyfully you expected him at nightfall it is not yet too late replied fawkes in a sombre tone his death is only deferred oh do not say so she cried in a voice of agony i hoped you had relented at this moment a peculiar knock was heard at the door it was thrice repeated and the strokes vibrated though with different effect through every bosom he is here cried catesby rising viviana go to your chamber commanded guy fawkes grasping her hand and leading her towards the stairs but she resisted his efforts and fell on her knees i will not go she cried in a supplicating tone unless you will spare this mans life i have already told you my fixed determination rejoined fawkes fiercely if you will not retire of your own free will i must force you if you attempt it i will scream and alarm your victim she replied mr catesby she added have my prayers my entreaties no weight with you will you not grant me his life no replied catesby fiercely she must be silenced he added with a significant look at fawkes she shall replied the latter drawing his poniard viviana he continued in a voice and with a look that left no doubt as to his intentions do not compel me to be your destroyer as he spoke the knocking was repeated and viviana uttered a prolonged and piercing cry guy fawkes raised his weapon and was about to strike but his resolution failed him and his arm dropped nerveless to his side your better angel has conquered she cried clasping his knees while this was passing the door was thrown open by catesby and tresham entered the room what means this outcry he asked looking round in alarm ah what do i see viviana radcliffe here did she utter the scream she did replied viviana rising and she hoped to warn you by it but you were led on by your fate warn me from what ejaculated tresham starting i am among friends you are among those who have resolved upon your death replied viviana ah exclaimed tresham making an effort to gain the door and draw his sword in both attempts however he was foiled for catesby intercepted him while fawkes and keyes flung themselves upon him and binding his arms together with a swordbelt forced him into a chair of what am i accused he demanded in a voice tremulous with rage and terror you shall learn presently replied catesby and he motioned to fawkes to remove viviana let me remain she cried fiercely my nature is changed and is become as savage as your own if blood must be spilt i will tarry to look upon it this is no place for you dear daughter interposed garnet nor for you either father retorted viviana bitterly unless you will act as a minister of christ and prevent this violence let her remain if she will observed catesby her presence need not hinder our proceedings so saying he seated himself opposite tresham while the two priests placed themselves on either side guy fawkes took up a position on the left of the prisoner with his drawn dagger in his hand and keyes stationed himself near the door the unfortunate captive regarded them with terrified glances and trembled in every limb thomas tresham commenced catesby in a stern voice you are a sworn brother in our plot before i proceed further i will ask you what should be his punishment who violates his oath and betrays his confederates we await your answer but tresham remained obstinately silent i will tell you since you refuse to speak continued catesby it is deathdeath by the hands of his associates it may be replied tresham but i have neither broken my oath nor betrayed you your letter to lord mounteagle is in my possession replied catesby behold it perdition exclaimed tresham but you will not slay me i have betrayed nothing i have revealed nothing on my souls salvation i have not spare me spare me and i will be a faithful friend in future i have been indiscreeti own itbut nothing more i have mentioned no names and lord mounteagle as you well know is as zealous a catholic as any now present your letter has been sent to the earl of salisbury pursued catesby coldly it was from him i obtained it then lord mounteagle has betrayed me returned tresham becoming pale as death have you nothing further to allege demanded catesby as tresham made no answer he turned to the others and said is it your judgment he should die all except viviana answered in the affirmative tresham continued catesby solemnly prepare to meet your fate like a man and do you father he added to garnet proceed to shrive him hold cried viviana stepping into the midst of themhold she exclaimed in a voice so authoritative and with a look so commanding that the whole assemblage were awestricken if you think to commit this crime with impunity you are mistaken i swear by everything sacred if you take this mans life i will go forth instantly and denounce you all to the council you may stare sirs and threaten me but you shall find i will keep my word we must put her to death too observed catesby in an under tone to fawkes or we shall have a worse enemy left than tresham i cannot consent to it replied fawkes if you mistrust this person why not place him in restraint pursued viviana you will not mend matters by killing him she says well observed garnet let us put him in some place of security i am agreed replied fawkes and i added keyes my judgment then is overruled rejoined catesby but i will not oppose you we will imprison him in the vault beneath this chamber he must be without light said garnet and without arms added keyes and without food muttered catesby he has only exchanged one death for another the flag was then raised and tresham thrust into the vault after which it was restored to its former position i have saved you from the lesser crime cried viviana to guy fawkes and with heavens grace i trust to preserve you from the greater chapter iii the escape prevented viviana having retired to her chamber apparently to rest a long and anxious consultation was held by the conspirators as to the next steps to be pursued garnet was of opinion that as the earl of salisbury was aware of a conspiracy against the state being on foot among the catholics their project ought to be deferred if not altogether abandoned we are sure to be discovered he said arrests without end will take place and such rigorous measures will be adopted by the earl such inquiries instituted that all will infallibly be brought to light besides we know not what tresham may have revealed he denies having betrayed our secret but no credit can be attached to his assertions shall we examine him again father cried catesby and wring the truth from him by threats or torture no my son replied garnet let him remain where he is till morning a night of solitary confinement added to the stings of his own guilty conscience is likely to produce a stronger effect upon him than any torments we could inflict he shall be interrogated strictly tomorrow and i will answer for it will make a full confession but even if he has revealed nothing material there exists another and equally serious ground of alarm i allude to your meeting with the earl on the river i should be the last to counsel bloodshed but if ever it could be justified it might have been so in this case i would have slain him if i had had my own way returned catesby with a fierce and reproachful look at fawkes if i have done wrong i will speedily repair my error observed the latter do you desire his death father and will you absolve me from the deed he added turning to garnet it is better as it is replied garnet making a gesture in the negative i would not have our high and holy purpose stained by common slaughter the power that delivered him into your hands and stayed them no doubt preserved him for the general sacrifice my first fear was lest having noticed the barrels of powder within the boat he might have suspected your design but i am satisfied his eyes were blinded and his reason benighted so that he could discern nothing such was my own opinion father replied fawkes let us observe the utmost caution but proceed at all hazards with the enterprise if we delay we fail right returned catesby and for that counsel i forgive you for standing between me and our enemy upon this it was agreed that if nothing occurred in the interim more powder should be transported to the habitation in westminster on the following nightthat fawkes and catesby who might be recognised by salisburys description should keep close house during the dayand that the rest of the conspirators should be summoned to assist in digging the mine prayers were then offered up by the two priests for their preservation from peril and for success in their enterprise after which they threw themselves on benches or seats and courted slumber all slept soundly except fawkes who not being able to close his eyes from an undefinable apprehension of danger arose and cautiously opening the door kept watch outside shortly afterwards viviana who had waited till all was quiet softly descended the stairs and shading her light gazed timorously round satisfied she was not observed she glided swiftly and noiselessly to the fireplace and endeavoured to raise the flag but it resisted all her efforts and she was about to abandon the attempt in despair when she perceived a bolt on one side that had escaped her notice hastily withdrawing it she experienced no further difficulty the stone revolved on hinges like a trapdoor and lifting it she hurried down the steps alarmed by her approach tresham had retreated to the further end of the vault and snatching up a halbert from the pile of weapons cried in a voice of desperation stand off i am armed and have severed my bonds off i say you shall not take me with life hush cried viviana putting her finger to her lips i am come to set you free do i behold an inhabitant of this world cried tresham crossing himself and dropping the halbert or some blessed saint ah he exclaimed as she advanced towards him it is viviana radcliffemy preserver pardon sweet lady my eyes were dazzled by the light and your sudden appearance and speechand i might almost say looksmade me think you were some supernatural being come to deliver me from these bloodyminded men where are they in the room above she replied in a whisperasleepand if you speak so loud you will arouse them let us fly without a moments delay returned tresham in the same tone and hastily picking up a rapier and a dagger stay cried viviana arresting him before you go you must tell me what you are about to do we will talk of that when we are out of this accursed place he replied you shall not stir a footstep she rejoined placing herself resolutely between him and the outlet till you have sworn neither to betray your confederates nor to do them injury may heaven requite me if i forgive them cried tresham between his ground teeth rememberyou are yet in their power she rejoined one word from me and they are at your side swearand swear solemnly or you do not quit this spot tresham gazed at her fiercely and griped his dagger as if determined to free himself at any cost ah she ejaculated noticing the movement you are indeed a traitor you have neither sense of honour nor gratitude and i leave you to your fate attempt to follow me and i give the alarm forgive me viviana he cried abjectly prostrating himself at her feet and clinging to the hem of her dress i meant only to terrify you i would not injure you for worlds do not leave me with these ruthless cutthroats they will assuredly murder me do not remain with them yourself or you will come to some dreadful end fly with me and i will place you beyond their reachwill watch over your safety or if you are resolved to brave their fury let me go and i will take any oath you propose as i hope for salvation i will not betray them peace cried viviana contemptuously if i set you free it is not to save you but them what mean you asked tresham hesitating question me not but follow she rejoined and tread softly as you value your life tresham needed no caution on this head and as they emerged from the trapdoor in breathless silence and he beheld the figures of his sleeping foes he could scarcely muster sufficient courage to pass through them motioning him to proceed quickly viviana moved towards the door and to her surprise found it unfastened without pausing to consider whence this neglect could arise she opened it and tresham who trembled in every limb and walked upon the points of his feet stepped forth as he crossed the threshold however a powerful grasp was laid upon his shoulder and a drawn sword presented to his breast while the voice of fawkes thundered in his ear who goes there speak or i strike while the fugitive not daring to answer lest his accents should betray him endeavoured vainly to break away viviana hearing the struggle threw open the door and exclaimed it is tresham i set him free you cried fawkes in astonishment wherefore in the hope that his escape would induce you to abandon your design and seek safety in flight she rejoined but you have thwarted my purpose fawkes made no reply but thrust tresham forcibly into the house and called to catesby who by this time had been roused with the others to close and bar the door the command was instantly obeyed and as catesby turned a strange and fearful group met his view in the midst stood tresham his haggard features and palsied frame bespeaking the extremity of his terror his sword having been beaten from his grasp by fawkes and his dagger wrested from him by keyes he was utterly defenceless viviana had placed herself between him and his assailants and screening him from their attack cried despatch me the fault is minemine onlyand i am ready to pay the penalty had i not released him he would not have attempted to escape i am the rightful victim she speaks the truth gasped tresham if she had not offered to liberate me i should never have thought of flying would to heaven i had never yielded to her solicitations peace craven hound exclaimed fawkes furiously you deserve to die for your meanness and ingratitude if not for your treachery and it is for this miserable wretch viviana he added turning to her that you would have placed your friends in such fearful jeopardyit is for him who would sacrifice you without scruple to save himself that you now offer your own life i deserve your reproaches she rejoined in confusion had i not fortunately intercepted him pursued fawkes an hour would not have elapsed ere he would have returned with the officers and we should have changed this dwelling for a dungeon in the towerthese benches for the rack in pity stab me cried viviana falling at his feet but oh do not wound me with your words i have committed a grievous wrong but i was ignorant of the consequences and as i hope for mercy hereafter my sole motive beyond compassion for this wretched man was to terrify you into relinquishing your dreadful project you have acted wrongfullyvery wrongfully viviana interposed garnet but since you are fully convinced of your error no more need be said there are seasons when the heart must be closed against compassion and when mercy becomes injustice go to your chamber and leave us to deal with this unhappy man tomorrow you must quit us observed fawkes as she passed him quit you she exclaimed i will never offend again i will not trust you replied fawkes unlessbut it is useless to impose restrictions upon you which you will notperhaps cannot observe impose any restrictions you please replied viviana but do not bid me leave you the time is come when we must separate rejoined fawkes see you not that the course we are taking is slippery with blood and beset with perils which the firmest of your sex could not encounter i will encounter them nevertheless replied viviana be merciful she added pointing to tresham and mercy shall be shown you in your hour of need and she slowly withdrew while this was passing catesby addressed a few words aside to keyes and oldcorne and now stepping forward and fixing his eye steadily upon the prisoner to note the effect of his speech upon him said i have devised a plan by which the full extent of treshams treachery can be ascertained you do not mean to torture him i trust exclaimed garnet uneasily no father replied catesby if torture is inflicted at all it will be upon the mind not the body then it will be no torture observed garnet state your plan my son it is this returned catesby he shall write a letter to lord mounteagle stating that he has important revelations to make to him and entreating him to come hither unattended here exclaimed fawkes here repeated catesby and alone we will conceal ourselves in such manner that we may overhear what passes between them and if any attempt is made by the villain to betray our presence he shall be immediately shot by this means we cannot fail to elicit the truth i approve your plan my son replied garnet but who will convey the letter to lord mounteagle i will replied fawkes let it be prepared at once and the case will be thought the more urgent i will watch him and see that he comes unattended or give you timely warning enough rejoined garnet let writing materials be procured and i will dictate the letter tresham meanwhile exhibited no misgiving but on the contrary his countenance brightened up as the plan was approved my life will be spared if you find i have not deceived you will it not he asked in a supplicating voice assuredly replied garnet give me pen and ink then he cried and i will write whatever you desire our secret is safe whispered catesby to garnet it is useless to test him further i think so replied garnet would we had made this experiment sooner do not delay i entreat you implored tresham i am eager to prove my innocence we are satisfied with the proof we have already obtained returned garnet tresham dropped on his knees in speechless gratitude we are spared the necessity of being your executioners my son pursued garnet and i rejoice at it but i cannot acquit you of the design to betray us and till you have unburthened your whole soul to me and proved by severe and selfinflicted penance that you are really penitent you must remain a captive within these walls i will disguise nothing from you father replied tresham and will strive to expiate my offence by the severest penance you choose to inflict do this my son rejoined garnet leave no doubt of your sincerity and you may be yet restored to the place you have forfeited and become a sharer in our great enterprise i will never trust him more observed fawkes nor i added keyes i will rejoined catesby not that i have more faith in him than either of you but i will so watch him that he shall not dare to betray us nay more he added in an under tone to garnet i will turn his treachery to account he will be a useful spy upon our enemies if he can be relied on observed garnet after this you need have no fears rejoined catesby with a significant smile the first part of your penance my son said garnet addressing tresham shall be to pass the night in solitary vigil and prayer within the vault number your transgressions and reflect upon their enormity consider not only the injury your conduct might have done us but the holy church of which you are so sinful a member weigh over all this and tomorrow i will hear your confession when if i find you in a state of grace absolution shall not be refused tresham humbly bowed his head in token of acquiescence he was then led to the vault and the flag closed over him as before this done after a brief conversation the others again stretched themselves on the floor and sought repose chapter iv the mine some days elapsed before the conspirators ventured forth from their present abode they had intended to remove the rest of the powder without loss of time but were induced to defer their purpose on the representations of tresham who stated to garnet that in his opinion they would run a great and needless risk before the expiration of a week treshams apparent remorse for his perfidy added to his seeming zeal had so far reinstated him in the confidence of his associates that he was fully absolved of his offence by garnet and after taking fresh oaths of even greater solemnity than the former was again admitted to the league catesby however who placed little faith in his protestations never lost sight of him for an instant and even if he meditated an escape he had no opportunity of effecting it a coldness stronger on his side than hers seemed to have arisen between viviana and guy fawkes whenever she descended to the lower room he withdrew on some excuse and though he never urged her departure by words his looks plainly bespoke that he desired it upon one occasion she found him alonethe others being at the time within the vault he was whetting the point of his dagger and did not hear her approach until she stood beside him he was slightly confused and a deep ruddy stain flushed his swarthy cheeks and brow but he averted his gaze and continued his occupation in silence why do you shun me asked viviana laying her hand gently upon his shoulder and as he did not answer she repeated the question in a broken voice guy fawkes then looked up and perceived that her eyes were filled with tears i shun you viviana for two reasons he replied gravely but kindly first because i would have no ties of sympathy to make me cling to the world or care for it and i feel that if i suffer myself to be interested about you this will not long be the case secondly and chiefly because you are constantly striving to turn me from my fixed purpose and though your efforts have been and will be unavailing yet i would not be exposed to them further you fear me because you think i shall shake your resolution she rejoined with a forced smile but i will trouble you no more nay if you wish it i will go it were better replied fawkes in accents of deep emotion and taking her hand painful as will be the parting with you i shall feel more easy when it is over it grieves me to the soul to see youthe daughter of the proud the wealthy sir william radcliffean inmate of this wretched abode surrounded by desperate men whose actions you disapprove and whose danger you are compelled to share think how it would add to my suffering if our plotwhich heaven avertshould be discovered and you be involved in it do not think of it replied viviana i cannot banish it from my thoughts continued fawkes i cannot reconcile it to my feelings that one so young so beautiful should be thus treated dwelling on this idea unmans meunfits me for sterner duties the great crisis is at hand and i must live only for it live for it then rejoined viviana but oh let me remain with you till the blow is struck something tells me i may yet be useful to youmay save you no more of this if you would indeed remain rejoined guy fawkes sternly regard me as a sword in the hand of fate which cannot be turned asideas a bolt launched from the cloud and shattering all in its course which may not be stoppedas something terrible exterminating immovable regard me as this and say whether i am not to be shunned no replied viviana i am as steadfast as yourself i will remain guy fawkes gazed at her in surprise mixed with admiration and pressing her hand affectionately said i applaud your resolution if i had a daughter i should wish her to be like you you promised to be a father to me she rejoined how can you be so if i leave you how can i be so if you stay returned fawkes mournfully no you must indulge no filial tenderness for one so utterly unable to requite it as myself fix your thoughts wholly on heaven pray for the restoration of our holy religionfor the success of the great enterpriseand haply your prayers may prevail i cannot pray for that she replied for i do not wish it success but i will prayand ferventlythat all danger may be averted from your head at this moment catesby and keyes emerged from the vault and viviana hurried to her chamber as soon as it grew dark the remaining barrels of powder were brought out of the cellar and carefully placed in the boat straw was then heaped upon them and the whole covered with a piece of tarpaulin as upon the former occasion it being necessary to cross the river more than once the conduct of the first and most hazardous passage was intrusted to fawkes and accompanied by keyes and bates both of whom were well armed he set out a little before midnight it was a clear starlight night but as the moon had not yet risen they were under no apprehension of discovery the few craft they encountered bent probably on some suspicious errand like themselves paid no attention to them and plying their oars swiftly they shot under the low parapet edging the gardens of the parliament house just as the deep bell of the abbey tolled forth the hour of twelve keeping in the shade they silently approached the stairs no one was there not even a waterman to attend to the numerous wherries moored to the steps and without losing a moment they sprang ashore and concealing the barrels beneath their cloaks glided like phantoms summoned by the witching hour along the passage formed by two high walls leading to old palace yard and speedily reached the gate of the habitation in this way and with the utmost rapidity the whole of the fearful cargo was safely deposited in the garden and leaving the others to carry it into the house guy fawkes returned to the boat as he was about to push off two persons rushed to the stairhead and the foremost evidently mistaking him for a waterman called to him to take them across the river i am no waterman friend replied fawkes and am engaged on business of my own seek a wherry elsewhere by heaven exclaimed the newcomer in accents of surprise it is guy fawkes do you not know me can it be humphrey chetham cried fawkes equally astonished it is replied the other this meeting is most fortunate i was in search of you having somewhat of importance to communicate to viviana state it quickly then returned fawkes i cannot tarry here much longer i will go with you rejoined chetham springing into the boat and followed by his companion you must take me to her impossible cried fawkes rising angrily neither can i permit you to accompany me i am busied about my own concerns and will not be interrupted at least tell me where i can find viviana persisted chetham not nownot now rejoined fawkes impatiently meet me tomorrow night at this hour in the great sanctuary at the farther side of the abbey and you shall learn all you desire to know why not now rejoined chetham earnestly you need not fear me i am no spy and will reveal nothing but your companion hesitated fawkes it is only martin heydocke answered chetham he can keep a close tongue as well as his master well sit down then returned fawkes sullenly there will be less risk in taking them to lambeth he muttered than in loitering here and rowing with great swiftness he soon gained the centre of the stream and so he observed resting for a moment on his oars you still cherish your attachment to viviana i see nay never start man i am no enemy to your suit though others may be and if she would place herself at my disposal i would give her to youcertain that it would be to one upon whom her affections are fixed do you think any change likely to take place in her sentiments towards me faltered chetham may i indulge a hope i would not have you despair replied fawkes because as far as i have noticed women are not apt to adhere to their resolutions in matters of the heart and because as i have just said she loves you and i see no reasonable bar to your union you give me new life cried chetham transported with joy oh that you who have so much influence with her would speak in my behalf nay you must plead your own cause replied fawkes i cannot hold out much hope at present for recent events have cast a deep gloom over her spirit and she appears to be a prey to melancholy let this wear offand with one so young and so firmminded it is sure to do soand then your suit may be renewed urge it when you may you have my best wishes for success and shall have my warmest efforts to second you humphrey chetham murmured his thanks in accents almost unintelligible from emotion and guy fawkes continued it would be dangerous for you to disembark with me but when i put you ashore i will point out the dwelling at present occupied by viviana you can visit it as early as you please tomorrow you will find no one with her but father oldcorne and i need scarcely add it will gladden me to the heart to find on my return that she has yielded to your entreaties i cannot thank you cried chetham warmly grasping his hand but i hope to find some means of evincing my gratitude prove it by maintaining the strictest secresy as to all you may see or hearor even suspectwithin the dwelling you are about to visit returned guy fawkes knowing that i am dealing with a man of honour i require no stronger obligation than your word you have it replied chetham solemnly your worship shall have my oath if you desire it remarked martin heydocke no rejoined fawkes your master will answer for your fidelity shortly after this guy fawkes pulled ashore and his companions landed after pointing out the solitary habitation which possessed greater interest in humphrey chethams eyes than the proud structures he had just quitted and extracting a promise that the young merchant would not approach it till the morrow he rowed off and while the others proceeded to lambeth in search of lodging for the night made the best of his way to the little creek and entered the house he found the other conspirators anxiously awaiting his arrival and the certainty afforded by his presence that the powder had been landed in safety gave general satisfaction preparations were immediately made for another voyage a large supply of provisions consisting of baked meat of various kinds hardboiled eggs pasties bread and other viands calculated to serve for a weeks consumption without the necessity of having recourse to any culinary process and which had been previously procured with that view together with a few flasks of wine occupied the place in the boat lately assigned to the powder at the risk of overloading the vessel they likewise increased its burthen by a quantity of mining implementsspades pickaxes augers and wrenching irons to these were added as many swords calivers pikes and petronels as the space left would accommodate garnet and catesby then embarkedthe former having taken an affectionate farewell of viviana whom he committed with the strictest injunction to watch over her to the care of father oldcorne guy fawkes lingered for a moment doubting whether he should mention his rencounter with humphrey chetham he was the more undecided from the deep affliction in which she was plunged at last he determined upon slightly hinting at the subject and to be guided as to what he said further by the manner in which the allusion was received and you decide upon remaining here till we return viviana he said she made a sign in the affirmative and you will see no one no one she answered but should any old friend find his way hitherhumphrey chetham for instancewill you not receive him why do you single out him demanded viviana inquiringly is he in london have you seen him i have replied guy fawkes i accidentally met him tonight and have shown him this dwelling he will come hither tomorrow i wanted only this to make me thoroughly wretched cried viviana clasping her hands with anguish oh what unhappy chance threw him across your path why did you tell him i was here why give him a hope that i would see him but i will not see him i will quit this house rather than be exposed to the meeting what means this sudden excitement viviana cried guy fawkes greatly surprised by her agitation why should a visit from humphrey chetham occasion you uneasiness i know not she answered blushing deeply but i will not hazard it i thought you superior to your sex rejoined fawkes and should never have suspected you of waywardness or caprice you charge me with failings that do not belong to me she answered i am neither wayward nor capricious but i would be willingly spared the pain of an interview with one whom i thought i loved thought you loved echoed fawkes in increased astonishment ay thought repeated viviana for i have since examined my heart and find he has no place in it you might be happy with him viviana rejoined fawkes reproachfully i might have been she replied had circumstances favoured our union but i should not be so now recent events have wrought an entire change in my feelings were i to abandon my resolution of retiring to a cloisterwere i to return to the worldand were such an event possible as that humphrey chetham should conform to the faith of romestill i would notcould not wed him i grieve to hear it replied fawkes would you have me wed him she cried in a slightly mortified tone in good sooth would i replied fawkes and i repeat my firm conviction you would be happier with him than with one more highly born and of less real worth viviana made no reply and her head declined upon her bosom you will see him pursued fawkes taking her hand if only to tell him what you have just told me since you desire it i will she replied fixing a look of melancholy tenderness upon him but it will cost me a bitter pang i would not tax you with it if i did not think it needful returned fawkes and now farewell farewellit may be for ever replied viviana sadly the boat is ready and the tide ebbing cried catesby impatiently at the door we shall be aground if you tarry longer i come replied fawkes and waving an adieu to viviana he departed strange he muttered to himself as he took his way to the creek i could have sworn she was in love with humphrey chetham who can have superseded him in her regard not catesby of a surety tis a perplexing sex the best are fickle heaven be praised i have long been proof against their wiles thus musing he sprang into the skiff and assisting catesby to push it into deep water seized an oar and exerted himself stoutly to make up for lost time the second voyage was as prosperous as the first a thick veil of cloud had curtained the stars the steps were deserted as before and the provisions arms and implements were securely conveyed to their destination thus far fortune seemed to favour their undertaking and garnet falling on his knees offered up the most fervent thanksgivings prayers over they descended to the cellar and their first care was to seek out a place as free from damp as possible where the powder could be deposited till the excavation which it was foreseen would be a work of time and great labour was completed a dry corner being found the barrels were placed in it and carefully concealed with billets of wood and coals so as to avert suspicion in case of search this with other arrangements occupied the greater part of the night and the commencement of the important undertaking was deferred till the morrow when an increase of their party was anticipated throughout the whole of the day no one stirred forth the windows were kept closed the doors locked and as no fires were lighted the house had the appearance of being uninhabited in the course of the morning they underwent considerable alarm some mischievous urchins having scaled the garden wall one of them fell within it and his cries so terrified his playmates that they dropped on the other side and left him the conspirators reconnoitred the unhappy urchin who continued his vociferations in a loud key through the holes in the shutters uncertain what to do and fearing that this trifling mischance might lead to serious consequences when the subject of their uneasiness relieved them by scrambling up the wall near the door and so effecting a retreat with this exception nothing material occurred till evening when their expected associates arrived the utmost caution was observed in admitting them the newcomers were provided with a key of the gardengate but a signal was given and repeated before the housedoor was opened by bates to whom the office of porter was intrusted as soon as the latter had satisfied himself that all was right by unmasking a dark lantern and throwing its radiance upon the faces of the elder wright rookwood and percy he stamped his foot thrice and the conspirators emerged from their hidingplaces a warm greeting passed between the confederates and they adjourned to a lower chamber adjoining the vault where the sound of their voices could not be overheard and where while partaking of a frugal mealfor they desired to eke out their store of provisions as long as possiblethey discoursed upon their plans and all that had occurred since their last meeting nothing was said of the treachery of treshamhis recent conduct as already observed having been such as to restore him in a great degree to the confidence of his companions percy whose office as a gentlemanpensioner gave him the best opportunities of hearing courtwhispers and secrets informed them it was rumoured that the earl of salisbury had obtained a clue to some catholic plot whether their own he could not say but it would seem from all that could be gathered that his endeavours to trace it out had been frustrated where is lord mounteagle demanded catesby at his mansion near hoxton replied percy have you observed him much about the court of late or with the earl of salisbury pursued catesby no replied percy yet now i bethink me i did observe them together and in earnest conversation about a week ago but lord mounteagle knows nothing of our plot hum exclaimed catesby shrugging his shoulders while significant looks were exchanged by the others and tresham hung his head lord mounteagle may not know that you or i or fawkes or rookwood are conspiring against the state but he knows that a plot is hatching amongst our party it is from him that the earl of salisbury derived his information amazement exclaimed percy a good catholic and betray his fellows cried rookwood this passes my comprehension are you sure of it unhappily we are so my son replied garnet gravely we will speak of this hereafter interposed catesby i have a plan to get his lordship into our power and make him serve our purposes in spite of himself we will outwit the crafty salisbury can any one tell if treshams sudden disappearance has been noticed his household report that he is on a visit to sir everard digby at gothurst replied rookwood i called at his residence yesterday and was informed that a letter had just been received from him dated from that place his departure they said was sudden but his letter fully accounted for it the messenger who bore that letter had only to travel from lambeth observed catesby smiling so i conclude returned rookwood and now that our meal is ended let us to work cried fawkes who had taken no part in the foregoing conversation i will strike the first blow he added rising and seizing a mattock hold my son exclaimed garnet arresting him the work upon which the redemption of our holy church hangs must be commenced with due solemnity you are right father replied fawkes humbly headed by garnet bearing a crucifix they then repaired to the vault a silver chalice filled with holy water was carried by fawkes and two lighted tapers by catesby kneeling down before that part of the wall against which operations were about to be directed and holding the crucifix towards it garnet commenced praying in a low but earnest tone gradually raising his voice and increasing in fervour as he proceeded the others knelt around him and the whole formed a strange and deeplyinteresting group the vault itself harmonized with its occupants it was of great antiquity and its solid stone masonry had acquired a timeworn hoary tint in width it was about nine feet and of corresponding height supported by a semicircular arch and its length was more than twenty feet the countenances of the conspirators showed that they were powerfully moved by what was passing but next to garnet guy fawkes exhibited the greatest enthusiasm his ecstatic looks and gestures evinced the strong effect produced upon his superstitious character by the scene garnet concluded his prayer as follows thus far o lord we have toiled in darkness and in difficulty but we have now arrived at a point where all thy support is needed do not desert us we beseech thee but let thy light guide us through these gloomy paths nerve our armssharpen our weaponsand crumble these hard and flinty stones so that they may yield to our efforts aid our enterprise if thou approvest it and it be really as in our ignorance we believe it to be for the welfare of thy holy church and the confusion of its enemies bear witness o lord that we devote ourselves wholly and entirely to this one endand that we implore success only for thy glory and honour with this he arose and the following strains were chanted by the whole assemblage hymn of the conspirators the heretic and heathen lord consume with fire cut down with sword the spoilers from thy temples thrust their altars trample in the dust false princes and false priests lay low their habitations fill with woe scatter them lord with sword and flame and bring them utterly to shame thy vengeful arm no longer stay arise exterminate and slay so shall thy fallen worship be restored to its prosperity this hymn raised the enthusiasm of the conspirators to the highest pitch and such was the effect produced by it as it rolled in sullen echoes along the arched roof of the vault that several of them drew their swords and crossed the blades with looks of the most determined devotion to their cause when it was ended garnet recited other prayers and sprinkled holy water upon the wall and upon every implement about to be used bestowing a separate benediction on each as he delivered the pickaxe to guy fawkes he cried in a solemn voice strike my son in the name of the most high and in behalf of our holy religionstrike guy fawkes raised the weapon and stimulated by excitement threw the whole strength of his arm into the blow a large piece of the granite was chipped off but the mattock snapped in twain guy fawkes looked deeply disconcerted and garnet though he concealed his emotion was filled with dismay let me take your place cried keyes advancing as guy fawkes retired keyes was a powerful man and exerting his energies he buried the point of the pickaxe so deeply in the mortar that he could not remove it unassisted these untoward circumstances cast a slight damp upon their ardour but catesby who perceived it went more cautiously to work and in a short time succeeded with great labour in getting out the large stone upon which the others had expended so much useless exertion the sight restored their confidence and as many as could work in the narrow space joined him but they found that their task was much more arduous than they had anticipated more than an hour elapsed before they could loosen another stone and though they laboured with the utmost perseverance relieving each other by turns they had made but a small breach when morning arrived the stones were as hard and unyielding as iron and the mortar in some places harder than the stones after a few hours rest they resumed their task still they made but small progress and it was not until the third day that they had excavated a hole sufficiently wide and deep to admit one man within it they were now arrived at a compost of gravel and flint stones and if they had found their previous task difficult what they had now to encounter was infinitely more so their implements made little or no impression on this unyielding substance and though they toiled incessantly the work proceeded with disheartening slowness the stones and rubbish were conveyed at dead of night in hampers into the garden and buried one night when they were labouring as usual guy fawkes who was foremost in the excavation thought he heard the tolling of a bell within the wall he instantly suspended his task and being convinced that he was not deceived crept out of the hole and made a sign to the others to listen each had heard the awful sound before but as it was partially drowned by the noise of the pickaxe it had not produced much impression upon them as they attributed it to some vibration in the wall caused by the echo of the blows but it was now distinctly audibledeep clear slowlike a passing bellbut so solemn so unearthly that its tones froze the blood in their veins illustration guy fawkes and the other conspirators alarmed while digging the mine they listened for a while in speechless astonishment scarcely daring to look at each other and expecting each moment that the building would fall upon them and bury them alive the light of a single lantern placed upon an upturned basket fell upon figures rigid as statues and countenances charged with awe my arm is paralysed said guy fawkes breaking silence i can work no more try holy water father cried catesby if it proceeds from aught of evil that will quell it the chalice containing the sacred lymph was brought and pronouncing a solemn exorcism garnet sprinkled the wall the sound immediately ceased it is as i thought father observed catesby it is the delusion of an evil spirit as he spoke the tolling of the mysterious bell was again heard and more solemnlymore slowly than before sprinkle the wall again in heavens name father cried fawkes crossing himself devoutly avoid thee sathanas garnet complied and throwing holy water upon the stones the same result followed chapter v the capture of viviana on the morning after his encounter with guy fawkes humphrey chetham accompanied by martin heydocke took his way to lambeth marsh with a throbbing heart he approached the miserable dwelling he knew to be inhabited by viviana and could scarcely summon courage to knock at the door his first summons not being answered he repeated it more loudly and he then perceived the face of father oldcorne at the window who having satisfied himself that it was a friend admitted him and his attendant you were expected my son said the priest after a friendly greeting guy fawkes has prepared viviana for your coming will she not see me demanded the young merchant uneasily i believe so replied oldcorne but i will apprise her of your arrival be seated my son he then carefully fastened the door and repaired to vivianas chamber leaving chetham in that state of tremor and anxiety which a lover hoping to behold his mistress only knows it was some time before viviana appeared and the young merchant whose heart beat violently at the sound of her footstep was startled by the alteration in her looks and the extreme coldness of her manner oldcorne was with her and motioning martin heydocke to follow him the youthful pair were left alone you desire to see me i am given to understand sir observed viviana in a freezing tone i have journeyed to london for that express purpose replied humphrey chetham tremulously i am much beholden to you sir returned viviana in the same repelling tone as before but i regret you should have taken so much trouble on my account to serve you is happiness not trouble viviana replied humphrey chetham ardently and i am overjoyed at finding an opportunity of proving my devotion i have yet to learn what service i must thank you for she returned i can scarcely say that i am warranted in thus intruding upon you replied chetham greatly abashed but having learnt from my servant martin heydocke that doctor dee had set out for london with the view of seeking you out and withdrawing you from your present associates i was determined to be beforehand with him and to acquaint you if possible with his intentions what you say surprises me replied viviana doctor dee has no right to interfere with my actions nor should i obey him were he to counsel me as is scarcely probable to quit my companions i know not what connexion there may be between you to justify the interposition of his authority replied chetham neither did i tarry to inquire but presuming from what i heard that he would attempt to exercise some control over you i set out at once and without guide to your retreat or the slightest knowledge of it was fortunate enough on the very night of my arrival in london to chance upon guy fawkes who directed me to you i am aware of it was the chilling answer i will not avouch pursued chetham passionately that i have not been actuated as much by an irrepressible desire to see you again as by anxiety to apprise you of doctor dees coming i wanted only a slight excuse to myself to induce me to yield to my inclinations your departure made me wretched i thought i had more control over myself but i find i cannot live without you alas alas cried viviana in a troubled tone and losing all her selfcommand i expected this whywhy did you come i have told you my motive replied chetham but oh do not reproach me i do not desire to do so returned viviana with a look of agony i bitterly reproach myself that i cannot meet you as of old but i would ratherfar rather have encountered doctor dee had he come hither resolved to exert all his magical power to force me away than have met you have i unwittingly offended you viviana asked chetham in astonishment oh nonono she replied you have not offended me but but what he cried anxiously i would rather have died than see you she answered i will not inquire wherefore rejoined chetham because i too well divine the cause i am no longer what i was to you press this matter no further i pray of you returned viviana in much confusion and blushing deeply i shall ever esteem youever feel the warmest gratitude to you and what matters it whether my heart is estranged from you or not since i can never wed you what matters it repeated the young merchant in accents of despairit matters much drowning love will cling to straws the thought that i was beloved by you though i could never hope to possess your hand reconciled me in some degree to my fate but now he added covering his face with his handsnow my heart is crushed nay say not so cried viviana in a voice of the deepest emotion i do love youas a sister that is small comfort rejoined chetham bitterly i echo your own wish would we had never met again i might at least have deluded myself into the belief that you loved me it would have been better so she returned i would inflict pain on no onefar less on you whom i regard so much and to whom i owe so much you owe me nothing viviana rejoined chetham all i desired was to serve you in the midst of the dangers we have shared together i felt no alarm except for your sake i have done nothingnothing would i had died for you calm yourself sir i entreat you she returned you did love me once demanded chetham suddenly i thought so she answered the young merchant uttered an exclamation of anguish and a mournful pause ensued broken only by his groans answer me viviana he said turning abruptly upon heranswer me and in mercy answer trulydo you love another it is a question i cannot answer she replied becoming ashy pale your looks speak for you he vociferated in a terrible toneyou do his namehis namethat i may wreak my vengeance upon him your violence terrifies me returned viviana withdrawing the hand he had seized i must put an end to this interview pardon me viviana cried chetham falling on his knees before herin pity pardon me i am not myself i shall be calmer presently but if you knew the anguish of the wound you have inflicted you would not add to it heaven knows i would not she returned motioning him to rise and if it will lighten your suffering know that the love i feel for anotherif love indeed it beis as hopeless as your own but it is not a love of which even you could be jealous it is a higher and a holier passion it is affection mixed with admiration and purified from all its grossness it is more perhaps than the love of a daughter for her fatherbut it is nothing more i shall never wed him i lovecould not if i would nay i would shun him if i did not feel that the hour will soon come when the extent of my affection must be proved this is strange sophistry returned chetham and you may deceive yourself by it but you cannot deceive me you love as all ardent natures do love but in what way do you mean to prove your affection perhaps by the sacrifice of my life she answered i can tell you who is the object of your affections said chetham it is guy fawkes i will not deny it replied viviana he is hear me then exclaimed chetham who appeared inexpressibly relieved by the discovery he had made in my passage across the river with him last night our conversation turned on the one subject ever nearest my heart yourselfand guy fawkes not only bade me not despair but promised to aid my suit and he kept his word replied viviana for while announcing your proposed visit he urged me strongly in your behalf then he knows not of your love for him demanded chetham he not only knows it not but never shall know it from menor must he know it from you sir rejoined viviana energetically fear it not said chetham sighing it is a secret i shall carefully preserve and now that you are in possession of it she answered i no longer feel your presence as a restraint let me still regard you as a friend be it so replied humphrey chetham mournfully and as a friend let me entreat you to quit this place and abandon your present associates i will not seek to turn your heart from fawkesnor will i try to regain the love i have lost but let me implore you to pause ere you irretrievably mix yourself up with the fortunes of one so desperate i am too well aware that he is engaged in a fearful plot against the statethough i know not its precise nature you will not betray him she cried i will not though he is my rival returned chetham but others maynay perhaps have done so already whom do you suspect demanded viviana in the greatest alarm i fear doctor dee replied the young merchant but i know nothing certainly my servant martin heydocke who is in the doctors confidence intimated as much to me and i have reason to think that his journey to town under the pretext of searching for you is undertaken for the purpose of tracing out the conspirators and delivering them to the government is he arrived in london inquired viviana eagerly i should think not returned chetham i passed him four days ago on this side leicester in company with kelley and topcliffe if the wretch topcliffe was with him your conjectures are too well founded she replied i must warn guy fawkes instantly of his danger command my services in any way said chetham i know not what to do cried viviana after a pause during which she betrayed the greatest agitation i dare not seek him outand yet if i do not he may fall into the hands of the enemy i must see him at all hazards suffer me to go with you implored chetham you may rely upon my secrecy and now i have a double motive for desiring to preserve fawkes you are indeed truly noblehearted and generous replied viviana and i would fully confide in you but if you were to be seen by the others you would be certainly put to death not even fawkes could save you i will risk it if you desire it and it will save him replied the young merchant devotedly nay i will go alone that were to insure your destruction she answered nonoit must not be i will consult with father oldcorne with this she hurried out of the room and returned in a short time with the priest father oldcorne is of opinion that our friends must be apprised of their danger she said and he thinks it needful we should both go to their retreat that no hindrance may be offered to our flight in case such a measure should be resolved upon you cannot accompany us my son added oldcorne for though i am as fully assured of your fidelity as viviana and would confide my life to you there are those who will not so trust you and who might rejoice in the opportunity of removing you viviana exclaimed chetham looking entreatingly at her for my sakeif not for your owndo not urge this further she returned there are already dangers and difficulties enow without adding to them you would be safer amid a horde of robbers than amidst these men and it is to such persons you commit yourself cried chetham reproachfully oh be warned by me ere it is too late abandon them it is too late already replied viviana the die is cast then i can only lament it returned chetham sadly suffer me at least to accompany you to some place near their retreat that you may summon me in case of need there can be no objection to that viviana observed oldcorne provided humphrey chetham will promise not to follow us readily replied the young merchant i am unwilling to expose him to further risk on my account said viviana but be it as you will it was then agreed that they should not set out till nightfall but proceed as soon as it grew dark to lambeth where humphrey chetham undertook to procure a boat for their conveyance across the river the hour of departure at length arrived viviana who had withdrawn to her own room appeared in her travelling habit and was about to set forth with her companions when they were all startled by a sudden and loud knocking at the door we are discovered she cried doctor dee has found out our retreat fear nothing rejoined chetham drawing his sword while his example was imitated by martin heydocke they shall not capture you while i live as he spoke the knocking was repeated and the door shaken so violently as to threaten to burst its fastenings extinguish the light whispered chetham and let father oldcorne conceal himself we have nothing to fear where shall i fly cried oldcorne despairingly it will be impossible to raise the flag and seek refuge in the vault fly to my room cried viviana and finding he stood irresolute as if paralysed with terror she took his arm and dragged him away the next moment the door was burst open with a loud crash and several armed men with their swords drawn followed by topcliffe and another middleaged man of slight stature and rather undersized but richly dressed and bearing all the marks of exalted rank rushed into the room you are my prisoner cried topcliffe rushing up to chetham who had planted himself with martin heydocke at the foot of the stairs i arrest you in the kings name you are mistaken in your man sir cried chetham fiercely i have committed no offence lay a hand upon me at your peril how is this cried topcliffe humphrey chetham here ay returned the young merchant you have fallen upon the wrong house not so sir replied topcliffe i am satisfied from your presence that i am right where you are viviana radcliffe is not far off throw down your arms you can offer no resistance to my force and your zeal will not benefit your friends while it will place your own safety in jeopardy but chetham fiercely refused compliance and after a few minutes further parley the soldiers were about to attack him when viviana opened a door above and slowly descended the stairs at her appearance the young merchant seeing that further resistance would be useless sheathed his sword and she passed between him and heydocke and advanced towards the leaders of the band what means this intrusion she asked we are come in search of two jesuit priests whom we have obtained information are hidden here replied topcliffeas well as of certain other papists disaffected against the state for whose apprehension i hold a warrant you are welcome to search the house replied viviana but there is no one within it except those you see as she said this chetham who gazed earnestly at her caught her eye and from a scarcelyperceptible glance felt certain that the priest through her agency had effected his escape but the soldiers had not waited for her permission to make the search rushing upstairs they examined the different chambersthere were two small rooms besides that occupied by vivianaand found several of the priests habiliments but though they examined every corner with the minutest attention sounded the walls peered up the chimneys underneath the bed and into every place likely and unlikely they could find no other traces of those they sought and were compelled to return to their leader with tidings of their ill success topcliffe with another party continued his scrutiny below and discovering the moveable flag in the hearth descended into the vault where he made certain of discovering his prey but no one was there and the powder and arms having been removed he gained nothing by his investigations meanwhile his companionand evidently from his garb and the deference paid him though he was addressed by no title which could lead to the absolute knowledge of his rank his superiorseated himself and put many questions in a courteous but authoritative tone to viviana respecting her residence in this solitary abodethe names of her companionswhere they wereand upon what scheme they were engaged to none of these questions would she return an answer and her interrogator at last losing patience said i hold it my duty to inform you that you will be carried before the council and if you continue thus obstinate means will be takenand those none of the gentlestto extort the truth from you you may apply the torture to me replied viviana firmly but it will wrest nothing from me that remains to be seen replied the other i only trust you will not compel me to put my threat into execution at this moment topcliffe emerged from the vault and the soldiers returned from their unsuccessful search above they have escaped us now remarked topcliffe to his superior but i will conceal a party of men on the premises who will be certain to capture them on their return viviana uttered an exclamation of irrepressible uneasiness which did not escape her auditors i am right you see observed topcliffe significantly to his companion you are so replied the other as this was said viviana hazarded a look at humphrey chetham the meaning of which he was not slow to comprehend he saw that she wished him to make an effort to escape that he might warn her companions and regardless of the consequence be prepared to obey her while those around were engaged in a last fruitless search he whispered his intentions to martin heydocke and only awaited a favourable opportunity to put them in execution it occurred sooner than he expected before quitting the premises topcliffe determined to visit the upper rooms himself and he took several of the men with him chetham would have made an attempt to liberate viviana but feeling certain it would be unsuccessful he preferred obeying her wishes to his own inclinations topcliffe gone he suddenly drew his swordfor neither he nor heydocke had been disarmedand rushing towards the door struck down the man next it and followed by his servant passed through it before he could be intercepted they both then flew at a swift pace towards the marshy fields and owing to the darkness and unstable nature of the ground speedily distanced their pursuers hearing the disturbance below and guessing its cause topcliffe immediately descended but he was too late and though he joined in the pursuit he was baffled like his attendants half an hour afterwards he returned to the house with an angry and disappointed look he has given us the slip he observed to his superior who appeared exceedingly provoked by the young merchants flight but we will soon have him again after giving directions to his men how to conceal themselves topcliffe informed his companions that he was ready to attend him viviana who had remained motionless and silent during the foregoing scene was taken out of the house and conducted towards the creek in which lay a large wherry manned by four rowers she was placed within it and as soon as his superior was seated topcliffe inquired where will your lordship go first to the starchamber was the answer at this reply in spite of herself viviana could not repress a shudder all is lost she mentally ejaculated chapter vi the cellar it was long before the conspirators gained sufficient courage to recommence digging the mine whenever holy water was thrown upon the stones the mysterious bell ceased tolling but it presently began anew and such was the appalling effect of the sound that it completely paralysed the listeners prayers were said by garnet hymns sung by the others but all was of no avail it continued to toll on with increased solemnity unless checked by the same potent application as before the effect became speedily manifest in the altered looks and demeanour of the conspirators and it was evident that if something was not done to arouse them the enterprise would be abandoned catesby equally superstitious with his confederates but having nerves more firmly strung was the first to conquer his terror crossing himself he muttered a secret prayer and snatching up a pickaxe entered the cavity and resumed his labour the noise of the heavy blows dealt by him against the wall drowned the tolling of the bell the charm was broken and stimulated by his conduct the others followed his example and though the awful tolling continued at intervals during the whole of their operations it offered no further interruption to them another and more serious cause of anxiety however arose as the work advanced without being aware of it they approached the bank of the river and the water began to ooze through the sides of the excavationat first slightly but by degrees to such an extent as to convince them that their labour would be entirely thrown away large portions of the clay loosened by the damp fell in upon them nearly burying those nearest the tumbling mass and the floor was now in some places more than a foot deep in water clearly proving it would be utterly impossible to keep the powder fit for use in such a spot catesby bore these untoward circumstances with illconcealed mortification for a time he struggled against them and though he felt that it was hopeless worked on like a desperate military leader conducting a forlorn hope to certain destruction at length however the water began to make such incursions that he could no longer disguise from himself or his companions that they were contending against insurmountable difficulties and that to proceed further would be madness he therefore with a heavy heart desisted and throwing down his pickaxe said it was clear that heaven did not approve their design and that it must be relinquished we ought to have been warned by that doleful bell he observed in conclusion i now perceive its meaning and as i was the first to act in direct opposition to the declared will of the supreme being so now i am the first to admit my error i cannot account for that dread and mysterious sound my son replied garnet and can only attribute it as you do to divine interference but whether it was intended as a warning or a guidance i confess i am unable to say can you longer doubt father returned catesby bitterly when you look at yon excavation it took us more than a weeks incessant labour to get through the first wall and our toil was no sooner lightened than these fatal consequences ensued if we proceed we shall drown ourselves instead of blowing up our foes and even if we should escape were the powder stowed for one day in that damp place it would never explode we have failed and must take measures accordingly i entirely concur with you my son replied garnet we must abandon our present plan but do not let us be disheartened perhaps at this very moment heaven is preparing for us a victory by some unlookedfor means it may be so replied catesby with a look of incredulity as he spoke an extraordinary noise like a shower of falling stones was heard overhead and coupling the sound with their fears of the encroachment of the damp the conspirators glanced at each other in dismay thinking the building was falling in upon them all blessed saints protect us cried garnet as the sound ceased what was that but no one was able to account for it and each regarded his neighbour with apprehension after a short interval of silence the sound was heard again there was then another pauseand again the same rushing and inexplicable noise what can it be cried catesby i am so enfeebled by this underground life that trifles alarm me are our enemies pulling down the structure over our headsor are they earthing us up like vermin he added to fawkes what is it i will go and see replied the other do not expose yourself my son cried garnet let us abide the result here no father replied fawkes having failed in our scheme what befals me is of little consequence i will go if i return not you will understand what has happened pausing for a moment to receive garnets benediction he then strode away half an hour elapsed before fawkes returned and the interval appeared thrice its duration in the eyes of the conspirators when he reappeared a smile sat upon his countenance and his looks instantly dispelled the alarm that had been previously felt you bring us good news my son cried garnet excellent father replied fawkes and you were right in saying that at the very moment we were indulging in misgiving heaven was preparing for us a victory by unforeseen and mysterious means garnet raised his hands gratefully and reverentially upwards and the other conspirators crowded round fawkes to listen to his relation the noise we heard he said arose from a very simple circumstanceand when you hear it you will smile at your fears but you will not smile at the result to which it has led exactly overhead it appears a cellar is situated belonging to a person named bright and the sound was occasioned by the removal of his coals which he had been selling off is that all cried catesby we are indeed grown childish to be alarmed by such a cause it appears slight now it is explained observed keyes gravely but how were we to know whence it arose true returned fawkes and i will now show you how the hand of heaven has been manifested in the matter the noise which led me to this investigation and which i regard as a signal from on high brought me to a cellar i had never seen before and knew not existed that cellar lies immediately beneath the house of lords ah i see exclaimed catesby you think it would form a good depository for the powder if it had been built for the express purpose it could not be better returned fawkes it is commodious and dry and in an outoftheway place as you may judge when we ourselves have never hitherto noticed it but what is all this to us if we cannot use it returned catesby we can use it replied fawkes it is ours there was a general exclamation of surprise finding on inquiry that bright was about to quit the neighbourhood continued fawkes and did not require the place longer i instantly proposed to take it from him and to create no suspicion engaged it in percys name stating that he wanted it for his own fuel you have done admirably cried catesby in a tone of exultation the success of the enterprise will now be entirely owing to you not to me but to the providence that directed me replied fawkes solemnly right my son returned garnet and let this teach us never to despair again the next day percy having taken possession of the cellar it was carefully examined and proved as fawkes had stated admirably adapted to their purpose their fears were now at an end and they looked on the success of their project as certain the mysterious bell no longer tolled and their sole remaining task was to fill up the excavation so far as to prevent any damage from the wet this was soon done and their next step was to transport the powder during the night to the cellar concealing the barrels as before with faggots and coals they gave the place the appearance of a mere receptacle for lumber by filling it with old hampers boxes without lids broken bottles stone jars and other rubbish they now began to think of separating and fawkes expressed his intention of returning that night to the house at lambeth no intelligence had reached them of vivianas captivity and they supposed her still an inmate of the miserable dwelling with father oldcorne fawkes had often thought of her and with uneasiness during his toilsome labours but they had so much engrossed him that her image was banished almost as soon as it arose now that grand obstacle was surmounted and nothing was wanting however except a favourable moment to strike the blow he began to feel the greatest anxiety respecting her still he thought it prudent to postpone his return to a late hour and it was not until near midnight that he and catesby ventured to their boat as he was about to descend the steps he heard his name pronounced by some one at a little distance and the next moment a man whom he immediately recognised as humphrey chetham rushed up to him you here again cried fawkes angrily and not unsuspiciously do you play the spy upon me i have watched for you for the last ten nights replied chetham hastily i knew not where you were but i found your boat here and i hoped you would not cross the water in any other why all this care demanded fawkes has aught happenedis viviana safespeak man do not keep me longer in suspense alas rejoined chetham she is a prisoner illustration guy fawkes laying the train a prisoner ejaculated fawkes in a hollow voice then my forebodings were not without cause how has this happened cried catesby who had listened to what was said in silent wonder chetham then hastily related all that had taken place i know not what has become of her he said in conclusion but i have heard that she was taken to the starchamber by the earl of salisburyfor he it appears was the companion of topcliffeand refusing to answer the interrogations of the council was conveyed to the tower and i fear subjected to the torture tortured exclaimed fawkes horrorstricken viviana tortured and i have brought her to this oh god oh god it is indeed an agonizing reflection replied humphrey chetham in a sombre tone and enough to drive you to despair her last wishes expressed only in looks for she did not dare to give utterance to them were that i should warn you not to approach the house at lambeth your enemies being concealed within it i have now fulfilled them farewell and he turned to depart stay cried catesby arresting him where is father oldcorne i know not replied humphrey chetham as i have told you viviana by some means contrived his escape i have seen nothing of him and hurrying away he was lost beneath the shadow of the wall is this a troubled dream or dread reality cried fawkes to catesby i fear it is too true returned the other in a voice of much emotion poor viviana something must be done to set her free cried fawkes i will purchase her liberty by delivering up myself your oathremember your oath rejoined catesby you may destroy yourself but not your associates truetrue replied fawkes distractedlyi do remember it i am sold to perdition anger not heaven by these idle lamentationsand at a time too when all is so prosperous rejoined catesby what cried fawkes fiercely would you have me calm when she who called me father and was dear to me as a child is taken from me by these remorseless butcherssubjected to their terrible examinationsplunged in a dismal dungeonand stretched upon the rackand all for mefor me i shall go mad if i think upon it you must not think upon it returned catesbyat least not here we shall be observed let us return to the house and perhapsthough i scarcely dare indulge the hopesome plan may be devised for her liberation with this he dragged fawkes who was almost frenzied with anguish forcibly along and they returned to the house nothing more was said that night catesby judged it prudent to let the first violence of his friends emotion expend itself before he attempted to soothe him and when he communicated the sad event to garnet the latter strongly approved the plan garnet was greatly distressed at the intelligence and his affliction was shared by the other conspirators no fears were entertained by any of them that viviana would reveal aught of the plot but this circumstance only added to their regrets i will stake my life for her constancy said catesby and so will i returned garnet she will die a martyr for us he then proposed that they should pray for her deliverance and all instantly assenting they knelt down while garnet poured forth the most earnest supplications to the virgin in her behalf the next morning guy fawkes set forth and ascertained that humphrey chethams statement was correct and that viviana was indeed a prisoner in the tower he repaired thither and tried to ascertain in what part of the fortress she was confined in the hope of gaining admittance to her but as he could obtain no information and his inquiries excited suspicion he was compelled to return without accomplishing his object crossing tower hill on his way back he turned to glance at the stern pile he had just quitted and which was fraught with the most fearful interest to him when he perceived chetham issue from the bulwark gate he would have made up to him but the young merchant who had evidently seen him though he looked sedulously another way set off in the direction of the river and was quickly lost to view filled with the gloomiest thoughts guy fawkes proceeded to westminster where he arrived without further adventure of any kind in the latter part of the same day as the conspirators were conferring together they were alarmed by a knocking at the outer gate and sending bates to reconnoitre he instantly returned with the intelligence that it was lord mounteagle at the mention of this name tresham who was one of the party turned pale as death and trembled so violently that he could scarcely support himself having been allowed to go forth on that day the visit of lord mounteagle at this juncture coupled with the agitation it occasioned him seemed to proclaim him guilty of treachery for the second time you have betrayed us villain cried catesby drawing his dagger but you shall not escape i will poniard you on the spot as you hope for mercy do not strike cried tresham on my soul i have not seen lord mounteagle and know not any more than yourselves what brings him hither put it to the proof let him come in conceal yourselves and you will hear what passes between us let it be so interposed fawkes i will step within this closet the door of which shall remain ajar from it i can watch him without being observed and if aught occurs to confirm our suspicions he dies bates shall station himself in the passage and stab him if he attempts to fly added catesby your sword sir it is here replied tresham delivering it to catesby who handed it to bates are you satisfied is lord mounteagle alone inquired catesby without noticing the question he appears to be so replied bates admit him then rejoined catesby entering the closet with keyes he was followed by fawkes who drew his dagger and kept the door slightly ajar while garnet and the rest retired to other hidingplaces a few moments afterwards bates returned with lord mounteagle and having ushered him into the room took his station in the passage as directed by catesby the room was very dark the shutters being closed and light only finding its way through the chinks in them and it appeared totally so to lord mounteagle who groping his way stumbled forward and exclaimed in accents of some alarm where am i where is mr tresham i am here replied tresham advancing towards him how did your lordship find me out he added after the customary salutations were exchanged my servant saw you enter this house replied mounteagle and knowing i was anxious to see you waited for some hours without in the expectation of your coming forth but as this did not occur he mentioned the circumstance to me on his return and i immediately came in quest of you when i knocked at the gate i scarcely knew what to think of the place and began to fear you must have fallen into the hands of cutthroats and now that i have gained admittance my wonderand i may add my uneasinessis not diminished why do you hide yourself in this wretched place be seated replied tresham placing a chair for lord mounteagle with his back to the closet while he took one opposite him and near a table on which some papers were laid your lordship may remember he continued scarcely knowing what answer to make to the question that i wrote to you some time ago to say that a conspiracy was hatching among certain of our party against the state i have reason to remember it replied mounteagle the letter was laid before the earl of salisbury and inquiries instituted in consequence but owing to your disappearance nothing could be elicited what plot had you discovered at this moment tresham who kept his eye fixed on the closet perceived the door noiselessly open and behind it the figure of guy fawkes with the dagger in his hand i was misinformed as to the nature of the plot he stammered was it against the kings life demanded mounteagle no rejoined tresham as far as i could learn it was an insurrection indeed exclaimed mounteagle sceptically my information then differed from yours who were the parties you suspected as i wrongfully suspected them replied tresham evasively your lordship must excuse my naming them was catesbyor winteror wrightor rookwoodor sir everard digby concerned in it demanded mounteagle not one of them asseverated tresham they are the persons i suspect replied mounteagle and they are suspected by the earl of salisbury but you have not told me what you are doing in this strange habitation are you ferreting out a plot or contriving one both replied tresham how cried mounteagle i am plotting for myself and counterplotting the designs of others replied tresham mysteriously is this place then the rendezvous of a band of conspirators asked mounteagle uneasily tresham nodded in the affirmative who are they continued mounteagle there is no need of concealment with me as this was said tresham raised his eyes and saw that guy fawkes had stepped silently forward and placed himself behind mounteagles chair his hand grasped his dagger and his gaze never moved from the object of his suspicion who are they repeated mounteagle is guy fawkes one of them assuredly not replied tresham why should you name him i never mentioned him to your lordship i think you did replied mounteagle but i am certain you spoke of catesby and treshams regards involuntarily wandered to the closet when he beheld the stern glance of the person alluded to fixed upon him you have heard of viviana radcliffes imprisonment i suppose pursued mounteagle unconscious of what was passing illustration guy fawkes keeping watch upon tresham and lord mounteagle illustration viviana examined by the earl of salisbury and the privy council in the star chamber i have replied tresham the earl of salisbury expected he would be able to wring all from her but he has failed observed mounteagle i am glad of it observed tresham i thought you were disposed to serve him remarked mounteagle so i am replied tresham but if secrets are to be revealed i had rather be the bearer of them than any one else i am sorry for viviana i could procure her liberation if i chose observed mounteagle say you so cried fawkes clapping him on the shoulder then you stir not hence till you have procured it chapter vii the starchamber viviana as has already been intimated after her capture at the house at lambeth was conveyed to the starchamber here she was detained until a late hour on the following day when she underwent a long and rigorous examination by certain members of the privy council who were summoned for that purpose by the earl of salisbury throughout this arduous trial she maintained the utmost composure and never for a single moment lost her firmness on all occasions her matchless beauty and dignity produced the strongest impression on the beholders but on no occasion had they ever produced so strong an effect as the present her features were totally destitute of bloom but their very paleness contrasted as it was with her large dark eyes which blazed with unwonted brilliancy as well as with her jetblack hair so far from detracting from her loveliness appeared to add to it as she was brought before the council who were seated round a table and remained standing at a short distance from them guarded by topcliffe and two halberdiers a murmur of admiration pervaded the groupnor was this feeling lessened as the examination proceeded once when the earl of salisbury adverted to the unworthy position in which she the daughter of the proud and loyal sir william radcliffe had placed herself a shade passed over her brow and a slight convulsion agitated her frame but the next moment she recovered herself and said however circumstances may appear against me and whatever opinion your lordships may entertain of my conduct the king has not a more loyal subject than myself nor have any of you made greater efforts to avert the danger by which he is threatened then you admit that his majesty is in danger cried the earl of salisbury eagerly i admit nothing replied viviana but i affirm that i am his true and loyal subject you cannot expect us to believe your assertion replied the earl unless you approve it by declaring all you know touching this conspiracy i have already told you my lord she returned that my lips are sealed on that subject you disclaim then all knowledge of a plot against the kings life and against his government pursued salisbury viviana shook her head you refuse to give up the names of your companions or to reveal their intentions continued the earl i do she answered firmly your obstinacy will not save them rejoined the earl in a severe tone and after a brief pause their names and their atrocious designs are known to us if such be the case replied viviana why interrogate me on the subject becausebut it is needless to give a reason for the course which justice requires me to pursue returned the earl you are implicated in this plot and nothing can save you from condign punishment but a frank and full confession nothing can save me then my lord replied viviana but heaven knows i shall perish unjustly a consultation was then held by the lords of the council who whispered together for a few minutes viviana regarded them anxiously but suffered no expression of uneasiness to escape her as they again turned towards her she saw from their looks some of which exhibited great commiseration for her that they had come to a decision she could not doubt what respecting her fate her heart stopped beating and she could scarcely support herself such however was the control she exercised over herself that though filled with terror her demeanour remained unaltered she was not long kept in suspense fixing his searching gaze upon her the earl of salisbury observed in a severe tone viviana radcliffe i ask you for the last time whether you will avow the truth no answer was returned i will not disguise from you continued the earl that your youth your beauty your constancy and above all your apparent innocence have deeply interested me as well as the other noble persons here assembled to interrogate you and who would willingly save you from the sufferings you will necessarily undergo from a mistaken fidelity to the heinous traitors with whom you are so unhappily leagued i would give you time to reflect did i think the delay would answer any good purpose i would remind you that no oath of secresy however solemn can be binding in an unrighteous cause i would tell you that your first duty is to your prince and governor and that it is as great a crime as unpardonable in the eyes of god as of man to withhold the revelation of a conspiracy against the state should it come to your knowledge as to conspire against it yourself i would lay all this before you i would show you the magnitude of your offence the danger in which you stand and the utter impossibility of screening your companions who ere long will be confronted with youdid i think it would avail but as you continue obstinate justice must take its course i am prepared for the worst my lord replied viviana humbly i thank your lordship for your consideration but i take you all to witness that i profess the utmost loyalty and devotion for my sovereign and that whatever may be my fate those feelings will remain unchanged to the last your manner and your words are so sincere that were not your conduct at variance with them they might convince us returned the earl as it is even if we could credit your innocence we are bound to act as if you were guilty you will be committed to the tower till his majestys pleasure is known and i grieve to add if you still continue obstinate the severest measures will be resorted to to extract the truth from you as he concluded he attached his signature to a warrant which was lying on the table before him and traced a few lines to sir william waad lieutenant of the tower this done he handed the papers to topcliffe and waving his hand viviana was removed to the chamber in which she had been previously confined and where she was detained under a strict guard until topcliffe who had left her returned to say that all was in readiness and bidding her follow him led the way to the riverside where a wherry manned by six rowers was waiting for them the night was profoundly dark and as none of the guard carried torches their course was steered in perfect obscurity but the rowers were too familiar with the river to require the guidance of light shooting the bridge in safety and pausing only for a moment to give the signal of their approach to the sentinels on the ramparts they passed swiftly under the lowbrowed arch of traitors gate chapter viii the jailers daughter as viviana set foot on those fatal stairs which so many have trod and none without feeling that they took their first step towards the scaffold she involuntarily shrank backward but it was now too late to retreat and she surrendered her hand to topcliffe who assisted her up the steps halfadozen menatarms with a like number of warders bearing torches were present and as it was necessary that topcliffe should deliver his warrant into sir william waads own hands he committed his prisoner to the warders with instructions to them to take her to the guardroom near the byward tower while he proceeded to the lieutenants lodgings it was the first time viviana had beheld the terrible pile in which she was immured though she was well acquainted with its history and with the persecutions which many of the professors of her faith had endured within it during the recent reign of elizabeth and as the light of the torches flashed upon the grey walls of the bloody tower and upon the adjoining ramparts all the dreadful tales she had heard rushed to her recollection but having recovered the first shock the succeeding impressions were powerless in comparison and she accompanied the warders to the guardroom without expressing any outward emotion here a seat was offered her and as the men considerately withdrew she was able to pursue her reflections unmolested they were sad enough and it required all her firmness to support her when considering what was likely to befal her in consequence of her adherence to the fortunes of fawkes and his companions she had often pictured some dreadful situation like the present but the reality far exceeded her worst anticipations she had deemed herself equal to any emergency but as she thought upon the dark menaces of the earl of salisbury she felt it would require greater fortitude than she had hitherto displayed to bear her through her trial nor were her meditations entirely confined to herself while trembling for the perilous situation of guy fawkes she reproached herself that she could not requite even in thought the passionate devotion of humphrey chetham what matters it now she thought that i cannot love him i shall soon be nothing to him or to any one and yet i feel i have done him wrong and that i should be happier if i could requite his attachment but the die is cast it is too late to repent or to retreat my heart acquits me of having been influenced by any unworthy motive and i will strive to endure the keenest pang without a murmur shortly after this topcliffe returned with sir william waad on their entrance viviana arose and the lieutenant eyed her with some curiosity he was a middleaged man tall stoutlybuilt and having harsh features stamped with an expression of mingled cunning and ferocity his eyes had a fierce and bloodthirsty look and were overshadowed by thick and scowling brows saluting the captive with affected courtesy he observed so you refuse to answer the interrogations of the privy council madam i understand i am not sorry for it because i would have the merit of wringing the truth from you those who have been most stubborn outside these walls have been the most yielding within them that will not be my case replied viviana coldly we shall see returned the lieutenant with a significant glance at topcliffe ordering her to follow him he then proceeded along the ward in the direction of the bloody tower and passing beneath its arched gateway ascended the steps on the left and led her to his lodgings entering the habitation he mounted to the upper story and tracking a long gallery brought her to a small circular chamber in the bell tower its sole furniture were a chair a table and a couch here you will remain for the present observed the lieutenant smiling grimly and placing a lamp on the table it will depend upon yourself whether your accommodations are better hereafter with this he quitted the cell with his attendants and barred the door outside left alone viviana who had hitherto restrained her anguish suffered it to find vent in tears never had she felt so utterly forlorn and desolate all before her was threatening and terrible full of dangers real and imaginary nor could she look back upon her past career without something like remorse oh that heaven would take me to itself she murmured clasping her hands in an agony of distress for i feel unequal to my trials oh that i had perished with my dear father for what dreadful fate am i reservedtorturei will bear it if i can but death by the hands of the public executionerit is too horrible to think of is there no way to escape that as this hideous thought occurred to her she uttered a loud and prolonged scream and fell senseless on the floor when she recovered it was daylight and weak and exhausted she crept to the couch and throwing herself upon it endeavoured to forget her misery in sleep but as is usually the case with the afflicted it fled her eyelids and she passed several hours in the severest mental torture unrelieved by a single cheering thought about the middle of the day the door of the cell was opened by an old woman with a morose and forbidding countenance attended by a younger female who resembled her in all but the expression of her features her look was gentle and compassionate and who appeared to be her daughter without paying any attention to viviana the old woman took a small loaf of bread and other provisions from a basket she had brought with her and placed them on the table this done she was about to depart when her daughter who had glanced uneasily at the couch observed in a kindly tone shall we not inquire whether we can be of service to the poor young lady mother why should we concern ourselves about her ruth returned the old woman sharply if she wants anything she has a tongue and can speak if she desires further comforts she added in a significant tone they must be paid for i desire nothing but death groaned viviana the poor soul is dying i believe cried ruth rushing to the couch have you no cordialwater about you mother truly have i returned the old woman and i have other things besides but i must be paid for them as she spoke she drew from her pocket a small square dutchshaped bottle give it me cried ruth snatching it from her i am sure the young lady will pay for it you are very kind said viviana faintly but i have no means of doing so i knew it cried the old woman fiercely i knew it give me back the flask ruth she shall not taste a drop do you not hear she has no money wench give it me i say nay mother for pitys sake implored ruth pity forsooth exclaimed the old woman derisively if i and thy father jasper ipgreve had any such feeling it would be high time for him to give up his post of jailer in the tower of london pity for a poor prisoner thou a jailers daughter and talk so i am ashamed of thee wench but i thought this was a rich catholic heiress and had powerful and wealthy friends so she is replied ruth and though she may have no money with her now she can command any amount she pleases i heard master topcliffe tell young nicholas hardesty the warder so she is the daughter of the late sir william radcliffe of ordsall hall in lancashire and sole heiress of his vast estates is this so sweet lady inquired the old woman stepping towards the couch are you truly sir william radcliffes daughter i am replied viviana but i have said i require nothing from you leave me nono dear young lady rejoined dame ipgreve in a whining tone which was infinitely more disagreeable to viviana than her previous harshness i cannot leave you in this state raise her head ruth while i pour a few drops of the cordial down her throat i will not taste it replied viviana putting the flask aside you would find it a sovereign restorative replied dame ipgreve with a mortified look but as you please i will not urge you against your inclination the provisions i have been obliged to bring you are too coarse for a daintilynurtured maiden like youbut you shall have others presently it is needless rejoined viviana pray leave me well well i am going rejoined dame ipgreve hesitating do you want to write to any one i can find means of conveying a letter secretly out of the tower ah exclaimed viviana raising herself and yet nonoi dare not trust you you may replied the avaricious old womanprovided you pay me well i will think of it returned viviana but i have not strength to write now you must not give way thusindeed you must not dear lady said ruth in a voice of great kindness it will not be safe to leave you suffer me to remain with you willingly replied viviana most willingly stay with her then child said dame ipgreve i will go and prepare a nourishing broth for her take heed and make a shrewd bargain with her for thy attendance she added in a hasty whisper as she retired greatly relieved by the old womans departure viviana turned to ruth and thanked her in the warmest terms for her kindness a few minutes sufficed to convert the sympathy which these two young persons evidently felt towards each other into affectionate regard and the jailers daughter assured viviana that so long as she should be detained she would devote herself to her by this time the old woman had returned with a mess of hot broth which she carried with an air of great mystery beneath her cloak viviana was prevailed upon by the solicitations of ruth to taste it and found herself much revived in consequence her slight meal ended dame ipgreve departed with a promise to return in the evening with such viands as she could manage to introduce unobserved and with a flask of wine you will need it sweet lady i fear she said for my husband tells me you are in peril of the torture oh it is a sad thing that such as you should be so cruelly dealt with but we will take all the care of you we can you will not forget to requite us you must give me an order on your steward or on some rich catholic friend i am half a papist myselfthat is i like one religion as well as the otherand i like those best whatever their creed may be who pay best that is my maxim and it is the same with my husband we do all we can to scrape together a penny for our child no more of this good mother interrupted ruth it distresses the lady i will take care she wants nothing right child right returned dame ipgrevedo not forget what i told you she added in a whisper and she quitted the cell ruth remained with viviana during the rest of the day and it was a great consolation to the latter to find that her companion was of the same faith as herselfhaving been converted by father poole a romish priest who was confined in the tower during the latter part of elizabeths reign and whose sufferings and constancy for his religion had made a powerful impression on the jailers daughter as soon as viviana ascertained this she made ruth so far as she thought prudent a confidante in her misfortunes and after beguiling some hours in conversation they both knelt down and offered up fervent prayers to the virgin ruth then departed promising to return in the evening with her mother soon after it became dark dame ipgreve and her daughter reappeared the former carrying a lamp and the latter a basket of provisions ruths countenance was so troubled that viviana was certain that some fresh calamity was at hand what is the matter she hastily demanded make your meal first dear young lady replied dame ipgreve our news might take away your appetite and you will have to pay for your supper whether you eat it or not you alarm me greatly cried viviana anxiously what ill news do you bring i will not keep you longer in suspense madam said ruth you are to be examined tonight by the lieutenant and certain members of the privy council and if you refuse to answer their questions i lament to say you will be put to the torture heaven give me strength to endure it ejaculated viviana in a despairing tone eat madam eat cried dame ipgreve pressing the viands upon her you will never be able to go through with the examination if you starve yourself in this way are you sure inquired viviana appealing to ruth that it will take place so soon quite sure replied ruth my father has orders to attend the lieutenant at midnight let me advise you to conceal nothing insinuated the old woman they are determined to wring the truth from youand they will do so you are mistaken good woman replied viviana firmly i will die before i utter a word you think so now returned dame ipgreve maliciously but the sight of the rack and the thumbscrews will alter your tone at all events support nature no replied viviana as i do not desire to live i will use no effort to sustain myself they may kill me if they please misfortune has turned her brain muttered the old woman i must take care and secure my dues well madam if you will not eat the supper i have provided it cannot be helped i must find some one who will you must pay for it all the same my husband jasper ipgreve will be present at your interrogation and i am sure for my sake he will use you as lightly as he can come ruth you must not remain here longer oh let her stay with me implored viviana i will make it well worth your while to grant me the indulgence what will you give cried the old woman eagerly but nonoi dare not leave her the lieutenant may visit you and find her and then i should lose my place come along ruth she shall attend you after the interrogation madam i shall be there myself farewell madam sobbed ruth who was almost drowned in tears heaven grant you constancy to endure your trial be ruled by me said the old woman speak out and secure your own safety she would have continued in the same strain but ruth dragged her away and casting a commiserating glance at viviana she closed the door the dreadful interval between their departure and midnight was passed by viviana in fervent prayer as she heard through the barred embrasure of her dungeon the deep strokes of the clock toll out the hour of twelve the door opened and a tall gaunt personage habited in a suit of rusty black and with a large bunch of keys at his girdle entered the cell you are jasper ipgreve said viviana rising right replied the jailer i am come to take you before the lieutenant and the council are you ready viviana replied in the affirmative and ipgreve quitting the cell outside which two other officials in sable habiliments were stationed led the way down a short spiral staircase which brought them to a narrow vaulted passage pursuing it for some time the jailer halted before a strong door cased with iron and opening it admitted the captive into a square chamber the roof of which was supported by a heavy stone pillar while its walls were garnished with implements of torture at a table on the left sat the lieutenant and three other gravelooking personages across the lower end of the chamber a thick black curtain was stretched hiding a deep recess and behind it as was evident from the glimmer that escaped from its folds there was a light certain indistinct but ominous sounds issuing from the recess proved that there were persons within it and vivianas quaking heart told her what was the nature of their proceedings she had ample time to survey this dismal apartment and its occupants for several minutes elapsed before a word was addressed to her by her interrogators who continued to confer together in an under tone as if unconscious of her presence during this pause broken only by the ominous sounds before mentioned viviana scanned the countenances of the group at the table in the hope of discerning in them some glimpses of compassion but they were inscrutable and inexorable and scarcely less dreadful to look upon than the hideous implements on the walls viviana wished the earth would open and swallow her that she might escape from them anything was better than to be left at the mercy of such men at certain times and not unfrequently at the most awful moments a double current of thought will flow through the brain and at this frightful juncture it was so with viviana while shuddering at all she saw around her nay dwelling upon it another and distinct train of thought led her back to former scenes of happiness when she was undisturbed by any but remote apprehensions of danger she thought of her tranquil residence at ordsallof the flowers she had tended in the gardenof her father and of his affection for herof humphrey chetham and of her early and scarceacknowledged attachment to himand of his generosity and devotion and how she had requited it and then like a sullen cloud darkening the fair prospect arose the figure of guy fawkesthe sombre enthusiastwho had unwittingly exercised such a baneful influence upon her fortunes had he not crossed my path she mentally ejaculated i might have been happymight have loved humphrey chethammight perhaps have wedded him these reflections were suddenly dispersed by the lieutenant who in a stern tone commenced his interrogations as upon her previous examination viviana observed the utmost caution and either refused to speak or answered such questions only as affected herself at first in spite of all her efforts she trembled violently and her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth but after a while she recovered her courage and regarded the lieutenant with a look as determined as his own it is useless to urge me farther she concluded i have said all i will say is it your pleasure my lords observed sir william waad to the others to prolong the examination his companions replied in the negative and the one nearest him remarked is she aware what will follow i am replied viviana resolutely and i am not to be intimidated sir william waad then made a sign to ipgreve who immediately stepped forward and seized her arm you will be taken to that recess said the lieutenant where the question will be put to you but as we shall remain here you have only to utter a cry if you are willing to avow the truth and the torture shall be stayed and it is our merciful hope that this may be the case summoning up all her resolution and walking with a firm footstep viviana passed with ipgreve behind the curtain she there beheld two men and a womanthe latter was the jailers wife who instantly advanced to her and besought her to confess there is no help for it if you refuse she urged not all your wealth can save you mind your own business dame interposed ipgreve angrily and assist her to unrobe saying this he stepped aside with the two men one of whom was the chirurgeon and the other the tormentor while dame ipgreve helped to take off vivianas gown she then tied a scarf over her shoulders and informed her husband she was ready the recess was about twelve feet high and ten wide it was crossed near the roof which was arched and vaulted by a heavy beam with pulleys and ropes at either extremity but what chiefly attracted the unfortunate captives attention was a couple of iron gauntlets attached to it about a yard apart upon the ground under the beam and immediately beneath that part of it where the gauntlets were fixed were laid three pieces of wood of a few inches in thickness and piled one upon another what must i do inquired viviana in a hollow voice but with unaltered resolution of the old woman step upon those pieces of wood replied dame ipgreve leading her towards them viviana obeyed and as soon as she had set foot upon the pile the tormentor placed a jointstool beside her and mounting it desired her to place her right hand in one of the gauntlets she did so and the tormentor then turned a screw which compressed the iron glove so tightly as to give her excruciating pain he then got down and ipgreve demanded if he should proceed a short pause ensued but notwithstanding her agony viviana made no answer the tormentor then placed the stool on the left side and fastened the hand which was still at liberty within the other gauntlet the torture was dreadfuland the fingers appeared crushed by the pressure still viviana uttered no cry after another short pause ipgreve said you had better let us stop here this is mere childs play compared with what is to come no answer being returned the tormentor took a mallet and struck one of the pieces of wood from under vivianas feet the shock was dreadful and seemed to dislocate her wrists while the pressure on the hands was increased in a tenfold degree the poor sufferer who was resting on the points of her feet felt that the removal of the next piece of wood would occasion almost intolerable torture her constancy however did not desert her and after the question had been repeated by ipgreve the second block was struck away she was now suspended by her hands and the pain was so exquisite that nature gave way and uttering a piercing scream she fainted on recovering she found herself stretched upon a miserable pallet with ruth watching beside her a glance round the chamber which was of solid stone masonry with a deep embrasure on one side convinced her that she had been removed to some other prison where am i she asked in a faint voice in the well tower madam replied ruth one of the fortifications near the moat and now used as a prisonlodging my father dwells within it and you are under his custody your father cried viviana shuddering as she recalled the sufferings she had recently undergone will he torture me again not if i can prevent it dear lady replied ruth but hush here comes my mother not a word before her as ruth spoke dame ipgreve who had been lingering at the door entered the room she affected the greatest solicitude for vivianafelt her pulselooked at the bandages fastened round her swollen and crippled fingers and concluded by counselling her not to persist in refusing to speak i dare not tell you what tortures are in store for you she said if you continue thus obstinate but they will be a thousand times worse than what you endured last night when will my next interrogation take place inquired viviana a week hence it may beor it may be sooner returned the old woman it depends upon the state you are inand somewhat upon the fees you give my husband for he has a voice with the lieutenant i would give him all i possess if he could save me from further torture cried viviana alas alas replied dame ipgreve you ask more than can be done he would save you if he could but you will not let him however we will do all we can to mitigate your sufferingsall we canprovided you pay us stay with her child she added with a significant gesture to her daughter as she quitted the room stay with her my heart bleeds for you madam said ruth in accents of the deepest commiseration as soon as they were alone you may depend upon my fidelity if i can contrive your escape i willat any risk to myself on no account replied viviana do not concern yourself about me more my earthly sufferings i feel will have terminated before further cruelty can be practised upon me oh say not so madam returned ruth i hopenay i am sure you will live long and happily viviana shook her head and ruth finding her very feeble thought it better not to continue the conversation she accordingly applied such restoratives as were at hand and observing that the eyes of the sufferer closed as if in slumber glided noiselessly out of the chamber and left her in this way a week passed at the expiration of that time the chirurgeon pronounced her in so precarious a state that if the torture were repeated he would not answer for her life the interrogation therefore was postponed for a few days during which the chirurgeon constantly visited her and by his care and the restoratives she was compelled to take she rapidly regained her strength one day after the chirurgeon had departed ruth cautiously closed the door and observed to her you are now so far recovered madam as to be able to make an attempt to escape i have devised a plan which i will communicate to you tomorrow it must not be delayed or you will have to encounter a second and more dreadful examination i will not attempt it if you are exposed to risk replied viviana heed me not returned ruth one of your friends has found out your place of confinement and has spoken to me about you what friend exclaimed viviana starting guy fawkesi mean and she hesitated while her pale cheeks were suffused with blushes he is named humphrey chetham returned ruth like myself he would risk his life to preserve you tell him he must not do so cried viviana eagerly he has done enoughtoo much for me already i will not expose him to further hazard tell him so and entreat him to abandon the attempt but i shall not see him dear lady replied ruth besides if i read him rightly he is not likely to be turned aside by any selfish consideration you are right he is not groaned viviana but this only adds to my affliction oh if you should see him dear ruth try to dissuade him from his purpose i will obey you madam replied the jailers daughter but i am well assured it will be of no avail after some further conversation ruth retired and viviana was left alone for the night except the slumber procured by soporific potions she had known no repose since she had been confined within the tower and this night she felt more than usually restless after ineffectually endeavouring to compose herself she arose and hastily robing herselfa task she performed with no little difficulty her fingers being almost uselesscontinued to pace her narrow chamber it has been mentioned that on one side of the cell there was a deep embrasure it was terminated by a narrow and stronglygrated loophole looking upon the moat pausing before it viviana gazed forth the night was pitchy dark and not even a solitary star could be discerned but as she had no light in her chamber the gloom outside was less profound than that within while standing thus buried in thought and longing for daybreak viviana fancied she heard a slight sound as of some one swimming across the moat thinking she might be deceived she listened more intently and as the sound continued she felt sure she was right in her conjecture all at once the thought of humphrey chetham flashed upon her and she had no doubt it must be him nor was she wrong the next moment a noise was heard as of some one clambering up the wall a hand grasped the bars of the loophole which was only two or three feet above the level of the water and a low voice which she instantly recognised pronounced her name is it humphrey chetham she asked advancing as near as she could to the loophole it is was the reply do not despair i will accomplish your liberation i have passed three days within the tower and only ascertained your place of confinement a few hours ago i have contrived a plan for your escape with the jailers daughter which she will make known to you tomorrow i cannot thank you sufficiently for your devotion replied viviana in accents of the deepest gratitude but i implore you to leave me to my fate i am wretched enough now heaven knows but if aught should happen to you i shall be infinitely more so if i possess any power over youand that i do so i well knowi entreat nay i command you to desist from this attempt i have never yet disobeyed you viviana replied the young merchant passionatelynor will i do so now but if you bid me abandon you i will plunge into this moat never to rise again his manner notwithstanding the low tone in which he spoke was so determined that viviana felt certain he would carry his threat into execution she therefore rejoined in a mournful tone well be it as you will it is in vain to resist our fate i am destined to bring misfortune to you not so replied chetham if i can save you i would rather die than live the jailers daughter will explain her plan to you tomorrow promise me to accede to it viviana reluctantly assented i shall quit the tower at daybreak pursued chetham and when you are once out of it hasten to the stairs beyond the wharf at petty wales i will be there with a boat farewell as he spoke he let himself drop into the water but his foot slipping the plunge was louder than he intended and attracted the attention of a sentinel on the ramparts who immediately called out to know what was the matter and not receiving any answer discharged his caliver in the direction of the sound viviana who heard the challenge and the shot uttered a loud scream and the next moment ipgreve and his wife appeared the jailer glanced suspiciously round the room but after satisfying himself that all was right and putting some questions to the captive which she refused to answer he departed with his wife and carefully barred the door it is impossible to imagine greater misery than viviana endured the whole of the night the uncertainty in which she was kept as to chethams fate was almost insupportable and the bodily pain she had recently endured appeared light when compared with her present mental torture day at length dawned but it brought with it no ruth instead of this faithful friend dame ipgreve entered the chamber with the morning meal and her looks were so morose and distrustful that viviana feared she must have discovered her daughters design she did not however venture to make a remark but suffered the old woman to depart in silence giving up all for lost and concluding that humphrey chetham had either perished or was like herself a prisoner viviana bitterly bewailed his fate and reproached herself with being unintentionally the cause of it later in the day ruth entered the cell to vivianas eager inquiries she replied that humphrey chetham had escaped owing to the darkness the sentinel had missed his aim and although the most rigorous search was instituted throughout the fortress he had contrived to elude observation our attempt pursued ruth must be made this evening the lieutenant has informed my father that you are to be interrogated at midnight the chirurgeon having declared that you are sufficiently recovered to undergo the torture if needful a second time now listen to me the occurrence of last night has made my mother suspicious and she watches my proceedings with a jealous eye she is at this moment with a female prisoner in the beauchamp tower or i should not be able to visit you she has consented however to let me bring in your supper you must then change dresses with me being about my height you may easily pass for me and i will take care there is no light below so that your features will not be distinguished viviana would have checked her but the other would not be interrupted as soon as you are ready she continued you must lock the door upon me you must then descend the short flight of steps before you and pass as quickly as you can through the room where you will see my father and mother as soon as you are out of the door turn to the left and go straight forward to the byward tower show this pass to the warders it is made out in my name and they will suffer you to go forth do the same with the warders at the next gatethe middle towerand again at the bulwark gate that passed you are free and what will become of you asked viviana with a bewildered look never mind me rejoined ruth i shall be sufficiently rewarded if i save you and now farewell be ready at the time appointed i cannot consent returned viviana you have no choice replied ruth breaking from her and hurrying out of the room time as it ever does when expectation is on the rack appeared to pass with unusual slowness but as the hour at length drew near viviana wished it farther off it was with the utmost trepidation that she heard the key turn in the lock and beheld ruth enter the cell with the evening meal closing the door and setting down the provisions the jailers daughter hastily divested herself of her dress which was of brown serge as well as of her coif and kerchief while viviana imitated her example without pausing to attire herself in the others garments ruth then assisted viviana to put on the dress she had just laid aside and arranged her hair and the headgear so skilfully that the disguise was complete hastily whispering some further instructions to her and explaining certain peculiarities in her gait and deportment she then pressed her to her bosom and led her to the door viviana would have remonstrated but ruth pushed her through it and closed it there was now no help so viviana though with great pain to herself contrived to turn the key in the lock descending the steps she found herself in a small circular chamber in which ipgreve and his wife were seated at a table discussing their evening meal the sole light was afforded by a few dying embers on the hearth what has she done already demanded the old woman as viviana appeared why hast thou not brought the jelly with thee if she has not eaten it all and those cates which master pilchard the chirurgeon ordered her go and fetch them directly they will finish our repast daintily and there are other matters too which i dare say she has not touched she will pay for them and that will make them the sweeter go back i say what dost thou stand there for as if thou wert thunderstruck dost hear me or not let the wench alone dame growled ipgreve you frighten her so i mean to do replied the old woman she deserves to be frightened hark thee girl we must get an order from her on some wealthy catholic family without delayfor i dont think she will stand the trial tonight nor i added ipgreve especially as she is to be placed on the rack she has a chain of gold round her throat i have observed said the old woman we must get that i have it said viviana in a low tone and imitating as well as she could the accents of ruth here it is did she give it thee cried the old woman getting up and grasping vivianas lacerated fingers with such force that she had difficulty in repressing a scream did she give it thee i say she gave it me for you gasped viviana take it while the old woman held the chain to the fire and called to her husband to light a lamp that she might feast her greedy eyes upon it viviana flew to the door just as she reached it the shrill voice of dame ipgreve arrested her come back cried the dame whither art thou going at this time of night i will not have thee stir forth come back i say pshaw let her go interposed ipgreve i dare say she hath an appointment on the green with young nicholas hardesty the warder go wench be careful of thyself and return within the hour if she does not she will rue it added the dame go then and i will see the prisoner viviana required no further permission starting off as she had been directed on the left she ran as fast as her feet could carry her and passing between two arched gateways soon reached the byward tower showing the pass to the warder he chucked her under the chin and drawing an immense bolt opened the wicket and gallantly helped her to pass through it the like good success attended her at the middle tower and at the bulwark gate scarcely able to credit her senses and doubting whether she was indeed free she hurried on till she came to the opening leading to the stairs at petty wales as she hesitated uncertain what to do a man advanced towards and addressed her by name it was humphrey chetham overcome by emotion viviana sank into his arms and in another moment she was placed in a wherry which was ordered to be rowed towards westminster chapter ix the counterplot startled but not dismayedfor he was a man of great courageby the sudden address and appearance of guy fawkes lord mounteagle instantly sprang to his feet and drawing his sword put himself into a posture of defence you have betrayed me he cried seizing tresham with his left hand but if i fall you shall fall with me you have betrayed yourself my lord rejoined guy fawkes or rather heaven has placed you in our hands as an instrument for the liberation of viviana radcliffe you must take an oath of secrecya binding oathsuch as being a good catholic you cannot breaknot to divulge what has come to your knowledge nay you must join me and my confederates or you quit not this spot with life i refuse your terms replied mounteagle resolutely i will never conspire against the monarch to whom i have sworn allegiance i will not join you i will not aid you in procuring viviana radcliffes release nor will i take the oath you propose on the contrary i arrest you as a traitor and i command you tresham in the kings name to assist me in his capture but suddenly extricating himself from the grasp imposed upon him and placing guy fawkes between him and the earl tresham rejoined it is time to throw off the mask my good lord and brother i can render you no assistance i am sworn to this league and must support it unless you assent to the conditions proposedand which for your own sake i would counsel you to doi must despite our near relationship take part against youeven he added significantly if your destruction should be resolved upon i will sell my life dearly as you shall find replied mounteagle and but for the sake of my dear lady your sister i would stab you where you stand your lordship will find resistance in vain replied guy fawkes keeping his eye steadily fixed upon him we seek not your life but your cooperation you are a prisoner a prisoner echoed mounteagle derisively you have not secured me yet and as he spoke he rushed towards the door but his departure was checked by bates who presented himself at the entrance of the passage with a drawn sword in his hand at the same moment catesby and keyes issued from the closet while garnet and the other conspirators likewise emerged from their hidingplaces hearing the noise behind him lord mounteagle turned and beholding the group uttered an exclamation of surprise and rage i am fairly entrapped he said sheathing his sword and advancing towards them fool that i was to venture hither these regrets are too late my lord replied catesby you came hither of your own accord but being here nothing except compliance with our demands can ensure your departure yes one thing else thought mounteaglecunning it shall go hard if i cannot outwit you tresham will act with me i know his treacherous nature too well to doubt which way he will incline interest as well as relationship binds him to me he will acquaint me with their plans i need not therefore compromise myself by joining them if i take the oath of secrecy it will sufficeand i will find means of eluding the obligation i may thus make my own bargain with salisbury but i must proceed cautiously too sudden a compliance might awaken their suspicions my lord said catesby who had watched his countenance narrowly and distrusted its expression we must have no doubledealing any attempt to play us false will prove fatal to you i have not yet consented to your terms mr catesby replied mounteagle and i demand a few moments reflection before i do so what say you gentlemen said catesby do you agree to his lordships request there was a general answer in the affirmative i would also confer for a moment alone with my brother tresham said mounteagle that cannot be my lord rejoined garnet peremptorily and take heed you meditate no treachery towards us or you will destroy yourself here and hereafter i have no desire to speak with him father observed tresham let him declare what he has to say before you all mounteagle looked hard at him but he made no remark in my opinion we ought not to trust him observed keyes it is plain he is decidedly opposed to us and if the oath is proposed to him he may take it with some mental reservation i will guard against that replied garnet if i take the oath i will keep it father rejoined mounteagle but i have not yet decided you must do so then quickly my lord returned catesby you shall have five minutes for reflection but first you must deliver up your sword the earl started we mean you no treachery my lord observed keyes and expect to be dealt with with equal fairness surrendering his sword to catesby mounteagle then walked to the farther end of the room and leaning against the wall with his back to the conspirators appeared buried in thought take tresham aside whispered catesby to wright i do not wish him to overhear our conference watch him narrowly and see that no signal passes between him and lord mounteagle wright obeyed and the others gathering closely together began to converse in a low tone it will not do to put him to death observed garnet from what he stated to tresham it appears that his servant was aware of his coming hither if he disappears therefore search will be immediately made and all will be discovered we must either instantly secure ourselves by flight and give up the enterprise or trust him you are right father replied rookwood the danger is imminent we are safe at present observed percy and may escape to france or flanders before information can be given against us nay we may carry off mounteagle with us for that matter but i am loth to trust him so am i rejoined catesby i do not like his looks there is no help said fawkes we must trust him or give up the enterprise he may materially aid us and has himself asserted that he can procure vivianas liberation from the tower pshaw exclaimed catesby impatiently what has that to do with the allimportant question we are now considering much returned fawkes and i will not move further in the matter unless that point is insisted on you have become strangely interested in viviana of late observed catesby sarcastically could i suspect you of so light a passion i should say you loved her a deep flush dyed fawkess swarthy cheeks but he answered in a voice of constrained calmness i do love heras a daughter humph exclaimed the other drily catesby rejoined fawkes sternly you know me welltoo well to suppose i would resort to any paltry subterfuge i am willing to let what you have said pass but i counsel you not to jest thus in future jest exclaimed catesby i was never more serious in my life then you do me wrong retorted fawkes fiercely and you will repeat the insinuation at your peril my sonsmy sons interposed garnet what means this suddenthis needless quarrel at a moment when we require the utmost calmness to meet the danger that assails us guy fawkes is right viviana must be saved if we desert her our cause will never prosper but let us proceed step by step and first decide upon what is to be done with lord mounteagle i am filled with perplexity replied catesby then i will decide for you replied percy our project must be abandoned never replied fawkes energetically fly and secure your own safety i will stay and accomplish it alone a brave resolution exclaimed catesby tendering him his hand which the other cordially grasped i will stand by you to the last nowe have advanced too far to retreat additional caution will be needful observed keyes can we not make it a condition with lord mounteagle to retire till the blow is struck to his mansion at hoxton that would be of no avail replied garnet we must trust him wholly or not at all there i agree with you father said percy let us propose the oath of secrecy to him and detain him here until we have found some secure retreat utterly unknown to him or to tresham whence we can correspond with our friends a few days will show whether he has betrayed us or not we need not visit this place again till the moment for action arrives you need not visit it again at all rejoined fawkes everything is prepared and i will undertake to fire the train prepare for what is to follow the explosion and leave the management of that to me i cannot consent to such a course my son said garnet the whole risk will thus be yours the whole glory will be mine also father rejoined fawkes enthusiastically i pray you let me have my own way well be it as you will my son returned garnet with affected reluctance i will not oppose the hand of heaven which clearly points you out as the chief agent in this mighty enterprise in reference to what percy has said about a retreat till lord mounteagles trustworthiness can be ascertained he added to catesby i have just bethought me of a large retired house on the borders of enfield chase called white webbs it has been recently taken by mrs brooksby and her sister anne vaux and will afford us a safe asylum an excellent plan father cried catesby since guy fawkes is willing to undertake the risk we will leave lord mounteagle in his charge and go there at once what must be done with tresham asked percy we cannot take him with us nor must he know of our retreat leave him with me said fawkes you will be at a disadvantage observed catesby should he take part as there is reason to fear he may do with lord mounteagle they are both unarmed returned fawkes but were it otherwise i would answer with my head for their detention all good saints guard you my son exclaimed garnet henceforth we resign the custody of the powder to you it will be in safe keeping replied fawkes the party then advanced towards lord mounteagle who hearing their approach instantly faced them your decision my lord demanded catesby you shall have it in a word sir replied mounteagle firmly i will not join you but i will take the required oath of secrecy is this your final resolve my lord rejoined catesby it is replied the earl it must content us observed garnet though we hoped you would have lent your active services to further a cause having for its sole object the restoration of the church to which you belong i know not the means whereby you propose to restore it father replied mounteagle and i do not desire to know them but i guess that they are dark and bloody and as such i can take no part in them and you refuse to give us any counsel or assistance pursued garnet i will not betray you replied mounteagle i can say nothing further i would rather he promised too little than too much whispered catesby to garnet i begin to think him sincere i am of the same opinion my son returned garnet one thing you shall do before i consent to set you free on any terms my lord observed guy fawkes you shall engage to procure the liberation of viviana radcliffe from the tower you told tresham you could easily accomplish it i scarcely knew what i said replied mounteagle with a look of embarrassment you spoke confidently my lord rejoined fawkes because i had no idea i should be compelled to make good my words returned the earl but as a catholic and related by marriage to tresham who is a suspected person any active exertions in her behalf on my part might place me in jeopardy this excuse shall not avail you my lord replied fawkes you must weigh your own safety against hers you stir not hence till you have sworn to free her i must perforce assent since you will have no refusal replied mounteagle but i almost despair of success if i can effect her deliverance i swear to do so enough replied fawkes and now gentlemen said catesby appealing to the others are you willing to let lord mounteagle depart upon the proposed terms we are they replied i will administer the oath at once said garnet and you will bear in mind my son he added in a stern tone to the earl that it will be one which cannot be violated without perdition to your soul i am willing to take it replied mounteagle producing a primer and motioning the earl to kneel before him garnet then proposed an oath of the most solemn and binding description the other repeated it after him and at its conclusion placed the book to his lips are you satisfied he asked rising i am replied garnet and so am i thought tresham who stood in the rear that he will perjure himself am i now at liberty to depart inquired the earl not yet my lord replied catesby you must remain here till midnight lord mounteagle looked uneasy but seeing remonstrance would be useless he preserved a sullen silence you need have no fear my lord said catesby but we must take such precautions as will ensure our safety in case you intend us any treachery you cannot doubt me sir after the oath i have taken replied mounteagle haughtily but since you constitute yourself my jailer i must abide your pleasure if i am your jailer my lord rejoined catesby i will prove to you that i am not neglectful of my office will it please you to follow me the earl bowed in acquiescence and catesby marching before him to a small room the windows of which were carefully barred pointed to a chair and instantly retiring locked the door upon him he then returned to the others and taking guy fawkes aside observed in a low tone we shall set out instantly for white webbs you will remain on guard with tresham whom you will of course keep in ignorance of our proceedings after you have set the earl at liberty you can follow us if you choose but take heed you are not observed fear nothing replied fawkes soon after this catesby and the rest of the conspirators with the exception of guy fawkes and tresham quitted the room and the former concluded they were about to leave the house he made no remark however to his companion but getting between him and the door folded his arms upon his breast and continued to pace backwards and forwards before it am i a prisoner as well as lord mounteagle asked tresham after a pause you must remain with me here till midnight replied fawkes we shall not be disturbed what are the others gone cried tresham they are was the reply treshams countenance fell and he appeared to be meditating some project which he could not muster courage to execute be warned by the past tresham said fawkes who had regarded him fixedly for some minutes if i find reason to doubt you i will put it out of your power to betray us a second time you have no reason to doubt me replied tresham with apparent candour i only wondered that our friends should leave me without any intimation of their purpose it is for me not you to apprehend some ill design am i not to act with you further that depends upon yourself and on the proofs you give of your sincerity replied fawkes answer me frankly do you think lord mounteagle will keep his oath i will stake my life upon it replied tresham the conversation then dropped and no attempt was made on either side to renew it in this way several hours passed when at length the silence was broken by tresham who requested permission to go in search of some refreshment and guy fawkes assenting they descended to the lower room and partook of a slight repast nothing further worthy of note occurred on the arrival of the appointed hour guy fawkes signified to his companion that he might liberate lord mounteagle and immediately availing himself of the permission tresham repaired to the chamber and threw open the door the earl immediately came forth and they returned together to the room in which guy fawkes remained on guard you are now at liberty to depart my lord said the latter and tresham can accompany you if he thinks proper remember that you have sworn to procure vivianas liberation i do replied the earl and he then quitted the house with tresham you have had a narrow escape my lord remarked the latter as they approached whitehall and paused for a moment under the postern of the great western gate true replied the earl but i do not regret the risk i have run they are now wholly in my power you forget your oath my lord said tresham if i do replied the earl i but follow your example you have broken one equally solemn equally binding and would break a thousand more were they imposed upon you but i will overthrow this conspiracy and yet not violate mine i see not how that can be my lord replied tresham you shall learn in due season replied the earl i have had plenty of leisure for reflection in that dark hole and have hit upon a plan which i think cannot fail i hope i am no party to it my lord rejoined tresham i dare not hazard myself among them further i cannot do without you replied mounteagle but i will ensure you against all danger it will be necessary for you however to act with the utmost discretion and keep a constant guard upon every look and movement as well as upon your words you must fully regain the confidence of these men and lull them into security i see your lordships drift replied tresham you wish them to proceed to the last point to enhance the value of the discovery right replied the earl the plot must not be discovered till just before its outbreak when its magnitude and danger will be the more apparent the reward will then be proportionate now you understand me tresham fully replied the other return to your own house rejoined mounteagle we need hold no further communication together till the time for action arrives and that will not be before the meeting of parliament replied tresham for they intend to whelm the king and all his nobles in one common destruction by heaven a brave design cried mounteagle it is a pity to mar it i knew it was a desperate and daring project but should never have conceived aught like this its discovery will indeed occasion universal consternation it may benefit you and me to divulge it my lord said tresham but the disclosure will deeply and lastingly injure the church of rome it would injure it more deeply if the plot succeeded replied mounteagle because all loyal catholics must disapprove so horrible and sanguinary a design but we will not discuss the question further though what you have said confirms my purpose and removes any misgiving i might have felt as to the betrayal farewell tresham keep a watchful eye upon the conspirators and communicate with me should any change take place in their plans we may not meet for some time parliament though summoned for the third of october will in all probability be prorogued till november in that case replied tresham you will postpone your disclosure likewise till november assuredly replied mounteagle the king must be convinced of his danger if it were found out now he would think lightly of it but if he has actually set foot upon the mine which a single spark might kindle to his destruction he will duly appreciate the service rendered him farewell and do not neglect my counsel chapter x white webbs tarrying for a short time within the house after the departure of the others guy fawkes lighted a lantern and concealing it beneath his cloak proceeded to the cellar to ascertain that the magazine of powder was safe satisfied of this he made all secure and was about to return to the house when he perceived a figure approaching him standing aside but keeping on his guard for fear of a surprise he would have allowed the person to pass but the other halted and after a moments scrutiny addressed him by name in the tones of humphrey chetham you seem to haunt this spot young sir said fawkes in answer to the address this is the third time we have met hereabouts on the last occasion replied chetham i told you viviana was a prisoner in the tower i have now better news for you she is free free exclaimed fawkes joyfully by lord mounteagles instrumentalitybut i forget he has only just left me she has been freed by my instrumentality replied the young merchant she escaped from the tower a few hours ago where is she demanded guy fawkes eagerly in a boat at the stairs near the parliament house replied chetham heaven and our lady be praised exclaimed fawkes this is more than i hoped for your news is so good young sir that i can scarce credit it come with me to the boat and you shall soon be satisfied of the truth of my statement rejoined chetham and followed by guy fawkes he hurried to the river side where a wherry was moored within it sat viviana covered by the tilt assisting her to land and finding she was too much exhausted to walk guy fawkes took her in his arms and carried her to the house he had just quitted humphrey chetham followed as soon as he had dismissed the waterman placing his lovely burthen in a seat guy fawkes instantly went in search of such restoratives as the place afforded viviana was extremely faint but after she had swallowed a glass of wine she revived and looking around her inquired where she was do not ask replied fawkes let it suffice you are in safety and now he added perhaps humphrey chetham will inform me in what manner he contrived your escape i am impatient to know the young merchant then gave the required information and viviana added such particulars as were necessary to the full understanding of the story guy fawkes could scarcely control himself when she related the tortures she had endured nor was chetham less indignant you rescued me just in time said viviana i should have sunk under the next application thank heaven you have escaped it exclaimed fawkes you owe much to humphrey chetham viviana i do indeed she replied and can you not requite it he returned can you not make him happycan you not make me happy vivianas pale cheek was instantly suffused with blushes but she made no answer oh viviana cried humphrey chetham you hear what is said if you could doubt my love before you must be convinced of it now a hope will make me happy have i that alas no she answered it would be the height of cruelty after your kindness to deceive you you have not the young merchant turned aside to hide his emotion not even a hope exclaimed guy fawkes after what he has done viviana i cannot understand you does gratitude form no part of your nature i hope so she replied nay i am sure sofor i feel the deepest gratitude towards humphrey chetham but gratitude is not love and must not be mistaken for it i understand the distinction too well returned the young merchant sadly it is more than i do rejoined guy fawkes and i will frankly confess that i think the important services humphrey chetham has rendered you entitle him to your hand it is seldomwhatever poets may feignthat love is so strongly proved as his has been and it ought to be adequately requited say no more about it i entreat interposed chetham but i will deliver my opinion rejoined guy fawkes because i am sure what i advise is for vivianas happiness no one can love her better than you no one is more worthy of her nor is there any one to whom i so much desire to see her united oh heaven exclaimed viviana this is worse than the torture what mean you exclaimed fawkes in astonishment she means interposed chetham that this is not the fitting season to urge the subjectthat she will never marry truetrue replied viviana if i ever did marryi ought to select you you ought replied fawkes and i know nothing of the female heart if it can be insensible to youth devotion and manly appearance like that of humphrey chetham you do know nothing of it rejoined chetham bitterly womens fancies are unaccountable such is the received opinion replied fawkes but as i am ignorant of the sex i can only judge from report you are the person i should imagine she would lovenay to be frank whom i thought she did love no more said humphrey chetham it is painful both to viviana and to me this is not a time for delicacy rejoined guy fawkes viviana has given me the privilege of a father with her and where her happiness is so much concerned as in the present case i should imperfectly discharge my duty if i did not speak out it would sincerely rejoice me and i am sure contribute materially to her own happiness if she would unite herself to you i cannoti cannot she rejoined i will never marry you hear what she says remarked chetham do not urge the matter further i admire maiden delicacy and reserve replied fawkes but when a man has acted as you have done he deserves to be treated with frankness i am sure viviana loves you let her tell you so you are mistaken replied chetham and it is time you should be undeceived she loves another is this so cried fawkes in astonishment she made no answer whom do you love he asked still no answer i will tell you whom she lovesand let her contradict me if i am wrong said chetham oh nonoin pity spare me cried viviana speakthundered fawkes who is it yourself replied chetham what exclaimed fawkes recoilinglove me i will not believe it she loves me as a fatherbut nothing morenothing more but you were right let us change the subject a more fitting season may arrive for its discussion after some further conversation it was agreed that viviana should be taken to white webbs and leaving her in charge of humphrey chetham guy fawkes went in search of a conveyance to enfield traversing the strandevery hostel in which was closedhe turned up wychstreet immediately on the right of which there was a large inn still in existence and entering the yard discovered a knot of carriers moving about with lanterns in their hands to his inquiries respecting a conveyance to enfield one of them answered that he was about to return thither with his waggon at four oclockit was then twoand should be glad to take him and his friends overjoyed at the intelligence and at once agreeing to the mans terms guy fawkes hurried back to his companions and with the assistance of humphrey chetham contrived to carry viviana for she was utterly unable to support herself to the innyard where she was immediately placed in the waggon on a heap of fresh straw about an hour after this but long before daybreak the carrier attached his horses to the waggon and set out guy fawkes and humphrey chetham were seated near viviana but little was said during the journey which occupied about three hours by this time it was broad daylight and as the carrier stopped at the door of a small inn guy fawkes alighted and inquired the distance to white webbs it is about a mile and a half off replied the man if you pursue that lane it will bring you to a small village about half a mile from this where you are sure to find some one who will gladly guide you to the house which is a little out of the road on the borders of the forest he then assisted viviana to alight and humphrey chetham descending at the same time the party took the road indicateda winding country lane with high hedges broken by beautiful timberand proceeding at a slow pace they arrived in about half an hour at a little cluster of cottages which guy fawkes guessed to be the village alluded to by the carrier as they approached it a rustic leaped a hedge and was about to cross to another field when guy fawkes calling to him inquired the way to white webbs i am going in that direction replied the man if you desire it i will show you the road i shall feel much indebted to you friend returned fawkes and will reward you for your trouble i want no reward returned the countryman trudging forward following their guide after a few minutes brisk walking they reached the borders of the forest and took their way along a patch of greensward that skirted it in some places their track was impeded by gigantic thorns and brushwood while at others avenues opened upon them affording them peeps into the heart of the wood it was a beautiful sylvan scene and as at length they arrived at the head of a long glade at the farther end of which a herd of deer were seen with their branching antlers mingling with the overhanging boughs viviana could not help pausing to admire it king james often hunts within the forest observed the countryman indeed i heard one of the rangers say it was not unlikely he might be here today he is at theobalds palace now indeed exclaimed fawkes let us proceed we lose time are we far from the house not above a quarter of a mile was the answer you will see it at the next turn of the road as the countryman had intimated they speedily perceived the roof and tall chimneys of an ancient house above the trees and as it was now impossible to mistake the road guy fawkes thanked their guide for his trouble and would have rewarded him but he refused the gratuity and leaping a hedge disappeared pursuing the road they shortly afterwards arrived at a gate leading to the housea large building erected probably at the beginning of elizabeths reignand entering it they passed under an avenue of trees on approaching the mansion they observed that many of the windows were closed and the whole appearance of the place was melancholy and deserted the garden was overgrown with weeds and the door looked as if it was rarely opened not discouraged by these appearances but rather satisfied by them of the security of the asylum guy fawkes proceeded to the back of the house and entering a court the flags and stones of which were covered with moss while the interstices were filled with long grass guy fawkes knocked against a small door and after repeating the summons it was answered by an old womanservant who popped her head out of an upper window and demanded his business guy fawkes was about to inquire for mrs brooksby when another head which proved to be that of catesby appeared at the window on seeing fawkes and his companions catesby instantly descended and unfastened the door the house proved far more comfortable within than its exterior promised and the old female domestic having taken word to anne vaux that viviana was below the former lady who had not yet risen sent for her to her chamber and provided everything for her comfort guy fawkes and humphrey chetham neither of whom had rested during the night were glad to obtain a few hours repose on the floor of the first room into which they were shown and they were not disturbed until the day had considerably advanced when catesby thought fit to rouse them from their slumbers explanations were then given on both sides chetham detailed the manner of vivianas escape from the tower and catesby in his turn acquainted them that father oldcorne was in the house having found his way thither after his escape from the dwelling at lambeth guy fawkes was greatly rejoiced at the intelligence and shortly afterwards had the satisfaction of meeting with the priest at noon the whole party assembled with the exception of viviana who by the advice of anne vaux kept her chamber to recruit herself after the sufferings she had undergone humphrey chetham of whom no suspicions were now entertained and of whom catesby no longer felt any jealousy was invited to stay in the house and he was easily induced to pass his time near viviana although he might not be able to see her long and frequent consultations were held by the conspirators and letters were despatched by catesby to the elder winter at his seat huddington in worcestershire entreating him to make every preparation for the crisis as well as to sir everard digby to desire him to assemble as many friends as he could muster against the meeting of parliament at dunchurch in warwickshire under the plea of a grand huntingparty arrangements were next made as to the steps to be taken by the different parties after the explosion catesby undertook with a sufficient force to seize the princess elizabeth the eldest daughter of james the first who was then at the residence of the earl of harrington near coventry and to proclaim her queen in case the others should fail in securing the princes it was supposed that henry prince of wales who it need scarcely be mentioned died in his youth would be present with the king his father in the parliament house and would perish with him and in this case as charles duke of york afterwards charles the first would become successor to the throne it was resolved that he should be seized by percy and instantly proclaimed other resolutions were decided upon and the whole time of the conspirators was spent in maturing their projects and thus weeks and even months stole on viviana had completely regained her strength and passed a life of perfect seclusion seldom if ever mixing with the others she however took a kindly farewell of humphrey chetham before his departure for manchester for which place he set out about a fortnight after his arrival at white webbs having first sought out his servant martin heydocke but though strongly urged by guy fawkes she would hold out no hopes of a change in her sentiments towards the young merchant meetings were occasionally held by the conspirators elsewhere and catesby and fawkes had more than one interview with treshambut never except in places where they were secure from a surprise the latter end of september had now arrived and the meeting of parliament was still fixed for the third of october on the last day of the month guy fawkes prepared to start for town but before doing so he desired to see viviana they had not met for some weeks nor indeed since fawkes had discovered the secret of her heart and perhaps of his own had they ever met with the same freedom as heretofore as she entered the room in which he awaited her coming a tremor agitated his frame but he had nerved himself for the interview and speedily subdued the feeling i am starting for london viviana he said in a voice of forced calmness you may guess for what purpose but as i may never behold you again i would not part with you without a confession of my weakness i will not deny that what humphrey chetham stated and which you have never contradictednamely that you loved me for i must speak outhas produced a strong effect upon me i have endeavoured to conquer it but it will return till i knew you i never loved viviana indeed she exclaimed never he replied the fairest had not power to move me but i grieve to saynotwithstanding my strugglesi do not continue equally insensible ah she ejaculated becoming as pale as death why should i hesitate to declare my feelings why should i not tell you thatthough blinded to it so longi have discovered that i do love you why should i hesitate to tell you that i regret this and lament that we ever met what mean you cried viviana with a terrified look i will tell you replied fawkes till i saw you my thoughts were removed from earth and fixed on one object till i saw you i asked not to live but to die the death of a martyr die so still rejoined viviana forget meoh forget me i cannot replied fawkes i have striven against it but your image is perpetually before me nay at this very moment when i am about to set out on the enterprise you alone detain me i am glad of it exclaimed viviana fervently oh that i could prevent youcould save you save me echoed fawkes bitterly you destroy me how she asked because i am sworn to this project he rejoined and if i were turned from it i would perish by my own hand oh say not so replied viviana but listen to me abandon it and i will devote myself to you guy fawkes gazed at her for a moment passionately and then covering his face with his hands appeared torn by conflicting emotions viviana approached him and pressing his arm asked in an entreating voice are you still determined to pursue your dreadful project i am replied fawkes uncovering his face and gazing at her but if i remain here a moment longer i shall not be able to do so i will detain you then she rejoined and exercise the power i possess over you for your benefit no he replied vehemently it must not be farewell for ever and breaking from her he rushed out of the room as he gained the passage he encountered catesby who looked abashed at seeing him i have overheard what has passed said the latter and applaud your resolution few men similarly circumstanced would have acted as you have done you would not said fawkes coldly perhaps not rejoined catesby but that does not lessen my admiration of your conduct i am devoted to one object replied fawkes and nothing shall turn me from it remove yourself instantly from temptation then replied catesby i will meet you at the cellar beneath the parliament house tomorrow night with this he accompanied guy fawkes to the door and the latter without hazarding a look behind him set out for london where he arrived at nightfall on the following night fawkes examined the cellar and found it in all respects as he had left it and apprehensive lest some difficulty might arise he resolved to make every preparation he accordingly pierced the sides of several of the barrels piled against the walls with a gimlet and inserted in the holes small pieces of slowburning match not content with this he staved in the tops of the uppermost tier and scattered powder among them to secure their instantaneous ignition this done he took a powderhorn with which he was provided and kneeling down and holding his lantern so as to throw a light upon the floor laid a train to one of the lower barrels and brought it within a few inches of the door intending to fire it from that point his arrangements completed he arose and muttered a vessel is provided for my escape in the river and my companions advise me to use a slow match which will allow me to get out of harms way but i will see the deed done and if the train fails will hold a torch to the barrels myself at this juncture a slight tap was heard without guy fawkes instantly masked his lantern and cautiously opening the door beheld catesby i am come to tell you that parliament is prorogued said the latter the house does not meet till the fifth of november we have another month to wait i am sorry for it rejoined fawkes i have just laid the train the lucky moment will pass and locking the door he proceeded with catesby to the adjoining house they had scarcely been gone more than a second when two figures muffled in cloaks emerged from behind a wall the train is laid observed the foremost and they are gone to the house you might seize them now without danger that will not answer my purpose replied the other i will give them another month another month replied the first speaker who knows what may happen in that time they may abandon their project there is no fear of that replied the other but you had better go and join them chapter xi the marriage in the forest tresham for it will have been conjectured that he was one of the speakers mentioned in the preceding chapter on separating from lord mounteagle took the same direction as the conspirators he hesitated for some time before venturing to knock at the gardengate and when he had done so felt halfdisposed to take to his heels but shame restrained him and hearing footsteps approach he gave the customary signal and was instantly admitted by guy fawkes what brings you here demanded the latter as they entered the house and made fast the door behind them i have just heard that parliament is prorogued to the fifth of november replied tresham and came to tell you so i already know it returned fawkes gloomily and for the first time feel some misgiving as to the issue of our enterprise why so inquired tresham november is unlucky to me rejoined fawkes and i cannot recollect a year in my life in which some ill has not befallen me during that month especially on the fifth day on the last fifth of november i nearly died of a fever at madrid it is a strange and unfortunate coincidence that the meeting of the parliament should be appointed for that particular day shall i tell you what i think it portends hesitated tresham do so replied fawkes and speak boldly i am no child to be frightened at shadows you have more than once declared your intention of perishing with our foes rejoined tresham the design though prosperous in itself may be fatal to you you are right replied fawkes i have little doubt i shall perish on that day you are both aware of my superstitious nature and are not ignorant that many mysterious occurrences have combined to strengthen the feelingsuch as the dying words of the prophetess elizabeth ortonher warning speech when she was raised from the dead by doctor deeand lastly the vision at st winifreds well what if i tell you the saint has again appeared to me in a dream inquired catesby in a slightly sceptical tone ay in a dream returned fawkes but i saw her as plainly as if i had been awake it was the same vapoury figurethe same transparent robes the same benign countenance only far more pitying than beforethat i beheld at holywell i heard no sound issue from her lips but i felt that she warned me to desist do you accept the warning asked tresham eagerly it is needless to answer replied fawkes i have laid the train tonight you have infected me with your misgivings observed tresham would the enterprise had never been undertaken but being undertaken it must be gone through with rejoined catesby sternly harke tresham you promised us two thousand pounds in aid of the project but have constantly deferred payment of the sum on some plea or other because i have not been able to raise it replied tresham sullenly i have tried in vain to sell part of my estates at rushton in northamptonshire i cannot effect impossibilities tush cried catesby fiercely you well know i ask no impossibility i will no longer be trifled with the money must be forthcoming by the tenth of october or you shall pay the penalty with your life this is the language of a cutthroat mr catesby replied tresham it is the only language i will hold towards you rejoined catesby contemptuously look you disappoint me not or take the consequences i must leave for northamptonshire at once then said tresham do as you please returned catesby play the cutthroat yourself and ease some rich miser of his store if you think fit bring us the money and we will not ask how you came by it before we separate said tresham disregarding these sneers i wish to be resolved on one point who are to be saved from destruction why do you ask inquired fawkes because i must stipulate for the lives of my brothersinlaw the lords mounteagle and stourton if anything detains them from the meeting well and good replied catesby but no warning must be given them that would infallibly lead to a discovery of the plot some means might surely be adopted to put them on their guard without danger to ourselves urged tresham i know of none replied catesby nor i added fawkes if i did i would warn lord montague and some others whom i shall grieve to destroy we are all similarly circumstanced replied catesby keyes is anxious for the preservation of his patron and friend lord mordauntpercy for the earl of northumberland i myself would gladly save the young earl of arundel but we must sacrifice our private feeling for the general good we must acquiesced fawkes we shall not meet again till the night of the tenth of october said catesby when take care you are in readiness with the money upon this the conversation dropped and soon afterwards tresham departed when he found himself alone he suffered his rage to find vent in words perdition seize them he cried i shall now lose two thousand pounds in addition to what i have already advanced and as mounteagle will not have the disclosure made till the beginning of november there is no way of avoiding payment they would not fall into the snare i laid to throw the blame of the discovery when it takes place upon their own indiscretion but i must devise some other plan the warning shall proceed from an unknown quarter a letter written in a feigned hand and giving some obscure intimation of danger shall be delivered with an air of mystery to mounteagle this will serve as a plea for its divulgement to the earl of salisbury well well they shall have the money but they shall pay me back in other coin early on the following day catesby and fawkes proceeded to white webbs garnet was greatly surprised to see them and could not conceal his disappointment at the cause of their return this delay bodes no good he observed parliament has been so often prorogued that i begin to think some suspicion is entertained of our design make your mind easy then replied catesby i have made due inquiries and find the meeting is postponed to suit the kings convenience who wishes to prolong his stay at royston he may probably have some secret motive for the delay but i am sure it in no way concerns us everything being now fully arranged the conspirators had only to wait patiently for the arrival of the expected fifth of november most of them decided upon passing the interval in the country ambrose rookwood departed for clopton near stratforduponavona seat belonging to lord carew where his family were staying keyes went to visit lord mordaunt at turvey in bedfordshire and percy and the two wrights set out for gothurst in buckinghamshire to desire sir everard digby to postpone the grand huntingparty which he was to hold at dunsmore heath as an excuse for mustering a strong party of catholics to the beginning of november the two winters repaired to their family mansion huddington in worcestershire while fawkes and catesby together with the two priests remained at white webbs the three latter held daily conferences together but were seldom joined by fawkes who passed his time in the adjoining forest selecting its densest and most intricate parts for his rambles it was now the beginning of october and as is generally the case in the early part of this month the weather was fine and the air pure and bracing the forest could scarcely have been seen to greater advantage the leaves had assumed their gorgeous autumnal tints and the masses of timber variegated in colour presented an inexpressibly beautiful appearance guy fawkes spent hours in the depths of the wood his sole companions were the lordly stag and the timid hare that occasionally started across his path since his return he had sedulously avoided viviana and they had met only twice and then no speech had passed between them one day when he had plunged even deeper than usual into the forest and had seated himself on the stump of a decayed tree with his eyes fixed on a small clear rivulet welling at his feet he saw the reflection of a female figure in the water and filled with the idea of the vision of saint winifred at first imagined he was about to receive another warning but a voice that thrilled to his hearts core soon undeceived him and turning he beheld viviana she was habited in a ridingdress and appeared prepared to set out upon a journey so you have tracked me to my solitude he observed in a tone of forced coldness i thought i was secure from interruption here you will forgive me i am sure when you know my errand she replied it is to take an eternal farewell of you indeed he exclaimed are you about to quit white webbs i am she mournfully rejoined i am about to set out with father oldcorne for gothurst where i shall remain till all is over i entirely approve your determination returned fawkes after a short pause i knew you would do so or i should have consulted you upon it she rejoined and as you appear to avoid me i would fain have departed without taking leave of you but found it impossible to do so you well know my motive for avoiding you viviana rejoined fawkes we are no longer what we were to each other a fearful struggle has taken place within me though i have preserved an unmoved exterior between passion and the sense of my high calling i have told you i never loved before and fancied my heart immoveable as adamant but i now find out my error it is a prey to a raging and constant flame i have shunned you he continued with increased excitement because the sight of you shakes my firmnessbecause i feel it sinful to think of you in preference to holier objectsand because after i have quitted you your image alone engrosses my thoughts here in the depths of this wood by the side of this brook i can commune with my soulcan abstract myself from the world and the thoughts of the worldfrom youyes you who are all the world to me nowand prepare to meet my end then you are resolved to die she cried i shall abide the explosion and nothing but a miracle can save me returned fawkes and think not it will be exerted in your behalf she replied heaven does not approve your design and you will assuredly incur its vengeance by your criminal conduct viviana replied guy fawkes rising man cannot read my heart but heaven can and the sincerity of my purpose will be recognised above what i am about to do is for the regeneration of our holy religion and if the welfare of that religion is dear to the supreme being our cause must prosper if the contrary it deserves to fail and will fail i have ever told you that i care not what becomes of myself i am now more than ever indifferent to lifeor rather he added in a sombre tone i am anxious to die your dreadful wish i fear will be accomplished replied viviana sadly i have been constantly haunted by frightful apprehensions respecting you and my dead father has appeared to me in my dreams his spirit if such it were seemed to gaze upon me with a mournful look and as i thought pronounced your name in piteous accents these forebodings chime with my own muttered fawkes repressing a shudder but nothing shall shake me it will inflict a bitter pang upon me to part with you vivianathe bitterest i can ever feeland i shall be glad when it is over i echo your own wish she returned and deeply lament that we ever met but the fate that brought us together must for ever unite us what mean you he inquired gazing fixedly at her there is one sad consolation which you can afford me and which you owe me for the deep and lasting misery i shall endure on your account replied vivianaa consolation that will enable me to bear your loss with fortitude and to devote myself wholly to heaven whatever i can do that will not interfere with my purpose you may command he rejoined what i have to propose will not interfere with it she answered now hear me and put the sole construction i deserve on my conduct father garnet is at a short distance from us behind those trees waiting my summons i have informed him of my design and he approves of it it is to unite us in marriagesolemnly unite usthat though i may never live with you as a wife i may mourn you as a widow do you consent guy fawkes returned an affirmative in a voice broken by emotion the moment the ceremony is over pursued viviana i shall start with father oldcorne for gothurst we shall never meet again in this world unless i succeed said fawkes you will not succeed replied viviana if i thought so i should not take this step i look upon it as an espousal with the dead so saying she hurried away and disappearing beneath the covert returned in a few seconds with garnet i have a strange duty to perform for you my son said garnet to fawkes who remained motionless and stupified but i am right willing to perform it because i think it will lead to your future happiness with the fair creature who has bestowed her affections on you do not speculate on the future father cried viviana you know why i asked you to perform this ceremony you know also that i have made preparations for instant departure and that i indulge no hope of seeing guy fawkes again all this i know dear daughter returned garnet but in spite of your anticipations of ill i still hope that your union may prove auspicious i take you to witness father said viviana that in bestowing my hand upon guy fawkes i bestow at the same time all my possessions upon him he is free to use them as he thinks propereven in the furtherance of his design against the state which though i cannot approve it seems good to him this must not be cried fawkes it shall be rejoined viviana proceed with the ceremony father let her have her own way my son observed garnet in a low tone under any circumstances her estates must now be necessarily yours he then took a breviary from his vest and placing them near each other began to read aloud the marriageservice appointed by the romish church and there in that secluded spot and under such extraordinary circumstances with no other witnesses than the ancient trees around them and the brook rippling at their feet were guy fawkes and viviana united the ceremony over guy fawkes pressed his bride to his breast and imprinted a kiss upon her lips i have broken my faith to heaven to which i was first espoused he cried no she returned you will now return to your first and holiest choice think of me only as i shall think of youas of the dead with this the party slowly and silently returned to the house where they found a couple of steeds with luggage strapped to the saddles at the door father oldcorne was already mounted and in a few minutes viviana was by his side before her departure she bade guy fawkes a tender farewell and at this trying juncture her firmness nearly deserted her but rousing herself she sprang upon her horse and urging the animal into a quick pace and followed by oldcorne she speedily disappeared from view guy fawkes watched her out of sight and shunning the regards of catesby who formed one of the group struck into the forest and was not seen again till the following day the tenth of october having arrived guy fawkes and catesby repaired to the place of rendezvous but the night passed and tresham did not appear catesby was angry and disappointed and could not conceal his apprehensions of treachery fawkes took a different view of the matter and thought it not improbable that their confederates absence might be occasioned by the difficulty he found in complying with their demands and this opinion was confirmed the next morning by the arrival of a letter from tresham stating that he had been utterly unable to effect the sales he contemplated and could not therefore procure the money till the end of the month i will immediately go down to rushton said catesby and if i find him disposed to palter with us i will call him to instant account but garnet informs me that viviana has bestowed all her wealth upon you are you willing to devote it to the good cause no replied fawkes in a tone so decisive that his companion felt it would be useless to urge the matter further i give my life to the causethat must suffice the subject was never renewed at night catesby having procured a powerful steed set out upon his journey to northamptonshire while fawkes returned to white webbs about a fortnight passed unmarked by any event of importance despatches were received from catesby stating that he had received the money from tresham and had expended it in procuring horses and arms he also added that he had raised numerous recruits on various pretences this letter was dated from ashby st legers the seat of his mother lady catesby but he expressed his intention of proceeding to coughton hall near alcester in warwickshire the residence of mr thomas throckmorton a wealthy catholic gentleman whither sir everard digby had removed with his family to be in readiness for the grand huntingparty to be held on the fifth of november on dunsmore heath here he expected to be joined by the two wrights the winters rookwood keyes and the rest of the conspirators and undertook to bring them all up to white webbs on saturday the twentysixth of october by this time guy fawkes had in a great degree recovered his equanimity and left alone with garnet held long and frequent religious conferences with him it being evidently his desire to prepare himself for his expected fate he spent the greater part of the nights in solitary vigilsfasted even more rigorously than he was enjoined to doand prayed with such fervour and frequency that fearing an ill effect upon his health and almost upon his mind which had become exalted to the highest pitch of enthusiasm garnet thought it necessary to check him the priest did not fail to note that vivianas name never passed his lips and that in all their walks in the forest he carefully shunned the scene of his espousals and thus time flew by on the evening of the twentysixth of october in accordance with catesbys intimation the conspirators arrived they were all assembled at supper and were relating the different arrangements which had been made in anticipation of the important event when garnet observed with a look of sudden uneasiness to catesby you said in one of your letters that you would bring tresham with you my son why do i not see him he sent a message to coughton to state that having been attacked by a sudden illness he was unable to join us replied catesby but as soon as he could leave his bed he would hasten to london this may be a subterfuge but i shall speedily ascertain the truth for i have sent my servant bates to rushton to investigate the matter i ought to tell you he added that he has given substantial proof of his devotion to the cause by sending another thousand pounds to be expended in the purchase of arms and horses i hope it is not dust thrown into our eyes returned garnet i have always feared tresham would deceive us at the last this sudden illness looks suspicious i must own said catesby has aught been heard of lord mounteagle guy fawkes heard that he was at his residence at southwark yesterday returned garnet so far good replied catesby did you visit the cellar where the powder is deposited he added turning to fawkes i did replied the other and found all secure the powder is in excellent preservation before quitting the spot i placed certain private marks against the door by which i can tell whether it is opened during our absence a wise precaution returned catesby and now gentlemen he added filling a goblet with wine success to our enterprise everything is prepared he continued as the pledge was enthusiastically drunk i have got together a company of above two hundred men all well armed and appointed who will follow me wherever i choose to lead them they will be stationed near dunsmore heath on the fifth of next month and as soon as the event of the explosion is known i shall ride thither as fast as i can and hurrying with my troops to coventry seize the princess elizabeth percy and keyes will secure the person of the duke of york and proclaim him king while upon the rest will devolve the arduous duty of rousing our catholic brethren in london to rise to arms trust to us to rouse them shouted several voices let each man swear not to swerve from the fulfilment of his task cried catesby swear it upon this cup of wine in which we will all mix our blood and as he spoke he pricked his arm with the point of his sword and suffered a few drops of blood to fall into the goblet while the others roused to a state of frenzied enthusiasm imitated his example and afterwards raised the horrible mixture to their lips pronouncing at the same time the oath guy fawkes was the last to take the pledge and crying in a loud voice i swear not to quit my post till the explosion is over he drained the cup after this they adjourned to a room in another wing of the house fitted up as a chapel where mass was performed by garnet and the sacrament administered to the whole assemblage they were about to retire for the night when a sudden knocking was heard at the door reconnoitring the intruder through an upper window overlooking the court catesby perceived it was bates who was holding a smoking and mudbespattered steed by the bridle well what news do you bring cried catesby as he admitted him have you seen tresham no replied bates his illness was a mere pretence he has left rushton secretly for london i knew it cried garnet he has again betrayed us he shall die said catesby and the determination was echoed by all the other conspirators instead of retiring to rest they passed the night in anxious deliberation and it was at last proposed that guy fawkes should proceed without loss of time to southwark to keep watch near the house of lord mounteagle and if possible ascertain whether tresham had visited it to this he readily agreed but before setting out he took catesby aside for a moment and asked did you see viviana at coughton only for a moment and that just before i left the place was the answer she desired to be remembered to you and said you were never absent from her thoughts or prayers guy fawkes turned away to hide his emotion and mounting one of the horses brought by the conspirators rode off towards london chapter xii the fifth of november on the same day as the occurrences last related lord mounteagle who was then staying at southwark suddenly intimated his intention of passing the night at his country mansion at hoxton a change of place which trivial as it seemed at the moment afterwards assumed an importance from the circumstances that arose out of it at the latter part of the day he accordingly proceeded to hoxton accompanied by his customary attendants and all appeared to pass on as usual until just as supper was over one of his pages arrived from town and desired to see his lordship immediately affecting to treat the matter with indifference lord mounteagle carelessly ordered the youth to be ushered into his presence and when he appeared he demanded his business the page replied that he brought a letter for his lordship which had been delivered under circumstances of great mystery i had left the house just as it grew dusk he said on an errand of little importance when a man muffled in a cloak suddenly issued from behind a corner and demanded whether i was one of your lordships servants on my replying in the affirmative he produced this letter and enjoined me as i valued my life and your lordships safety to deliver it into your own hands without delay so saying he delivered the letter to his lord who gazing at its address which was to the right honourable the lord mounteagle observed there is nothing very formidable in its appearance what can it mean without even breaking the seal which was secured with a silken thread he gave it to one of his gentlemen named ward who was standing near him read it aloud sir said the earl with a slight smile i have no doubt it is some vapouring effusion which will afford us occasion for laughter before i hear what the writer has to say i can promise him he shall not intimidate me thus exhorted ward broken open the letter and read as follows my lord out of the love i bear to some of your friends i have a care of your preservation therefore i would advise you as you tender your life to devise some excuse to shift from your attendance at this parliament for god and man have concurred to punish the wickedness of this time think not slightingly of this advice but retire into the country where you may expect the event in safety for though there be no appearance of any stir yet i say they shall receive a terrible blow this parliament and yet they shall not know who hurts them this counsel is not to be contemned it may do you good and can do you no harm for the danger is passed as soon as you have burned the letter god i hope will give you grace to make good use of it to whose holy protection i commend you a singular letter exclaimed mounteagle as soon as ward had finished what is your opinion of it i think it hints at some dangerous plot my lord replied ward who had received his instructions some treason against the state with submission i would advise your lordship instantly to take it to the earl of salisbury i see nothing in it replied the earl what is your opinion mervyn he added turning to another of his gentlemen to whom he had likewise given his lesson i am of the same mind as ward replied the attendant your lordship will hardly hold yourself excused if you neglect to give due warning should aught occur hereafter say you so sirs cried lord mounteagle let me hear it once more the letter was accordingly read again by ward and the earl feigned to weigh over each passage i am advised not to attend the parliament he said for god and man have concurred to punish the wickedness of this time that is too vague to be regarded then i am urged to retire into the country the recommendation must proceed from some discontented catholic who does not wish me to be present at the opening of the house this is not the first time i have been so adjured they shall receive a terrible blow this parliament and yet shall not know who hurts them that is mysterious enough but it may mean nothingany more than what follows namely the danger is passed as soon as you have burnt the letter i do not think so my lord replied ward and though i cannot explain the riddle i am sure it means mischief well said lord mounteagle since you are of this mind i must lose no time in communicating the letter to the secretary of state it is better to err on the safe side accordingly after some further consultation he set out at that late hour for whitehall where he roused the earl of salisbury and showed him the letter it is almost needless to state that the whole was a preconcerted scheme between these two crafty statesmen but as the interview took place in the presence of their attendants the utmost caution was observed salisbury pretended to be greatly alarmed at the communication and coupling it he said with previous intelligence which he had received he could not help fearing to adopt the words of the writer of the mysterious letter that the parliament was indeed threatened with some terrible blow acting apparently upon this supposition he caused such of the lords of the privy council as lodged at whitehall to be summoned and submitting the letter to them they all concurred in the opinion that it referred to some dangerous plot though none could give a guess at its precise nature it is clearly some popish project said salisbury or lord mounteagle would not have been the party warned we must keep a lookout upon the disaffected of his faith as i have been the means of revealing the plot to your lordshipif plot it bei must pray you to deal gently with them rejoined mounteagle i will be as lenient as i can returned salisbury but in a matter of this kind little favour can be shown if your lordship will enable me to discover the principal actors in this affair i will take care that no innocent party suffers you ask an impossibility replied mounteagle i know nothing beyond what can be gathered from that letter but i pray your lordship not to make it a means of exercising unnecessary severity towards the members of my religion on that you may rely returned the earl his majesty will not return from the hunting expedition on which he is engaged at royston till thursday next the th i think it scarcely worth while considering his naturally timid nature with which your lordships are well acquainted to inform him of the threatened danger until his arrival at the palace it will then be time enough to take any needful steps as parliament will not meet for four or five days afterwards in the policy of this course the privy councillors agreed and it was arranged that the matter should be kept perfectly secret until the kings opinion had been taken upon the letter the assemblage then broke up it being previously arranged that for fear of some attempt upon his life lord mounteagle should remain within the palace till full inquiries had been instituted into the affair when the two confederate nobles were left alone salisbury observed with a slight laugh to his companion thus far we have proceeded well and without suspicion and rely upon it none shall fall on you as soon as all is over the most important post the king has to bestow shall be yours but what of tresham asked mounteagle he was the deliverer of this letter and i have little faith in him hum said salisbury after a moments reflection if you think it desirable we can remove him to the tower where he can be easily silenced it will be better so replied mounteagle he may else babble hereafter i gave him a thousand pounds to send in his own name to the conspirators the other day to lure them into our nets it shall be repaid you a hundredfold replied salisbury but we are observed and must therefore separate so saying he withdrew to his own chamber while lord mounteagle was ushered to the apartments allotted to him to return to guy fawkes arriving at southwark he stationed himself near lord mounteagles residence but he observed nothing to awaken his suspicions until early in the morning he perceived a page approaching the mansion whom from his livery he knew to be one of lord mounteagles household it was in fact the very youth who had delivered the mysterious letter and from him he ascertained all that had occurred filled with alarm and scarcely knowing what to do he crossed the river and proceeding to the cellar examined the marks at the door and finding all precisely as he had left it felt certain that whatever discovery had been made the magazine had not been visited he next repaired to the house of which he possessed the key and was satisfied that no one had been there somewhat relieved by this he yet determined to keep watch during the day and concealing himself near the cellar remained on the lookout till night but no one came nor did anything occur to excite his suspicions he would not however quit his post till about six oclock on the following evening when thinking further delay might be attended with danger he set out to white webbs to give his companions intelligence of the letter his news was received by all with the greatest alarm and not one except catesby who strove to put a bold face upon the matter though he was full of inward misgiving but confessed that he thought all chance of success was at an end while deliberating upon what should be done in this fearful emergency they were greatly alarmed by a sudden knocking without all the conspirators concealed themselves except guy fawkes who opening the door found to his infinite surprise that the summons proceeded from tresham he said nothing till the other had entered the house and then suddenly drawing his dagger held it to his throat make your shrift quickly traitor he cried in a furious tone for your last hour is arrived what ho he shouted to the others who instantly issued from their hidingplaces the fox has ventured into the lions den you distrust me wrongfully rejoined tresham with more confidence than he usually exhibited in time of danger i am come to warn you not betray you is this the return you make me for the service villain cried catesby rushing up to him and holding his drawn sword to his breast you have conveyed the letter to lord mounteagle it is false replied tresham i have only just heard of it and in spite of the risk i knew i should run from your suspicions i came to tell you what had happened why did you feign illness and depart secretly for town instead of joining us at coughton demanded catesby i will instantly explain my motive which though it may not be satisfactory to you on one point will be so on another replied tresham unhesitatingly and with apparent frankness i was fearful you would make a further tool of me and resolved not to join you again till a few days before the outbreak of the plot to this determination i should have adhered had i not learnt tonight that a letter had been transmitted by some one to lord mounteagle which he had conveyed to the earl of salisbury it may not convey any notion of the plot but it is certain to occasion alarm and i thought it my duty in spite of every personal consideration to give you warning if you design to escape there is yet time a vessel lies in the river in which we can all embark for flanders can he be innocent said catesby in a whisper to garnet if i had betrayed you continued tresham i should not have come hither and i have no motive for such baseness for i am in equal danger with yourselves but though the alarm has been given i do not think any discovery will be made they are evidently on the wrong scent i hope so replied catesby but i fear the contrary shall i put him to death demanded fawkes of garnet do not sully your hands with his blood my son returned garnet if he has betrayed us he will reap the traitors reward here and hereafter if he has not it would be to take away a life unjustly let him depart we shall feel more secure without him will it be safe to set him free father cried fawkes i think so replied garnet we will not admit him to our further conferences but let us act mercifully the major part of the conspirators concurring in this opinion though fawkes and catesby were opposed to it tresham was suffered to depart as soon as he was gone garnet avowed that the further prosecution of the design appeared so hazardous that it ought to be abandoned and that in his opinion each of the conspirators had better consult his own safety by flight he added that at some future period the design might be resumed or another planned which might be more securely carried out after much discussion all seemed disposed to acquiesce in the proposal except fawkes who adhered doggedly to his purpose and treated the danger so slightingly that he gradually brought the others round to his views at length it was resolved that garnet should set out immediately for coughton hall and place himself under the protection of sir everard digby and there await the result of the attempt while the other conspirators decided upon remaining in town in some secure places of concealment until the event was known unmoved as ever guy fawkes declared his intention of watching over the magazine of powder if anything happens to me he said you will take care of yourselves you well know nothing will be wrung from me catesby and the others aware of his resolute nature affected to remonstrate with him but they willingly suffered him to take his own course attended by bates garnet then set out for warwickshire and the rest of the conspirators proceeded to london where they dispersed after appointing lincolns inn walks as their place of midnight rendezvous each then made preparations for sudden flight in case it should be necessary and rookwood provided relays of horses all the way to dunchurch guy fawkes alone remained at his post he took up his abode in the cellar resolved to blow up himself together with his foes in case of a surprise on thursday the st of october the king returned to whitehall and the mysterious letter was laid before him in the presence of the privy council by the earl of salisbury james perused it carefully but could scarcely hide his perplexity your majesty will not fail to remark the expressions a terrible blow to the parliament and that the danger will be past as soon as you have burnt the letter evidently referring to combustion observed the earl you are right salisbury said james snatching at the suggestion i should not wonder if these mischievous papists mean to blow us all up with gunpowder your majesty has received a divine illumination returned the earl such an idea never occurred to me but it must be as you intimate undoubtedlyundoubtedly replied the monarch pleased with the compliment to his sagacity though alarmed by the danger but what desperate traitors they must be to imagine such a deed blow us up gods mercy that were a dreadful death and yet that must evidently be the meaning of the passage how else can it be construed except by reference to the suddenness of the act which might be as quickly performed as that paper would take to be consumed in the fire your majestys penetration has discovered the truth replied salisbury and by the help of your wisdom i will fully develop this dark design where think you the powder may lie hidden are there any vaults beneath the parliament house demanded james trembling heaven save us we have often walked thereperhaps over a secret mine there are replied salisbury and i am again indebted to your majesty for a most important suggestion not a corner in the vaults shall be left unsearched but perhaps you will think with me that in order to catch these traitors in their own trap it will be well to defer the search till the very night before the meeting of parliament i was about to recommend such a course myself salisbury replied james i was sure you would think so returned the earl and now i must entreat you to dismiss the subject from your thoughts and to sleep securely for you may rely upon it after your majestys discovery that the plot shall be fully unravelled the significant tone in which the earl uttered the latter part of this speech convinced the king that he knew more of the matter than he cared to confess and he contented himself with saying well let it be so i trust all to you but i at once divined their purposei at once divined it the council then broke up and james laughed and chuckled to himself at the discernment he had displayed nor was he less pleased with his minister for the credit given him in the affair but he took care not to enter the parliament house on the afternoon of monday the th of november the lord chamberlain accompanied by the lords salisbury and mounteagle visited the cellars and vaults beneath the parliament house for some time they discovered nothing to excite suspicion at length probably at the suggestion of lord mounteagle who as will be recollected was acquainted with the situation of the magazine they proceeded to the cellar where they found the store of powder but not meeting with any of the conspirators as they expected they disturbed nothing and went away reporting the result of their search to the king by the recommendation of the earl of salisbury james advised that a guard should be placed near the cellar during the whole of the night consisting of topcliffe and a certain number of attendants and headed by sir thomas knevet a magistrate of westminster upon whose courage and discretion full reliance could be placed lord mounteagle also requested permission to keep guard with them to witness the result of the affair to this the king assented and as soon as it grew dark the party secretly took up their position at a point commanding the entrance of the magazine fawkes who chanced to be absent at the time the search was made returned a few minutes afterwards and remained within the cellar seated upon a barrel of gunpowder the head of which he had staved in with a lantern in one hand and petronel in the other till past midnight the fifth of november was now at hand and the clock of the adjoining abbey had scarcely ceased tolling the hour that proclaimed its arrival when fawkes somewhat wearied with his solitary watching determined to repair for a short space to the adjoining house he accordingly quitted the cellar leaving his lantern lighted within it in one corner opening the door he gazed cautiously around but perceiving nothing after waiting a few seconds he proceeded to lock the door while thus employed he thought he heard a noise behind him and turning suddenly he beheld through the gloom several persons rushing towards him evidently with hostile intent his first impulse was to draw a petronel and grasp his sword but before he could effect his purpose his arms were pinioned by a powerful grasp from behind while the light of a lantern thrown full in his face revealed the barrel of a petronel levelled at his head and an authoritative voice commanded him in the kings name to surrender illustration guy fawkes arrested by sir thomas knevet and topcliffe chapter xiii the flight of the conspirators on the same night and at the same hour that guy fawkes was captured the other conspirators held their rendezvous in lincolns inn walks a presentiment of the fate awaiting them filled the breasts of all and even catesby shared in the general depression plan after plan was proposed and as soon as proposed rejected and they seemed influenced only by alarm and irresolution feeling at length that nothing could be done and that they were only increasing their risk by remaining together longer they agreed to separate appointing to meet at the same place on the following night if their project should not in the interim be discovered before daybreak said catesby i will proceed to the cellar under the parliament house and ascertain whether anything has happened to guy fawkes my heart misgives me about him and i reproach myself that i have allowed him to incur this peril alone guy fawkes is arrested said a voice near them and is at this moment under examination before the king it is tresham who speaks cried catesby secure him the injunction was instantly obeyed tresham was seized and several weapons pointed against his breast he did not however appear to be dismayed but so far as could be discerned in the obscurity seemed to maintain great boldness of demeanour i have again ventured among you at the hazard of my life he said in a firm tone to give you this most important intelligence and am requited as i have ever been of late with menaces and violence stab me and see whether my death will avail you in this extremity i am in equal danger with yourselves and whether i perish by your hands or by those of the executioner is of little moment let me question him before we avenge ourselves upon him said catesby to rookwood how do you know that guy fawkes is a prisoner i saw him taken replied tresham and esteem myself singularly fortunate that i escaped the same fate though excluded from further share in the project i could not divest myself of a strong desire to know how matters were going on and i resolved to visit the cellar secretly at midnight as i stealthily approached it i remarked several armed figures beneath a gateway and conjecturing their purpose instantly concealed myself behind a projection of the wall i had not been in this situation many minutes when the cellar door opened and guy fawkes issued from it well cried catesby breathlessly the party i had noticed immediately rushed forward and secured him before he could offer any resistance continued tresham after a brief struggle certain of their number dragged him into the cellar while others kept watch without i should now have flown but my limbs refused their office and i was therefore compelled however reluctantly to see the end of it in a short time guy fawkes was brought forth again and i heard some one in authority give directions that he should be instantly taken to whitehall to be interrogated before the king and the privy council he was then led away and a guard placed at the door of the cellar feeling certain i should be discovered i continued for some time in an agony of apprehension not daring to stir but at length summoning up sufficient resolution i crept cautiously along the side of the wall and got off unperceived my first object was to warn you how did you become acquainted with our place of rendezvous demanded the elder wright i overheard you at our last interview at white webbs appoint a midnight meeting in this place replied tresham and i hurried hither in the hope of finding you and have not been disappointed when i give the word plunge your swords into his breast said catesby in a low tone hold cried percy taking him aside if we put him to death in this spot his body will be found and his slaughter may awaken suspicions against us guy fawkes will reveal nothing of that i am well assured said catesby shall we take the traitor with us to some secure retreat where we can detain him till we learn what takes place at the palace and if we find he has betrayed us despatch him that would answer no good purpose returned percy the sooner we are rid of him the better we can then deliberate as to what is best to be done you are right rejoined catesby if he has betrayed us life will be a burthen to him and the greatest kindness we could render him would be to rid him of it let him go tresham he added in a loud voice you are free but we meet no more we have not parted yet cried the traitor springing backwards and uttering a loud cry i arrest you all in the kings name the signal was answered by a band of soldiers who emerged from behind the trees where they had hitherto been concealed and instantly surrounded the conspirators it is now my turn to threaten laughed tresham catesby replied by drawing a petronel and firing it in the supposed direction of the speaker but he missed his mark the ball lodged in the brain of a soldier who was standing beside him and the illfated wretch fell to the ground a desperate conflict now ensued topcliffe who commanded the assailing party ordered his followers to take the conspirators alive and it was mainly owing to this injunction that the latter were indebted for their safety whispering his directions to his companions catesby gave the word and making a simultaneous rush forward they broke through the opposing ranks and instantly dispersing and favoured by the gloom they baffled pursuit we have failed in this part of our scheme said tresham to topcliffe as they met half an hour afterwards what is to be done we must take the earl of salisburys advice upon it returned topcliffe i shall now hasten to whitehall to see how guy fawkess interrogation proceeds and will communicate with his lordship upon this they separated none of the conspirators met again that night each fled in a different direction and ignorant of what had happened to the rest sought some secure retreat catesby ran towards chancerylane and passing through a narrow alley entered the large gardens which then lay between this thoroughfare and fetterlane listening to hear whether he was pursued and finding nothing to alarm him he threw himself on the sod beneath a tree and was lost in painful reflection all my fair schemes are marred by that traitor tresham he muttered i could forgive myself for being duped by him if i had slain him when he was in my power but that he should escape to exult in our ruin and reap the reward of his perfidy afflicts me even more than failure tortured by thoughts like these and in vain endeavouring to snatch such brief repose as would fit him for the fatigue he might have to endure on the morrow he did not quit his position till late in the morning of a dull november dayit was as will be recollected the memorable fifthhad arrived he then arose and slouching his hat and wrapping his cloak around him shaped his course towards fleetstreet from the knots of persons gathered together at different cornersfrom their muttered discourse and mysterious looks as well as from the general excitement that prevailedhe felt sure that some rumour of the plot had gone abroad shunning observation as much as he could he entered a small tavern near fleet bridge and called for a flask of wine and some food while discussing these he was attracted by the discourse of the landlord who was conversing with his guests about the conspiracy i hear that all the papists are to be hanged drawn and quartered cried the host and if it be true as i have heard that this plot is their contrivance they deserve it i hope i have no believer in that faithno recusant in my house dont insult us by any such suspicion cried one of the guests we are all loyal menall good protestants do you know whether the conspirators have been discovered sir asked the host of catesby i do not even know of the plot replied the other what was its object what was its object cried the host you will scarcely credit me when i tell you i tremble to speak of it its object was to blow up the parliament house and the king and all the nobles and prelates of the land along with it horrible exclaimed the guests but how do you know it is a scheme of the papists asked catesby because i have been told so rejoined the host but who else could devise such a monstrous plan it would never enter into the head or heart of a protestant to conceive so detestable an action we love our king too well for that and would shed the last drop of our blood rather than a hair of his head should be injured but these priestridden papists think otherwise they regard him as a usurper and having received a dispensation from the pope to that effect fancy it would be a pious act to remove him there will be no tranquillity in the kingdom while one of them is left alive and i hope his majesty will take advantage of the present ferment to order a general massacre of them like that of the poor protestants on saint bartholomews day in paris aymassacre them cried the guests thats the way burn their houses and cut their throats will it be lawful to do so without further authority mine host if so we will set about it immediately i cannot resolve you on that point replied the landlord you had better wait a short time i dare say their slaughter will be publicly commanded heaven grant it may be so cried one of the guests i will bear my part in the business catesby arose paid his reckoning and strode out of the tavern do you know mine host said the guest who had last spoken i half suspect that tall fellow who has just left us is a papist perhaps a conspirator said another let us watch him cried a third stay cried the host he has paid me double my reckoning i believe him to be an honest man and a good protestant what you say confirms my suspicions rejoined the first speaker we will follow him on reaching temple bar catesby found the gates closed and a guard stationed at themno one being allowed to pass through without examination not willing to expose himself to this scrutiny catesby turned away and in doing so perceived three of the persons he had just left in the tavern the expression of their countenances satisfied him they were dogging him but affecting not to perceive it he retraced his steps gradually quickening his pace until he reached a narrow street leading into whitefriars down which he darted the moment his pursuers saw this they hurried after him shouting a papista papista conspirator but catesby was now safe claiming the protection of certain alsatians who were lounging at the door of a tavern and offering to reward them they instantly drew their swords and drove the others away while catesby tossing a few pieces of money to his preservers passed through a small doorway into the temple and making the best of his way to the stairs leaped into a boat and ordered the waterman to row to westminster the man obeyed and plying his oars soon gained the middle of the stream little way however had been made when catesby descried a large wherry manned by several rowers swiftly approaching them and instinctively comprehending whom it contained ordered the man to rest on his oars till it had passed in a few moments the wherry approached them it was filled with serjeants of the guard and halberdiers in the midst of whom sat guy fawkes catesby could not resist the impulse that prompted him to rise and the movement attracted the attention of the prisoner the momentary glance they exchanged convinced catesby that fawkes perceived him though his motionless features gave no token of recognition and he immediately afterwards fixed his eyes towards heaven as if to intimateat least catesby so construed the gesturethat his earthly career was wellnigh ended heaving a deep sigh catesby watched the wherry sweep on towards the towerits fatal destinationuntil it was lost to view all is over i fear with the bravest of our band he thought as he tracked its course but some effort must be made to save him at all events we will die sword in hand and like soldiers and not as common malefactors abandoning his intention of proceeding to westminster he desired the man to pull ashore and landing at arundel stairs hastened to the strand here he found large crowds collected the shops closed and business completely at a stand nothing was talked of but the conspiracy and the most exaggerated and extraordinary accounts of it were circulated and believed some would have it that the parliament house was already blown up and that the city of london itself had been set fire to in several places by the papists it was also stated that numerous arrests had taken place and it was certain that the houses of several catholic nobles and wealthy gentlemen had been searched to such a height was the popular indignation raised that it required the utmost efforts of the soldiery to prevent the mob from breaking into these houses and using violence towards their inmates every gate and avenue to the palace was strictly guarded and troops of horse were continually scouring the streets sentinels were placed before suspected houses and no one was suffered to enter them or to go forth without special permission detachments of soldiery were also stationed at the end of all the main thoroughfares bars were thrown across the smaller streets and outlets and proclamation was made that no one was to quit the city however urgent his business for three days on hearing this announcement catesby saw at once that if he did not effect his escape immediately it would be impracticable accordingly he hurried towards charingcross and turning up st martinslane at the back of the kings mews contrived to elude the vigilance of the guard and speeded along the lanefor it was then literally so and surrounded on either side by high hedgesuntil he came to st gilessat this time nothing more than a few scattered houses intermixed with trees here he encountered a man mounted on a powerful steed and seeing this person look hard at him would have drawn out of the way if the other had not addressed him by name he then regarded the equestrian more narrowly and found it was martin heydocke i have heard what has happened mr catesby said martin and can imagine the desperate strait in which you must be placed take my horseit may aid your flight i was sent to london by my master mr humphrey chetham to bring him intelligence of the result of your attempt and i am sure i am acting in accordance with his wishes in rendering you such a service at all events i will risk it mount sirmount and make the best of your way hence catesby needed no further exhortation but springing into the saddle hastily murmured his thanks and striking into a lane on the right rode off at a swift pace towards highgate on reaching the brow of this beautiful hill he drew in the bridle for a moment and gazed towards the city he had just quitted dark and bitter were his thoughts as he fixed his eye upon westminster abbey and fancied he could discern the neighbouring pile whose destruction he had meditated remembering that from this very spot when he had last approached the capital in company with guy fawkes and viviana radcliffe he had looked in the same direction he could not help contrasting his present sensations with those he had then experienced at that time he was full of ardour and confident of success now all was lost to him and he was anxious for little more than selfpreservation involuntarily his eye wandered along the great city until passing over the mighty fabric of saint pauls it settled upon the towerupon the place of guy fawkess captivity and can nothing be done for his deliverance sighed catesby as he turned away his eyes filling with moisture must that brave soldier die the death of a felonmust he be subjected to the torturehorror if he had died defending himself i should scarcely have pitied him and if he had destroyed himself together with his foes as he resolved to do i should have envied him but the idea of what he will have to suffer in that dreadful placenay what he is now perhaps sufferingmakes the lifeblood curdle in my veins i will never fall alive into their hands with this resolve he struck spurs into his steed and urging him to a swift pace dashed rapidly forward he had ridden more than a mile when hearing shouts behind him he perceived two troopers galloping after him as fast as their horses could carry them they shouted to him to stay and as they were better mounted than he was it was evident they would soon come up with him determined however to adhere to the resolution he had just formed and not to yield himself with life he prepared for a conflict and suddenly halting he concealed a petronel beneath his cloak and waited till his foes drew near i command you in the kings name to surrender said the foremost trooper riding up you are a rebel and a traitor be this my answer replied catesby aiming at the man and firing with such certainty that he fell from his horse mortally wounded unsheathing his sword he then prepared to attack the other trooper but terrified at the fate of his comrade the man turned his horses head and rode off without bestowing a thought on the dying man who lay groaning in the mire catesby caught hold of the bridle of his horse and satisfied that the animal was better than his own mounted him and proceeded at the same headlong pace as before in a short time he reached finchley where several persons rushed from their dwellings to inquire whether he brought any intelligence of the plot rumours of which had already reached them without stopping catesby replied that most important discoveries had been made and that he was carrying despatches from the king to northampton no opposition was therefore offered him and he soon left all traces of habitation behind him urging his horse to its utmost he arrived in less than a quarter of an hour at chipping barnet here the same inquiries were made as at finchley and returning the same answerfor he never relaxed his speed for a momenthe pursued his course in less than three quarters of an hour after this he arrived at saint albans and proceeding direct to the posthouse asked for a horse but instead of complying with the request the landlord of the rose and crownsuch was the name of the hostelinstantly withdrew and returned the next moment with an officer who desired to speak with catesby before he proceeded further the latter however took no notice of the demand but rode off the clatter of horses hoofs behind him soon convinced him he was again pursued and he was just beginning to consider in what way he should make a second defence when he observed two horsemen cross a lane on the left and make for the main road his situation now appeared highly perilous especially as his pursuers who had noticed the other horsemen at the same time as himself shouted to them but he was speedily relieved these persons instead of stopping accelerated their pace and appeared as anxious as he was to avoid those behind him they were now within a short distance of dunstable and were ascending the lovely downs which lie on the london side of this ancient town when one of the horsemen in front chancing to turn round catesby perceived it was rookwood overjoyed at the discovery he shouted to him at the top of his voice and the other who it presently appeared was accompanied by keyes instantly stopped in a few seconds catesby was by their side and a rapid explanation taking place they all three drew up in order of battle by this time their pursuers had arrived within a hundred yards of them and seeing how matters stood and not willing to hazard an engagement after a brief consultation retired the three friends then pursued their route passed through dunstable and without pausing a moment on the road soon neared fenny stratford just before they arrived at this place catesbys horse fell from exhaustion instantly extricating himself from the fallen animal he ran by the side of his companions till they got to the town where rookwood who had placed relays on the road changed his horse and the others were fortunate enough to procure fresh steeds proceeding with unabated impetuosity they soon cleared a few more miles and had just left stony stratford behind them when they overtook a solitary horseman who proved to be john wright and a little further on they came up with percy and christopher wright though their numbers were thus increased they did not consider themselves secure but flinging their cloaks away to enable them to proceed with greater expedition hurried on to towcester here keyes quitted his companions and shaped his course into warwickshire where he was afterwards taken while the others having procured fresh horses made the best of their way to ashby saint legers about six oclock catesby and his companions arrived at his old family seat which he had expected to approach in triumph but which he now approached with feelings of the deepest mortification and disappointment they found the house filled with guestsamong whom was robert winterwho were just sitting down to supper catesby rushed into the room in which these persons were assembled covered with mud and dirt his haggard looks and dejected appearance proclaiming that his project had failed his friends followed and their appearance confirmed the impression that he had produced lady catesby hastened to her son and strove to comfort him but he rudely repulsed her what is the matter she anxiously inquired what is the matter cried catesby in a furious tone and stamping his foot to the ground all is lost our scheme is discovered guy fawkes is a prisoner and ere long we shall all be led to the block yes all he repeated gazing sternly around i will never be led thither with life said robert winter nor i added a young catholic gentleman named acton of ribbesford who had lately joined the conspiracy though the great design has failed we are yet free and have swords to draw and arms to wield them ay exclaimed robert winter all our friends are assembled at dunchurch let us join them instantly and we may yet stir up a rebellion which may accomplish all we can desire i myself accompanied humphrey littleton to dunchurch this morning and know we shall find everything in readiness do not despair cried lady catesby all will yet be well every member of our faith will join you and you will soon muster a formidable army we must not yield without a blow cried percy pouring out a bumper of wine and swallowing it at a draught you are right said rookwood imitating his example we will sell our lives dearly if you will adhere to this resolution gentlemen rejoined catesby we may yet retrieve our loss with five hundred stanch followers who will stand by me to the last i will engage to raise such a rebellion in england as shall not be checked except by the acknowledgment of our rights or the dethronement of the king we will all stand by you cried the others swear it cried catesby raising the glass to his lips we do was the reply wearied as we are cried catesby we must at once proceed to dunchurch and urge our friends to rise in arms with us agreed cried the others summoning all his household and arming them catesby then set out with the rest for dunchurch which lay about five miles from ashby saint legers they arrived there in about three quarters of an hour and found the mansion crowded with catholic gentlemen and their servants entering the banquet hall they found sir everard digby at the head of the board with garnet on his right hand upwards of sixty persons were seated at the table their arrival was greeted with loud shouts and several of the guests drew their swords and flourished them over their heads what news cried sir everard digby is the blow struck no replied catesby we have been betrayed a deep silence prevailed a change came over the countenances of the guests significant glances were exchanged and it was evident that general uneasiness prevailed what is to be done cried sir everard digby after a pause our course is clear returned catesby we must stand by each other in that case we have nothing to fear and shall accomplish our purpose though not in the way originally intended i will have nothing further to do with the matter said sir robert digby of coleshill sir everards uncle and rising he quitted the room with several of his followers while his example was imitated by humphrey littleton and others all chance for the restoration of our faith in england is over observed garnet in a tone of despondency not so father replied catesby if we are true to each other my friends he cried stopping those who were about to depart in the name of our holy religion i beseech you to pause much is against us now but let us hold together and all will speedily be righted every catholic in this county in cheshire in lancashire and wales must flock to our standard when it is once displayeddo not desert usdo not desert yourselvesfor our cause is your cause i have a large force at my command so has sir everard digby and together we can muster nearly five hundred adherents with these we can offer such a stand as will enable as to make conditions with our opponents or even to engage with them with a reasonable prospect of success i am well assured moreover if we lose no time but proceed to the houses of our friends we shall have a large army with us do not fall off then on you depends our success this address was followed by loud acclamations and all who heard it agreed to stand by the cause in which they had embarked to the last as catesby left the banquetinghall with sir everard to make preparations for their departure they met viviana and a female attendant i hear the enterprise has failed she cried in a voice suffocated by emotion what has happened to my husband is he safe is he with you alas no replied catesby he is a prisoner viviana uttered a cry of anguish and fell senseless into the arms of the attendant chapter xiv the examination disarmed by sir thomas knevet and his followers who found upon his person a packet of slow matches and touchwood and bound hand and foot guy fawkes was dragged into the cellar by his captors who instantly commenced their search in a corner behind the door they discovered a dark lantern with a light burning within it and moving with the utmost cautionfor they were afraid of bringing sudden destruction upon themselvesthey soon perceived the barrels of gunpowder ranged against the wall carefully removing the planks billets and iron bars with which they were covered they remarked that two of the casks were staved in while the hoops from a third were taken off and the powder scattered around it they also noticed that several trains were laid along the flooreverything in short betokening that the preparations for the desperate deed were fully completed while they were making this investigation guy fawkes who seeing that further resistance was useless had remained perfectly motionless up to this moment suddenly made a struggle to free himself and so desperate was the effort that he burst the leathern thong that bound his hands and seizing the soldier nearest to him bore him to the ground he then grasped the lower limbs of another who held a lantern and strove to overthrow him and wrest the lantern from his grasp evidently intending to apply the light to the powder and he would unquestionably have executed his terrible design if three of the most powerful of the soldiers had not thrown themselves upon him and overpowered him all this was the work of a moment but it was so startling that sir thomas knevet and topcliffe though both courageous men and used to scenes of dangerespecially the latterrushed towards the door expecting some dreadful catastrophe would take place do him no harm cried knevet as he returned to the soldiers who were still struggling with fawkesdo him no harm it is not here he must die a moment more and i had blown you all to perdition cried fawkes but heaven ordained it otherwise heaven will never assist such damnable designs as yours rejoined knevet thrust him into that corner he added to his men who instantly obeyed his injunctions and held down the prisoner so firmly that he could not move a limb keep him there i will question him presently you may question me replied fawkes sternly but you will obtain no answer we shall see returned knevet pursuing the search with topcliffe he counted thirtysix hogsheads and casks of various sizes all of which were afterwards found to be filled with powder though prepared for this discovery knevet could not repress his horror at it and gave vent to execrations against the prisoner to which the other replied by a disdainful laugh they then looked about in the hope of finding some document or fragment of a letter which might serve as a clue to the other parties connected with the fell design but without success nothing was found except a pile of arms but though they examined them no name or cipher could be traced on any of the weapons we will now examine the prisoner more narrowly said knevet this was accordingly done on removing guy fawkess doublet a horsehair shirt appeared and underneath it next his heart suspended by a silken cord from his neck was a small silver cross when this was taken from him guy fawkes could not repress a deep sigh there is some secret attached to that cross whispered topcliffe plucking knevets sleeve upon this the other held it to the light while topcliffe kept his eye fixed upon the prisoner and observed that in spite of all his efforts to preserve an unmoved demeanour he was slightly agitated do you perceive anything he asked yes replied knevet there is a name but the character is so small i cannot decipher it let me look at it said topcliffe this is most important he added after gazing at it for a moment the words inscribed on it are viviana radcliffe ordsall hall you may remember that this young lady was examined a short time ago on suspicion of being connected with some popish plot against the state and committed to the tower whence she escaped in a very extraordinary manner this cross found upon the prisoner proves her connexion with the present plot every effort must be used to discover her retreat another deep sigh involuntarily broke from the breast of guy fawkes you hear how deeply interested he is in the matter observed topcliffe in a low tone this trinket will be of infinite service to us in future examinations and may do more for us with this stubborn subject even than the rack itself you are right returned knevet i will now convey him to whitehall and acquaint the earl of salisbury with his capture do so replied topcliffe i have a further duty to perform before morning i hope to net the whole of this wolfish pack indeed exclaimed knevet have you any knowledge of the others topcliffe smiled significantly time will show he said but if you do not require me further i will leave you with this he quitted the cellar and joined the earl of mounteagle and tresham who were waiting for him outside at a little distance from the cellar after a brief conference it was arranged in compliance with the earl of salisburys wishes that if they failed in entrapping the conspirators nothing should be said about the matter he then departed with tresham their subsequent proceedings have already been related by sir thomas knevets directions guy fawkes was now raised by two of the soldiers and led out of the cellar as he passed through the door he uttered a deep groan you groan for what you have done villain said one of the soldiers on the contrary rejoined fawkes sternly i groan for what i have not done he was then hurried along by his conductors and conveyed through the great western gate into the palace of whitehall where he was placed in a small room the windows of which were strongly grated before quitting him sir thomas knevet put several questions to him but he maintained a stern and obstinate silence committing him to the custody of an officer of the guard whom he enjoined to keep strict guard over him as he valued his life knevet then went in search of the earl of salisbury the secretary who had not retired to rest and was anxiously awaiting his arrival was delighted with the success of the scheme they were presently joined by lord mounteagle and after a brief conference it was resolved to summon the privy council immediately to rouse the king and acquaint him with what had occurred and to interrogate the prisoner in his presence nothing will be obtained from him i fear said knevet he is one of the most resolute and determined fellows i ever encountered and he then related the desperate attempt made by fawkes in the vault to blow them all up whether he will speak or not the king must see him said salisbury as soon as knevet was gone the earl observed to mounteagle you had now better leave the palace you must not appear further in this matter except as we have arranged before morning i trust we shall have the whole of the conspirators in our power with damning proofs of their guilt by this time my lord they are in treshams hands replied mounteagle if he fails not a word must be said observed salisbury it must not be supposed we have moved in the matter all great statesmen have contrived treasons that they might afterwards discover them and though i have not contrived this plot i have known of its existence from the first and could at any time have crushed it had i been so minded but that would not have answered my purpose and i shall now use it as a pretext to crush the whole catholic party except those on whom like yourself i can confidently rely your lordship must admit that i have well seconded your efforts observed mounteagle i do so replied salisbury and you will not find me ungrateful farewell i hope soon to hear of our further success mounteagle then took his departure and salisbury immediately caused all such members of the privy council as lodged in the palace to be aroused desiring they might be informed that a terrible plot had been discovered and a conspirator arrested in a short time the duke of lennox the earl of marr lord hume the earl of southampton lord henry howard lord mountjoy sir george hume and others were assembled and all eagerly inquired into the occasion of the sudden alarm meanwhile the earl of salisbury had himself repaired to the kings bedchamber and acquainted him with what had happened james immediately roused himself and desired the chamberlain who accompanied the earl to quit the presence will it be safe to interrogate the prisoner here he asked i will take care your majesty shall receive no injury replied salisbury and it is absolutely necessary you should examine him before he is committed to the tower let him be brought before me then directly said the king i am impatient to behold a wretch who has conceived so atrociousso infernal a design against me and against my children hark e salisbury one caution i wish to observe let a captain of the guard with his drawn sword in hand place himself between me and the prisoner and let two halberdiers stand beside him and if the villain moves a step bid them strike him dead you understand illustration guy fawkes interrogated by king james the first perfectly replied salisbury bowing in that case you may take off his bondsthat is if you think it prudent to do sonot otherwise continued james i would not have the knave suppose he can awe me your majestys commands shall be fulfilled to the letter returned the earl lose no time salisbury cried james springing out of bed and beginning to dress himself without the assistance of his chamberlain the earl hastily retired and ordered the attendants to repair to their royal master he next proceeded to the chamber where guy fawkes was detained and ordered him to be unbound and brought before the king when the prisoner heard this mandate a slight smile crossed his countenance but he instantly resumed his former stern composure the smile however did not escape the notice of salisbury and he commanded the halberdiers to keep near to the prisoner and if he made the slightest movement in the kings presence instantly to despatch him giving some further directions the earl then led the way across a court and entering another wing of the palace ascended a flight of steps and traversed a magnificent corridor guy fawkes followed attended by the guard they had now reached the antechamber leading to the royal sleeping apartment and salisbury ascertained from the officers in attendance that all was in readiness motioning the guard to remain where they were he entered the inner room alone and found james seated on a chair of state near the bed surrounded by his councilthe earl of marr standing on his right hand and the duke of lennox on his left all anxiously awaiting his arrival behind the king were stationed half a dozen halberdiers the prisoner is without said salisbury is it your majestys pleasure that he be admitted ay let him come in forthwith replied james stand by me my lords and do you varlets keep a wary eye upon him there is no saying what he may attempt salisbury then waved his hand the door was thrown open and an officer entered the room followed by guy fawkes who marched between two halberdiers when within a couple of yards of the king the officer halted and withdrew a little on the right so as to allow full view of the prisoner while he extended his sword between him and the king nothing could be more undaunted than the looks and demeanour of fawkes he strode firmly into the room and without making any reverence folded his arms upon his breast and looked sternly at james a bold villain cried the king as he regarded him with curiosity not unmixed with alarm who and what are you traitor a conspirator replied fawkes that i know rejoined james sharply but how are you called john johnson answered fawkes i am servant to mr thomas percy that is false cried salisbury take heed that you speak the truth traitor or the rack shall force it from you the rack will force nothing from me replied fawkes sternly neither will i answer any question asked by your lordship leave him to me salisburyleave him to me interposed james and it was your hellish design to blow us all up with gunpowder he demanded it was replied fawkes and how could you resolve to destroy so many persons none of whom have injured you pursued james dangerous diseases require desperate remedies replied fawkes milder means have been tried but without effect it was gods pleasure that this scheme which was for the benefit of his holy religion should not prosper and therefore i do not repine at the result and are you so blinded as to suppose that heaven can approve the actions of him who raises his hand against the kingagainst the lords anointed cried james he is no king who is excommunicated by the apostolic see replied fawkes this to our face cried james angrily have you no remorseno compunction for what you have done my sole regret is that i have failed replied fawkes you will not speak thus confidently on the rack said james try me replied fawkes what purpose did you hope to accomplish by this atrocious design demanded the earl of marr my main purpose was to blow back the beggarly scots to their native mountains returned fawkes this audacity surpasses belief said james mutius scaevola when in the presence of porsenna was not more resolute hark e villain if i give you your life will you disclose the names of your associates no replied fawkes they shall be wrung from you cried salisbury fawkes smiled contemptuously you know me not he said it is idle to interrogate him further said james let him be removed to the tower be it so returned salisbury and when next your majesty questions him i trust it will be in the presence of his confederates despite the villains horrible intent i cannot help admiring his courage observed james in a low tone and were he as loyal as he is brave he should always be near our person with this he waved his hand and guy fawkes was led forth he was detained by the earl of salisburys orders till the morningit being anticipated that before that time the other conspirators would be arrested but as this was not the case he was placed in a wherry and conveyed as before related to the tower end of the second book book the third the conspirators the conclusion shall be from the admirable clemency and moderation of the king in that howsoever these traitors have exceeded all others in mischief yet neither will the king exceed the usual punishment of law nor invent any new torture or torment for them but is graciously pleased to afford them as well an ordinary course of trial as an ordinary punishment much inferior to their offence and surely worthy of observation is the punishment by law provided and appointed for high treason for first after a traitor hath had his just trial and is convicted and attainted he shall have his judgment to be drawn to the place of execution from his prison as being not worthy any more to tread upon the face of the earth whereof he was made also for that he hath been retrograde to nature therefore is he drawn backward at a horsetail after to have his head cut off which had imagined the mischief and lastly his body to be quartered and the quarters set up in some high and eminent place to the view and detestation of men and to become a prey for the fowls of the air and this is a reward due to traitors whose hearts be hardened for that it is a physic of state and government to let out corrupt blood from the heartsir edward cokes speech on the gunpowder treason chapter i how guy fawkes was put to the torture intimation of the arrest of guy fawkes having been sent to the tower his arrival was anxiously expected by the warders and soldiers composing the garrison a crowd of whom posted themselves at the entrance of traitors gate to obtain a sight of him as the bark that conveyed the prisoner shot through london bridge and neared the fortress notice of its approach was given to the lieutenant who scarcely less impatient had stationed himself in a small circular chamber in one of the turrets of saint thomass or traitors tower overlooking the river he hastily descended and had scarcely reached the place of disembarkation when the boat passed beneath the gloomy archway the immense wooden wicket closed behind it and the officer in command springing ashore was followed more deliberately by fawkes who mounted the slippery stairs with a firm footstep as he gained the summit the spectators pressed forward but sir william waad ordering them in an authoritative tone to stand back fixed a stern and scrutinizing glance on the prisoner many vile traitors have ascended those steps he said but none so falsehearted none so bloodthirsty as you none ever ascended them with less misgiving or with less selfreproach replied fawkes miserable wretch do you glory in your villany cried the lieutenant if anything could heighten my detestation of the pernicious creed you profess it would be to witness its effects on such minds as yours what a religion must that be which can induce its followers to commit such monstrous actions and delude them into the belief that they are pious and praiseworthy it is a religion at least that supports them at seasons when they most require it rejoined fawkes peace cried the lieutenant fiercely or i will have your viperous tongue torn out by the roots turning to the officer he demanded his warrant and glancing at it gave some directions to one of the warders and then resumed his scrutiny of fawkes who appeared wholly unmoved and steadily returned his gaze meanwhile several of the spectators eager to prove their loyalty to the king and abhorrence of the plot loaded the prisoner with execrations and finding these produced no effect proceeded to personal outrage some spat upon his face and garments some threw mud gathered from the slimy steps upon him some pricked him with the points of their halberds while others if they had not been checked would have resorted to greater violence only one bystander expressed the slightest commiseration for him it was ruth ipgreve who with her parents formed part of the assemblage a few kindly words pronounced by this girl moved the prisoner more than all the insults he had just experienced he said nothing but a slight and almost imperceptible quivering of the lip told what was passing within the jailer was extremely indignant at his daughters conduct fearing it might prejudice him in the eyes of the lieutenant get hence girl he cried and stir not from thy room for the rest of the day i am sorry i allowed thee to come forth you must look to her jasper ipgreve said sir william waad sternly no man shall hold an office in the tower who is a favourer of papacy if you were a good protestant and a faithful servant of king james your daughter could never have acted thus unbecomingly look to her i sayand to yourself i will honourable sir replied jasper in great confusion take her home directly he added in an under tone to his wife lock her up till i return and scourge her if thou wilt she will ruin us by her indiscretion in obedience to this injunction dame ipgreve seized her daughters hand and dragged her away ruth turned for a moment to take a last look at the prisoner and saw that his gaze followed her and was fraught with an expression of the deepest gratitude by way of showing his disapproval of his daughters conduct the jailer now joined the bitterest of guy fawkess assailants and ere long the assemblage became infuriated to such an ungovernable pitch that the lieutenant who had allowed matters to proceed thus far in the hope of shaking the prisoners constancy finding his design fruitless ordered him to be taken away escorted by a dozen soldiers with calivers on their shoulders guy fawkes was led through the archway of the bloody tower and across the green to the beauchamp tower he was placed in the spacious chamber on the first floor of that fortification now used as a messroom by the guards sir william waad followed him and seating himself at a table referred to the warrant you are here called john johnson is that your name he demanded if you find it thus written you need make no further inquiry from me replied fawkes i am the person so described that is sufficient for you not so replied the lieutenant and if you persist in this stubborn demeanour the severest measures will be adopted towards you your sole chance of avoiding the torture is in making a full confession i do not desire to avoid the torture replied fawkes it will wrest nothing from me so all think till they have experienced it replied the lieutenant but greater fortitude than yours has given way before our engines fawkes smiled disdainfully but made no answer the lieutenant then gave directions that he should be placed within a small cell adjoining the larger chamber and that two of the guard should remain constantly beside him to prevent him from doing himself any violence you need have no fear observed fawkes i shall not destroy my chance of martyrdom at this juncture a messenger arrived bearing a despatch from the earl of salisbury the lieutenant broke the seal and after hurriedly perusing it drew his sword and desiring the guard to station themselves outside the door approached fawkes notwithstanding the enormity of your offence he observed i find his majesty will graciously spare your life provided you will reveal the names of all your associates and disclose every particular connected with the plot guy fawkes appeared lost in reflection and the lieutenant conceiving he had made an impression upon him repeated the offer how am i to be assured of this asked the prisoner my promise must suffice rejoined waad it will not suffice to me returned fawkes i must have a pardon signed by the king you shall have it on one condition replied waad you are evidently troubled with few scruples it is the earl of salisburys conviction that the heads of many important catholic families are connected with this plot if they should prove to be soor to be plain if you will accuse certain persons whom i will specify you shall have the pardon you require is this the purport of the earl of salisburys despatch asked guy fawkes the lieutenant nodded let me look at it continued fawkes you may be practising upon me your own perfidious nature makes you suspicious of treachery in others cried the lieutenant will this satisfy you and he held the letter towards guy fawkes who instantly snatched it from his grasp what ho he shouted in a loud voice what ho and the guards instantly rushed into the room you shall learn why you were sent away sir william waad has offered me my life on the part of the earl of salisbury provided i will accuse certain innocent partiesinnocent except that they are catholicsof being leagued with me in my design read this letter and see whether i speak not the truth and he threw it among them but no one stirred except a warder who picking it up delivered it to the lieutenant you will now understand whom you have to deal with pursued fawkes i do replied waad but were you as unyielding as the walls of this prison i would shake your obduracy i pray you not to delay the experiment said fawkes have a little patience retorted waad i will not balk your humour depend upon it with this he departed and repairing to his lodgings wrote a hasty despatch to the earl detailing all that had passed and requesting a warrant for the torture as he was apprehensive if the prisoner expired under the severe application that would be necessary to force the truth from him he might be called to account two hours afterwards the messenger returned with the warrant it was in the handwriting of the king and contained a list of interrogations to be put to the prisoner concluding by directing him to use the gentler torture first et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur and so god speed you in your good work thus armed and fearless of the consequences the lieutenant summoned jasper ipgreve we have a very refractory prisoner to deal with he said as the jailer appeared but i have just received the royal authority to put him through all the degrees of torture if he continues obstinate how shall we begin with the scavengers daughter and the little ease if it please you honourable sir replied ipgreve if these fail we can try the gauntlets and the rack and lastly the dungeon among the rats and the hot stone a good progression said the lieutenant smiling i will now repair to the torturechamber let the prisoner be brought there without delay he is in the beauchamp tower ipgreve bowed and departed while the lieutenant calling to an attendant to bring a torch proceeded along a narrow passage communicating with the bell tower opening a secret door within it he descended a flight of stone steps and traversing a number of intricate passages at length stopped before a strong door which he pushed aside and entered the chamber he had mentioned to ipgreve this dismal apartment has already been described it was that in which vivianas constancy was so fearfully approved two officials in the peculiar garb of the placea sable liverywere occupied in polishing the various steel implements besides these there was the chirurgeon who was seated at a side table reading by the light of a brazen lamp he instantly arose on seeing the lieutenant and began with the other officials to make preparations for the prisoners arrival the two latter concealed their features by drawing a large black capoch or hood attached to their gowns over them and this disguise added materially to their lugubrious appearance one of them then took down a broad iron hoop opening in the centre with a hinge and held it in readiness their preparations were scarcely completed when heavy footsteps announced the approach of fawkes and his attendants jasper ipgreve ushered them into the chamber and fastened the door behind them all the subsequent proceedings were conducted with the utmost deliberation and were therefore doubly impressive no undue haste occurred and the officials who might have been mistaken for phantoms or evil spirits spoke only in whispers guy fawkes watched their movements with unaltered composure at length jasper ipgreve signified to the lieutenant that all was ready the opportunity you desired of having your courage put to the test is now arrived said the latter to the prisoner what am i to do was the reply remove your doublet and prostrate yourself subjoined ipgreve guy fawkes obeyed and when in this posture began audibly to recite a prayer to the virgin be silent cried the lieutenant or a gag shall be thrust into your mouth kneeling upon the prisoners shoulders and passing the hoop under his legs ipgreve then succeeded with the help of his assistants who added their weight to his own in fastening the hoop with an iron button this done they left the prisoner with his limbs and body so tightly compressed together that he was scarcely able to breathe in this state he was allowed to remain for an hour and a half the chirurgeon then found on examination that the blood had burst profusely from his mouth and nostrils and in a slighter degree from the extremities of his hands and feet he must be released he observed in an under tone to the lieutenant further continuance might be fatal accordingly the hoop was removed and it was at this moment that the prisoner underwent the severest trial despite his efforts to control himself a sharp convulsion passed across his frame and the restoration of impeded circulation and respiration occasioned him the most acute agony the chirurgeon bathed his temples with vinegar and his limbs being chafed by the officials he was placed on a bench my warrant directs me to begin with the gentler tortures and to proceed by degrees to extremities observed the lieutenant significantly you have now had a taste of the milder sort and may form some conjecture what the worst are like do you still continue contumacious i am in the same mind as before replied fawkes in a hoarse but firm voice take him to the little ease and let him pass the night there said the lieutenant tomorrow i will continue the investigation fawkes was then led out by ipgreve and the officials and conveyed along a narrow passage until arriving at a low door in which there was an iron grating it was opened and disclosed a narrow cell about four feet high one and a few inches wide and two deep into this narrow receptacle which seemed wholly inadequate to contain a tall and stronglybuilt man like himself the prisoner was with some difficulty thrust and the door locked upon him in this miserable plight with his head bent upon his breastthe cell being so contrived that its wretched inmate could neither sit nor recline at full length within itguy fawkes prayed long and fervently and no longer troubled by the uneasy feelings which had for some time haunted him he felt happier in his present forlorn condition than he had been when anticipating the full success of his project at least he thought i shall now win myself a crown of martyrdom and whatever my present sufferings may be they will be speedily effaced by the happiness i shall enjoy hereafter overcome at length by weariness and exhaustion he fell into a sort of dozeit could scarcely be called sleepand while in this state fancied he was visited by saint winifred who approaching the door of the cell touched it and it instantly opened she then placed her hand upon his limbs and the pain he had hitherto felt in them subsided your troubles will soon be over murmured the saint and you will be at rest do not hesitate to confess your silence will neither serve your companions nor yourself with these words the vision disappeared and guy fawkes awoke whether it was the effect of imagination or that his robust constitution had in reality shaken off the effects of the torture it is impossible to say but it is certain that he felt his strength restored to him and attributing his recovery entirely to the marvellous interposition of the saint he addressed a prayer of gratitude to her while thus occupied he heardfor it was so dark he could distinguish nothinga sweet low voice at the grating of the cell and imagining it was the same benign presence as before paused and listened do you hear me asked the voice i do replied fawkes is it the blessed winifred who again vouchsafes to address me alas no replied the voice it is one of mortal mould i am ruth ipgreve the jailers daughter you may remember that i expressed some sympathy in your behalf at your landing at traitors gate today for which i incurred my fathers displeasure but you will be quite sure i am a friend when i tell you i assisted viviana radcliffe to escape ha exclaimed guy fawkes in a tone of great emotion i was in some degree in her confidence pursued ruth and if i am not mistaken you are the object of her warmest regard the prisoner could not repress a groan you are guy fawkes pursued ruth nay you need have no fear of me i have risked my life for viviana and would risk it for you i will disguise nothing from you replied fawkes i am he you have named as the husband of vivianafor such i ami feel the deepest gratitude to you for the service you rendered her she bitterly reproached herself with having placed you in so much danger how did you escape i was screened by my parents replied ruth it was given out by them that viviana escaped through the window of her prison and i was thus preserved from punishment where is she now in safety i trust replied fawkes alas i shall never behold her again do not despair returned ruth i will try to effect your liberation and though i have but slender hope of accomplishing it still there is a chance i do not desire it returned fawkes i am content to perish all i lived for is at an end this shall not deter me from trying to save you replied ruth and i still trust there is happiness in store for you with viviana amid all your sufferings rest certain there is one who will ever watch over you i dare not remain here longer for fear of a surprise farewell she then departed and it afforded guy fawkes some solace to ponder on the interview during the rest of the night on the following morning jasper ipgreve appeared and placed before him a loaf of the coarsest bread and a jug of dirty water his scanty meal ended he left him but returned in two hours afterwards with a party of halberdiers and desiring him to follow him led the way to the torturechamber sir william waad was there when he arrived and demanding in a stern tone whether he still continued obstinate and receiving no answer ordered him to be placed in the gauntlets upon this he was suspended from a beam by his hands and endured five hours of the most excruciating agonyhis fingers being so crushed and lacerated that he could not move them he was then taken down and still refusing to confess was conveyed to a horrible pit adjoining the river called from the loathsome animals infesting it the dungeon among the rats it was about twenty feet wide and twelve deep and at high tide was generally more than two feet deep in water into this dreadful chasm was guy fawkes lowered by his attendants who warning him of the probable fate that awaited him left him in total darkness at this time the pit was free from water but he had not been there more than an hour when a bubbling and hissing sound proclaimed that the tide was rising while frequent plashes convinced him that the rats were at hand stooping down he felt that the water was alive with themthat they were all around himand would not probably delay their attack prepared as he was for the worst he could not repress a shudder at the prospect of the horrible death with which he was menaced at this juncture he was surprised by the appearance of a light and perceived at the edge of the pit a female figure bearing a lantern not doubting it was his visitant of the former night he called out to her and was answered in the voice of ruth ipgreve i dare not remain here many minutes she said because my father suspects me but i could not let you perish thus i will let down this lantern to you and the light will keep away the rats when the tide retires you can extinguish it so saying she tore her kerchief into shreds and tying the slips together lowered the lantern to the prisoner and without waiting to receive his thanks hurried away thus aided guy fawkes defended himself as well as he could against his loathsome assailants the light showed that the water was swarming with themthat they were creeping by hundreds up the sides of the pit and preparing to make a general attack upon him at one time fawkes determined not to oppose them but to let them work their will upon him but the contact of the noxious animals made him change his resolution and he instinctively drove them off they were not however to be easily repulsed and returned to the charge with greater fury than before the desire of self preservation now got the better of every other feeling and the dread of being devoured alive giving new vigour to his crippled limbs he rushed to the other side of the pit his persecutors however followed him in myriads springing upon him and making their sharp teeth meet in his flesh in a thousand places in this way the contest continued for some time guy fawkes speeding round the pit and his assailants never for one moment relaxing in the pursuit until he fell from exhaustion and his lantern being extinguished the whole host darted upon him thinking all over he could not repress a loud cry and it was scarcely uttered when lights appeared and several gloomy figures bearing torches were seen at the edge of the pit among these he distinguished sir william waad who offered instantly to release him if he would confess i will rather perish replied fawkes and i will make no further effort to defend myself i shall soon be out of the reach of your malice this must not be observed the lieutenant to jasper ipgreve who stood by the earl of salisbury will never forgive me if he perishes then not a moment must be lost or those ravenous brutes will assuredly devour him replied ipgreve they are so fierce that i scarcely like to venture among them a ladder was then let down into the pit and the jailer and the two officials descended they were just in time fawkes had ceased to struggle and the rats were attacking him with such fury that his words would have been speedily verified but for ipgreves timely interposition on being taken out of the pit he fainted from exhaustion and loss of blood and when he came to himself found he was stretched upon a couch in the torturechamber with the chirurgeon and jasper ipgreve in attendance strong broths and other restoratives were then administered and his strength being sufficiently restored to enable him to converse the lieutenant again visited him and questioning him as before received a similar answer in the course of that day and the next he underwent at intervals various kinds of torture each more excruciating than the preceding all of which he bore with unabated fortitude among other applications the rack was employed with such rigour that his joints started from their sockets and his frame seemed torn asunder on the fourth day he was removed to another and yet gloomier chamber devoted to the same dreadful objects as the first it had an arched stone ceiling and at the further extremity yawned a deep recess within this there was a small furnace in which fuel was placed ready to be kindled and over the furnace lay a large black flag at either end of which were stout leathern straps after being subjected to the customary interrogations of the lieutenant fawkes was stripped of his attire and bound to the flag the fire was then lighted and the stone gradually heated the writhing frame of the miserable man ere long showed the extremity of his suffering but as he did not even utter a groan his tormentors were compelled to release him on this occasion there were two personages present who had never attended any previous interrogation they were wrapped in large cloaks and stood aloof during the proceedings both were treated with the most ceremonious respect by sir william waad who consulted them as to the extent to which he should continue the torture when the prisoner was taken off the heated stone one of those persons advanced towards him and gazed curiously at him fawkes upon whose brow thick drops were standing and who was sinking into the oblivion brought on by overwrought endurance exclaimed it is the king and fainted the traitor knew your majesty said the lieutenant but you see it is in vain to attempt to extort anything from him so it seems replied james and i am greatly disappointed for i was led to believe that i should hear a full confession of the conspiracy from his own lips how say you good master chirurgeon will he endure further torture not without danger of life your majesty unless he has some days repose replied the chirurgeon even if he can endure it then it will not be necessary to apply it further replied salisbury i am now in full possession of the names of all the principal conspirators and when the prisoner finds further concealment useless he will change his tone tomorrow the commissioners appointed by your majesty for the examination of all those concerned in this dreadful project will interrogate him in the lieutenants lodgings and i will answer with my life that the result will be satisfactory enough said james it has been a painful spectacle which we have just witnessed and yet we would not have missed it the wretch possesses undaunted resolution and we can never be sufficiently grateful to the beneficent providence that prevented him from working his ruthless purpose upon us the day on which we were preserved from this gunpowder treason shall ever hereafter be kept sacred in our church and thanks shall be returned to heaven for our wonderful deliverance your majesty will act wisely replied salisbury the ordinance will impress the nation with a salutary horror of all papists and traitorsfor they are one and the same thingand keep alive a proper feeling of enmity against them such a fearful example shall be made of these miscreants as shall it is to be hoped deter all others from following their cause not only shall they perish infamously but their names shall for ever be held in execration be it so rejoined james it is a good legal maximcrescente malitia crescere debuit et poena upon this he left the chamber and traversing a number of subterranean passages with his attendants crossed the drawbridge near the byward tower to the wharf where his barge was waiting for him and returned in it to whitehall at an early hour on the following day the commissioners appointed to the examination of the prisoner met together in a large room on the second floor of the lieutenants lodgings afterwards denominated from its use on this occasion the council chamber affixed to the walls of this room may be seen at the present day a piece of marble sculpture with an inscription commemorative of the event the commissioners were nine in number and included the earls of salisbury northampton nottingham suffolk worcester devon marr and dunbar and sir john popham lord chief justice with these were associated sir edward coke attorneygeneral and sir william waad the apartment in which the examination took place is still a spacious one but at the period in question it was much larger and loftier the walls were panelled with dark lustrous oak covered in some places with tapestry and adorned in others with paintings over the chimneypiece hung a portrait of the late sovereign elizabeth the commissioners were grouped round a large heavily carved oak table and after some deliberation together it was agreed that the prisoner should be introduced sir william waad then motioned to topcliffe who was in attendance with half a dozen halberdiers and a few moments afterwards a panel was pushed aside and guy fawkes was brought through it he was supported by topcliffe and ipgreve and it was with the greatest difficulty he could drag himself along so severe had been the sufferings to which he had been subjected that they had done the work of time and placed more than twenty years on his head his features were thin and sharp and of a ghastly whiteness and his eyes hollow and bloodshot a large cloak was thrown over him which partially concealed his shattered frame and crippled limbs but his bent shoulders and the difficulty with which he moved told how much he had undergone on seeing the presence in which he stood a flush for a moment rose to his pallid cheek his eye glowed with its wonted fire and he tried to stand erectbut his limbs refused their officeand the effort was so painful that he fell back into the arms of his attendants he was thus borne forward by them and supported during his examination the earl of salisbury then addressed him and enlarging on the magnitude and horrible nature of his treason concluded by saying that the only reparation he could offer was to disclose not only all his own criminal intentions but the names of his associates i will hide nothing concerning myself replied fawkes but i shall be for ever silent respecting others the earl then glanced at sir edward coke who proceeded to take down minutes of the examination you have hitherto falsely represented yourself said the earl what is your real name guy fawkes replied the prisoner and do you confess your guilt pursued the earl i admit that it was my intention to blow up the king and the whole of the lords spiritual and temporal assembled in the parliament house with gunpowder replied fawkes and you placed the combustibles in the vault where they were discovered demanded salisbury the prisoner answered in the affirmative you are a papist continued the earl i am a member of the church of rome returned fawkes and you regard this monstrous design as righteous and laudableas consistent with the religion you profess and as likely to uphold it said the earl i did so replied fawkes but i am now convinced that heaven did not approve it and i lament that it was ever undertaken still you refuse to make the only reparation in your poweryou refuse to disclose your associates said salisbury i cannot betray them replied fawkes traitor it is needless cried the earl they are known to usnay they have betrayed themselves they have risen in open and armed rebellion against the king but a sufficient power has been sent against them and if they are not ere this defeated and captured many days will not elapse before they will be lodged in the tower if this is the case you require no information from me rejoined fawkes but i pray you name them to me i will do so replied salisbury and if i have omitted you can supply the deficiency i will begin with robert catesby the chief contriver of this hellengendered ploti will next proceed to the superior of the jesuits father garnetnext to another jesuit priest father oldcornenext to sir everard digbythen to thomas winter and robert winterthen to john wright and christopher wrightthen to ambrose rookwood thomas percy and john grant and lastly to robert keyes are these all demanded fawkes all we are acquainted with said salisbury then add to them the names of francis tresham and of his brotherinlaw lord mounteagle rejoined fawkes i charge both with being privy to the plot i have forgotten another name said salisbury in some confusion that of viviana radcliffe of ordsall hall i have received certain information that she was wedded to you while you were resident at white webbs near epping forest and was cognisant of the plot if captured she will share your fate fawkes could not repress a groan salisbury pursued his interrogations but it was evident from the increasing feebleness of the prisoner that he would sink under it if the examination was further protracted he was therefore ordered to attach his signature to the minutes taken by sir edward coke and was placed in a chair for that purpose a pen was then given him but for some time his shattered fingers refused to grasp it by a great effort and with acute pain he succeeded in tracing his christian name thus illustration guido while endeavouring to write his surname the pen fell from his hand and he became insensible chapter ii showing the troubles of viviana on coming to herself viviana inquired for garnet and being told that he was in his chamber alone she repaired thither and found him pacing to and fro in the greatest perturbation if you come to me for consolation daughter he said you come to one who cannot offer it i am completely prostrated in spirit by the disastrous issue of our enterprise and though i tried to prepare myself for what has taken place i now find myself utterly unable to cope with it illustration guy fawkes subscribing his examination after the torture if such is your condition father replied viviana what must be that of my husband upon whose devoted head all the weight of this dreadful calamity now falls you are still at libertystill able to save yourselfstill able at least to resist unto the death if you are so minded but he is a captive in the tower exposed to every torment that human ingenuity can invent and with nothing but the prospect of a lingering death before his eyes what is your condition compared with his happymost happy daughter replied garnet and i have been selfish and unreasonable i have given way to the weakness of humanity and i thank you from the bottom of my heart for enabling me to shake it off you have indulged false hopes father said viviana whereas i have indulged none or rather all has come to pass as i desired the dreadful crime with which i feared my husbands soul would have been loaded is now uncommitted and i have firm hope of his salvation if i might counsel you i would advise you to surrender yourself to justice and by pouring out your blood on the scaffold wash out your offence such will be my own course i have been involuntarily led into connexion with this plot and though i have ever disapproved of it since i have not revealed it i am as guilty as if i had been its contriver i shall not shun my punishment fate has dealt hardly with me and my path on earth has been strewn with thorns and cast in grief and trouble but i humbly trust that my portion hereafter will be with the blessed i cannot doubt it daughter replied garnet and though i do not view our design in the light that you do but regard it as justifiable if not necessary yet with your feelings i cannot sufficiently admire your conduct your devotion and selfsacrifice is wholly without parallel at the same time i would try to dissuade you from surrendering yourself to our relentless enemies believe me it will add the severest pang to your husbands torture to know that you are in their power his nature is stern and unyielding and persuaded as he is of the justice of his cause he will die happy in that conviction certain that his name though despised by our heretical persecutors will be held in reverence by all true professors of our faith no daughter fly and conceal yourself till pursuit is relinquished and pass the rest of your life in prayer for the repose of your husbands soul i will pass it in endeavouring to bring him to repentance replied viviana the sole boon i shall seek from my judges will be permission to attempt this it will be refused daughter replied garnet and you will only destroy yourself not aid him rest satisfied that the great power who judges the hearts of men and implants certain impulses within them for his own wise but inscrutable purposes well knows that guy fawkes however culpable his conduct may appear in your eyes acted according to the dictates of his conscience and in the full confidence that the design would restore the true worship of god in this kingdom the failure of the enterprise proves that he was mistakenthat we were all mistakenand that heaven was unfavourable to the means adoptedbut it does not prove his insincerity these arguments have no weight with me father replied viviana i will leave nothing undone to save his soul and whatever may be the result i will surrender myself to justice i shall not seek to move you from your purpose daughter replied garnet and can only lament it before however you finally decide let us pray together for directions from on high thus exhorted viviana knelt down with the priest before a small silver image of the virgin which stood in a niche in the wall and they both prayed long and earnestly garnet was the first to conclude his devotions and as he gazed at the upturned countenance and streaming eyes of his companion his heart was filled with admiration and pity at this juncture the door opened and catesby and sir everard digby entered on hearing them viviana immediately arose the urgency of our business must plead an excuse for the interruption if any is needed said catesby but do not retire madam we have no secrets from you now sir everard and i have fully completed our preparations he added to garnet our men are all armed and mounted in the court and are in high spirits for the enterprise as the service however will be one of the greatest danger and difficulty you had better seek a safe asylum father till the first decisive blow is struck i would go with you my son rejoined garnet if i did not think my presence might be an hinderance i can only aid you with my prayers and those can be more efficaciously uttered in some secure retreat than during a rapid march or dangerous encounter you had better retire to coughton with lady digby and viviana said sir everard i have provided a sufficient escort to guard you thitherand as you are aware there are many hidingplaces in the house where you can remain undiscovered in case of search i place myself at your disposal replied garnet but viviana is resolved to surrender herself this must not be returned catesby such an act at this juncture would be madness and would materially injure our cause whatever your inclinations may prompt you must consent to remain in safety madam i have acquiesced in your proceedings thus far replied viviana because i could not oppose them without injury to those dear to me but i will take no further share in them my mind is made up as to the course i shall pursue since you are bent upon your own destructionfor it is nothing lessit is the duty of your friends to save you rejoined catesby you shall not do what you propose and when you are yourself again and have recovered from the shock your feelings have sustained you will thank me for my interference you are right catesby observed sir everard it would be worse than insanity to allow her to destroy herself thus i am glad you are of this opinion said garnet i tried to reason her out of her design but without avail catesby cried viviana throwing herself at his feet by the love you once professed for meby the friendship you entertained for him who unhesitatingly offered himself for you and your cause i implore you not to oppose me now i shall best serve you and most act in accordance with the wishes of my friend by doing so replied catesby therefore you plead in vain alas cried viviana my purposes are ever thwarted you will have to answer for my life i should indeed have it to answer for if i permitted you to act as you desire rejoined catesby i repeat you will thank me ere many days are passed sir everard exclaimed viviana appealing to the knight i entreat you to have pity upon me i do sincerely sympathise with your distress replied digby in a tone of the deepest commiseration but i am sure what catesby advises is for the best i could not reconcile it to my conscience to allow you to sacrifice yourself thus be governed by prudence oh nono cried viviana distractedly i will not be stayed i command you not to detain me viviana said catesby taking her arm this is no season for the display of silly weakness either on our part or yours if you cannot control yourself you must be controlled father garnet i intrust her to your care two of my troop shall attend you together with your own servant nicholas owen you shall have stout horses able to accomplish the journey with the greatest expedition and i should wish you to convey her to her own mansion ordsall hall and to remain there with her till you hear tidings of us it shall be as you direct my son said garnet i am prepared to set out at once that is well replied catesby you will not do me this violence sir cried viviana i appeal against it to you sir everard i cannot help you madam replied the knight indeed i cannot then heaven i trust will help me cried viviana for i am wholly abandoned of man i beseech you madam put some constraint upon yourself said catesby if after your arrival at ordsall you are still bent upon your rash and fatal design father garnet shall not oppose its execution but give yourself time for reflection since it may not be otherwise i assent replied viviana if i must go i will start at once wisely resolved replied sir everard viviana then retired and soon afterwards appeared equipped for her journey the two attendants and nicholas owen were in the courtyard and catesby assisted her into the saddle do not lose sight of her he said to garnet as the latter mounted rest assured i will not replied the other and taking the direction of coventry the party rode off at a brisk pace catesby then joined the other conspirators while sir everard sent off lady digby and his household attended by a strong escort to coughton this done the whole party repaired to the courtyard where they called over the musterroll of their men to ascertain that none were missingexamined their arms and ammunitionand finding all in order sprang to their steeds and putting themselves at the head of the band rode towards southam and warwick chapter iii huddington about six oclock in the morning the conspirators reached leamington priors at that time an inconsiderable village and having ridden nearly twenty miles over heavy and miry roadsfor a good deal of rain had fallen in the nightthey stood in need of some refreshment accordingly they entered the first farmyard they came to and proceeding to the cowhouses and sheepfolds turned out the animals within them and fastening up their own steeds in their places set before them whatever provender they could find those and they were by far the greater number who could not find better accommodation fed their horses in the yard which was strewn with trusses of hay and great heaps of corn the whole scene formed a curious picture here was one party driving away the sheep and cattle which were bleating and lowingthere another rifling a henroost and slaughtering its cackling inmates on this hand by the direction of catesby two stout horses were being harnessed with ropes to a cart which he intended to use as a baggagewaggon on that sir everard digby was interposing his authority to prevent the destruction of a fine porker their horses fed the next care of the conspirators was to obtain something for themselves and ordering the master of the house who was terrified almost out of his senses to open his doors they entered the dwelling and causing a fire to be lighted in the chief room began to boil a large kettle of broth upon it and to cook other provisions finding a good store of eatables in the larder rations were served out to the band two casks of strong ale were likewise broached and their contents distributed and a small keg of strong waters being also discovered it was disposed of in the same way this however was the extent of the mischief done all the conspirators but chiefly catesby and sir everard digby dispersed themselves amongst the band and checked any disposition to plunder the only articles taken away from the house were a couple of old rusty swords and a caliver catesby proposed to the farmer to join their expedition but having now regained his courage the sturdy churl obstinately refused to stir a foot with them and even ventured to utter a wish that the enterprise might fail i am a good protestant and a faithful subject of king james and will never abet popery and treason he said this bold sally would have been answered by a bullet from one of the troopers if catesby had not interfered you shall do as you please friend he said in a conciliatory tone we will not compel any man to act against his conscience and we claim the same right ourselves will you join us good fellows he added to two farming men who were standing near their master must i confess to a priest asked one of them certainly not replied catesby you shall have no constraint whatever put upon you all i require is obedience to my commands in the field then i am with you replied the fellow thourt a traitor and rebel sam morrell cried the other hind and wilt come to a traitors end i will never fight against king james and if i must take up arms it shall be against his enemies and in defence of our religion no priestsno papistry for me well said hugh cried his master well die in that cause if need be catesby turned angrily away and giving the word to his men to prepare to set forth in a few minutes all were in the saddle but on inquiring for the new recruit sam morrell it was found he had disappeared the cart was laden with arms ammunition and a few sacks of corn and the line being formed they commenced their march the morning was dark and misty and all looked dull and dispiriting the conspirators however were full of confidence and their men exhilarated and refreshed by their meal appeared anxious for an opportunity of distinguishing themselves arrived within half a mile of warwick whence the lofty spire of the church of saint nicholas the tower of saint marys and the ancient gates of this beautiful old town could just be discerned through the mist a short consultation was held by the rebel leaders as to the expediency of attacking the castle and carrying off the horses with which they had learnt its stables were filled deciding upon making the attempt their resolution was communicated to their followers and received with loud acclamations catesby then put himself at the head of the band and they all rode forward at a brisk pace crossing the bridge over the avon whence the castle burst upon them in all its grandeur and beauty catesby dashed forward to an embattled gate commanding the approach to the structure and knocking furiously against it a wicket was opened by an old porter who started back on beholding the intruders he would have closed the wicket but catesby was too quick for him and springing from his steed dashed aside the feeble opposition of the old man and unbarred the gate instantly mounting again he galloped along a broad and winding path cut so deeply in the rock that the mighty pile they were approaching was completely hidden from view a few seconds however brought them to a point from which its three towers reared themselves full before them another moment brought them to the edge of the moat at this time crossed by a stone bridge but then filled with water and defended by a drawbridge as no attack like the present was apprehended and as the owner of the castle the celebrated fulke greville afterwards lord brooke to whom it had been recently granted by the reigning monarch was then in the capital the drawbridge was down and though several retainers rushed forth on hearing the approach of so many horsemen they were too late to raise it threatening these persons with destruction if any resistance was offered catesby passed through the great entrance and rode into the court where he drew up his band by this time the whole of the inmates of the castle had collected on the ramparts armed with calivers and partisans and whatever weapons they could find and though their force was utterly disproportioned to that of their opponents they seemed disposed to give them battle paying no attention to them catesby proceeded to the stables where he found upwards of twenty horses which he exchanged for the worst and most jaded of his own and was about to enter the castle in search of arms when he was startled by hearing the alarmbell rung this was succeeded by the discharge of a culverin on the summit of the tower named after the redoubted guy earl of warwick and though the bell was instantly silenced rookwood who had dislodged the party from the ramparts brought word that the inhabitants of warwick were assembling that drums were beating at the gates and that an attack might be speedily expected not desiring to hazard an engagement at this juncture catesby gave up the idea of ransacking the castle and ordered his men to their horses some delay however occurred before they could all be got together and meanwhile the ringing of bells and other alarming sounds continued at one time it occurred to catesby to attempt to maintain possession of the castle but this design was overruled by the other conspirators who represented to him the impracticability of the design at length the whole troop being assembled they crossed the drawbridge and speeded along the rocky path before the outer gate they found a large body of men some on horseback and some on foot drawn up these persons however struck with terror at their appearance retreated and allowed them a free passage on turning to cross the bridge they found it occupied by a strong and wellarmed body of men headed by the sheriff of warwickshire who showed no disposition to give way while the rebel party were preparing to force a passage a trumpet was sounded and the sheriff riding towards them commanded them in the kings name to yield themselves prisoners we do not acknowledge the supremacy of james stuart whom you call king rejoined catesby sternly we fight for our liberties and for the restoration of the holy catholic religion which we profess do not oppose us or you will have cause to rue your temerity hear me cried the sheriff turning from him to his men i promise you all a free pardon in the kings name if you will throw down your arms and deliver up your leaders but if after this warning you continue in open rebellion against your sovereign you will all suffer the vilest death rejoin your men sir said catesby in a significant tone and drawing a petronel a free pardon and a hundred pounds to him who will bring me the head of robert catesby said the sheriff disregarding the menace your own is not worth half the sum rejoined catesby and levelling the petronel he shot him dead the sheriffs fall was the signal for a general engagement exasperated by the death of their leader the royalist party assailed the rebels with the greatest fury and as the latter were attacked at the same time in the rear their situation began to appear perilous but nothing could withstand the vigour and determination of catesby cheering on his men he soon cut a way across the bridge and would have made good his retreat if he had not perceived to his infinite dismay that percy and rookwood had been captured regardless of any risk he might run he shouted to those near to follow him and made such a desperate charge upon the royalists that in a few minutes he was by the side of his friends and had liberated them in trying however to follow up his advantage he got separated from his companions and was so hotly pressed on all sides that his destruction seemed inevitable his petronels had both brought down their mark and in striking a blow against a stalwart trooper his sword had shivered close to the handle in this defenceless state his enemies made sure of him but they miscalculated his resources he was then close to the side of the bridge and before his purpose could be divined struck spurs deeply into his horse and cleared the parapet with a single bound a shout of astonishment and admiration arose alike from friend and foe and there was a general rush towards the side of the bridge the noble animal that had borne him out of danger was seen swimming towards the bank and though several shots were fired at him he reached it in safety this gallant action so raised catesby in the estimation of his followers that they welcomed him with the utmost enthusiasm and rallying round him fought with such vigour that they drove their opponents over the bridge and compelled them to flee towards the town catesby now mustered his men and finding his loss slighter than he expected though several were so severely wounded that he was compelled to leave them behind rode off at a quick pace after proceeding for about four miles along the stratford road they turned off on the right into a narrow lane leading to snitterfield with the intention of visiting norbrook the family residence of john grant on arriving there they put the house into a state of defence and then assembled in the hall while their followers recruited themselves in the courtyard so far well observed catesby flinging himself into a chair the first battle has been won true replied grant but it will not do to tarry here long this house cannot hold out against a prolonged attack we will not remain here more than a couple of hours replied catesby but where shall we go next i am for making some desperate attempt which shall strike terror into our foes are we strong enough to march to the earl of harringtons mansion near coventry and carry off the princess elizabeth asked percy she were indeed a glorious prize replied catesby but i have no doubt on the first alarm of our rising she has been conveyed to a place of safety and even if she were there we should have the whole armed force of coventry to contend with nono it will not do to attempt that nothing venture nothing have cried sir everard digby we ought in my opinion to run any risk to secure her you know me too well digby rejoined catesby to doubt my readiness to undertake any project however hazardous which would offer the remotest chance of success but in this i see none unless indeed it could be accomplished by stratagem let us first ascertain what support we can obtain and then decide upon the measures to be adopted i am content returned digby old mr talbot of grafton is a friend of yours is he not continued catesby addressing thomas winter can you induce him to join us i will try replied thomas winter but i have some misgivings be not fainthearted rejoined catesby you and stephen littleton shall go to him at once and join us at your own mansion of huddington whither we will proceed as soon as our men are thoroughly recruited use every argument you can devise with talbottell him that the welfare of the catholic cause depends on our successand that neither his years nor infirmities can excuse his absence at this juncture if he will not or cannot come himself cause him to write letters to all his catholic neighbours urging them to join us and bid him send all his retainers and servants to us i will not neglect a single plea replied thomas winter and i will further urge compliance by his long friendship towards myself but as i have just said i despair of success soon after this he and stephen littleton with two of the troopers wellmounted and wellarmed rode across the country through lanes and byroads with which they were well acquainted to grafton at the same time catesby repaired to the courtyard and assembling his men found there were twentyfive missing more than half of these it was known had been killed or wounded at warwick but the rest it was suspected had deserted whatever effect this scrutiny might secretly have upon catesby he maintained a cheerful and confident demeanour and mounting a flight of steps harangued the band in energetic and exciting terms displaying a small image of the virgin to them he assured them they were under the special protection of heaven whose cause they were fightingand concluded by reciting a prayer in which the whole assemblage heartily joined this done they filled the baggagecart with provisions and further ammunition and forming themselves into good order took the road to alcester they had not gone far when torrents of rain fell and the roads being in a shocking condition and ploughed up with ruts they turned into the fields wherever it was practicable and continued their march very slowly and under excessively disheartening circumstances on arriving at the ford across the avon near bishopston they found the stream so swollen that it was impossible to get across it sir everard digby who made the attempt was nearly carried off by the current they were therefore compelled to proceed to stratford and cross the bridge my friends said catesby commanding a halt at a short distance of the town i know not what reception we may meet with here probably much the same as at warwick but i command you not to strike a blow except in selfdefence those injunctions given attended by the other conspirators except percy and rookwood who brought up the rear he rode slowly into stratford and proceeding to the marketplace ordered a trumpet to be sounded on the first appearance of the troop most of the inhabitants fled to their houses and fastened the doors but some few courageous persons followed them at a wary distance these were harangued at some length by catesby who called upon them to join the expedition and held out promises which only excited the derision of the hearers indeed the dejected looks of most of the band and the drenched and muddy state of their apparel made them objects of pity and contempt rather than of serious apprehension and nothing but their numbers prevented an attack being made upon them catesbys address concluded amid groans of dissatisfaction and finding he was wasting time and injuring his own cause he gave the word to march and moved slowly through the main street but not a single recruit joined him another unpropitious circumstance occurred just as they were leaving stratford two or three of his followers tried to slink away when catesby riding after them called to them to return and no attention being paid to his orders he shot the man nearest him and compelled the others by threats of the same punishment to return to their ranks this occurrence while it occasioned much discontent and illwill among the band gave great uneasiness to their leaders catesby and percy now brought up the rear and kept a sharp lookout to check any further attempt at desertion digby and winter being well acquainted with all the catholic gentry in the neighbourhood they proceeded to their different residences and were uniformly coldly received and in some cases dismissed with reproaches and menaces in spite of all their efforts too repeated desertions took place and long before they reached alcester their force was diminished by a dozen men not thinking it prudent to pass through the town they struck into a lane on the right and fording the arrow near ragley skirted that extensive park and crossing the hills near weethly and stoney moreton arrived in about an hour and a half in a very jaded condition at huddington the seat of robert winter affairs seemed to wear so unpromising an aspect that catesby on entering the house immediately called a council of his friends and asked them what they proposed to do for my own part he said i am resolved to fight it out i will continue my march as long as i can get a man to follow me and when they are all gone will proceed alone but i will never yield we will all die together if need be said sir everard digby let us rest here tonight and in the morning proceed to lord windsors mansion hewel grange which i know to be well stocked with arms and after carrying off all we can we will fortify stephen littletons house at holbeach and maintain it for a few days against our enemies this proposal agreed to they repaired to the courtyard and busied themselves in seeing the wants of their followers attended to and such a change was effected by good fare and a few hours repose that the spirits of the whole party revived and confidence was once more restored a slight damp however was again thrown upon the satisfaction of the leaders by the return of thomas winter and stephen littleton from grafton their mission had proved wholly unsuccessful mr talbot had not merely refused to join them but had threatened to detain them he says we deserve the worst of deaths observed thomas winter in conclusion and that we have irretrievably injured the catholic cause and i begin to fear he speaks the truth rejoined christopher wright however for us there is no retreat none whatever rejoined catesby in a sombre tone we must choose between death upon the battlefield or on the scaffold the former be my fate cried percy and mine added catesby an anxious and perturbed night was passed by the conspirators and many a plan was proposed and abandoned it had been arranged among them that they should each in succession make the rounds of the place to see that the sentinels were at their postsstrict orders having been given to the latter to fire upon whomsoever might attempt to flybut as catesby despite his great previous fatigue was unable to rest he took this duty chiefly upon himself returning at midnight from an examination of the courtyard he was about to enter the house when he perceived before him a tall figure with a cloak muffled about its face standing in his path it was perfectly motionless and catesby who carried a lantern in his hand threw the light upon it but it neither moved forward nor altered its position catesby would have challenged it but an undefinable terror seized him and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth an idea rose to his mind that it was the spirit of guy fawkes and by a powerful effort he compelled himself to address it are you come to warn me he demanded the figure moved in acquiescence and withdrawing the cloak revealed features of ghastly paleness but resembling those of fawkes have i long to live demanded catesby the figure shook its head shall i fall tomorrow pursued catesby the figure again made a gesture in the negative the next day solemnly inclining its head the figure once more muffled its ghastly visage in its cloak and melted from his view for some time catesby remained in a state almost of stupefaction he then summoned up all the resolution of his nature and instead of returning to the house continued to pace to and fro in the court and at last walked forth into the garden it was profoundly dark and he had not advanced many steps when he suddenly encountered a man repressing the exclamation that rose to his lips he drew a petronel from his belt and waited till the person addressed him is it you sir john foliot asked a voice which he instantly recognised as that of topcliffe ay replied catesby in a low tone did you manage to get into the house pursued topcliffe i did returned catesby but speak lower there is a sentinel within a few paces of us come this way and grasping the others arm he drew him further down the walk do you think we may venture to surprise them demanded topcliffe hum exclaimed catesby hesitating in the hope of inducing the other to betray his design or shall we wait the arrival of sir richard walsh the sheriff of worcestershire and the posse comitatus pursued topcliffe how soon do you think the sheriff will arrive asked catesby scarcely able to disguise his anxiety he cannot be here before daybreakif so soon returned topcliffe and then we shall have to besiege the house and though i have no fear of the result yet some of the conspirators may fall in the skirmish and my orders from the earl of salisbury as i have already apprised you are to take them alive true replied catesby i would not for twice the reward i shall receive for the capture of the whole party that that desperate traitor catesby should be slain continued topcliffe the plot was contrived by him and the extent of its ramifications can alone be ascertained through him i think i can contrive their capture observed catesby but the utmost caution must be used i will return to the house and find out where the chief conspirators are lodged i will then throw open the door and will return to this place where you can have our men assembled if we can seize and secure the leaders the rest will be easy you will run great risk sir john said topcliffe with affected concern heed not that replied catesby you may expect me in a few minutes get together your men as noiselessly as you can with this he hastily withdrew on returning to the house he instantly roused his companions and acquainted them with what had occurred my object he said is to make topcliffe a prisoner we may obtain much useful information from him as to the others if they offer resistance we will put them to death what force have they asked sir everard digby with some uneasiness it is impossible to say precisely replied catesby but not more than a handful of men i should imagine as they are waiting for sir richard walsh i know not what may be the issue of this matter observed robert winter whose looks were unusually haggard but i have had a strange and ominous dream which fills me with apprehension indeed exclaimed catesby upon whose mind the recollection of the apparition he had beheld rushed catesby pursued robert winter taking him aside if you have any sin unrepented of i counsel you to make your peace with heaven for i fear you are not long for this world it may be so rejoined catesby firmly and i have many dark and damning sins upon my soul but i will die as i have lived firm and unshaken to the last and now let us prepare for our foes so saying he proceeded to call up the trustiest of his men and enjoining profound silence upon them disposed them in various places that they might instantly appear at his signal after giving them other directions he returned to the garden and coughed slightly he was answered by a quicklyapproaching footstep and a voice demanded are you there sir john catesby answered in a low tone in the affirmative come forward then rejoined topcliffe as he spoke there was a rush of persons towards the spot and seizing catesby he cried in a triumphant tone while he unmasked a lantern and threw its light full upon his face you are caught in your own trap mr catesby you are my prisoner not so villain cried catesby disengaging himself by a powerful effort springing backwards he drew his sword and making the blade describe a circle round his body effected his retreat in safety though a dozen shots were fired at him leaping the garden wall he was instantly surrounded by the other conspirators and the greater part of the band who hearing the reports of the firearms had hurried to the spot instantly putting himself at their head catesby returned to the garden but topcliffe and his party had taken the alarm and fled torches were brought and by catesbys directions a large heap of dry stubble was set on fire but though the flames revealed every object for a considerable distance around them no traces of the hostile party could be discerned after continuing their ineffectual search for some time the conspirators returned to the house and abandoning all idea of retiring to rest kept strict watch during the remainder of the night little conversation took place all were deeply depressed and catesby paced backwards and forwards within a passage leading from the hall to the diningchamber his thoughts were gloomy enough and he retraced the whole of his wild and turbulent career pondering upon its close which he could not disguise from himself was at hand it matters not he mentally ejaculated i shall not die ignominiously and i would rather perish in the vigour of manhood than linger out a miserable old age i have striven hard to achieve a great enterprise and having failed have little else to live for this band cannot hold together two days longer our men will desert us or turn upon us to obtain the price set upon our heads and were they true i have little reliance upon my companions they have no longer the confidence that can alone insure success and i expect each moment some one will propose a surrender surrender i will never do so with life something must be donesomething worthy of meand then let me perish i have ever prayed to die a soldiers death as he uttered these words unconsciously aloud he became aware of the presence of robert winter who stood at the end of the passage watching him your prayer will not be granted catesby said the latter some dreadful doom i fear is reserved for you and all of us what mean you demanded the other uneasily listen to me replied robert winter i told you i had a strange and appalling dream tonight and i will now relate it i thought i was in a boat upon the river thames when all at once the day which had been bright and smiling became dark and overcastnot dark like the shades of night but gloomy and ominous as when the sun is shrouded by an eclipse i looked around and every object was altered the tower of saint pauls stood awry and seemed ready to topple downso did the spires and towers of all the surrounding fanes the houses on london bridge leaned frightfully over the river and the habitations lining its banks on either side seemed shaken to their foundations i fancied some terrible earthquake must have occurred or that the end of the world was at hand go on said catesby who had listened with profound attention to the relation the stream too changed its colour continued robert winter and became red as blood and the man who rowed my boat was gone and his place occupied by a figure masked and habited like an executioner i commanded him to row me ashore and in an instant the bark shot to land and i sprang out glad to be liberated from my mysterious conductor my steps involuntarily led me toward the cathedral and on entering it i found its pillars shrines monuments and roof hung with black the throng that ever haunt pauls walk had disappeared and a few dismal figures alone traversed the aisles on approaching them i recognised in their swollen deathlike and blackened lineaments some resemblance to you and our friends i was about to interrogate them when i was awakened by yourself a strange dream truly observed catesby musingly and coupled with what i myself have seen tonight would seem to bode evil and he then proceeded to describe the supernatural appearance he had beheld to his companion all is over with us rejoined robert winter we must prepare to meet our fate we must meet it like menlike brave men robert replied catesby we must not disgrace ourselves and our cause you are right rejoined robert winter but these visions are more terrible than the contemplation of death itself if you require further rest take it returned catesby in an hour i shall call up our men and march to hewel grange i am wearied enough replied robert winter but i dare not close my eyes again then recommend your soul to heaven said catesby i would be alone melancholy thoughts press upon me and i desire to unburden my heart to god robert winter then left him and he withdrew into a closet where there was an image of the virgin and kneeling before it prayed long and fervently arising in a calmer frame of mind he returned to the hall and summoning his companions and followers their horses were brought forth and they commenced their march it was about four oclock when they started and so dark that they had some difficulty in finding the road they proceeded at a slow pace and with the utmost caution but notwithstanding this and though the two winters and grant who were well acquainted with the country led the way many trifling delays and disasters occurred their baggagecart frequently stuck fast in the deep ruts while the men missing their way got into the trenches skirting the lane and were not unfrequently thrown from their horses more than once too the alarm was given that they were pursued and a sudden halt ordered but these apprehensions proved groundless and after a most fatiguing ride they found themselves at stoke prior and within two miles of hewel grange originally built in the early part of the reign of henry the eighth and granted by that monarch to an ancestor of its present possessor lord windsor this ancient mansion was quadrangular in form and surrounded by a broad deep fosse situated in the heart of an extensive park at the foot of a gentle hill it was now approached from the brow of the latter beautiful eminence by the rebel party but at this season and at this hour both park and mansion had a forlorn look the weather still continued foggy with drizzling showers and though the trees were not yet entirely stripped of their foliage their glories had altogether departed the turf was damp and plashy and in some places partook so much of the character of a swamp that the horsemen were obliged to alter their course but all obstacles were eventually overcome and in ten minutes after their entrance into the park they were within gunshot of the mansion there were no symptoms of defence apparent but the drawbridge being raised it was catesbys opinion notwithstanding appearances that their arrival was expected he was further confirmed in this idea when sounding a trumpet and calling to the porter to let down the drawbridge no answer was returned the entrance to the mansion was through a lofty and machiolated gateway strengthened at each side by an embattled turret perceiving a man at one of the loopholes catesby discharged his petronel at him and it was evident from the cry that followed that the person was wounded an instant afterwards calivers were thrust through the other loopholes and several shots fired upon the rebels while some dozen armed men appeared upon the summit of the tower and likewise commenced firing perceiving topcliffe among the latter and enraged at the sight catesby discharged another petronel at him but without effect he then called to some of his men to break down the door of an adjoining barn and to place it in the moat the order was instantly obeyed and the door afloat in the fosse and springing upon it he impelled himself with a pike towards the opposite bank several shots were fired at him and though more than one struck the door he crossed the moat uninjured so suddenly was this daring passage effected that before any of the defenders of the mansion could prevent him catesby had severed the links of the chain fastening the drawbridge and it fell clattering down with a loud shout his companions then crossed it but they had still a difficulty to encounter the gates which were of great strength and covered with plates of iron were barred but a ladder having been found in the barn it was brought forward and catesby mounting it sword in hand drove back all who opposed him and got upon the wall he was followed by sir everard digby percy and several others and driving the royalists before them they made their way down a flight of stone steps and proceeding to the gateway threw it open and admitted the others all this was the work of a few minutes committing the ransacking of the mansion to digby and percy and commanding a dozen men to follow him catesby entered a small arched doorway and ascended a winding stone staircase in search of topcliffe his progress was opposed by the soldiers but beating aside all opposition he gained the roof topcliffe however was gone anticipating the result of the attack he had let himself drop from the summit of the tower to the walls and descending by the ladder had made good his retreat disarming the soldiers catesby then descended to the courtyard where in a short time a large store of arms consisting of corslets demilances pikes calivers and two falconets were brought forth these together with a cask of powder were placed in the baggagewaggon meanwhile the larder and cellar had been explored and provisions of all kinds together with a barrel of mead and another of strong ale being found they were distributed among the men while this took place catesby searched the mansion and partly by threats partly by persuasion induced about twenty persons to join them this unlookedfor success so encouraged the conspirators that their drooping spirits began to revive catesby appeared as much elated as the others but at heart he was full of misgiving soon afterwards the rebel party quitted hewel grange taking with them every weapon they could find the forced recruits were placed in the midst of the band so that escape was impracticable chapter iv holbeach avoiding the high road and traversing an unfrequented part of the country the conspirators shaped their course towards stourbridge as they reached forfield green they perceived a large party descending the hilly ground near bromsgrove and evidently in pursuit of them an immediate halt was ordered and taking possession of a farmhouse they prepared for defence seeing these preparations their pursuers who proved to be sir richard walsh the sheriff of worcestershire sir john foliot three gentlemen named ketelbye salwaye and conyers attended by a large posse of men all tolerably well armed drew up at some distance from the farm and appeared to be consulting as to the prudence of making an attack topcliffe was with them and catesby who reconnoitered their proceedings from a window of the dwelling inferred from his gestures that he was against the assault and so it proved the royalist party remained where they were and as one or two of their number occasionally disappeared catesby judged and correctly that they were despatched for a reinforcement not willing to wait for this he determined to continue his march and accordingly forming his men into a close line and bringing up the rear himself they again set forward sir richard walsh and his party followed them and whenever they were in a difficult part of the road harassed them with a sudden attack in this way several stragglers were cut off and a few prisoners made so exasperated did catesby become by these annoyances that though desirous to push forward as fast as possible he halted at the entrance of a common and prepared for an engagement but his purpose was defeated for the royalist party took another course nor did he see anything more of them for some time in about an hour the rebels arrived at the banks of the river stour not far from the little village of churchill and here just as they were preparing to ford the stream the sheriff and his followers again made their appearance by this time also the forces of their opponents were considerably augmented and as more than a third of their own party were engaged in crossing the stream which was greatly swollen by the recent rains and extremely dangerous their position was one of no slight peril nothing daunted catesby instantly drew up his men on the bank and after a short skirmish drove away the enemy and afterwards contrived to cross the river without much loss he found however that the baggagecart had got immersed in the stream and it was feared that the powder would be damaged they remained on the opposite bank for some time but as their enemies did not attempt to follow them they took the way to holbeach a large and strongly built mansion belonging as has been already stated to stephen littleton here they arrived without further molestation and their first business was to put it into a complete state of defence illustration the explosion at holbeach after a long and anxious consultation sir everard digby quitted them undertaking to return on the following day with succours stephen littleton also disappeared on the same evening his flight produced a strong impression on catesby and he besought the others not to abandon the good cause but to stand by it as he himself meant to do to the last they all earnestly assured him that they would do so except robert winter who sat apart and took no share in their discourse catesby then examined the powder that had been plunged in the water in crossing the stour and found it so much wetted as to be nearly useless a sufficient stock of powder being of the utmost consequence to them he caused all the contents of the barrel not dissolved by the immersion to be poured into a large platter and proceeded to dry it before a fire which had been kindled in the hall a bag of powder which had likewise been slightly wetted was also placed at what was considered a safe distance from the fire heaven grant this may prove more destructive to our enemies than the combustibles we placed in the mine beneath the parliament house observed percy heaven grant so indeed rejoined catesby with a moody smile they would call it retribution where we to perish by the same means which we designed for others jest not on so serious a matter catesby observed robert winter for my own part i dread the sight of powder and shall walk forth till you have dried this and put it away you are not going to leave us like stephen littleton rejoined catesby suspiciously i will go with him said christopher wright so you need be under no apprehension accordingly he quitted the hall with robert winter and they proceeded to the courtyard and were conversing together on the dismal prospects of the party when a tremendous explosion took place the roof of the building seemed rent in twain and amidst a shower of tiles plaster bricks and broken wood falling around the bag of powder dropped untouched at their feet mother of mercy exclaimed christopher wright picking it up here is a providential occurrence had this exploded we must all have been destroyed let us see what has happened cried robert winter and followed by christopher wright he rushed towards the hall and bursting open the door beheld catesby enveloped in a cloud of smoke and pressing his hand to his face which was scorched and blackened by the explosion rookwood was stretched on the floor in a state of insensibility and it at first appeared that life was extinct percy was extinguishing the flames which had caught his dress and john grant was similarly occupied those are the very faces i beheld in my dream cried robert winter gazing at them with affright it was a true warning rushing up to catesby christopher wright clasped him in his arms and extinguishing his flaming apparel cried wretch that i am that i should live to see this day be not alarmed gasped catesby it is nothingit was a mere accident it is no accident catesby replied robert winter heaven is against us and our design and he quitted the room and left the house nor did he return to it i will pray for forgiveness cried john grant whose vision was so much injured by the explosion that he could as yet see nothing and dragging himself before an image of the virgin he prayed aloud acknowledging that the act he had designed was so bloody that it called for the vengeance of heaven and expressing his sincere repentance no more of this cried catesby staggering up to him and snatching the image from him it was a mere accident i tell you we are all alive and shall yet succeed on inquiry christopher wright learnt that a blazing coal had shot out of the fire and falling into the platter containing the powder had occasioned the disastrous accident above described chapter v the close of the rebellion unable longer to endure the agony occasioned by his scorched visage catesby called for a bucket of water and plunged his head into it somewhat relieved by the immersion he turned to inquire after his fellowsufferers rookwood having been carried into the open air had by this time regained his consciousness percy was shockingly injured his hair and eyebrows burnt his skin blackened and swollen with unseemly blisters and the sight of one eye entirely destroyed while john grant though a degree less hurt than his companions presented a grim and ghastly appearance in fact the four sufferers looked as if they had just escaped from some unearthly place of torment and were doomed henceforth to bear the brand of divine wrath on their countenances seeing the effect produced on the others catesby rallied all his force and treating the accident as a matter of no moment and which ought not to disturb the equanimity of brave men called for wine and quaffed a full goblet injured as he was and smarting with pain percy followed his example but both john grant and rookwood refused the cup hark e gentlemen cried catesby fiercely you may drink or not as you see fit but i will not have you assume a deportment calculated to depress our followers stephen littleton and robert winter have basely deserted us if you have any intention of following them go at once we are better without you than with you i have no thought of deserting you catesby rejoined rookwood mournfully and when the time arrives for action you will find i shall not be idle but i am now assured that we have sold ourselves to perdition pshaw cried catesby with a laugh that communicated an almost fiendish expression to his grim features because a little powder has accidentally exploded and blackened our faces are we to see in the occurrence the retributive justice of heaven are we to be cast down by such a trifle be a man and rouse yourself recollect that the eyes of all england are upon us and if we must fall let us perish in a manner that becomes us no real mischief has been done my hand is as able to wield a blade and my sight to direct a shot as heretofore if heaven had meant to destroy us the bag of powder which has been taken up in the yard and which was sufficient not only to annihilate us but to lay this house in ruins would have been suffered to explode would it had exploded exclaimed john wright all would then have been over are you too fainthearted john cried catesby well well leave me one and all of you i will fight it out alone you wrong me by the suspicion catesby returned john wright i am as true to the cause as yourself but i perceive that our last hour is at hand and i would it were past the indulgence of such a wish at such a moment is a weakness rejoined catesby i care not when death comes provided it comes gloriously and such should be your feeling on the manner in which we meet our fate will depend the effect which our insurrection will produce throughout the country we must set a brave example to our brethren heaven be praised we shall not perish on the scaffold be not too sure of that said grant gloomily it may yet be our fate it shall never be mine cried catesby nor mine added percy i am so far from regarding the recent disaster as a punishment though i am the severest sufferer by it that i think we ought to return thanks to heaven for our preservation in whatever light the accident is viewed observed john wright we cannot too soon address ourselves to heaven we know not how long it may be in our power to do so again desponding cried catesby but no matter you will recover your spirits anon john wright shook his head and catesby pulling his hat over his brows to hide his features walked forth into the courtyard he found as he expected that general consternation prevailed amongst the band the men were gathered together in little knots and though they became silent as he approached he perceived they were discussing the necessity of a surrender nothing daunted by these unfavourable appearances catesby harangued them in such bold terms that he soon inspired them with some of his own confidence and completely resteadied their wavering feelings elated with his success he caused a cup of strong ale to be given to each man and proposed as a pledge the restoration of the romish church he then returned to the house and summoning the other conspirators to attend him in a chamber on the groundfloor they all prayed long and fervently and concluded by administering the sacrament to each other it was now thought necessary to have the damage done by the explosion repaired and a few hours were employed in the operation evening was fast approaching and catesby who was anxiously expecting the return of sir everard digby stationed himself on the turreted walls of the mansion to look out for him but he came not and fearing some mischance must have befallen him catesby descended desirous of concealing his misgivings from his companions he put on a cheerful manner as he joined them i am surprised ere this that we have not been attacked remarked percy our enemies may be waiting for the darkness to take us by surprise but they will be disappointed i can only account for the delay by supposing they have encountered sir everard digby and the force he is bringing to us remarked christopher wright it may be so returned catesby and if so we shall soon learn the result in spite of all catesbys efforts he failed to engage his companions in conversation and feeling it would best suit his present frame of mind and contribute most to their safety to keep in constant motion he proceeded to the courtyard saw that all the defences were secure that the drawbridge was raised the sentinels at their posts and everything prepared for the anticipated attack every half hour he thus made his rounds and when towards midnight he was going forth percy said to him do you not mean to take any rest catesby not till i am in my grave was the moody reply catesbys untiring energy was in fact a marvel to all his followers his iron frame seemed wholly unsusceptible of fatigue and even when he returned to the house he continued to pace to and fro in the passage in preference to lying down rest tranquilly he said to christopher wright who offered to take his place i will rouse you on the slightest approach of danger but though he preserved this stoical exterior catesbys breast was torn by the keenest pangs he could not hide from himself that to serve his own ambitious purposes he had involved many loyal and worthy till he had deluded them persons in a treasonable project which must now terminate in their destruction and their blood he feared would rest upon his head but what weighed heaviest of all upon his soul was the probable fate of viviana if i were assured she would escape he thought i should care little for all the rest even for fawkes they say it is never too late to repent but my repentance shall lie between my maker and myself man shall never know it the night was dark and the gloom was rendered more profound by a dense fog fearing an attack might now be attempted catesby renewed his vigilance marching round the edge of the moat he listened to every sound that might betray the approach of a foe for some time nothing occurred to excite his suspicions until about an hour after midnight as he was standing at the back of the house he fancied he detected a stealthy tread on the other side of the fosse and soon became convinced that a party of men were there determined to ascertain their movements before giving the alarm he held his breath and drawing a petronel remained perfectly motionless presently though he could discern no object he distinctly heard a plank pushed across the moat and could distinguish in the whispered accents of one of the party the voice of topcliffe a thrill of savage joy agitated his bosom and he internally congratulated himself that revenge was in his power a footstep though so noiseless as to be inaudible to any ear less acute than his own was now heard crossing the plank and feeling certain it was topcliffe catesby allowed him to land and then suddenly advancing kicked the plank on which were two other persons into the water and unmasking a dark lantern threw its light upon the face of a man near him who proved as he suspected to be topcliffe aware of the advantage of making a prisoner of importance catesby controlled the impulse that prompted him to sacrifice topcliffe to his vengeance and firing his petronel in the air as a signal he drew his sword and sprang upon him topcliffe attempted to defend himself but he was no match for the skill and impetuosity of catesby and was instantly overpowered and thrown to the ground by this time percy and several of the band had come up and delivering topcliffe to the charge of two of the stoutest of them catesby turned his attention to the other assailants one of them got across the moat but the other encumbered by his arms was floundering about when catesby pointing a petronel at his head he was fain to surrender and was dragged out a volley of musketry was now fired by the rebels in the supposed direction of their opponents but it could not be ascertained what execution was done after waiting for some time in expectation of a further attack catesby placed a guard upon the spot and proceeded to examine topcliffe he had been thrown into a cellar beneath the kitchen and the two men were on guard over him he refused to answer any of catesbys questions though enforced by threats of instant death on searching him some letters were found upon him and thrusting them into his doublet catesby left him with the strictest injunctions to the men as to his safe custody he then proceeded to examine the other captive and found him somewhat more tractable this man informed him that topcliffe had intended to steal into the house with the design of capturing the conspirators or failing in that of setting fire to the premises he also ascertained that topcliffes force consisted only of a dozen men so that no further attack need be apprehended notwithstanding this information catesby determined to be on the safe side and doubling the sentinels he stationed one of the conspirators all of whom had sprung to arms at his signal at each of the exposed points he then withdrew to the mansion and examined topcliffes papers the first despatch he opened was from the earl of salisbury bearing date about the early part of fawkess confinement in the tower in which the earl expressed his determination of wringing a full confession from the prisoner a bitter smile curled catesbys lip as he read this but his brow darkened as he proceeded and found that a magnificent reward was offered for his own arrest i must have catesby captured ran the missiveso see you spare no pains to take him i would rather all escaped than he did his confession is of the last importance in the matter and i rely upon your bringing him to me alive i will at least balk him of that satisfaction muttered catesby but what is this of viviana reading further he found that the earl had issued the same orders respecting viviana and that she would be rigorously dealt with if captured alas groaned catesby i hope she will escape these inhuman butchers the next despatch he opened was from tresham and with a savage satisfaction he found that the traitor was apprehensive of doubledealing on the part of salisbury and mounteagle he stated that he had been put under arrest and was detained a prisoner in his own house and fearing he should be sent to the tower besought topcliffe to use his influence with the earl of salisbury not to deal unfairly with him he is rightly served cried catesby with a bitter smile heaven grant they may deal with him as he dealt with us the consideration of these letters furnished catesby with food for much bitter reflection pacing the room to and fro with uncertain footsteps he remained more than an hour by himself and at last yielding to the promptings of vengeance repaired to the cellar in which he had placed topcliffe with the intention of putting him to death what was his rage and mortification to find both the guard and the prisoner gone a door was open and it was evident that the fugitives had stolen to the moat and swimming noiselessly across it in the darkness had securely effected their retreat fearful of exciting the alarm of his followers catesby controlled his indignation and said nothing of the escape of the prisoner to any but his confederates who entirely approved of the policy of silence they continued on the alert during the remainder of the night and no one thought of seeking repose till it was fully light and all danger of a surprise at an end day dawned late and dismally the fog that had hung round the mansion changed just before daybreak into drizzling rain and this increased ere long to heavy and drenching showers everything looked gloomy and depressing and the conspirators were so disheartened that they avoided each others regards catesby mounted the walls of the mansion to reconnoitre the prospect was forlorn and melancholy to the last degree the neighbouring woods were obscured by mist the courtyard and garden flooded with rain and the waters of the moat spotted by the heavy shower not an object was in view except a hind driving cattle to a neighbouring farm catesby shouted to him and the fellow with evident reluctance approaching the brink of the moat was asked whether he had seen any troops in the neighbourhood the man answered in the negative but said he had heard that an engagement had taken place in the night about five miles from thence near hales owen between sir everard digby and sir richard walsh and that sir everards party had been utterly routed and himself taken prisoner this intelligence was a severe blow to catesby as it destroyed the last faint hope he had clung to for some time he continued wrapt in thought and then descended to the lower part of the house a large fire had been kept up during the night in the hall and the greater part of the band were now gathered round it drying their wet clothes and conversing together a plentiful breakfast had been served out to them so that they were in tolerably good spirits and many of them talked loudly of the feats they meant to perform in case of an attack catesby heard these boasts but they fell upon an idle ear he felt that all was over that his last chance was gone and that the struggle could not be much longer protracted entering the inner room he sat down at table with his companions but he ate nothing and continued silent and abstracted it is now my turn to reproach you observed grant you look deeply depressed sir everard digby is a prisoner replied catesby sternly his capture grieves me sorely he should have died with us all echoed the wish catesby arose and closed the door the attack will not be many hours delayed he said and unless there should be some miraculous interposition in our behalf it must end in our defeat do not let us survive it he continued earnestly let us swear to stand by each other as long as we can and to die together agreed cried the others and now continued catesby i must compel myself to take some nourishment for i have much to do having swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and drained a goblet of wine he again visited every part of the habitation examined the arms of the men encouraged them by his looks and words and became satisfied unless some unlookedfor circumstance occurred to damp their ardour they would offer a determined and vigorous resistance if i could only come off victorious in this last conflict i should die content thought catesby and i do not despair of it the rain continued till eleven oclock when it ceased and the mist that had attended it partially cleared off about noon catesby who was on the lookout from the walls of the mansion descried a large troop of horsemen issuing from the wood he immediately gave the alarm the bell was rung and all sprang to arms by this time the troop had advanced within a hundred yards of the house and catesby who had rushed into the courtyard mounted a turret near the gate to watch their movements and issue his commands the royalists were headed by sir richard walsh who was attended on the right by sir john foliot and on the left by topcliffe immediately behind them were ketelbye salwaye conyers and others who had accompanied the posse comitatus the day before a trumpet was then sounded and a proclamation made in a loud voice by a trooper commanding the rebels in the kings name to surrender and to deliver up their leaders the man had scarcely concluded his speech when he was for ever silenced by a shot from catesby a loud and vindictive shout was raised by the royalists and the assault instantly commenced sir richard walsh directed the attack against the point opposite the drawbridge while sir john foliot topcliffe and the others dispersed themselves and completely surrounded the mansion several planks were thrust across the moat and in spite of the efforts of the rebels many of the assailants effected a passage catesby drove back the party under sir richard walsh and with his own hand hewed asunder their plank in doing this he so much exposed himself that but for the injunctions of the sheriff who commanded his followers not to fire upon him he must have been slain the other rebelleaders displayed equal courage and equal indifference to danger and though as has just been stated a considerable number of the royalists had got across the moat and entered the garden they had obtained no material advantage sir john foliot and topcliffe commanded this party and encouraged them to press on but such a continued and welldirected firing was kept up upon them from the walls and windows of the mansion that they soon began to show symptoms of wavering at this juncture and while topcliffe was trying to keep his men together a concealed door in the wall was opened and catesby issued from it at the head of a dozen men he instantly attacked topcliffe and his band put several to the sword and drove those who resisted into the moat foliot and topcliffe with difficulty escaped across the plank which was seized and pulled over to his own side by catesby but the hope which this success inspired was instantly crushed loud shouts were raised from the opposite wing of the mansion and catesby to his great dismay perceived from the volumes of smoke ascending from it that it was on fire uttering an exclamation of rage and despair he commanded those with him not to quit their present position and set off in the direction of the fire he found that an outbuilding had been set in flames by a lighted brand thrown across the moat by a trooper the author of the action was named john streete and was afterwards rendered notorious by another feat to be presently related efforts were made to extinguish the conflagration but such was the confusion prevailing that it was found wholly impossible to do so and it was feared that the destruction of the whole mansion would ensue disaster after disaster followed another party had crossed the moat and burst into the courtyard in the desperate conflict that ensued rookwood was shot through the arm and severely wounded by a pike and was borne into the house by one of his followers whom he entreated to kill him outright but his request was refused meantime the drawbridge was lowered and with loud and exulting shouts the great body of the royalists crossed it catesby now perceived that the day was irretrievably lost calling to christopher wright who was standing near him to follow him and rushing towards the courtyard he reached it just as the royalists gained an entrance in numbers both parties were pretty well matched but the rebels were now thoroughly disheartened and seeing how matters must end many of them threw down their arms and begged for mercy a destructive fire however was still kept up on the royalists by a few of the rebels stationed on the walls of the mansion under the command of john wright putting himself at the head of a few faithful followers catesby fought with all the fury of despair christopher wright was shot by his side grant instantly sprang forward but was cut down by a trooper catesby was too busily occupied to attend to the fate of his companions but seeing thomas winter near him called to him to come on i can fight no longer said thomas winter my right arm is disabled by a bolt from a crossbow then die cried catesby he shall dieon the scaffold rejoined topcliffe who had heard the exclamation and rushing up to thomas winter he seized him and conveyed him to the rear of his party catesby continued to fight with such determined bravery that sir richard walsh seeing it would be vain to take him alive withdrew his restrictions from his men and ordered them to slay him by this time most of the rebels had thrown down their arms those on the walls had been dislodged and john wright refusing to yield was slaughtered catesby however having been joined by percy and half a dozen men made a last desperate charge upon his opponents in doing this his sword shivered and he would have fallen back but found himself surrounded percy was close behind him and keeping together they fought back to back even in this disabled state they made a long and desperate resistance remember your oath percy cried catesby you have sworn not to be taken to the scaffold illustration the death of catesby fear nothing replied percy i will never quit this spot alive the words were scarcely out of his mouth when he fell to the ground mortally wounded and the same shot that had pierced his breast had likewise stricken catesby it was fired by the trooper john streete who has just been mentioned collecting all his force catesby struck a few terrible blows at his opponents and dashing through them made for the house just as he reached the door which was standing open his strength failed and he fell to the ground in this condition he dragged himself into the vestibule where there was a large wooden statue of the virgin and clasping his arms around it pressed his lips to the feet of the image he was followed by streete with his drawn sword in one hand and a petronel in the other prepared to finish his work but ere he could reach him catesby had expired so exclaimed topcliffe who came up the next moment with sir richard walsh we have been robbed of our prey the earl of salisbury will never forgive me for this disappointment i am glad i have done it though observed streete to kill two such traitors with one shot is something to talk of you will be well rewarded for it no doubt remarked topcliffe sarcastically i care not whether i am or not rejoined streete i have done my duty and besides i have avenged my comrade richard trueman who was shot by this traitor when he read the proclamation i will take care that your brave action is duly represented to his majesty observed sir richard walsh and he failed not to keep his promise streete received a pension of two shillings a day for the rest of his lifeno inconsiderable sum in those days the conflict was now at an end for though some few of the more desperate of the rebels continued to struggle after their leaders had fallen they were soon disarmed sir richard walsh and topcliffe went in search of the other conspirators and finding rookwood and grant who though severely wounded were not dead lying in the hall immediately secured them rookwood on their approach made an effort to plunge his dagger into his breast but his hand was stayed by sir richard walsh we shall not go away quite emptyhanded cried topcliffe but these are sorry substitutes for catesby has catesby escaped demanded grant faintly ay to the other world replied topcliffe he has kept his word groaned grant he may have escaped some part of his punishment said topcliffe bitterly but the worst remains his quarters will be exposed on every gate in london and his head on the bridge as to you traitors you know your doom and are prepared for it rejoined grant a guard being left over the prisoners sir richard walsh and topcliffe then went to see that the other captives were properly secured some few having made their escape into the adjoining fields they were pursued and recaptured the whole of the prisoners were then conveyed to stourbridge where they were lodged in the gaol after which sir richard walsh despatched a messenger to the earl of salisbury and the lords of the council acquainting them with what he had done chapter vi hagley robert winter it may be remembered immediately after the explosion quitted holbeach and did not return to it he proceeded to the neighbouring thicket and while wandering about in a state bordering on distraction encountered stephen littleton who had likewise deserted his companions on the same day acquainting him with the disastrous occurrence that had taken place and stating his impression that both god and man were against them and that it would be vain as well as impious to struggle longer he proposed to him to surrender but stephen littleton so strongly combated this opinion that he at last consented to make an effort to escape this however was no easy matter nor could they devise a plan that appeared feasible both were well provided with money but under present circumstances it would be of little use to them a large price being set on their heads and the whole country alarmed they scarcely knew where to seek shelter after a long debate they quitted the covert and keeping clear of all habitations took the direction of stourbridge on approaching the stour at a point opposite churchill where they knew the river was fordable they perceived sir richard walshs force approaching and threw themselves into a ditch to avoid observation it was quite dark when they again ventured forth and at the peril of their lives they forded the stour which was swollen more than it had been in the morning by the longcontinued rain their design was to proceed to hagley the residence of stephen littletons sister mrs littleton and to claim her protection this magnificent mansion lay about two miles on the other side of the river in the heart of an extensive park but they were obliged to take a circuitous route of nearly double the distance to reach it and when at length they arrived there and were about to steal into the courtyard they found it occupied by a portion of sir richard walshs troop overcome by anxiety and fatigue and scarcely knowing whither to proceed they recrossed the park and sought out the cottage of a poor woman whose two sons had joined their illfated expedition and were at that moment under arms at holbeach she was a good catholic and they thought they might confide in her arriving at her cottage they glanced in at the window and perceiving her as they concluded alone and cooking a small piece of meat at the fire they raised the latch and entered the house the woman turned at their approach and uttering a cry of surprise and alarm pointed towards a back room they then saw that they had betrayed themselves but the caution came too late and a stalwart trooper alarmed by the cry issued from the back room from the wretched appearance of the newcomers he at once guessed that they were rebels and felt satisfied from the richness of their apparel dirtied and stained as it was that they were persons of consequence accordingly he drew a brace of petronels and holding them at their heads commanded them to surrender they were too much taken by surprise and too enfeebled to offer resistance and the trooper calling to the old woman to bring a cord to bind them at the same time unloosed his own girdle with which he fastened robert winters arms behind his back in doing this he was compelled to lay down his petronels and he had scarcely done so when the woman snatched them up and gave them to stephen littleton who presented them at his head it was now the turn of the conspirators to triumph in another instant robert winter was released by the old woman and the pair throwing themselves upon the trooper forced him to the ground they then dragged him to the back room and stripped him of his habiliments which stephen littleton put on instead of his own attire and binding him hand and foot returned to the old woman at the request of robert winter she furnished him with a suit of clothes belonging to one of her sons and then set before them the best eatables she possessed they were ravenously hungry and soon disposed of the viands meanwhile their hostess told them that the whole country was in arms against them that mrs littleton being suspected though she had always been adverse to the design her house had undergone a rigorous search but that mr humphrey littleton not having taken any part in the insurrection had not as yet been arrested though it was feared he would be proved to be connected with the plot she concluded by strongly counselling them to use the utmost caution and to expose themselves as little as possible they assured her she need have no apprehension on that score and expressed great anxiety as to what would befal her when they were pone i do not desire to shed blood if it can be helped said stephen littleton but in a case of necessity like the present where life must be weighed against life i hold it lawful to shed it shall we put the trooper to death not unless your own safety requires it good sirs she said i shall quit this cottage soon after you have left it and obtain a safe asylum with one of my neighbours it matters not what becomes of me having lost my two sonsfor i consider them as already deadi have nothing left to bind me to life unable to make any reply the conspirators remained for some time silent when by the poor womans advice they withdrew to an upper chamber and stretching themselves on a bed sought a few hours repose the old woman kept watch below and they gave her one of the petronels with strict injunctions to blow out the troopers brains if he attempted to move nothing however occurred to alarm her and at three oclock she awakened them offering the woman a handsome reward which however she declined they then set out and shortly afterwards their hostess quitted her habitation and withdrew to the cottage of a neighbour where she remained concealed for some weeks and then died of grief on learning that her sons had been slain during the assault of holbeach by the royalists recruited by the rest they had enjoyed the conspirators pursued their course over the fields the weather was the same as that which disheartened their confederates at holbeach and the rain fell so heavily that they had soon not a dry thread upon them but being now disguised they were not under so much apprehension of detection shaping their course towards rowley regis in staffordshire which lay about five miles from hagley where a farmer named pelborrow a tenant of humphrey littleton resided and whom they thought would befriend them they proceeded swiftly on their way but though well acquainted with the country they were so bewildered and deceived by the fog that they strayed materially out of their course and when it grew light found themselves near weoley castle and about four miles from birmingham confiding in their disguises and in their power of sustaining the characters they assumed they got into the high road and approaching a farmhouse stephen littleton who had tied his companions arms behind him with his belt represented himself as a trooper conveying a prisoner from stourbridge to birmingham and in consequence of this obtained a breakfast from the farmer after their meal was over the host who had eyed them suspiciously observed to the supposed trooper you will overtake some of your comrades before you reach egbaston and had better lose no time in joining them you are known to me my masters he added in a tone that could not be heard by the household but i will not betray you get you gone the conspirators did not fail to act upon the suggestion and as soon as they got out of sight struck across the county in the direction of rowley regis and arrived at the farmhouse which was their destination in about an hour pelborrow chanced to be in a barn adjoining his house and alone and on seeing them readily offered to hide them no one had noticed their approach and carefully concealing them amid the hay in the loft he proceeded about his business as if nothing had happened he could not just then procure them provisions without exciting suspicion but when night arrived brought them a sufficient supply for the next day in this way they passed nearly a week never venturing to stir forth for they had been traced to the neighbourhood and constant search was going on after them pelborrow had great difficulty in keeping his men out of the barn and the disappearance of the provisions excited the suspicions of his female domestics who began to think all was not right he therefore intimated to the conspirators that they must change their quarters and in the dead of the night they removed to the house of another farmer named perkes residing on the borders of hagley park to whom pelborrow had confided the secret of their being in the neighbourhood and who on promise of a large reward readily undertook to secrete them perkes met them at a little distance from his house and conducted them to a barleymow where he had contrived a hidingplace amid the straw for them a womanservant and a man were both let into the secret by perkes and a sum of money given him for that purpose by the conspirators bribed them to silence here they remained close prisoners unable to stir forth or even to change their habiliments for nearly six weeks during which time they received constant intelligence from their protector of what was going forward and learnt that the search for them had not relaxed they were not without hope however that the worst was over when an incident occurred that gave them serious uneasiness one night perkes who was a stout hale yeoman and had formerly been warrener to mrs littleton went to catch conies with a companion named poynter and returned laden with spoil after drinking a cup or two of ale together the pair separated and poynter feeling fatigued with his exertions as well as drowsy with the liquor he had swallowed determined to pass the night in his friends barn and entering it clambered up to the loft and laid himself in the straw in doing this he slipped into the hole made for the conspirators who aroused by his fall instantly seized him terrified to death and fancying he had fallen into the hands of gipsies or other plunderers poynter roared for mercy which they were not at first disposed to show him but the poor wretch finding into whose hands he had fallen besought them in such piteous terms to spare his life affirming with the strongest oaths that he would never betray them that they consented to spare him on condition of his remaining with them as long as they should occupy their place of concealment when perkes appeared in the morning he was not a little surprised at finding his comrade caught in such a trap but entirely approved of the course taken by the conspirators poynter as may be supposed was no willing captive and being constantly pondering on the means of escape and of obtaining the reward for the apprehension of the conspirators at last hit upon the following expedient while engaged in the poaching expedition with perkes he had received a slight wound in the leg and the close confinement to which he was now subjected inflamed it to such a degree as to render it highly dangerous this he represented to the conspirators who however would not suffer him to depart but desired perkes to bring him some ointment to dress his wound the request was complied with and feigning that it was necessary to approach the light to apply the salve poynter scrambled up the straw apparently for that sole purpose he did not attempt to fly for several days but at last when they were grown less suspicious he slided down the other side of the loft and made good his retreat the conspirators saw the error they had committed when too late not daring to pursue him they remained in fearful anticipation of an arrest throughout the day but they were not disturbed until night when perkes made his appearance they told him what had happened but he did not appear to be much alarmed i do not think you need be afraid of him he said let me have some money and i will go in quest of him at once and bribe him to silence here are fifty marks replied stephen littleton if that is not enough take more it will amply suffice replied perkes i will answer for his silence this assurance greatly relieved the conspirators and they were made completely easy by the return of perkes in less than an hour afterwards who told them he had seen poynter and had given him the money binding him by the most solemn oaths not to betray them i have still better news for you my masters he added mrs littleton has set out for london today and i have received orders from mr humphrey littleton to bring you to the hall at midnight this last intelligence completed their satisfaction and they awaited perkess return with impatience shortly before midnight he came to summon them and they set forth together perkess house lay about a mile from the hall and they soon entered the park the night was clear and frostyit was now the middle of decemberand as the conspirators trod the crisp sod and gazed at the noble but leafless trees around them they silently returned thanks to heaven for their restoration to freedom humphrey littleton was waiting for them at the end of an avenue near the mansion and tenderly embraced them tears of joy were shed on both sides and it seemed to humphrey littleton as if his brother had been restored from the grave dismissing perkes with warm thanks and promises of a further recompence they then entered the house by a window which had been left purposely open humphrey littleton conducted them to his own chamber where fresh apparel was provided for them and to poor wretches who had not been able to put off their attire for so long a period the luxury of the change was indescribably great the arrival of the fugitives was kept secret from all the household except the mancook john ocklie upon whose fidelity humphrey littleton thought he could rely a good supper was prepared by this man and brought up into his masters chamber where the conspirators were now seated before a hearth heaped with blazing logs the conspirators needed no solicitation to fall to and they did ample justice to the good things before them his spirits being raised by the good cheer robert winter observed to the cook who was in attendance upon them ah jack thy mistress little thinks what guests are now in her house who have neither seen fire nor tasted a hot morsel for wellnigh two months ay it is a sad matter returned the cook shaking his head and i wish i could offer your worships a flask of wine or a cup of stout ale at the least but the butler is in bed and if i were to rouse him at this hour it might excite his suspicion if you are willing sir he added to humphrey littleton i will hie to my mothers cottage in the park and bring a jug of ale from her this was agreed to and the cook left the house his sole object however was to instruct his mother to give the alarm so that the conspirators might be arrested before morning on reaching her cottage he was surprised to see a light within it and two men there one of whom was poynter and the other mrs littletons steward robert hazlewood poynter had acquainted hazlewood with all he knew respecting the conspirators supposing them still in the barleymow and they were discussing the best means of arresting them when the cook entered the house the birds are flown he said as you will find if you search the nest but come to the hall with a sufficient force betimes tomorrow morning and i will show you where to find them i shall claim however my share of the reward though i must not appear in the matter having fully arranged their plan he procured the ale from his mother and returned to the hall the conspirators soon disposed of the jug threw themselves on a couch in the room and instantly dropping asleep enjoyed such repose as only falls to the lot of those who have similarly suffered and it was well they did sleep soundly for it was the last tranquil night they ever enjoyed humphrey littleton who as has been stated reposed implicit confidence in the cook had committed the key of the chamber to him strictly enjoining him to call them in the morning and the fellow feeling secure of his prey retired to rest about seven oclock he burst suddenly into the room and with a countenance of wellfeigned alarm which struck tenor into the breasts of the conspirators cried master hazlewood and the officers are below and say they must search the house poynter is with them the villain has betrayed us cried stephen littleton fools that we were to spare his life there is no use in lamenting your indiscretion now sir replied the cook leave it to me and i will yet effect your escape we place ourselves entirely in your hands said stephen littleton go down stairs sir said the cook to humphrey littleton and hold master hazlewood in conversation for a few minutes and i will engage to get the gentlemen safely out of the house humphrey littleton obeyed and descending to the steward told him he was willing to conduct him to every room in the house i am certain they are here and shall not quit it till i find them rejoined hazlewood ah he exclaimed as if struck by a sudden thought you say they are not in the house perhaps they are in the gardenin the summerhouse we will go and see so saying he took halfadozen of his men with him leaving poynter and the rest with humphrey littleton who was perplexed and alarmed at his conduct meanwhile the cook led the two conspirators along the gallery and from thence down a back staircase which brought them to a small door communicating with the garden a few seconds were lost in opening it and when they issued forth they encountered hazlewood and his men who instantly arrested them the unfortunate conspirators were conveyed under a strong guard to london where they were committed to the tower to take their trial with their confederates chapter vii vivianas last night at ordsall hall on the evening of the third day after quitting dunchurch viviana radcliffe and her companions arrived at ordsall hall they had encountered many dangers and difficulties on the journey and were wellnigh overcome with fatigue and anxiety fearful of being detained garnet had avoided all the larger towns in the way and had consequently been driven greatly out of the direct course he had assumed the disguise which he usually wore when travelling that of a lawyer and as he possessed great mimetic talent he sustained the character admirably viviana passed for his daughter and his servant nicholas owen who was almost as clever an actor as his master represented his clerk while the two attendants performed the parts of clients at abbotsbromley where they halted for refreshment on the second day having spent the night at a small village near lichfield they were detained by the landlord who entertained some suspicions of them but garnet succeeded in frightening the man into allowing them to depart they underwent another alarm of the same kind at leek and were for two hours locked up but on the arrival of a magistrate who had been sent for by the host garnet gave so plausible an account of himself that the party were instantly set at liberty and arrived without further molestation at their journeys end vivianas last visit to the hall had been sad enough but it was not so sad as the present it was a dull november evening and the wind moaned dismally through the trees scattering the yellow leaves on the ground the house looked forlorn and desolate no smoke issued from the chimneys nor was there any external indication that it was inhabited the drawbridge was down and as they passed over it the hollow trampling of their steeds upon the planks vibrated painfully upon vivianas heart before dismounting she cast a wistful look around and surveyed the grassgrown and neglected court where in years gone by she had sported the moat on whose brink she had lingered and the surrounding woods which she had never looked upon even on a dreary day like the present and when they were robbed in some measure of their beauty without delight scanning the deserted mansion from roof to foundation she traced all its gables angles windows doors and walls and claimed every piece of carved work every stone as a familiar object and as associated with other and happier hours it is but the wreck of what it was she thought the spirit that animated it is fled grass grows in its courtsno cheerful voices echo in its chambersno hospitality is maintained in its hallbut neglect gloom and despair claim it as their own the habitation and its mistress are well matched guessing from the melancholy expression of her countenance what was passing within and thinking it advisable to turn the current of her thoughts garnet assisted her to alight and committing the care of their steeds to owen and the others proceeded with her to the principal entrance everything appeared in nearly the same state as when they had last seen it and the only change that had taken place was for the worse the ceilings were mapped and mildewed with damps the oncegorgeously stained glass was shivered in the windows the costly arras hung in tattered fragments from the walls while the floors which were still strewn with plaster and broken furniture were flooded with the moisture that had found its way through the holes in the roof bear up dear daughter said garnet observing that viviana was greatly distressed by the sight and let the contemplation of this scene of havoc instead of casting you down inspire you with just indignation against enemies from whom it is vain to expect justice or mercy how many catholic mansions have been thus laid waste how many highborn and honourable men whose sole fault was their adherence to the religion of their fathers and their refusal to subscribe to doctrines against which their consciences revolted have been put to death like your father nay have endured a worse fate for they have languished out their lives in prison while their families and retainers have undergone every species of outrage how many a descendant of a proud line distinguished for worth for loyalty and for devotion has stood as you now stand upon his desolate hearthhas seen misery and ruin usurp the place of comfort and happinessand has heard the very stones beneath his feet cry out for vengeance accursed be our oppressors he added lifting up his hands and elevating his voice may their churches be thrown downtheir faith crushedtheir rights invadedtheir children delivered to bondagetheir hearths laid waste as ours have been may this and worse come to pass till the whole stock of heresy is uprooted hold father exclaimed viviana even here beholding this miserable sight and with feelings keenly excited i cannot join in your terrible denunciation what i hope forwhat i pray for is toleration not vengeance the sufferings of our brethren will not have been in vain if they enable our successors to worship god in their own way and according to the dictates of their consciences the ruthless conduct of our persecutors must be held in as much abhorrence by all good protestants as our persecution of that sect when we were in the ascendant is regarded by all worthy members of our own church i cannot believe that by persecution we can work out the charitable precepts inculcated by our saviour and i am sure such a course is as adverse to the spirit of religion as it is to that of humanity let us bear our sorrows with patiencelet us utter no repinings but turn the other cheek to the smiter and we shall find in due time that the hearts of our oppressors will relent and that all the believers in the true god will be enabled to worship him in peace though at different altars such a season will never arrive daughter replied garnet severely till heresy is extirpated and the false doctrines now prevailing utterly abolished then indeed when the church of rome is reestablished and the old and true religion restored universal peace will prevail and let me correct the grievous and sinful error into which you have fallen our church is always at war with heresy and if it cannot uproot it by gentle means authorizes nay enjoins the employment of force i will not attempt to dispute with you upon points of faith father returned viviana i am content to think and act according to my own feelings and convictions but i will not give up the hope that in some milder and wiser age persecution on either side will cease and the sufferings of its victims be remembered only to soften the hearts of fanatics of whatever creed towards each other were a lesson wanting to ourselves surely it might be found in the result that has attended your dark and criminal enterprise and in which the disapproval of heaven has been signally manifested not so daughter replied garnet an action is not to be judged or justified by the event attending it but by its own intrinsic merits to aver the contrary were to throw a doubt upon the holy scriptures themselves where we read in the book of judges that the eleven tribes of israel were commanded to make war upon the tribe of benjamin and yet were twice defeated we have failed but this proves nothing against our project which i maintain to be righteous and praiseworthy undertaken to overthrow an heretical and excommunicated monarch and to reestablish the true faith of the most high throughout this land i lament to find that you still persist in error father replied viviana but you cannot by any sophistry induce me to coincide with you in opinion i hold the attempt an offence alike against god and man and while i rejoice at the issue that has attended it i deplore the irreparable harm it will do to the whole body of catholics all of whom will be connected by the bigoted and unthinking of the hostile party with the atrocious design not only have you done our cause an injury but you have in a measure justified our opponents severity and given them a plea for further persecution no more of this daughter rejoined garnet impatiently or i shall deem it necessary to reprove you let us search the house and try to find some habitable chamber in which you can pass the night after a long search they discovered a room in comparatively good order and leaving viviana within it garnet descended to the lower part of the house where he found nicholas owen and the two other attendants we have chanced upon a scanty supply of provender for our steeds remarked owen with a doleful look but we are not likely to obtain a meal ourselves unless we can feed upon rats and mice which appear to be the sole tenants of this miserable dwelling you must go to manchester instantly and procure provisions returned garnet but take heed you observe the utmost caution fear nothing replied owen if i am taken your reverence will lose your supperthat is all he then set out upon his errand and garnet proceeded to the kitchen where to his great surprise he found the hearthstone still warm and a few lighted embers upon it while crumbs of bread and little fragments of meat scattered about proved that some one had taken a meal there startled by this discovery he continued his search but as fruitlessly as before and though he called to any one who might be hidden to come forth the summons was unanswered one of the attendants had placed a few sticks upon the smouldering ashes and on returning to the kitchen it was found that they had kindled a fire being thus obtained some of the broken furniture was used to replenish it and by garnets commands another fire was speedily lighted in vivianas chamber night had now come on and owen not returning garnet became extremely uneasy and had almost given him up when the absentee made his appearance with a large basket of provisions under his arm i have had some difficulty in obtaining them he said and fancying i observed two persons following me was obliged to take a circuitous route to get back the whole town is in commotion about the plot and it is said that the most rigorous measures are to be adopted towards all the catholic families in the neighbourhood sighing at the latter piece of intelligence garnet selected such provisions as he thought would be acceptable to viviana and took them upstairs to her she ate a little bread and drank a cup of water but refused to taste anything else and finding it in vain to press her garnet returned to the kitchen where being much exhausted he recruited himself with a hearty meal and a cup of wine left alone viviana knelt down and clasping a small crucifix to her breast prayed long and fervently while she was thus engaged she heard the door open gently behind her and turning her head beheld an old man clothed in a tattered garb with long white hair flowing over his shoulders and a beard of the same snowy hue descending upon his breast as he advanced slowly towards her she started to her feet and a brighter flame arising at the moment from the fire it illumined the intruders wobegone features is it possible she exclaimedcan it be my fathers old steward jerome heydocke it is indeed my dear young mistress replied the old man falling on his knee before her heaven be praised he continued seizing her hand and bedewing it with tears i have seen you once again and shall die content i never expected to behold you more good heydocke returned viviana raising him i heard you had died in prison it was so given out by the jailers to account for my escape replied the old steward and i took care never to contradict the report by making my appearance i will not distress you by the recital of all i have endured but will simply state that i was confined in the prison upon hunts bank whence i escaped in the night by dropping upon the rocks and from them into the river where it was supposed i was drowned making my way into the country i concealed myself for a time in barns and outbuildings until at length i ventured back to the old house and have dwelt in it unmolested ever since i should have perished of want long ago but for the kindness of mr humphrey chetham he used to send my son regularly to me with provisions and now that martin is gone to london on business as i understood relating to you he brings them to me himself he will be here tomorrow indeed exclaimed viviana i must see him as you please returned the old man i suppose those are your companions below i was in my hidingplace and hearing voices and footsteps did not dare to venture forth till all was still on approaching this room which i have been in the habit of occupying lately and peeping through the door which was standing ajar i perceived a female figure and thinking it must be you though i scarcely dared to trust the evidence of my senses i ventured in oh my dear dear young mistress what a joy it is to see you again i fear you must have suffered much for you are greatly altered at this moment garnet entered the room he started on seeing the old steward but an explanation was instantly given him you then are the person by whom the fire was recently lighted in the kitchen he asked heydocke replied in the affirmative i came to bid you farewell for the night dear daughter said garnet and to assure you that you may rest without fear for we have contrived to make fast the doors come with me my son he added to the steward and you shall have a comfortable meal below making a profound reverence to viviana the old man followed him down stairs viviana continued to pace to and fro within her chamber for some time and then overcome with fatigue flung herself upon the bedstead on which a cloak had been thrown sleep soon closed her eyes but it was disturbed by frightful and distressing dreams from which she was suddenly aroused by a touch upon the arm starting up she perceived the old steward by the side of her couch with a light in his hand what brings you here heydocke she demanded with surprise and alarm you have slept soundly my dear young mistress or you would not require to be informed replied the steward there do you not hear it he added as a loud knocking resounded from below viviana listened for a moment and then as if struck by a sudden idea hurried down stairs she found garnet and the others assembled in the hall but wholly unnerved by fright hide yourselves she said and no ill shall befal you quicknot a moment is to be lost having allowed them sufficient time for concealment she demanded in a loud voice who was without friends was the reply it is the voice of doctor dee replied heydocke indeed exclaimed viviana admit him instantly heydocke obeyed and throwing open the door gave entrance to the doctor who was wrapped in his long furred gown and carried a lantern he was accompanied by kelley and humphrey chetham your visit is singularly timed mr chetham said viviana after she had saluted the party but you are not the less welcome on that account i much desired to see you and indeed should have sent for you tomorrow but how did you know i was here the only explanation i can offer you is this replied chetham i was hastily summoned from my residence at crumpsall by kelley who told me you were at ordsall hall and that doctor dee was about to visit you and desired my company thus summoned i came at once a strange explanation indeed replied viviana close and fasten the door said dee in an authoritative tone to kelley and as soon as his commands were obeyed he took vivianas hand and led her to the farther end of the hall my art informed me of your arrival viviana he said i am come to save you you are in imminent danger i well know it she replied but i have no wish to fly from justice i am weary of my life and would gladly resign it i would call to your recollection viviana pursued dee that i foretold the disastrous result of this plot in which you have become unhappily involved to guy fawkes and warned him not to proceed in it but he would not be advised and is now a prisoner in the tower all i wish is to go thither and die with him rejoined viviana if you go thither you will die before him said dee i would do so she replied viviana radcliffe returned dee in a compassionate tone i truly grieve for you your attachment to this heinous traitor completely blinds you the friendship i entertained for your mother makes me anxious to serve youto see you happy it is now in your power to be so but if you take another false step your fate is decided and you will die an early death i will answer for your safetynay what is more i will undertake that ere long you shall again be mistress of this mansion and have your estates restored to you you promise fairly sir she replied with a mournful smile i have not yet done pursued dee all i require for the service is that when freed by the death of guy fawkes from the chain that now binds youfor i am aware of your illstarred union with himyou shall bestow your hand upon humphrey chetham it may not be replied viviana firmly and if you could in truth read the secrets of the heart you would know that mine would instantly reject the proposal think not it originates with me viviana said humphrey chetham who had approached them unobserved my previous experience of your character would alone have prevented me from becoming a party to any such proposal had i known it would be made do not i beseech you sir he added to dee clog your offer with conditions which will effectually prevent its accomplishment you are true to yourself mr chetham rejoined viviana and will not therefore wonder that i continue so were i to assent to doctor dees proposal i should be further from happiness than i am now even if he could make good his words and restore me to the station i have forfeited i have received a shock from which i shall never recover and the only haven of repose to which i look forward is the grave alas exclaimed chetham in a pitying tone you will think i trespass too much upon your kindness she pursued but you can render me a great service and it will be the last i shall ever require from you name it cried chetham eagerly i would beg you to escort me to london she rejoined and to deliver me to the lords of the council i would willingly escape the indignities to which t shall be exposed if i am conveyed thither as a prisoner will you do this i will replied chetham lest you should think i have offered more than i can perform viviana said dee who had listened attentively to the foregoing conversation i will now tell you on what grounds i build my expectation of procuring your pardon the conspiracy was first revealed by me to the earl of salisbury though for his own purposes he kept it secret to the last he owes me a heavy debt and shall pay it in the way i propose if you desire it i will abide by what i have done replied viviana you know then what fate awaits you said dee i shall not shrink from it she rejoined it is well he replied before i leave i will give you another caution father garnet is here nay attempt not to deny it you cannot deceive me besides i desire to serve not harm him if he remains here till tomorrow he will be captured a proclamation has been issued for his arrest as well as for that of father oldcorne deliver him this warning and now farewell with this he took up his lantern and followed by kelley quitted the hall humphrey chetham only tarried a few moments to inform viviana that he would return soon after daybreak with a couple of steeds for the journey as soon as he was gone viviana communicated dees warning to garnet who was so alarmed by it that he resolved not to delay his own departure a moment taking an affectionate leave of viviana and confiding her to the care of the old steward he set out with his three attendants faithful to his promise humphrey chetham appeared at the appointed time viviana bade an eternal farewell to the old steward who was overwhelmed with grief and looked as if his sorrows would soon be ended and mounting one of the steeds brought by the young merchant they took the direction of london chapter viii hendlip garnet proceeded at a rapid pace for some miles before he acquainted his companions whither he was going he then informed nicholas owen who rode by his side that he should make the best of his way to hendlip house the seat of mr thomas abingdon near droitwich in worcestershire where he knew that father oldcorne and anne vaux had retired and where he was certain to meet with a friendly reception and protection owen who was completely in his masters confidence agreed that no safer asylum could be found and they pursued their journey with so much ardour that early on the following night they arrived within a short distance of the mansion owen was sent forward to reconnoitre and returned in about half an hour with mr abingdon who embraced garnet and told him he was truly happy in being able to offer him a retreat and i think it will prove a secure one he added there are so many hidingplaces in the old house that if it is beset for a year you will scarcely be discovered have you heard of the fate of your confederates alas no my son replied garnet and i tremble to ask it it had better be told at once rejoined abingdon catesby percy and the two wrights have been slain in the defence of holbeach while rookwood grant and thomas winter all of whom were severely wounded in the siege have been made prisoners and are now on their way to the tower a fearful catalogue of ills exclaimed garnet it is not yet complete pursued abingdon sir everard digby has been defeated and made prisoner in an attempt to bring additional force to his friends and keyes has been arrested in warwickshire these are woful tidings truly my son returned garnet but heavens will be done he then dismissed his two attendants to whom he gave a sum of money together with the steeds and attended by nicholas owen repaired to the house with mr abingdon who admitted them through a secret door hendlip house which unfortunately for the lovers of picturesque and storied habitations was pulled down a few years ago having been latterly used as a ladies boardingschool was a large and irregular structure with walls of immense thickness tall stacks of chimneys turrets oriel windows and numberless projections contrived to mask the labyrinths and secret chambers within erected by john abingdon father of the proprietor at the period of this history and cofferer to queen elizabeth in the early part of the reign of that princess it was filled with secret staircases masked entrances trapdoors vaults subterranean passages secret recesses and every other description of hidingplace an immense gallery surrounded three sides of the entrancehall containing on each side a large chimneypiece surmounted by a shield displaying the arms of the familyargent a bend gules three eaglets displayed or behind each of these chimneypieces was a small cell or priestshole as it was termed contrived in the thickness of the wall throughout the mansion the chambers were so sombre and the passages so numerous and intricate that in the words of one who described it from personal observation the whole place presented a picture of gloom insecurity and suspicion standing on an elevated situation it commanded the country on all sides and could not be approached during the daytime without alarm being given to its inmates thomas abingdon the owner of the mansion at the period in question and the eldest son of its founder was born at thorpe near chertsey in surrey in he was educated at oxford and finished his studies at the universities of paris and rheims a man of considerable taste and learning but of a plotting disposition he became a willing tool of the jesuits and immediately on his return to england connected himself with the different conspiracies set on foot for the liberation of the imprisoned queen of scots for these offences he was imprisoned in the tower for the term of six years and only escaped death from the fact of his being the queens godson coupled with the estimation in which she had held his father on his liberation he remained perfectly tranquil till the accession of james when he became a secret plotter against that monarch his concealment of the two priests about to be related occasioned his being again sent to the tower and if it had not been for the intercession of lord mounteagle whose sister he had espoused he would have been executed he was pardoned on condition of never stirring beyond the precincts of worcestershire and he employed his retirement in compiling an account of the antiquities of that county which he left behind him in manuscript and of which doctor nash its more recent historian has largely availed himself with a habitation so contrived mr abingdon might fairly promise his guests a safe asylum conducting them along a secret passage to a chamber of which he alone possessed the key he left garnet within it and taking owen with him to another place of concealment returned shortly afterwards with anne vaux and father oldcorne the two priests tenderly embraced each other and oldcorne poured forth his tears on his superiors shoulder garnet next turned to anne vaux between whom and himself as has been before mentioned an affectionate intimacy subsisted and found her quite overcome by her feelings supper was now served to garnet by a confidential servant and after a few hours spent in conversation with his friends during which they discussed the disastrous issue of the affair and the probable fate of the conspirators they quitted him and he retired to restbut not before he had returned thanks to heaven for enabling him once more to lay down his head in safety on the following morning he was visited by mrs abingdon a lady of considerable personal attractions and anne vaux and when he had recovered from the fatigue of his journey and the anxieties he had recently undergone he experienced great delight in their society the chamber he occupied was lighted by a small loophole which enabled him to breathe the fresh air and gaze upon the surrounding country in this way nearly two months passed on during which though rigorous inquiries were made throughout the country no clue was found by the searchers to lead them to hendlip and the concealed parties began to indulge hopes that they should escape detection altogether being in constant correspondence with her brother lord mounteagle though she did not trust him with the important secret of the concealment of the priests mrs abingdon ascertained all that was done in reference to the conspirators whose trials were now approaching and communicated the intelligence to garnet on the morning of the th of january and when long quietude had bred complete fancied security in garnet anne vaux and mrs abingdon suddenly entered his chamber and with countenances of the utmost alarm informed him that mr abingdons confidential servant had just returned from worcester where his master then was and had brought word that topcliffe armed with a searchwarrant from the earl of salisbury had just passed through that city on his way to holt castle the residence of sir henry bromley it appears said mrs abingdon that humphrey littleton who has been apprehended and condemned to death at worcester for harbouring his brother and robert winter has sought to procure a remission of his sentence by betraying your retreat in consequence of this topcliffe has been sent down from london with a warrant addressed to sir henry bromley to aid him in searching hendlip my husband has given particular orders that you are to be removed to the most secure hidingplace without delay and he deeply regrets that he himself cannot return till evening for fear of exciting suspicion take me where you please daughter replied garnet who was thrown into great perturbation by the intelligence i thought myself prepared for any emergency but i was wofully deceived be not alarmed father said anne vaux in an encouraging tone let them search as long as they will they will never discover your retreat i have a strong presentiment to the contrary replied garnet at this moment oldcorne made his appearance and on learning the alarming news was as much dismayed as his superior after a short consultation and while the priests were putting aside every article necessary to be removed mrs abingdon proceeded to the gallery and contrived on some plausible pretext to send away the whole of the domestics from this part of the house this done she hastily returned and conducted the two priests to one of the large fireplaces a raised stone about two feet high occupied the inside of the chimney and upon it stood an immense pair of iron dogs obeying mrs abingdons directions garnet got upon the stone and setting his foot on the large iron knob on the left found a few projections in the masonry on the side up which he mounted and opening a small door made of planks of wood covered with bricks and coloured black so as not to be distinguishable from the walls of the chimney crept into a recess contrived in the thickness of the wall this cell was about two feet wide and four high and was connected with another chimney at the back by means of three or four small holes around its sides ran a narrow stone shelf just wide enough to afford an uncomfortable seat garnet was followed by oldcorne who brought with him a quantity of books vestments and sacred vessels used in the performance of the rites of the church of rome these articles which afterwards occasioned them much inconvenience they did not dare to leave behind having seen them safely bestowed mrs abingdon and her companion went in search of provisions and brought them a piece of cold meat and a pasty together with some bread dried fruit conserves and a flask of wine they did not dare to bring more for fear of exciting the suspicion of the household their next care was to conduct owen and oldcornes servant chambers to a similar retreat in one of the other chimneys and to provide them with a scanty supply of provisions and a flask of wine all this was accomplished without being noticed by any of the domestics as may be imagined a most anxious day was passed by all parties towards evening sir henry bromley the sheriff of the county accompanied by topcliffe and attended by a troop of soldiers appeared at the gates of the mansion and demanded admittance just at this moment mr abingdon rode up and affecting to know nothing of the matter saluted sir henry bromley with whom he was on terms of intimacy and inquired his business you are charged with harbouring two jesuit priests fathers garnet and oldcorne supposed to be connected with the late atrocious conspiracy against the king mr abingdon interposed topcliffe and i brought a warrant from the earl of salisbury which i have delivered to sir henry bromley commanding him to search your house for them i was loth to accept the office mr abingdon said sir henry bromley who was a handsome middleaged man but my duty to my sovereign allows me no alternative i trust though a catholic that you share my own detestation of this diabolical plot and would not shelter any of its contrivers or abettors you judge me rightly sir henry replied abingdon who meanwhile had received a private signal from his confidential servant that all was safe i would not i am just returned from worcester where i have been for the last two days enter my house i pray you and search every corner of it and if you find a jesuit priest concealed within it you shall hang me at my own gate you must be misinformed sir observed sir henry who was completely imposed upon by abingdons unconcerned demeanour they cannot be here trust me they are returned the other and i should like to take him at his word giving directions to the band to environ the house and guard all its approaches so as to prevent any one from escaping from it topcliffe took halfadozen men with him and instructed them how to act they first repaired to the great diningchamber where in accordance with the instructions received from the earl of salisbury topcliffe proceeded to the further end of the room and directed his men to break down the wainscot with some difficulty the order was obeyed and the entrance to a vault discovered into which topcliffe descended but he found nothing to repay his trouble returning to the diningchamber he questioned mr abingdon who secretly enjoyed his disappointment as to the use of the vault but the latter professed entire ignorance of its existence the searchers next proceeded to the cellar and bored the floors with a broach to a considerable depth to try whether there were any vaults beneath them but they made no discovery meanwhile topcliffe hurried upstairs and examined the size of the rooms to see whether they corresponded with those below and wherever any difference was observable he caused the panels to be pulled down and holes broken in the walls in this way several secret passages were discovered one of which led to the chamber lately occupied by garnet encouraged by this discovery the searchers continued their operations to a late hour when they desisted for the night on the following day they resumed their task and sir henry bromley took a general survey of the house both externally and internally noting the appearances outside and seeing that they corresponded with the rooms within the three extraordinary chimneypieces in the gallery attracted topcliffes attention but the contrivances within were so well managed that they escaped his notice he even got into the chimneys and examined the walls on either side but could detect nothing and lastly he ordered large fires to be lighted within them but the experiment proving fruitless he turned his attention elsewhere mr abingdon had attended him during this part of the search and though he preserved an unmoved exterior he was full of apprehension and was greatly relieved when it was abandoned in the course of the same day two other hidingplaces were found in the thickness of the walls but nothing was discovered within them in order to prevent any communication with the concealed persons topcliffe stationed a sentinel at the door of mr abingdons chamber and another at that of anne vaux on the third day the search was continued more rigorously than ever wainscots were taken down walls broken open the boards of the floor removed and other secret passages vaults and hidingplaces discovered some priests vestments and articles used in the romish service were found in one of these places and shown to mr abingdon he at first denied all knowledge of them but when topcliffe brought forward the titledeeds of his property which had been found in the same place he was obliged to confess he had put them there himself still though these discoveries had been made the searchers were as far from their aim as ever and sir henry bromley who began to despair of success would have departed on the fifth day if topcliffe had not prevented him i am certain they are here said the latter and have hit upon a plan which cannot fail to bring them forth the prisoners meanwhile suffered grievously from their confinement and hearing the searchers knocking against the walls and even within the chimney felt certain they should be discovered not being able to stand upright or to stretch themselves within the cell the sitting posture they were compelled to adopt became after a time intolerably irksome broths milk wine and other nutritious fluids were conveyed to them by means of a reed from the adjoining chimney but after the fifth day this supply was stopped as mrs abingdon and anne vaux were compelled by topcliffe to remove to a different part of the house they now began to experience all the horrors of starvation and debated whether they should die where they were or yield themselves up to their enemies wretched as their condition was however it was not so bad as that of their domestics owen and chambers whose wants had not been so carefully attended to and who were now reduced to the most deplorable state nor were their friends less uneasy aware that the captives whom there was no means of relieving for the searchers were constantly on the watch could not hold out much longer mrs abingdon consulted with her husband whether it would not be better to reveal their hidingplaces but this he would not permit by this time every secret chamber vault and passage in the place except the actual retreats of the conspirators had been discovered by topcliffe and though nothing material was found he felt assured from the uneasiness displayed by mr abingdon and his wife and above all by anne vaux that it could not be long before his perseverance was rewarded though he narrowly watched the two ladies from the first he could never detect them in the act of conveying food to the captives but feeling convinced that they did so he determined to remove them to a different part of the house and their unwillingness to obey the order confirmed his suspicions we are sure of our prey now he observed to sir henry bromley they must be halfstarved by this time and will speedily surrender themselves pray heaven they do so returned the other i am wearied to death with my long stay here have a few hours patience rejoined topcliffe and you will find that your time has not been thrown away and he was right soon after midnight a trooper who was watching in the gallery beheld two spectrallooking figures approach him and appalled by their ghastly appearance uttered a loud cry this brought topcliffe who was in the hall below to his aid and instantly perceiving what was the matter he ran towards the supposed phantoms and seized them the poor wretches who were no other than owen and chambers and were wellnigh famished offered no resistance but would neither confess where they had been hidden nor who they were as the trooper had not seen them come forth though he affirmed with a tremendous oath that they had issued from the floor the walls were again sounded but with no result food being placed before the captives they devoured it voraciously but topcliffe forbore to question them further that night feeling confident that he could extract the truth from them on the morrow either by promises or threats he was however mistaken they continued as obstinate as before and when confronted with mr abingdon denied all knowledge of him neither would they explain how they got into the house sir henry bromley however now considered himself justified in placing mr abingdon and his lady under arrest and topcliffe redoubled his exertions to discover the hidingplace of the two priests he examined every part of the gallery most carefullytook down one of the chimneypieces singularly enough it was the wrong one but was still unable to discover their retreat meanwhile the poor wretches inside found it impossible to endure their condition longer anything seemed preferable to the lingering and agonizing death they were now enduring and they resolved to delay their surrender no longer had they been able to hold out a few hours more they would have escaped for sir henry bromley was so fatigued with the search and so satisfied that nothing further would come of it that he resolved notwithstanding topcliffes efforts to dissuade him to depart on the morrow of this they were ignorant and having come to the determination to surrender garnet opened the entrance to the chimney and hearing voices below and being too feeble to get out unassisted he called to the speakers for aid his voice was so hollow and had such a sepulchral sound that those who heard it stared at each other in astonishment and affright who calls cried one of the troopers after a pause one of those you seek replied garnet come and help us forth upon hearing this and ascertaining whence the voice came from one of the men ran to fetch sir henry bromley and topcliffe both of whom joyfully obeyed the summons is it possible they can be in the chimney cried topcliffe why i myself have examined it twice we are here nevertheless replied garnet who heard the remark and if you would take us alive lose no time the hint was not lost upon topcliffe casting a triumphant look at bromley he seized a torch from one of his attendants and getting into the chimney soon perceived the entrance to the recess on beholding his prey he uttered an exclamation of joy and the two miserable captives seeing the savage and exulting grin that lighted up his features half repented the step they had taken it was now however too late and garnet begged him to help them out that i will readily do father replied topcliffe you have given us a world of trouble but you have made ample amends for it now had we been so minded you would never have found us rejoined garnet this cell would have been our sepulchre no doubt retorted topcliffe with a bitter laugh but a death on the scaffold is preferable to the horrors of starvation finding it impossible to remove garnet whose limbs were so cramped that they refused their office he called to the troopers below to bring a ladder which was placed in the chimney and then with some exertion he succeeded in getting him down this done he supported him towards sir henry bromley who was standing near a small table in the gallery illustration the discovery of garnet and oldcorne at hendlip i told you your time would not be thrown away sir henry he observed here is father garnet it is well you yielded yourself tonight father he added to garnet with his customary cynical chuckle for sir henry had resolved to depart tomorrow indeed groaned garnet help me to a chair while this was passing oldcorne was brought down by two of the troopers and the unfortunate priests were conveyed to an adjoining chamber where they were placed in a bed their stiffened limbs chafed and cordials administered to them they were reduced however to such extremity of weakness that it was not judged prudent to remove them till the third day when they together with their two servants owen and chambers who were as much enfeebled as themselves were conveyed to worcester chapter ix whitehall such was the expedition used by humphrey chetham and viviana that they accomplished the journey to london in an extraordinarily short space of time proceeding direct to whitehall viviana placed a letter in the hands of a halberdier and desired that it might be given without delay to the earl of salisbury after some demur the man handed it to an usher who promised to lay it before the earl some time elapsed before the result of its reception was known when an officer accompanied by two sergeants of the guard made his appearance and commanded viviana and her companion to follow him crossing a wide hall which was filled with the various retainers of the palace who regarded them with a sort of listless curiosity and ascending a flight of marble steps they traversed a long corridor and were at length ushered into the presence of the earl of salisbury he was seated at a table covered with a multitude of papers and was busily employed in writing a despatch but immediately stopped on their entrance he was not alone his companion was a middleaged man attired in a suit of black velvet with a cloak of the same material but as he sat with his back towards the door it was impossible to discern his features you may leave us said salisbury to the officer but remain without and be ready to enter at a moments notice added his companion without altering his position the officer bowed and retired with his followers your surrender of yourself at this time viviana radcliffe said the earl weighs much in your favour and if you are disposed freely to declare all you know of the conspiracy it is not impossible that the king may extend his mercy towards you i do not desire it my lord she replied in surrendering myself i have no other aim than to satisfy the laws i have outraged i do not seek to defend myself but i desire to offer an explanation to your lordship circumstances which it is needless to detail drew me into connexion with the conspirators and i became unwillingly the depositary of their dark design you were guilty of misprision of treason in not revealing it remarked the earl i am aware of it she rejoined but this i take heaven to witness is the extent of my criminality i held the project in the utmost abhorrence and used every argument i was mistress of to induce its contrivers to abandon it if such were the case demanded the earl what withheld you from disclosing it i will now confess what torture could not wring from me before she replied i was restrained from the disclosure by a fatal passion i suspected as much observed the earl with a sneer for whom for guy fawkes returned viviana gods mercy guy fawkes ejaculated the earls companion starting to his feet and turning as he spoke and facing her he disclosed heavy but not unintellectual features now charged with an expression of the utmost astonishment did you say guy fawkes mistress it is the king whispered humphrey chetham since i know in whose presence i stand sire replied viviana i will answer the interrogation guy fawkes was the cause of my concealing my acquaintance with the plot and more i will confess to your majesty that much as i abhor the design if he had not been a conspirator i should never have loved him his sombre and enthusiastic character first gave him an interest in my eyes which heightened by several important services which he rendered me soon ripened into love linked to his fortunes shrouded by the same gloomy cloud that enveloped him and bound by a chain from which i could not extricate myself i gave him my hand but the moment of our union was the moment of our separation we have not met since and shall meet no more unless to part for ever a strange history exclaimed james in a tone that showed he was not unmoved by the relation i beseech your majesty to grant me one boon cried viviana falling at his feet it is to be allowed a single interview with my husbandnot for the sad gratification of beholding him againnot for the indulgence of my private sorrowsbut that i may endeavour to awaken a feeling of repentance in his breast and be the means of saving his soul alive my inclinations prompt me to grant the request salisbury said the king irresolutely there can be no risk in doing iteh not under certain restrictions my liege replied the earl you shall have your wish then mistress said james and i trust your efforts may be crowned with success your husband is a hardy traitora second jacques clementand we never think of him without the floor shaking beneath our feet and a horrible smell of gunpowder assailing our nostrils blessed be god for our preservation but whom have we here he added turning to humphrey chetham another conspirator come to surrender himself no my liege replied chetham i am a loyal subject of your majesty and a stanch protestant if we may take your word for it doubtless replied the king with an incredulous look but how come you in this ladys company i will hide nothing from your majesty replied chetham long before vivianas unhappy acquaintance with fawkesfor such i must ever consider itmy affections had been fixed upon her and i fondly trusted she would not prove indifferent to my suit even now sire when all hope is dead within me i have not been able to overcome my passion but love her as devotedly as ever when therefore she desired my escort to london to surrender herself i could not refuse the request it is the truth my liege added viviana i owe humphrey chetham for so this gentleman is named an endless debt of gratitude and not the least of my present distresses is the thought of the affliction i have occasioned him dismiss it from your mind then viviana rejoined chetham it will not mitigate my sorrows to feel that i have added to yours your manner and looks seem to give a warranty for loyalty young sir said the king but i must have some assurance of the truth of your statement before you are set at large i am your willing prisoner my liege returned chetham but i have a letter for the earl of salisbury which may vouch perhaps for me and as he spoke he placed a letter in the earls hands who broke open the seal and hastily glanced at its contents it is from doctor dee he said from whom as your majesty is aware we have received much important information relative to this atrocious design he answers for this young mans loyalty i am glad to hear it rejoined the king it would have been mortifying to be deceived by so honest a physiognomy your majesty will be pleased to attach your signature to this warrant for viviana radcliffes committal to the tower said salisbury placing a paper before him james complied and the earl summoned the guard have i your majestys permission to attend this unfortunate lady to the fortress cried chetham prostrating himself before the king james hesitated but glancing at the earl and reading no objection in his looks he assented whispering some private instructions to the officer respecting chetham salisbury delivered the warrant to him viviana and her companion were then removed to a small chamber adjoining the guardroom where they remained for nearly an hour at the expiration of which time the officer again appeared and conducted them to the palacestairs where a large wherry awaited them in which they embarked james did not remain long with his councillor and as soon as he had retired salisbury summoned a confidential attendant and told him to acquaint lord mounteagle who was in an adjoining apartment that he was now able to receive him the attendant departed and presently returned with the nobleman in question as soon as they were alone and salisbury had satisfied himself they could not be overheard he observed to the other since treshams committal to the tower yesterday i have received a letter from the lieutenant stating that he breathes nothing but revenge against yourself and me and threatens to betray us if he is not released it will not do to let him be examined by the council for though we can throw utter discredit on his statement it may be prejudicial to my future designs true my lord replied mounteagle but how do you propose to silence him by poison returned salisbury there is a trusty fellow in the tower a jailer named ipgreve who will administer it to him here is the powder he added unlocking a coffer and taking out a small packet it was given me by its compounder doctor dee it is the same i am assured as the celebrated italian poison prepared by pope alexander the sixth is without scent or taste and destroys its victim without leaving a trace of its effects i must take heed how i offend your lordship observed mounteagle nay rejoined salisbury with a ghastly smile it is for traitors like tresham not true men like you to fear me i understand the distinction my lord replied the other i must intrust the entire management of this affair to you pursued salisbury to me exclaimed mounteagle tresham is my brotherinlaw i can take no part in his murder if he lives you are ruined rejoined salisbury coldly you must sacrifice him or yourself but i see you are reasonable take this powder and proceed to the tower see ipgreve alone and instruct him to drug treshams wine with it a hundred marks shall be his reward when the deed is done my soul revolts from the deed said mounteagle as he took the packet is there no other way of silencing him none whatever replied salisbury sternly his blood be upon his own head with this mounteagle took his departure chapter x the parting of viviana and humphrey chetham humphrey chetham was so oppressed by the idea of parting with viviana that he did not utter a single word during their transit to the tower passing beneath the gloomy archway of traitors gate they mounted the fatal steps and were conducted to the guardroom near the byward tower the officer then despatched one of the warders to inform the lieutenant of vivianas arrival and telling humphrey chetham he would allow him a few minutes to take leave of her considerately withdrew and left them alone together oh viviana exclaimed chetham unable to repress his grief my heart bleeds to see you here if you repent the step you have taken and desire freedom say so and i will use every effort to liberate you i have been successful once and may be so again i thank you for your devotion she replied in a tone of profound gratitude but you have rendered me the last service i shall ever require of you i deeply deplore the misery i have occasioned you and regret my inability to requite your attachment as it deserves to be requited my last prayers shall be for your happiness and i trust you will meet with some being worthy of you and who will make amends for my insensibility be not deceived viviana replied chetham in a broken voice i shall never love again your image is too deeply imprinted upon my heart ever to be effaced time may work a change she rejoined though i ought not to say so for i feel it would work none in me suffer me to give you one piece of counsel devote yourself resolutely to the business of life and you will speedily regain your peace of mind i will follow your instructions implicitly replied chetham but have little hope of the result you promise me let the effort be made she rejoinedand now promise me to quit london tomorrow return to your native town employ yourself in your former occupations and strive not to think of the past except as a troubled dream from which you have fortunately awakened do not let us prolong our parting or your resolution may waver farewell so saying she extended her hand towards him and he pressed it passionately to his lips farewell viviana he cried with a look of unutterable anguish may heaven support you in your trials one of them i am now enduring she replied in a broken voice farewell for ever and may all good angels bless you at this moment the officer appeared and announcing the approach of the lieutenant told chetham that his time had expired without hazarding another look at viviana the young merchant tore himself away and followed the officer out of the tower obedient to vivianas last request he quitted london on the following day and acting upon her advice devoted himself on his return to manchester sedulously to his mercantile pursuits his perseverance and integrity were crowned with entire success and he became in due season the wealthiest merchant of the town but the blighting of his early affections tinged his whole life and gave a melancholy to his thoughts and an austerity to his manner originally foreign to them true to his promise he died unmarried his long and worthy career was marked by actions of the greatest benevolence in proportion as his means increased his charities were extended and he truly became a father to the fatherless and the destitute to him the town of manchester is indebted for the noble library and hospital bearing his name and for these admirable institutions by which they so largely benefit his memory must ever be held in veneration by its inhabitants chapter xi the subterranean dungeon regarding viviana with a smile of savage satisfaction sir william waad commanded jasper ipgreve who accompanied him to convey her to one of the subterranean dungeons below the devereux tower she cannot escape thence without your connivance he said and you shall answer to me for her safe custody with your life if she escapes again your worship shall hang me in her stead rejoined ipgreve my instructions from the earl of salisbury state that it is the kings pleasure that she be allowed a short interview with guy fawkes said the lieutenant in a low tone let her be taken to his cell tomorrow the jailer bowed and motioning the guard to follow him with viviana he led the way along the inner ward till he arrived at a small strong door in the wall a little to the north of the beauchamp tower which he unlocked and descended into a low cavernouslooking vault striking a light and setting fire to a torch he then led the way along a narrow gloomy passage which brought them to a circular chamber from which other passages diverged and selecting one of them threaded it till he came to the door of a cell here is your dungeon he said to viviana as he drew back the heavy bolts and disclosed a small chamber about four feet wide and six long in which there was a pallet my dame will attend you soon with this he lighted a lamp and departing with the guard barred the door outside viviana shuddered as she surveyed the narrow dungeon in which she was placed roof walls and floor were of stone and the aspect of the place was so dismal and tomblike that she felt as if she were buried alive some hours elapsed before dame ipgreve made her appearance she was accompanied by ruth who burst into tears on beholding viviana the jailers wife had brought a few blankets and other necessaries with her together with a loaf of bread and a jug of water while disposing the blankets on the couch she never ceased upbraiding viviana for her former flight poor ruth who was compelled to assist her mother endeavoured by her gestures and looks to convey to the unfortunate captive that she was as much devoted to her as ever their task completed the old woman withdrew and her daughter casting a deeplycommiserating look at viviana followed her and the door was barred without determined not to yield to despondency viviana knelt down and addressed herself to heaven and comforted by her prayers threw herself on the bed and sank into a peaceful slumber she was awakened by hearing the bolts of her cell withdrawn and the next moment ruth stood before her i fear you have exposed yourself to great risk in thus visiting me said viviana tenderly embracing her i would expose myself to any risk for you sweet lady replied ruth but oh why do i see you here again the chief support of guy fawkes during his sufferings has been the thought that you were at liberty i surrendered myself in the hope of beholding him again rejoined viviana you have given a fond but fatal proof of your affection returned ruth the knowledge that you are a captive will afflict him more than all the torments he has endured what torments has he endured ruth inquired viviana with a look of anguish do not ask me to repeat them replied the jailers daughter they are too dreadful to relate when you behold his shattered frame and altered looks you will comprehend what he has undergone alas exclaimed viviana bursting into tears i almost fear to behold him you must prepare for a fearful shock returned ruth and now madam i must take my leave i will endeavour to see you again tomorrow but dare not promise to do so i should not have been able to visit you now but that my father is engaged with lord mounteagle with lord mounteagle cried viviana upon what business upon a foul business rejoined ruth no less than the destruction of mr tresham who is now a prisoner in the tower lord mounteagle came to the well tower this evening and i accidentally overheard him propose to my father to administer poison to the person i have named i do not pity their victim returned viviana he is a doubledyed traitor and will meet with the fate he deserves farewell madam said ruth if i do not see you again you will know that you have one friend in this fortress who deeply sympathizes with your afflictions so saying she withdrew and viviana heard the bolts slipped gently into their sockets vainly after ruths visit did she try to compose herself sleep fled her eyes and she was haunted all night by the image of fawkes haggard and shattered by torture as he had been described by the jailers daughter day and night were the same to her and she could only compute progress of the time by her own feelings judging by which she supposed it to be late in the day when she was again visited the bolts of her cell being withdrawn two men clad in long black gowns and having hoods drawn over their faces entered it they were followed by ipgreve and viviana concluding she was about to be led to the torture endeavoured to string herself to its endurance though he guessed what was passing in her breast jasper ipgreve did not care to undeceive her but motioning the hooded officials to follow him with her quitted the cell seizing each a hand the attendants led her after him along a number of intricate passages until he stopped before the door of a cell which he opened be brief in what you have to say he cried thrusting her forward i shall not allow you much time viviana no sooner set foot in the cell than she felt in whose presence she stood on a stool at the further end of the narrow chamber with his head upon his breast and a cloak wrapped around his limbs sat fawkes a small iron lamp suspended by a rusty chain from the ceiling served to illumine his ghastly features he lifted his eyes from the ground on her entrance and recognising her uttered a cry of anguish raising himself by a great effort he opened his arms and she rushed into them for some moments both continued silent grief took away their utterance but at length guy fawkes spoke my cup of bitterness was not sufficiently full he said this alone was wanting to make it overflow i fear you will blame me she replied when you learn that i have voluntarily surrendered myself guy fawkes uttered a deep groan i am the cause of your doing so he said you are so she replied but you will forgive me when you know my motive i came here to urge you to repentance oh if you hope that we shall meet again hereafterif you hope that we shall inherit joys which will requite us for all our troubles you will employ the brief time left you on earth in imploring forgiveness for your evil intentions having had no evil intentions replied fawkes coldly i have no pardon to ask the tempter who led you into the commission of sin under the semblance of righteousness puts these thoughts into your heart replied viviana you have escaped the commission of an offence which must have deprived you of the joys of heaven and i am thankful for it but if you remain impenitent i shall tremble for your salvation my account will soon be settled with my maker rejoined fawkes and he will punish or reward me according to my deserts i have acted according to my conscience and can never repent that which i believe to be a righteous design but do you not now see that you were mistaken returned vivianado you not perceive that the sword which you raised against others has been turned against yourselfand that the great power whom you serve and worship has declared himself against you you seek in vain to move me replied fawkes i am as insensible to your arguments as to the tortures of my enemies then heaven have mercy upon your soul she rejoined look at me viviana cried fawkes and behold the wreck i am what has supported me amid my torturesin this dungeonin the presence of my relentless foeswhat but the consciousness of having acted rightly and what will support me on the scaffold except the same conviction if you love me do not seek to shake my faith but it is idle to talk thus you cannot do so rest satisfied we shall meet again everything assures me of it wretched as i appear in this solitary cell i am not wholly miserable because i am buoyed up by the certainty that my actions are approved by heaven i will not attempt to destroy the delusion since it is productive of happiness to you replied viviana but if my earnest heartfelt prayers can conduce to your salvation they shall not be wanting as she spoke the door of the cell was opened by jasper ipgreve who stepped towards her and seized her roughly by the hand your time has expired mistress he said you must come with me a minute longer implored fawkes not a second replied ipgreve shall we not meet again cried viviana distractedly ay the day before your execution rejoined ipgreve i have good news for you he added pausing for a moment and addressing fawkes mr tresham who i told you has been brought to the tower has been taken suddenly and dangerously ill if the traitor perishes before me i shall die content observed fawkes then rest assured of it said viviana the task of vengeance is already fulfilled she was then forced away by ipgreve and delivered by him to the hooded officials outside who hurried her back to her dungeon chapter xii the traitor betrayed lord mounteagle arrived at the tower shortly after viviana and repairing at once to the lieutenants lodgings had a brief conference with him and informed him that he had a secret order to deliver to jasper ipgreve from the earl of salisbury touching the conspirators sir william waad would have summoned the jailer but mounteagle preferred visiting him at the well tower and accordingly proceeded thither he found ipgreve with his wife and daughter and telling him he desired a moments private speech with him the jailer dismissed them suspecting that the newcomers errand related in some way to viviana ruth contrived to place herself in such a situation that she could overhear what passed a moments scrutiny of jaspers villanous countenance satisfied mounteagle that the earl of salisbury was not mistaken in his man and as soon as he supposed they were alone he unhesitatingly opened his plan to him as he expected jasper exhibited no reluctance to undertake it and after some further discussion it was agreed to put it in execution without delay the sooner mr tresham is silenced the better said jasper for he threatens to make disclosures to the council that will bring some noble persons with a significant look at mounteagle into trouble where is he confined demanded the other in the beauchamp tower replied ipgreve i will visit him at once said mounteagle and when i have conferred with him will call for wine bring two goblets and in that which you give to tresham place this powder ipgreve nodded assent and with a grim smile took the packet shortly after this they quitted the well tower together and passing under the archway of the bloody tower crossed the green and entered the fortification in which the traitor was confined tresham was treated with far greater consideration than the other conspirators being allowed the use of the large room on the upper floor of the beauchamp tower which was seldom allotted to any persons except those of the highest distinction when they entered he was pacing to and fro within his chamber in great agitation but he immediately stopped on seeing mounteagle and rushed towards him you bring me my liberation he said it is impossible to effect it at present returned the other but make yourself perfectly easy your confinement will not be of long duration i will not be trifled with cried tresham furiously if i am examined by the council look to yourselves as i hope for salvation the truth shall out leave us said mounteagle with a significant look at the jailer who quitted the chamber harke mounteagle said tresham as soon as they were alone i have been your tool thus far but if you propose to lead me blindfold to the scaffold you are greatly mistaken you think that you have me safe within these walls that my voice cannot be heard and that i cannot betray you but you are deceivedfearfully deceived as you will find i have your lettersthe earl of salisburys letters proving that you were both aware of the plotand that you employed me to watch its progress and report it to you i have also letters from doctor dee the warden of manchester detailing his acquaintance with the conspiracy and containing descriptions of the persons of fawkes and catesby which i showed to the earl of salisburythese letters are now in my possession and i will deliver them to the council if i am not released deliver them to me and i swear to you you shall be set free said mounteagle i will not trust you rejoined tresham liberate me and they are yours but i will not rob myself of vengeance i will confound you and the false earl of salisbury you wrong us both by your unjust suspicions said mounteagle wrong you echoed tresham contemptuously where is my promised reward why am i in this dungeon why am i treated like a traitor if you meant me fairly i should not be here but like yourself at liberty and in the enjoyment of the kings favour but you have duped me villain and shall rue it if i am led to the scaffold it shall be in your company compose yourself rejoined mounteagle calmly appearances i own are against us but circumstances render it imperatively necessary that the earl of salisbury should appear to act against you you have been charged by guy fawkes when under the torture of being a confederate in the design and your arrest could not be avoided i am come hither to give you a solemn assurance that no harm shall befal you but that you shall be delivered from your thraldom in a few daysperhaps in a few hours you have no further design against me said tresham suspiciously what motive could i have in coming hither except to set your mind at rest rejoined mounteagle and i shall receive my reward demanded tresham you will receive your reward returned mounteagle with significant emphasis i swear it so make yourself easy if i thought i might trust you i should not heed my imprisonment irksome though it be rejoined tresham it cannot be avoided for the reasons i have just stated replied mounteagle but come no more despondency all will be well with you speedily let us drown care in a bumper what ho jailer he added opening the door a cup of wine in a few minutes ipgreve made his appearance bearing two goblets filled with wine on a salver one of which he presented to mounteagle and the other to tresham here is to your speedy deliverance from captivity said mounteagle draining the goblet you will not refuse that pledge tresham of a surety not replied the other to my speedy deliverance and he emptied the cup while mounteagle and the jailer exchanged significant glances and now having fully discharged my errand i must bid you farewell said mounteagle you will not forget your promise observed tresham assuredly not replied the other a week hence and you will make no complaint against meare you sure you did not give me the wrong goblet he added to ipgreve as they descended the spiral staircase quite sure my lord returned the jailer with a grim smile mounteagle immediately quitted the tower and hastening to whitehall sought out the earl of salisbury to whom he related what he had done the earl complimented him on his skilful management of the matter and congratulating each other upon having got rid of a dangerous and now useless instrument they separated on the following day tresham was seized with a sudden illness and making known his symptoms to ipgreve the chirurgeon who attended the prison was sent for and on seeing him pronounced him dangerously ill though he was at a loss to explain the nature of his disorder every hour the sick man grew worse and he was torn with racking pains connecting his sudden seizure with the visit of lord mounteagle an idea of the truth flashed upon him and he mentioned his suspicions to the chirurgeon charging jasper ipgreve with being accessory to the deed the jailer stoutly denied the accusation and charged the prisoner in his turn with making a malicious statement to bring him into discredit i will soon test the truth of his assertion observed the chirurgeon taking a small flat piece of the purest gold from his doublet place this in your mouth tresham obeyed and ipgreve watched the experiment with gloomy curiosity you are a dead man said the chirurgeon to tresham as he drew forth the piece of gold and perceived that it was slightly tarnished poison has been administered to you is there no remedyno counterpoison demanded tresham eagerly the chirurgeon shook his head then let the lieutenant be summoned said tresham i have an important confession to make to him i charge this man pointing to the jailer with giving poisoned wine to me do you hear what i say to you i do replied the chirurgeon but he will never reveal it said ipgreve with great unconcern i have a warrant from the earl of salisbury for what i have done what cried tresham can murder be committed here with impunity you have to thank your own indiscretion for what has happened rejoined ipgreve had you kept a close tongue in your head you would have been safe can nothing be done to save me cried the miserable man with an imploring look at the chirurgeon nothing whatever replied the person appealed to i would advise you to recommend your soul to god will you not inform the lieutenant that i desire to speak with him demanded tresham the chirurgeon glanced at ipgreve and receiving a sign from him gave a promise to that effect they then quitted the cell together leaving tresham in a state of indescribable agony both of mind and body half an hour afterwards the chirurgeon returned and informed him that the lieutenant refused to visit him or to hear his confession and wholly discredited the fact of his being poisoned i will take charge of your papers if you choose to commit them to me he said and will lay them before the council no replied tresham while life remains to me i will never part with them i have brought you a mixture which though it cannot heal you will at least allay your sufferings said the chirurgeon i will not take it groaned tresham i distrust you as much as the others i will leave it with you at all events rejoined the chirurgeon setting down the phial the noise of the bolts shot into their sockets sounded to tresham as if his tomb were closed upon him and he uttered a cry of anguish he would have laid violent hands upon himself and accelerated his own end but he wanted courage to do so and continued to pace backwards and forwards across his chamber as long as his strength lasted he was about to throw himself on the couch from which he never expected to rise again when his eyes fell upon the phial what if it should be poison he said it will end my sufferings the sooner and placing it to his lips he swallowed its contents as the chirurgeon had foretold it alleviated his sufferings and throwing himself on the bed he sank into a troubled slumber during which he dreamed that catesby appeared to him with a vengeful countenance and tried to drag him into a fathomless abyss that yawned beneath their feet shrieking with agony he awoke and found two persons standing by his couch one of them was the jailer and the other appeared from his garb to be a priest but a hood was drawn over his head so as to conceal his features are you come to witness my dying pangs or to finish me demanded tresham of the jailer i am come for neither purpose replied ipgreve i pity your condition and have brought you a priest of your own faith who like yourself is a prisoner in the tower i will leave him with you but he cannot remain long so make the most of your time and with these words he retired when he was gone the supposed priest who spoke in feeble and faltering accents desired to hear treshams confession and having listened to it gave him absolution the wretched man then drew from his bosom a small packet and offered it to the confessor who eagerly received it this contains the letters of the earl of salisbury and lord mounteagle which i have just mentioned he said i pray you lay them before the privy council i will not fail to do so replied the confessor and reciting the prayer for one in extremis over the dying man he departed i have obtained the letters from him said mounteagle throwing back his hood as he quitted the chamber and addressing the jailer and now you need give yourself no further concern about him he will be dead before morning jasper ipgreve locked the door upon the prisoner and proceeded to the well tower when he returned he found mounteagles words had come to pass tresham was lying on the floor quite deadhis collapsed frame and distorted countenance showing the agonies in which he must have expired chapter xiii the trial the trial of the conspirators which had been delayed in order that full evidence might be procured against them was at length appointed to take place in westminster hall on monday the th of january early on the morning of this day the eight surviving confederates garnet and oldcorne being at this time secreted at hendlip were conveyed in two large covered wherries from the fortress to the place of trial in spite of the severity of the weatherit was snowing heavily and the river was covered with sheets of icethey were attended by a vast number of boats filled with persons anxious to obtain a sight of them such was the abhorrence in which the actors in the conspiracy were held by the populace that not content with menaces and execrations many of these persons hurled missiles against the wherries and would have proceeded to further violence if they had not been restrained by the pikemen when the prisoners landed a tremendous and fearful shout was raised by the mob stationed at the head of the stairs and it required the utmost efforts of the guard to protect them from injury two lines of soldiers with calivers on their shoulders were drawn out from the banks of the river to the entrance of the hall and between them the conspirators marched the melancholy procession was headed by sir william waad who was followed by an officer of the guard and six halberdiers then came the executioner carrying the gleaming implement of death with its edge turned from the prisoners he was followed by sir everard digby whose noble figure and handsome countenance excited much sympathy among the beholders and ambrose rookwood next came the two winters both of whom appeared greatly dejected next john grant and robert batescatesbys servant who had been captured at holbeach and lastly keyes and fawkes bitterly and justly incensed as were the multitude against the conspirators their feelings underwent some change as they beheld the haggard countenance and shattered frame of guy fawkes it was soon understood that he was the individual who had been found in the vault near the parliament house with the touchwood and matches in his belt ready to fire the train and the greatest curiosity was exhibited to see him just as the foremost of the conspirators reached the entrance of the hall a terrific yell resembling nothing human except the roar of a thousand tigers thirsting for blood was uttered by the mob and a tremendous but ineffectual attempt was made to break through the lines of the guard never before had so large an assemblage been collected on the spot the whole of the space extending on one hand from westminster hall to the gates of whitehall and on the other to the abbey was filled with spectators and every roof window and buttress was occupied nor was the interior of the hall less crowded not an inch of room was unoccupied and it was afterwards complained in parliament that the members of the house had been so pressed and incommoded that they could not hear what was said at the arraignment the conspirators were first conveyed to the court of the starchamber where they remained till the lords commissioners had arrived and taken their seats the commissioners were the earl of nottingham lord high admiral of england the earl of suffolk steward of the household the earl of worcester master of the horse the earl of devonshire master of the ordnance the earl of northampton warden of the cinqueports the earl of salisbury principal secretary of state sir john popham lord chief justice sir thomas fleming lord chief baron of the exchequer and sir thomas walmisley and sir peter warburton knights and both justices of the common pleas summoned by an usher the conspirators were conducted to a platform covered with black cloth which had been erected at the lower end of the hall a murmur of indignation vainly sought to be repressed by the grave looks of the commissioners burst from the immense assemblage as they one by one ascended the steps of the platform guy fawkes was the last to mount and his appearance was followed by a deep groan supporting himself against the rail of the scaffold he surveyed the assemblage with a stern and undaunted look as he gazed around he could not help marvelling at the vast multitude before him the whole of the peers and all the members of the house of commons were present while in a box on the left though screened by a lattice sat the queen and prince henry and in another on the right and protected in the same way the king and his courtiers silence being peremptorily commanded the indictment was read wherein the prisoners were charged with conspiring to blow up the king and the peers with gunpowder and with attempting to incite the papists and other persons to open rebellion to which all the conspirators to the no small surprise of those who heard them and were aware that they had subscribed their confessions pleaded not guilty how sir cried the lord chief justice in a stern tone to fawkes with what face can you pretend to deny the indictment when you were actually taken in the cellar with the powder and have already confessed your treasonable intentions i do not mean to deny what i have confessed my lord replied fawkes but this indictment contains many matters which i neither can nor will countenance by assent or silence and i therefore deny it it is well replied the lord chief justice let the trial proceed the indictment being opened by sir edward philips sergeantatlaw he was followed by sir edward coke the attorneygeneral who in an eloquent and elaborate speech which produced an extraordinary effect upon the assemblage expatiated upon the monstrous nature of the plot which he characterised as the greatest treason that ever was plotted in england and against the greatest king that ever reigned in england and after narrating the origin and progress of the conspiracy concluded by desiring that the confessions of the prisoners should be openly read this done the jury were ordered by the lord chief justice to retire and the injunction being obeyed they almost instantly returned with a verdict of guilty a deep dread silence then prevailed throughout the hall and every eye was bent upon the conspirators all of whom maintained a composed demeanour they were then questioned by the lord chief justice whether they had anything to say why judgment of death should not be pronounced against them all i have to crave of your lordships said thomas winter is that being the chief offender of the two i may die for my brother and myself and i ask only that my brothers request may not be granted said robert winter if he is condemned i do not desire to live i have nothing to solicitnot even pardon said keyes carelessly my fortunes were always desperate and are better now than they have ever been i desire mercy said rookwood not from any fear of death but because so shameful an ending will leave a perpetual stain upon my name and blood i humbly submit myself to the king and pray him to imitate our supreme judge who sometimes punishes corporally but not mortally i have been guilty of a conspiracy intended but never effected said john grant and solicit forgiveness on that plea my crime has been fidelity to my master said bates if the king will let me live i will serve him as faithfully as i did mr catesby i would not utter a word said fawkes looking sternly round if i did not fear my silence might be misinterpreted i would not accept a pardon if it were offered me i regard the project as a glorious one and only lament its failure silence the vile traitor said the earl of salisbury rising and as he spoke two halberdiers sprang up the steps of the scaffold and placing themselves on either side of fawkes prepared to gag him i have done he said contemptuously regarding them i have nothing to say save this said sir everard digby bowing to the judges if any of your lordships will tell me you forgive me i shall go more cheerfully to the scaffold heaven forgive you sir everard said the earl of nottingham returning his reverence as we do i humbly thank your lordship replied digby sentence was then passed upon the prisoners by lord chief justice popham and they were removed from the platform as they issued from the hall and it became known to the assemblage without that they were condemned a shout of fierce exultation rent the air and they were so violently assailed on all sides that they had great difficulty in reaching the wherries the guard however succeeded at length in accomplishing their embarkation and they were conveyed back in safety to the tower chapter xiv the last meeting of fawkes and viviana up to this time viviana had not been allowed another interview with guy fawkes she was twice interrogated by the privycouncil but having confessed all she knew of the conspiracy excepting what might implicate garnet and oldcorne neither of whom she was aware had been apprehended she was not again subjected to the torture her health however rapidly sank under her confinement and she was soon reduced to such an extreme state of debility that she could not leave her bed the chirurgeon having been called in by dame ipgreve to attend her reported her condition to sir william waad who directed that every means should be adopted for her restoration and that ruth ipgreve should remain in constant attendance upon her ascertaining all particulars relative to guy fawkes from the jailers daughter it was a sad satisfaction to viviana to learn that he spent his whole time in devotion and appeared completely resigned to his fate it had been the earl of salisburys purpose to bring viviana to trial at the same time as the rest of the conspirators but the chirurgeon reporting that her removal at this juncture would be attended with fatal consequences he was compelled to defer it when the result of the trial was made known to viviana by ruth though she had anticipated the condemnation of guy fawkes she swooned away and on her recovery observed to ruth who was greatly alarmed at her looks i feel i am going fast i should wish to see my husband once more before i die i fear it is impossible madam replied ruth but i will try to accomplish it do so rejoined viviana and my blessing shall rest ever on your head have you any valuable inquired ruth my heart bleeds to make the demand at such a moment but it is the only way to produce an effect on the avaricious nature of my father i have nothing but this golden crucifix said viviana and i meant to give it to you it will be better employed in this way rejoined ruth taking it from her quitting the cell she hurried to the well tower and found her father who had just returned from locking up the conspirators in their different dungeons sitting down to his evening meal what is the matter with the wench he cried staring at her you look quite distracted is viviana radcliffe dead no but she is dying replied ruth if that is the case i must go to her directly observed dame ipgreve she may have some valuable about her which i must secure you will be disappointed mother rejoined ruth with a look of irrepressible disgust she has nothing valuable left but this golden crucifix which she has sent to my father on condition of his allowing guy fawkes to see her before she dies give it me wench cried jasper ipgreve and let her die in peace she will not die in peace unless she sees him replied ruth nor shall you have it if you do not comply with her request how exclaimed her father do you dare think not to terrify me father interrupted ruth i am resolute in this hear me she cried seizing his arm and fixing a look upon him that seemed to pierce his soulhear me she said in a tone so low as to be inaudible to her mother she shall see him or i will denounce you as the murderer of tresham now will you comply give me the cross said ipgreve not till you have earned it replied his daughter well well he rejoined if it must be it must but i may get into trouble in the matter i must consult master forsett the gentleman jailer who has the charge of guy fawkes before i dare take him to her cell consult whom you please rejoined ruth impatiently but lose no time or you will be too late muttering imprecations on his daughter ipgreve left the well tower and ruth hurried back to viviana whom she found anxiously expecting her and related to her what she had done oh that i may hold out till he comes cried viviana but my strength is failing fast ruth endeavoured to comfort her but she was unequal to the effort and bursting into tears knelt down and wept upon the pillow beside her half an hour had now elapsed it seemed an age to the poor sufferers and still the jailer came not and even ruth had given up all hope when a heavy tread was heard in the passage the door was opened and guy fawkes appeared attended by ipgreve and forsett we will not interrupt your parting said forsett who seemed to have a touch of humanity in his composition and beckoning to ruth to follow him he quitted the cell with ipgreve guy fawkes meanwhile had approached the couch and gazed with an expression of intense anguish at viviana she returned his glance with a look of the utmost affection and clasped his hand between her thin fingers i am now standing on the brink of eternity she said in a solemn tone and i entreat you earnestly as you hope to insure our meeting hereafter to employ the few days left you in sincere and hearty repentance you have sinnedsinned deeply but not beyond the power of redemption let me feel that i have saved you and my last moments will be happy oh by the love i have borne youby the pangs i have endured for youby the death i am now dying for youlet me implore you not to lose one moment but to supplicate a merciful providence to pardon your offence illustration death of viviana i willi will rejoined fawkes in broken accents you have opened my eyes to my error and i sincerely repent it saved saved cried viviana raising herself in the bed opening her arms she strained him to her bosom and for a few moments they mingled their tears together and now she said sinking backwards kneel by mepray for forgivenesspray audibly and i will join in your prayer guy fawkes knelt by the bedside and addressed the most earnest supplications to heaven for forgiveness for a while he heard vivianas gentle accents accompany him they grew fainter and fainter until at last they totally ceased filled with a dreadful apprehension he sprang to his feet an angelic smile illumined her countenance her gaze was fixed on him for one momentit then grew dim and dimmer until it was extinguished guy fawkes uttered a cry of the wildest despair and fell to the ground alarmed by the sound forsett and ipgreve who were standing outside rushed into the cell and instantly raised him but he was now in a state of distraction and for the moment seemed endowed with all his former strength striving to break from them he cried in a tone of the most piercing anguish you shall not tear me from her i will die with her let me go i say or i will dash out my brains against these flinty walls and balk you of your prey but his struggles were in vain they held him fast and calling for further assistance conveyed him to his cell where fearing he might do some violence to himself they placed him in irons ruth entered the cell as soon as fawkes and the others had quitted it and performed the last sad offices for the departed alternately praying and weeping she watched by the body during the whole of the night on the following day the remains of the unfortunate viviana were interred in the chapel of saint peter on the green and the sole mourner was the jailers daughter peace be with her cried ruth as she turned away from the grave her sorrows at last are over chapter xv saint pauls churchyard guy fawkes was for some time wholly inconsolable his stoical nature seemed completely subdued and he wept like an infant by degrees however the violence of his grief abated and calling to mind the last injunctions of her whose loss he mourned he addressed himself to prayer and acknowledging his guilt besought her intercession with heaven for his forgiveness it will not seem strange when his superstitious character is taken into consideration that he should fancy he received an immediate proof that his prayers were heard to his excited imagination it appeared that a soft unearthly strain of music floated in the air over his head that an odour like that of paradise filled his cell while an invisible finger touched his brow while in this entranced state he was utterly insensible to his present miserable situation and he seemed to have a foretaste of celestial happiness he did not however desist from prayer but continued his supplications throughout the day on that night he was visited by the lieutenant who announced to him that the execution of four of the conspirators was fixed for thursday it was then tuesday while his own and that of the three others would not take place till the following day as you are the greatest traitor of all your execution will be reserved to the last pursued waad no part of the sentence will be omitted you will be dragged to old palace yard over against the scene of your intended bloody and damnable action at a horses tail and will be there turned off the gallows and hanged but not till you are dead you will then be embowelled your vile heart which conceived this atrocious design will be torn beating from your breast and your quarters will be placed on the palace gates as an abhorrent spectacle in the eyes of men and a terrible proof of the kings just vengeance guy fawkes heard the recapitulation of his dreadful sentence unmoved the sole mercy i would have craved of his majesty would have been permission to die first he said but heavens will be done i deserve my doom what is your stubborn nature at length subdued cried the lieutenant in surprise do you repent of your offence deeply and heartily returned fawkes make the sole amends in your power for it then and disclose the names of all who have been connected with the atrocious design rejoined waad i confess myself guilty replied fawkes humbly but i accuse no others then you die impenitent rejoined the lieutenant and cannot hope for mercy hereafter guy fawkes made no answer but bowed his head upon his breast and the lieutenant darting a malignant look at him quitted the cell on the following day the whole of the conspirators were taken to st johns chapel in the white tower where a discourse was pronounced to them by doctor overall dean of st pauls who enlarged upon the enormity of their offence and exhorted them to repentance the discourse over they were about to be removed when two ladies clad in mourning habits entered the chapel these were lady digby and mrs rookwood and they immediately flew to their husbands the rest of the conspirators walked away and averted their gaze from the painful scene after an ineffectual attempt to speak lady digby swooned away and was committed by her husband while in a state of insensibility to the care of an attendant mrs rookwood however who was a woman of high spirit and great personal attractions though the latter were now wasted by affliction maintained her composure and encouraging her husband to bear up manfully against his situation tenderly embraced him and withdrew the conspirators were then taken back to their cells at an early hour on the following morning the four miserable persons intended for death namely sir everard digby the elder winter john grant and bates were conducted to the beauchamp tower bates would have stood aloof from his superiors but sir everard digby took him kindly by the hand and drew him towards them no distinctions must be observed now he said we ought to beg pardon of thee my poor fellow for bringing thee into this strait think not of me worshipful sir replied bates i loved mr catesby so well that i would have laid down my life for him at any time and i now die cheerfully in his cause mr lieutenant said robert winter to sir william waad who stood near them with forsett and ipgreve i pray you commend me to my brother tell him i die in entire love of him and if it is possible for the departed to watch over the living i will be with him at his last hour at this moment a trampling of horses was heard on the green and the lieutenant proceeding to the grated window saw four mounted troopers each having a sledge and hurdle attached by ropes to his steed drawn up before the door while he was gazing at them an officer entered the room and informed him that all was in readiness sir william waad then motioned the prisoners to follow him and they descended the spiral staircase the green was thronged with horse and foot soldiers and as the conspirators issued from the arched door of the fortification the bell of saint peters chapel began to toll sir everard digby was first bound to a hurdle with his face towards the horse and the others were quickly secured in the same manner the melancholy cavalcade was then put in motion a troop of horsesoldiers in their full accoutrements and with calivers upon their shoulders rode first then came a band of halberdiers on foot then the masked executioner mounted on a led horse then the four prisoners on the hurdles one after the other then the lieutenant on horseback while another band of horsesoldiers equipped like the first brought up the rear they were met by the recorder of london sir henry montague and the sheriffs at the gate of the middle tower to the latter of whom the lieutenant according to custom delivered up the bodies of the prisoners after a short delay the train again set forward and emerging from the bulwark gate proceeded through an enormous concourse of spectators towards towerstreet aware that a vast crowd would be assembled in the city and apprehensive of some popular tumult the lord mayor had issued precepts to the aldermen of every ward commanding them to cause one able and sufficient person with a halbert in his hand to stand at the door of every dwellinghouse in the open street in the way that the traitors were to be drawn towards the place of execution there to remain from seven in the morning until the return of the sheriffs but these were not the whole of the arrangements made to preserve order the cavalcade it was fixed was to proceed along towerstreet gracechurch street lombardstreet cheapside and so on to the west end of saint pauls cathedral where the scaffold was erected along the whole road on either side a line of halberdiers was drawn up while barriers were erected against the cross streets nor were these precautions needless such a vast concourse was collected that nothing but the presence of a strong armed force could have prevented confusion and disorder the roofs of all the houses the towers of the churches the steps of the crosses were covered with spectators who groaned and hooted as the conspirators passed by the scaffold as has just been stated was erected in front of the great western entrance of the cathedral the mighty valves of the sacred structure were thrown open and disclosed its columned aisles crowded with spectators as was its roof and central tower the great bell which had begun to toll when the melancholy procession came in sight continued to pour forth its lugubrious sounds during the whole of the ceremonial the rolling of muffled drums was likewise heard above the tumultuous murmurs of the impatient multitude the whole area from the cathedral to ludgatehill was filled with spectators but an open space was kept clear in front of the scaffold in which the prisoners were one by one unbound from the hurdles during this awful pause they had sufficient time to note the whole of the dreadful preparations at a little distance from them was a large fire on which boiled a caldron of pitch destined to receive their dismembered limbs a tall gallows approached by a double ladder sprung from the scaffold on which the hangman was already mounted with the rope in his hand at the foot of the ladder was the quarteringblock near which stood the masked executioner with a chopper in his hand and two large sharp knives in his girdle his arms were bared to the shoulder and a leathern apron soiled by gory stains and tied round his waist completed his butcherly appearance straw was scattered upon the scaffold near the block sir everard digby was the first to receive the fatal summons he mounted with a firm footstep and his youth his noble aspect and undaunted demeanour awakened as before the sympathy of the beholders looking round he thus addressed the assemblage good people i am here about to die ye well know for what cause throughout the matter i have acted according to the dictates of my conscience they have led me to undertake this enterprise which in respect of my religion i hold to be no offence but in respect of the law a heinous offence and i therefore ask forgiveness of god of the king and of the whole realm crossing himself devoutly he then knelt down and recited his prayers in latin after which he arose and again looking round said in an earnest voice i desire the prayers of all good catholics and of none other then none will pray for you replied several voices from the crowd heedless of the retort sir everard surrendered himself to the executioners assistant who divested him of his cloak and doublet and unfastened his collar in this state he mounted the ladder and the hangman fulfilled his office robert winter was next summoned and ascended the scaffold with great firmness everything proclaimed the terrible tragedy that had just been enacted the straw was sprinkled with blood so was the block so were the long knives of the executioner whose hands and arms were dyed with the same crimson stain while in one corner of the scaffold stood a basket containing the dismembered limbs of the late unfortunate sufferer but these dreadful sights produced no effect on robert winter declining to address the assemblage he at once surrendered himself to the assistant and shared the fate of his friend grant was the next to follow undismayed as his predecessor he looked round with a cheerful countenance and said i am about to suffer the death of a traitor and am content to die so but i am satisfied that our project was so far from being sinful that i rely entirely on my merits in bearing a part in it as an abundant satisfaction and expiation for all the sins i have at other times of my life committed this speech was received by a terrific yell from the multitude wholly unmoved however grant uttered a few prayers and then crossing himself mounted the ladder and was quickly despatched the bloody business was completed by the slaughter of bates who died as resolutely as the others these executions being conducted with the utmost deliberation occupied nearly an hour the crowd then separated to talk over the sight they had witnessed and to keep holiday during the remainder of the day rejoicing that an equallyexciting spectacle was in store for them on the morrow chapter xvi old palace yard guy fawkess tranquillity of mind did not desert him to the last on the contrary as his term of life drew near its close he became more cheerful and resigned his sole anxiety being that all should be speedily terminated when ipgreve took leave of him for the night he threw himself on his couch and soon fell into a gentle slumber his dreams were soothing and he fancied that viviana appeared to him clad in robes of snowy whiteness and regarding him with a smiling countenance promised that the gates of eternal happiness would be opened to him on the morrow awaking about four oclock he passed the interval between that time and his summons by the jailer in earnest prayer at six oclock ipgreve made his appearance he was accompanied by his daughter who had prevailed on him to allow her to take leave of the prisoner she acquainted fawkes with all particulars of the interment of viviana to which he listened with tearful interest would my remains might be laid beside her he said but fate forbids it truly does it observed ipgreve gruffly unless you would have her body removed to the spikes of whitehall gates disregarding this brutal speech which called a blush of shame to the cheeks of ruth fawkes affectionately pressed her hand and said do not forget me in your prayers and sometimes visit the grave of viviana doubt it not she replied in accents half suffocated by grief fawkes then bade her farewell and followed the jailer through various intricate passages which brought them to a door opening upon one of the lower chambers of the beauchamp tower unlocking it ipgreve led the way up the circular staircase and ushered his companion into the large chamber where rookwood keyes and thomas winter were already assembled the morning was clear but frosty and bitterly cold and when the lieutenant appeared rookwood besought him to allow them a fire as their last earthly indulgence the request was peremptorily refused a cup of hot spiced wine was however offered them and accepted by all except fawkes at the same hour as on the previous day the hurdles were brought to the entrance of the fortification and the prisoners bound to them the recorder and sheriffs met them at the middle tower as they had done the other conspirators and the cavalcade set forth the crowd was even greater than on the former occasion and it required the utmost exertion on the part of the guard to maintain order some little delay occurred at ludgate and during this brief halt rookwood heard a cry and looking up perceived his wife at the upper window of one of the habitations waving her handkerchief to him and cheering him by her gestures he endeavoured to answer her by signs but his hands were fast bound and the next moment the cavalcade moved on at temple bar another halt occurred and as the train moved slowly forward an immense crowd like a swollen stream swept after it the two gates at whitehall then barring the road to westminster were opened as the train approached and a certain portion of the concourse allowed to pass through the scaffold which had been removed from saint pauls was erected in the middle of old palace yard in front of the house of lords around it were circled a band of halberdiers outside whom stood a dense throng the buttresses and pinnacles of the abbey were covered with spectators so was the roof of the parliament house and the gallery over the entrance the bell of the abbey began to toll as the train passed through the gates of whitehall and its deep booming filled the air just as the conspirators were released from the hurdles topcliffe who had evidently from his disordered attire arrived from a long journey rode up and dismounted i am just in time he cried with an exulting glance at the conspirators this is not the last execution i shall witness fathers garnet and oldcorne are prisoners and on their way to london i was a long time in unearthing the priestly foxes but i succeeded at last at this moment an officer approached and summoned thomas winter to mount the scaffold he obeyed and exhibited no symptom of quailing except that his complexion suddenly turned to a livid colour being told of this by the lieutenant he tried to account for it by saying that he thought he saw his brother precede him up the steps he made a brief address protesting he died a true catholic and in that faith notwithstanding his offences hoped to be saved rookwood followed him and indulged in a somewhat longer oration i confess my offence to god he said in seeking to shed blood and implore his mercy i likewise confess my offence to the king of whose majesty i humbly ask forgiveness and i further confess my offence to the whole state of whom in general i entreat pardon may the almighty bless the king the queen and all their royal progeny and grant them a long and happy reign may he turn their hearts to the catholic faith so that heresy may be wholly extirpated from the kingdom the first part of this speech was well received by the assemblage but the latter was drowned in groans and hootings amid which rookwood was launched into eternity keyes came next and eyeing the assemblage disdainfully went up the ladder and threw himself off with such force that he broke the rope and was instantly despatched by the executioner and his assistants guy fawkes now alone remained and he slowly mounted the scaffold his foot slipped on the bloodstained boards and he would have fallen if topcliffe who stood near him had not caught his hand a deep silence prevailed as he looked around and uttered the following words in a clear and distinct voice i ask forgiveness of the king and the state for my criminal intention and trust that my death will wash out my offence he then crossed himself and knelt down to pray after which his cloak and doublet were removed by the executioners assistant and placed with those of the other conspirators he made an effort to mount the ladder but his stiffened limbs refused their office your courage fails you sneered topcliffe laying his hand upon his shoulder my strength does replied fawkes sternly regarding him help me up the ladder and you shall see whether i am afraid to die seeing how matters stood the executioner who stood by leaning upon his chopper tendered him his bloodstained hand but fawkes rejected it with disgust and exerting all his strength forced himself up the ladder as the hangman adjusted the rope he observed a singular smile illumine the features of his victim you seem happy he said i am so replied fawkes earnestlyi see the form of her i loved beckoning me to unfading happiness with this he stretched out his arms and sprang from the ladder before his frame was exposed to the executioners knife life was totally extinct chapter xvii the last execution little more remains to be told and that little is of an equally painful nature with the tragical events just related fathers garnet and oldcorne together with mr abingdon and their servants arrived in london on the th of february about a fortnight after the execution of the other conspirators they were first taken to the gatehouse at westminster and were examined on the following day by the earl of salisbury and the privycouncil at the starchamber nothing could be elicited from them and garnet answered the earls interrogatories with infinite subtlety and address the examination over they were ordered to be removed to the tower topcliffe accompanied them to the stairs as they proceeded thither he called garnets attention to a ghastly object stuck on a spike over the palace gates do you recognise those features he asked no replied garnet shudderingly averting his gaze i am surprised to hear it rejoined topcliffe for they were once well known to you it is the head of guy fawkes of all the conspirators he added with a bitter laugh he was the only one who died truly penitent it is reported that this happy change was wrought in him by viviana radcliffe heaven have mercy upon his soul muttered garnet i will tell you a strange tale about catesby pursued topcliffe he was buried in the garden at holbeach with percy but an order was sent down by the earl of salisbury to have their bodies disinterred and quartered when catesbys head was severed from the trunk to be set on the gates of warwick fresh blood spouted forth as if life were in the veins you do not expect me to believe this idle story said garnet incredulously believe it or not as you please returned topcliffe angrily on arriving at the fortress garnet was lodged in the large chamber of the beauchamp tower and allowed the attendance of his servant nicholas owen while oldcorne was equally well accommodated in the constable tower this leniency was the result of the policy of the earl of salisbury who hoped to obtain disclosures from the two jesuit priests which would enable him to strike the decisive blow he meditated against the papists but he was unsuccessful they refused to make any confessions which would criminate themselves or implicate others and as none of the conspirators not even tresham had admitted their connexion with the plot it was difficult to find proof against them garnet underwent daily examinations from the earl of salisbury and the commissioners but he baffled all their inquiries if we cannot wring the truth from you by fair means mr garnet said salisbury we must have recourse to torture minare ista pueris replied garnet contemptuously leave these two priests to me my lord observed sir william waad who was present at the examination which took place at the councilchamber in his lodgingsleave them to me he said in a low voice to the earl and i will engage to procure a full confession from their own lips without resorting to torture you will render the state an important service by doing so replied salisbury in the same tone i place the matter entirely in your hands the lieutenant set to work without loss of time by his directions garnet and oldcorne were removed from their present places of confinement to two subterranean cells immediately adjoining each other but between which a secret recess contrived in the thickness of the wall and built for the purpose it was subsequently put to existed two days after they had been so immured ipgreve who had received his instructions loitered for a moment in oldcornes cell and with affected hesitation informed him that for a trifling reward he would enable him to hold unreserved communication with his fellowprisoner oldcorne eagerly caught at the bait but required to be satisfied that the jailer could make good his words ipgreve immediately proceeded to the side of the cell and holding a lamp to the wall showed him a small iron knob touch this spring he said and a stone will fall from its place and enable you to converse with father garnet who is in the next cell but you must take care to replace the stone when any one approaches promising to observe the utmost caution and totally unsuspicious of the deceit practised upon him oldcorne gave ipgreve the reward and as soon as he was gone touched the spring and found it act precisely as the jailer had stated garnet was greatly surprised to hear the others voice and on learning how the communication was managed was at first suspicious of some stratagem but by degrees his fears wore off and he became unreserved in his discourse with his companion discussing the fate of the conspirators their own share in the plot the probability of their acquittal and the best means of baffling their examiners all these interlocutions were overheard and taken down by the lieutenant and two other witnesses forsett and lockerson private secretary to the earl of salisbury who were concealed in the recess having obtained all the information he desired sir william waad laid his notes before the council and their own confessions being read to the priests they were both greatly confused though neither would admit their authenticity meanwhile their two servants owen and chambers had been repeatedly examined and refusing to confess were at last suspended from a beam by the thumbs but this producing no result they were told that on the following day they would be placed on the rack chambers then offered to make a full confession but owen continuing obstinate was conveyed back to his cell ipgreve brought him his food as usual in the evening and on this occasion it consisted of broth and a small allowance of meat it was the custom of the jailer to bring with him a small bluntpointed knife with which he allowed the prisoner to cut his victuals having got possession of the knife owen tasted the broth and complaining that it was quite cold he implored the jailer to get it warmed for him as he felt extremely unwell somewhat moved by his entreaties and more by his appearance ipgreve complied on his return he found the unfortunate man lying in one corner of the cell partially covered by a heap of straw which ordinarily formed his bed here is your broth he said take it while it is hot i shall give myself no further trouble about you it will not be needed gasped owen alarmed by the sound of his voice ipgreve held the light towards him and perceived that his face was pale as death at the same time he remarked that the floor was covered with blood instantly divining the truth the jailer rushed towards the wretched man and dragging away the bloodstained straw found he had inflicted a frightful wound upon himself with the knife which he still held in his grasp fool that i was to trust you with the weapon cried ipgreve but who would have thought it could inflict a mortal wound any weapon will serve him who is resolved to die rejoined owen you cannot put me on the rack now and with a ghastly expression of triumph he expired soon after this oldcorne and abingdon were sent down to worcester where the former was tried and executed stephen littleton suffered death at the same time on friday the rd of march full proofs being obtained against him garnet was arraigned of high treason at guildhall the trial which excited extraordinary interest was attended by the king by the most distinguished personages male and female of his court and by all the foreign ambassadors garnet conducted himself throughout his arraignment which lasted for thirteen hours with the same courage and address which he had displayed on his examinations before the commissioners but his subtlety availed him little he was found guilty and condemned the execution of the sentence was for some time deferred it being hoped that a complete admission of his guilt would be obtained from him together with disclosures relative to the designs of the jesuit party with this view the examinations were still continued but the rigour with which he had been latterly treated was relaxed a few days before his execution he was visited by several eminent protestant divinesdoctor montague dean of the chapel royal doctor neile dean of westminster and doctor overall dean of saint pauls with whom he had a long disputation on points of faith and other spiritual matters at the close of this discussion doctor overall remarked i suppose you expect mr garnet that after your death the church of rome will declare you a martyr i a martyr exclaimed garnet sorrowfully o what a martyr i should be if indeed i were really about to suffer death for the catholic religion and had never known of this project except by means of sacramental confession i might perhaps be accounted worthy the honour of martyrdom and might deservedly be glorified in the opinion of our church as it is i acknowledge myself to have sinned in this respect and deny not the justice of the sentence passed upon me satisfied at length that no further disclosures could be obtained from him the king signed the warrant for his execution on the nd of may the scaffold was erected at the west end of saint pauls cathedral on the spot where digby and the other conspirators had suffered a vast assemblage was collected as on the former occasion and similar precautions were taken to prevent tumult and disturbance the unfortunate mans torture was cruelly and unnecessarily prolonged by a series of questions proposed to him on the scaffold by doctor overall and the dean of westminster all of which he answered very collectedly and clearly he maintained his fortitude to the last when fully prepared he mounted the ladder and thus addressed the assemblage i commend myself to all good catholics i grieve that i have offended the king by not revealing the design entertained against him and that i did not use more diligence in preventing the execution of the plot i commend myself most humbly to the lords of his majestys council and entreat them not to judge too hardly by me i beseech all men that catholics may not fare the worse for my sake and i exhort all catholics to take care not to mix themselves with seditious or traitorous designs against the kings majesty whom god preserve making the sign of the cross upon his forehead and breast he continued in nomine patris filii et spiritus sancti jesus maria maria mater gratiae mater misericordiae tu me ab hoste protege et hora mortis suscipe in manus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum quia tu redimisti me domine deus veritatis again crossing himself he addedper crucis hoc signum fugiat procul omne malignum infige crucem tuam domine in corde meo and with this last pathetic ejaculation he threw himself from the ladder garnet obtained after death the distinction he had disclaimed while living he was enrolled together with oldcorne among the list of catholic martyrs several miracles are affirmed by the jesuits to have been performed in his behalf father more relates that on the lawn at hendlip where he and oldcorne last set foot a new and hitherto unknown species of grass sprang up into the exact shape of an imperial crown and remained for a long time without being trodden down by the feet of passengers or eaten up by the cattle it was further asserted that a spring of oil burst forth at the west end of saint pauls cathedral on the precise spot where he suffered but the most singular prodigy is that recounted by endaemon joannes who affirms that in a straw which had been sprinkled with garnets blood a human countenance strangely resembling that of the martyr was discovered this legend of the miraculous straw having received many embellishments and improvements as it travelled abroad obtained universal credence and was conceived to fully establish garnets innocence anne vaux the jesuits devoted friend retired with her sister mrs brooksby to a nunnery in flanders where she ended her days so terminated the memorable and nevertobeforgotten gunpowder treason for deliverance from which our church still offers thanksgivings and in remembrance of which on the
