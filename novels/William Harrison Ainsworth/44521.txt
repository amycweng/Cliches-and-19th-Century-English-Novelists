vindictive character jack sheppard accuses thames darrell of theft epoch the first jonathan wild chapter i the widow and her child on the night of friday the th of november and at the hour of eleven the door of a miserable habitation situated in an obscure quarter of the borough of southwark known as the old mint was opened and a man with a lantern in his hand appeared at the threshold this person whose age might be about forty was attired in a brown double breasted frieze coat with very wide skirts and a very narrow collar a light drugget waistcoat with pockets reaching to the knees black plush breeches grey worsted hose and shoes with round toes wooden heels and high quarters fastened by small silver buckles he wore a three cornered hat a sandy coloured scratch wig and had a thick woollen wrapper folded round his throat his clothes had evidently seen some service and were plentifully begrimed with the dust of the workshop still he had a decent look and decidedly the air of one well to do in the world in stature he was short and stumpy in person corpulent and in countenance sleek snub nosed and demure immediately behind this individual came a pale poverty stricken woman whose forlorn aspect contrasted strongly with his plump and comfortable physiognomy she was dressed in a tattered black stuff gown discoloured by various stains and intended it would seem from the remnants of rusty crape with which it was here and there tricked out to represent the garb of widowhood and held in her arms a sleeping infant swathed in the folds of a linsey woolsey shawl notwithstanding her emaciation her features still retained something of a pleasing expression and might have been termed beautiful had it not been for that repulsive freshness of lip denoting the habitual dram drinker a freshness in her case rendered the more shocking from the almost livid hue of the rest of her complexion she could not be more than twenty and though want and other suffering had done the work of time had wasted her frame and robbed her cheek of its bloom and roundness they had not extinguished the lustre of her eyes nor thinned her raven hair checking an ominous cough that ever and anon convulsed her lungs the poor woman addressed a few parting words to her companion who lingered at the doorway as if he had something on his mind which he did not very well know how to communicate well good night mr wood said she in the deep hoarse accents of consumption and may god almighty bless and reward you for your kindness you were always the best of masters to my poor husband and now you've proved the best of friends to his widow and orphan boy poh poh say no more about it rejoined the man hastily i've done no more than my duty mrs sheppard and neither deserve nor desire your thanks 'whoso giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord' that's my comfort and such slight relief as i can afford should have been offered earlier if i'd known where you'd taken refuge after your unfortunate husband's execution you would say sir added mrs sheppard with a deep sigh perceiving that her benefactor hesitated to pronounce the word you show more consideration to the feelings of a hempen widow than there is any need to show i'm used to insult as i am to misfortune and am grown callous to both but i'm not used to compassion and know not how to take it my heart would speak if it could for it is very full there was a time long long ago when the tears would have rushed to my eyes unbidden at the bare mention of generosity like yours mr wood but they never come now i have never wept since that day and i trust you will never have occasion to weep again my poor soul replied wood setting down his lantern and brushing a few drops from his eyes unless it be tears of joy pshaw added he making an effort to subdue his emotion i can't leave you in this way i must stay a minute longer if only to see you smile so saying he re entered the house closed the door and followed by the widow proceeded to the fire place where a handful of chips apparently just lighted crackled within the rusty grate the room in which this interview took place had a sordid and miserable look rotten and covered with a thick coat of dirt the boards of the floor presented a very insecure footing the bare walls were scored all over with grotesque designs the chief of which represented the punishment of nebuchadnezzar the rest were hieroglyphic characters executed in red chalk and charcoal the ceiling had in many places given way the laths had been removed and where any plaster remained it was either mapped and blistered with damps or festooned with dusty cobwebs over an old crazy bedstead was thrown a squalid patchwork counterpane and upon the counterpane lay a black hood and scarf a pair of bodice of the cumbrous form in vogue at the beginning of the last century and some other articles of female attire on a small shelf near the foot of the bed stood a couple of empty phials a cracked ewer and basin a brown jug without a handle a small tin coffee pot without a spout a saucer of rouge a fragment of looking glass and a flask labelled rosa solis broken pipes littered the floor if that can be said to be littered which in the first instance was a mass of squalor and filth over the chimney piece was pasted a handbill purporting to be the last dying speech and confession of tom sheppard the notorious housebreaker who suffered at tyburn on the th of february this placard was adorned with a rude wood cut representing the unhappy malefactor at the place of execution on one side of the handbill a print of the reigning sovereign anne had been pinned over the portrait of william the third whose aquiline nose keen eyes and luxuriant wig were just visible above the diadem of the queen on the other a wretched engraving of the chevalier de saint george or as he was styled in the label attached to the portrait james the third raised a suspicion that the inmate of the house was not altogether free from some tincture of jacobitism beneath these prints a cluster of hobnails driven into the wall formed certain letters which if properly deciphered produced the words paul groves cobler and under the name traced in charcoal appeared the following record of the poor fellow's fate hung himsel' in this rum for luv off licker accompanied by a graphic sketch of the unhappy suicide dangling from a beam a farthing candle stuck in a bottle neck shed its feeble light upon the table which owing to the provident kindness of mr wood was much better furnished with eatables than might have been expected and boasted a loaf a knuckle of ham a meat pie and a flask of wine you've but a sorry lodging mrs sheppard said wood glancing round the chamber as he expanded his palms before the scanty flame it's wretched enough indeed sir rejoined the widow but poor as it is it's better than the cold stones and open streets of course of course returned wood hastily anything's better than that but take a drop of wine urged he filling a drinking horn and presenting it to her it's choice canary and'll do you good and now come and sit by me my dear and let's have a little quiet chat together when things are at the worst they'll mend take my word for it your troubles are over i hope they are sir answered mrs sheppard with a faint smile and a doubtful shake of the head as wood drew her to a seat beside him for i've had my full share of misery but i don't look for peace on this side the grave nonsense cried wood while there's life there's hope never be down hearted besides added he opening the shawl in which the infant was wrapped and throwing the light of the candle full upon its sickly but placid features it's sinful to repine while you've a child like this to comfort you lord help him he's the very image of his father like carpenter like chips that likeness is the chief cause of my misery replied the widow shuddering were it not for that he would indeed be a blessing and a comfort to me he never cries nor frets as children generally do but lies at my bosom or on my knee as quiet and as gentle as you see him now but when i look upon his innocent face and see how like he is to his father when i think of that father's shameful ending and recollect how free from guilt he once was at such times mr wood despair will come over me and dear as this babe is to me far dearer than my own wretched life which i would lay down for him any minute i have prayed to heaven to remove him rather than he should grow up to be a man and be exposed to his father's temptations rather than he should live as wickedly and die as disgracefully as his father and when i have seen him pining away before my eyes getting thinner and thinner every day i have sometimes thought my prayers were heard marriage and hanging go by destiny observed wood after a pause but i trust your child is reserved for a better fate than either mrs sheppard the latter part of this speech was delivered with so much significance of manner that a bystander might have inferred that mr wood was not particularly fortunate in his own matrimonial connections goodness only knows what he's reserved for rejoined the widow in a desponding tone but if mynheer van galgebrok whom i met last night at the cross shovels spoke the truth little jack will never die in his bed save us exclaimed wood and who is this van gal gal what's his outlandish name van galgebrok replied the widow he's the famous dutch conjuror who foretold king william's accident and death last february but one a month before either event happened and gave out that another prince over the water would soon enjoy his own again for which he was committed to newgate and whipped at the cart's tail he went by another name then rykhart scherprechter i think he called himself his fellow prisoners nicknamed him the gallows provider from a habit he had of picking out all those who were destined to the gibbet he was never known to err and was as much dreaded as the jail fever in consequence he singled out my poor husband from a crowd of other felons and you know how right he was in that case sir ay marry replied wood with a look that seemed to say that he did not think it required any surprising skill in the art of divination to predict the doom of the individual in question but whatever opinion he might entertain he contented himself with inquiring into the grounds of the conjuror's evil augury respecting the infant what did the old fellow judge from eh joan asked he from a black mole under the child's right ear shaped like a coffin which is a bad sign and a deep line just above the middle of the left thumb meeting round about in the form of a noose which is a worse replied mrs sheppard to be sure it's not surprising the poor little thing should be so marked for when i lay in the women felons' ward in newgate where he first saw the light or at least such light as ever finds entrance into that gloomy place i had nothing whether sleeping or waking but halters and gibbets and coffins and such like horrible visions for ever dancing round me and then you know sir but perhaps you don't know that little jack was born a month before his time on the very day his poor father suffered lord bless us ejaculated wood how shocking no i did not know that you may see the marks on the child yourself if you choose sir urged the widow see the devil not i cried wood impatiently i didn't think you'd been so easily fooled joan fooled or not returned mrs sheppard mysteriously old van told me one thing which has come true already what's that asked wood with some curiosity he said by way of comfort i suppose after the fright he gave me at first that the child would find a friend within twenty four hours who would stand by him through life a friend is not so soon gained as lost replied wood but how has the prediction been fulfilled joan eh i thought you would have guessed sir replied the widow timidly i'm sure little jack has but one friend beside myself in the world and that's more than i would have ventured to say for him yesterday however i've not told you all for old van did say something about the child saving his new found friend's life at the time of meeting but how that's to happen i'm sure i can't guess nor any one else in his senses rejoined wood with a laugh it's not very likely that a babby of nine months old will save my life if i'm to be his friend as you seem to say mrs sheppard but i've not promised to stand by him yet nor will i unless he turns out an honest lad mind that of all crafts and it was the only craft his poor father who to do him justice was one of the best workmen that ever handled a saw or drove a nail could never understand of all crafts i say to be an honest man is the master craft as long as your son observes that precept i'll befriend him but no longer i don't desire it sir replied mrs sheppard meekly there's an old proverb continued wood rising and walking towards the fire which says 'put another man's child in your bosom and he'll creep out at your elbow' but i don't value that because i think it applies to one who marries a widow with encumbrances and that's not my case you know well sir gasped mrs sheppard well my dear i've a proposal to make in regard to this babby of yours which may or may not be agreeable all i can say is it's well meant and i may add i'd have made it five minutes ago if you'd given me the opportunity illustration pray come to the point sir said mrs sheppard somewhat alarmed by this preamble i am coming to the point joan the more haste the worse speed better the feet slip than the tongue however to cut a long matter short my proposal's this i've taken a fancy to your bantling and as i've no son of my own if it meets with your concurrence and that of mrs wood for i never do anything without consulting my better half i'll take the boy educate him and bring him up to my own business of a carpenter the poor widow hung her head and pressed her child closer to her breast well joan said the benevolent mechanic after he had looked at her steadfastly for a few moments what say you silence gives consent eh mrs sheppard made an effort to speak but her voice was choked by emotion shall i take the babby home with me persisted wood in a tone between jest and earnest i cannot part with him replied the widow bursting into tears indeed indeed i cannot so i've found out the way to move her thought the carpenter those tears will do her some good at all events not part with him added he aloud why you wouldn't stand in the way of his good fortune surely i'll be a second father to him i tell you remember what the conjuror said i do remember it sir replied mrs sheppard and am most grateful for your offer but i dare not accept it dare not echoed the carpenter i don't understand you joan i mean to say sir answered mrs sheppard in a troubled voice that if i lost my child i should lose all i have left in the world i have neither father mother brother sister nor husband i have only him if i ask you to part with him my good woman it's to better his condition i suppose ain't it rejoined wood angrily for though he had no serious intention of carrying his proposal into effect he was rather offended at having it declined it's not an offer continued he that i'm likely to make or you're likely to receive every day in the year and muttering some remarks which we do not care to repeat reflecting upon the consistency of the sex he was preparing once more to depart when mrs sheppard stopped him give me till to morrow implored she and if i can bring myself to part with him you shall have him without another word take time to consider of it replied wood sulkily there's no hurry don't be angry with me sir cried the widow sobbing bitterly pray don't i know i am undeserving of your bounty but if i were to tell you what hardships i have undergone to what frightful extremities i have been reduced and to what infamy i have submitted to earn a scanty subsistence for this child's sake if you could feel what it is to stand alone in the world as i do bereft of all who have ever loved me and shunned by all who have ever known me except the worthless and the wretched if you knew and heaven grant you may be spared the knowledge how much affliction sharpens love and how much more dear to me my child has become for every sacrifice i have made for him if you were told all this you would i am sure pity rather than reproach me because i cannot at once consent to a separation which i feel would break my heart but give me till to morrow only till to morrow i may be able to part with him then the worthy carpenter was now far more angry with himself than he had previously been with mrs sheppard and as soon as he could command his feelings which were considerably excited by the mention of her distresses he squeezed her hand warmly bestowed a hearty execration upon his own inhumanity and swore he would neither separate her from her child nor suffer any one else to separate them plague on't added he i never meant to take your babby from you but i'd a mind to try whether you really loved him as much as you pretended i was to blame to carry the matter so far however confession of a fault makes half amends for it a time may come when this little chap will need my aid and depend upon it he shall never want a friend in owen wood as he said this the carpenter patted the cheek of the little object of his benevolent professions and in so doing unintentionally aroused him from his slumbers opening a pair of large black eyes the child fixed them for an instant upon wood and then alarmed by the light uttered a low and melancholy cry which however was speedily stilled by the caresses of his mother towards whom he extended his tiny arms as if imploring protection i don't think he would leave me even if i could part with him observed mrs sheppard smiling through her tears i don't think he would acquiesced the carpenter no friend like the mother for the babby knows no other and that's true rejoined mrs sheppard for if i had not been a mother i would not have survived the day on which i became a widow you mustn't think of that mrs sheppard said wood in a soothing tone i can't help thinking of it sir answered the widow i can never get poor tom's last look out of my head as he stood in the stone hall at newgate after his irons had been knocked off unless i manage to stupify myself somehow the dismal tolling of st sepulchre's bell is for ever ringing in my ears oh if that's the case observed wood i'm surprised you should like to have such a frightful picture constantly in view as that over the chimney piece i'd good reasons for placing it there sir but don't question me about them now or you'll drive me mad returned mrs sheppard wildly well well we'll say no more about it replied wood and by way of changing the subject let me advise you on no account to fly to strong waters for consolation joan one nail drives out another it's true but the worst nail you can employ is a coffin nail gin lane's the nearest road to the churchyard it may be but if it shortens the distance and lightens the journey i care not retorted the widow who seemed by this reproach to be roused into sudden eloquence to those who like me have never been able to get out of the dark and dreary paths of life the grave is indeed a refuge and the sooner they reach it the better the spirit i drink may be poison it may kill me perhaps it is killing me but so would hunger cold misery so would my own thoughts i should have gone mad without it gin is the poor man's friend his sole set off against the rich man's luxury it comforts him when he is most forlorn it may be treacherous it may lay up a store of future woe but it insures present happiness and that is sufficient when i have traversed the streets a houseless wanderer driven with curses from every door where i have solicited alms and with blows from every gateway where i have sought shelter when i have crept into some deserted building and stretched my wearied limbs upon a bulk in the vain hope of repose or worse than all when frenzied with want i have yielded to horrible temptation and earned a meal in the only way i could earn one when i have felt at times like these my heart sink within me i have drank of this drink and have at once forgotten my cares my poverty my guilt old thoughts old feelings old faces and old scenes have returned to me and i have fancied myself happy as happy as i am now and she burst into a wild hysterical laugh poor creature ejaculated wood do you call this frantic glee happiness it's all the happiness i have known for years returned the widow becoming suddenly calm and it's short lived enough as you perceive i tell you what mr wood added she in a hollow voice and with a ghastly look gin may bring ruin but as long as poverty vice and ill usage exist it will be drunk god forbid exclaimed wood fervently and as if afraid of prolonging the interview he added with some precipitation but i must be going i've stayed here too long already you shall hear from me to morrow stay said mrs sheppard again arresting his departure i've just recollected that my husband left a key with me which he charged me to give you when i could find an opportunity a key exclaimed wood eagerly i lost a very valuable one some time ago what's it like joan it's a small key with curiously fashioned wards it's mine i'll be sworn rejoined wood well who'd have thought of finding it in this unexpected way don't be too sure till you see it said the widow shall i fetch it for you sir by all means i must trouble you to hold the child then for a minute while i run up to the garret where i've hidden it for safety said mrs sheppard i think i may trust him with you sir added she taking up the candle don't leave him if you're at all fearful my dear replied wood receiving the little burthen with a laugh poor thing muttered he as the widow departed on her errand she's seen better days and better circumstances than she'll ever see again i'm sure strange i could never learn her history tom sheppard was always a close file and would never tell whom he married of this i'm certain however she was much too good for him and was never meant to be a journeyman carpenter's wife still less what is she now her heart's in the right place at all events and since that's the case the rest may perhaps come round that is if she gets through her present illness a dry cough's the trumpeter of death if that's true she's not long for this world as to this little fellow in spite of the dutchman who in my opinion is more of a jacobite than a conjurer and more of a knave than either he shall never mount a horse foaled by an acorn if i can help it the course of the carpenter's meditations was here interrupted by a loud note of lamentation from the child who disturbed by the transfer and not receiving the gentle solace to which he was ordinarily accustomed raised his voice to the utmost and exerted his feeble strength to escape for a few moments mr wood dandled his little charge to and fro after the most approved nursery fashion essaying at the same time the soothing influence of an infantine melody proper to the occasion but failing in his design he soon lost all patience and being as we have before hinted rather irritable though extremely well meaning he lifted the unhappy bantling in the air and shook him with so much good will that he had well nigh silenced him most effectually a brief calm succeeded but with returning breath came returning vociferations and the carpenter with a faint hope of lessening the clamour by change of scene took up his lantern opened the door and walked out chapter ii the old mint mrs sheppard's habitation terminated a row of old ruinous buildings called wheeler's rents a dirty thoroughfare part street and part lane running from mint street through a variety of turnings and along the brink of a deep kennel skirted by a number of petty and neglected gardens in the direction of saint george's fields the neighbouring houses were tenanted by the lowest order of insolvent traders thieves mendicants and other worthless and nefarious characters who fled thither to escape from their creditors or to avoid the punishment due to their different offenses for we may observe that the old mint although it had been divested of some of its privileges as a sanctuary by a recent statute passed in the reign of william the third still presented a safe asylum to the debtor and even continued to do so until the middle of the reign of george the first when the crying nature of the evil called loudly for a remedy and another and more sweeping enactment entirely took away its immunities in consequence of the encouragement thus offered to dishonesty and the security afforded to crime this quarter of the borough of southwark was accounted at the period of our narrative the grand receptacle of the superfluous villainy of the metropolis infested by every description of vagabond and miscreant it was perhaps a few degrees worse than the rookery near saint giles's and the desperate neighbourhood of saffron hill in our own time and yet on the very site of the sordid tenements and squalid courts we have mentioned where the felon openly made his dwelling and the fraudulent debtor laughed the object of his knavery to scorn on this spot not two centuries ago stood the princely residence of charles brandon the chivalrous duke of suffolk whose stout heart was a well of honour and whose memory breathes of loyalty and valour suffolk house as brandon's palace was denominated was subsequently converted into a mint by his royal brother in law henry the eighth and after its demolition and the removal of the place of coinage to the tower the name was still continued to the district in which it had been situated old and dilapidated the widow's domicile looked the very picture of desolation and misery nothing more forlorn could be conceived the roof was partially untiled the chimneys were tottering the side walls bulged and were supported by a piece of timber propped against the opposite house the glass in most of the windows was broken and its place supplied with paper while in some cases the very frames of the windows had been destroyed and the apertures were left free to the airs of heaven on the groundfloor the shutters were closed or to speak more correctly altogether nailed up and presented a very singular appearance being patched all over with the soles of old shoes rusty hobnails and bits of iron hoops the ingenious device of the former occupant of the apartment paul groves the cobbler to whom we have before alluded it was owing to the untimely end of this poor fellow that mrs sheppard was enabled to take possession of the premises in a fit of despondency superinduced by drunkenness he made away with himself and when the body was discovered after a lapse of some months such was the impression produced by the spectacle such the alarm occasioned by the crazy state of the building and above all by the terror inspired by strange and unearthly noises heard during the night which were of course attributed to the spirit of the suicide that the place speedily enjoyed the reputation of being haunted and was consequently entirely abandoned in this state mrs sheppard found it and as no one opposed her she at once took up her abode there nor was she long in discovering that the dreaded sounds proceeded from the nocturnal gambols of a legion of rats a narrow entry formed by two low walls communicated with the main thoroughfare and in this passage under the cover of a penthouse stood wood with his little burthen to whom we shall now return as mrs sheppard did not make her appearance quite so soon as he expected the carpenter became a little fidgetty and having succeeded in tranquillizing the child he thought proper to walk so far down the entry as would enable him to reconnoitre the upper windows of the house a light was visible in the garret feebly struggling through the damp atmosphere for the night was raw and overcast this light did not remain stationary but could be seen at one moment glimmering through the rents in the roof and at another shining through the cracks in the wall or the broken panes of the casement wood was unable to discover the figure of the widow but he recognised her dry hacking cough and was about to call her down if she could not find the key as he imagined must be the case when a loud noise was heard as though a chest or some weighty substance had fallen upon the floor before wood had time to inquire into the cause of this sound his attention was diverted by a man who rushed past the entry with the swiftness of desperation this individual apparently met with some impediment to his further progress for he had not proceeded many steps when he turned suddenly about and darted up the passage in which wood stood uttering a few inarticulate ejaculations for he was completely out of breath the fugitive placed a bundle in the arms of the carpenter and regardless of the consternation he excited in the breast of that personage who was almost stupified with astonishment he began to divest himself of a heavy horseman's cloak which he threw over wood's shoulder and drawing his sword seemed to listen intently for the approach of his pursuers the appearance of the new comer was extremely prepossessing and after his trepidation had a little subsided wood began to regard him with some degree of interest evidently in the flower of his age he was scarcely less remarkable for symmetry of person than for comeliness of feature and though his attire was plain and unpretending it was such as could be worn only by one belonging to the higher ranks of society his figure was tall and commanding and the expression of his countenance though somewhat disturbed by his recent exertion was resolute and stern at this juncture a cry burst from the child who nearly smothered by the weight imposed upon him only recovered the use of his lungs as wood altered the position of the bundle the stranger turned his head at the sound by heaven cried he in a tone of surprise you have an infant there to be sure i have replied wood angrily for finding that the intentions of the stranger were pacific so far as he was concerned he thought he might safely venture on a slight display of spirit it's very well you haven't crushed the poor little thing to death with this confounded clothes' bag but some people have no consideration that child may be the means of saving me muttered the stranger as if struck by a new idea i shall gain time by the expedient do you live here not exactly answered the carpenter no matter the door is open so it is needless to ask leave to enter ha exclaimed the stranger as shouts and other vociferations resounded at no great distance along the thoroughfare not a moment is to be lost give me that precious charge he added snatching the bundle from wood if i escape i will reward you your name owen wood replied the carpenter i've no reason to be ashamed of it and now a fair exchange sir yours the stranger hesitated the shouts drew nearer and lights were seen flashing ruddily against the sides and gables of the neighbouring houses my name is darrell said the fugitive hastily but if you are discovered answer no questions as you value your life wrap yourself in my cloak and keep it remember not a word so saying he huddled the mantle over wood's shoulders dashed the lantern to the ground and extinguished the light a moment afterwards the door was closed and bolted and the carpenter found himself alone mercy on us cried he as a thrill of apprehension ran through his frame the dutchman was right after all this exclamation had scarcely escaped him when the discharge of a pistol was heard and a bullet whizzed past his ears i have him cried a voice in triumph a man then rushed up the entry and seizing the unlucky carpenter by the collar presented a drawn sword to his throat this person was speedily followed by half a dozen others some of whom carried flambeaux mur der roared wood struggling to free himself from his assailant by whom he was half strangled damnation exclaimed one of the leaders of the party in a furious tone snatching a torch from an attendant and throwing its light full upon the face of the carpenter this is not the villain sir cecil so i find rowland replied the other in accents of deep disappointment and at the same time relinquishing his grasp i could have sworn i saw him enter this passage and how comes his cloak on this knave's shoulders it is his cloak of a surety returned rowland harkye sirrah continued he haughtily interrogating wood where is the person from whom you received this mantle throttling a man isn't the way to make him answer questions replied the carpenter doggedly you'll get nothing out of me i can promise you unless you show a little more civility we waste time with this fellow interposed sir cecil and may lose the object of our quest who beyond doubt has taken refuge in this building let us search it just then the infant began to sob piteously hist cried rowland arresting his comrade do you hear that we are not wholly at fault the dog fox cannot be far off since the cub is found with these words he tore the mantle from wood's back and perceiving the child endeavoured to seize it in this attempt he was however foiled by the agility of the carpenter who managed to retreat to the door against which he placed his back kicking the boards vigorously with his heel joan joan vociferated he open the door for god's sake or i shall be murdered and so will your babby open the door quickly i say knock him on the head thundered sir cecil or we shall have the watch upon us no fear of that rejoined rowland such vermin never dare to show themselves in this privileged district all we have to apprehend is a rescue the hint was not lost upon wood he tried to raise an outcry but his throat was again forcibly griped by rowland another such attempt said the latter and you are a dead man yield up the babe and i pledge my word you shall remain unmolested i will yield it to no one but its mother answered wood 'sdeath do you trifle with me sirrah cried rowland fiercely give me the child or as he spoke the door was thrown open and mrs sheppard staggered forward she looked paler than ever but her countenance though bewildered did not exhibit the alarm which might naturally have been anticipated from the strange and perplexing scene presented to her view take it cried wood holding the infant towards her take it and fly mrs sheppard put out her arms mechanically but before the child could be committed to her care it was wrested from the carpenter by rowland these people are all in league with him cried the latter but don't wait for me sir cecil enter the house with your men i'll dispose of the brat this injunction was instantly obeyed the knight and his followers crossed the threshold leaving one of the torch bearers behind them davies said rowland delivering the babe with a meaning look to his attendant i understand sir replied davies drawing a little aside and setting down the link he proceeded deliberately to untie his cravat my god will you see your child strangled before your eyes and not so much as scream for help said wood staring at the widow with a look of surprise and horror woman your wits are fled and so it seemed for all the answer she could make was to murmur distractedly i can't find the key devil take the key ejaculated wood they're about to murder your child your child i tell you do you comprehend what i say joan i've hurt my head replied mrs sheppard pressing her hand to her temples and then for the first time wood noticed a small stream of blood coursing slowly down her cheek at this moment davies who had completed his preparations extinguished the torch it's all over groaned wood and perhaps it's as well her senses are gone however i'll make a last effort to save the poor little creature if it costs me my life and with this generous resolve he shouted at the top of his voice arrest arrest help help seconding the words with a shrill and peculiar cry well known at the time to the inhabitants of the quarter in which it was uttered in reply to this summons a horn was instantly blown at the corner of the street arrest vociferated wood mint mint death and hell cried rowland making a furious pass at the carpenter who fortunately avoided the thrust in the darkness will nothing silence you help ejaculated wood renewing his cries arrest jigger closed shouted a hoarse voice in reply all's bowman my covey fear nothing we'll be upon the ban dogs before they can shake their trotters and the alarm was sounded more loudly than ever another horn now resounded from the further extremity of the thoroughfare this was answered by a third and presently a fourth and more remote blast took up the note of alarm the whole neighbourhood was disturbed a garrison called to arms at dead of night on the sudden approach of the enemy could not have been more expeditiously or effectually aroused rattles were sprung lanterns lighted and hoisted at the end of poles windows thrown open doors unbarred and as if by magic the street was instantaneously filled with a crowd of persons of both sexes armed with such weapons as came most readily to hand and dressed in such garments as could be most easily slipped on hurrying in the direction of the supposed arrest they encouraged each other with shouts and threatened the offending parties with their vengeance regardless as the gentry of the mint usually were for indeed they had become habituated from their frequent occurrence to such scenes of any outrages committed in their streets deaf as they had been to the recent scuffle before mrs sheppard's door they were always sufficiently on the alert to maintain their privileges and to assist each other against the attacks of their common enemy the sheriff's officer it was only by the adoption of such a course especially since the late act of suppression to which we have alluded that the inviolability of the asylum could be preserved incursions were often made upon its territories by the functionaries of the law sometimes attended with success but more frequently with discomfiture and it rarely happened unless by stratagem or bribery that in the language of the gentlemen of the short staff an important caption could be effected in order to guard against accidents or surprises watchmen or scouts as they were styled were stationed at the three main outlets of the sanctuary ready to give the signal in the manner just described bars were erected which in case of emergency could be immediately stretched across the streets doors were attached to the alleys and were never opened without due precautions gates were affixed to the courts wickets to the gates and bolts to the wickets the back windows of the houses where any such existed were strongly barricaded and kept constantly shut and the fortress was furthermore defended by high walls and deep ditches in those quarters where it appeared most exposed there was also a maze the name is still retained in the district into which the debtor could run and through the intricacies of which it was impossible for an officer to follow him without a clue whoever chose to incur the risk of so doing might enter the mint at any hour but no one was suffered to depart without giving a satisfactory account of himself or producing a pass from the master in short every contrivance that ingenuity could devise was resorted to by this horde of reprobates to secure themselves from danger or molestation whitefriars had lost its privileges salisbury court and the savoy no longer offered places of refuge to the debtor and it was therefore doubly requisite that the island of bermuda as the mint was termed by its occupants should uphold its rights as long as it was able to do so mr wood meantime had not remained idle aware that not a moment was to be lost if he meant to render any effectual assistance to the child he ceased shouting and defending himself in the best way he could from the attacks of rowland by whom he was closely pressed forced his way in spite of all opposition to davies and dealt him a blow on the head with such good will that had it not been for the intervention of the wall the ruffian must have been prostrated before he could recover from the stunning effects of the blow wood possessed himself of the child and untying the noose which had been slipped round its throat had the satisfaction of hearing it cry lustily at this juncture sir cecil and his followers appeared at the threshold he has escaped exclaimed the knight we have searched every corner of the house without finding a trace of him back cried rowland don't you hear those shouts yon fellow's clamour has brought the whole horde of jail birds and cut throats that infest this place about our ears we shall be torn in pieces if we are discovered davies he added calling to the attendant who was menacing wood with a severe retaliation don't heed him but if you value a whole skin come into the house and bring that woman with you she may afford us some necessary information davies reluctantly complied and dragging mrs sheppard who made no resistance along with him entered the house the door of which was instantly shut and barricaded a moment afterwards the street was illumined by a blaze of torchlight and a tumultuous uproar mixed with the clashing of weapons and the braying of horns announced the arrival of the first detachment of minters mr wood rushed instantly to meet them hurrah shouted he waving his hat triumphantly over his head saved ay ay it's all bob my covey you're safe enough that's certain responded the minters baying yelping leaping and howling around him like a pack of hounds when the huntsman is beating cover but where are the lurchers who asked wood the traps responded a bystander the shoulder clappers added a lady who in her anxiety to join the party had unintentionally substituted her husband's nether habiliments for her own petticoats the ban dogs thundered a tall man whose stature and former avocations had procured him the nickname of the long drover of the borough market where are they ay where are they chorussed the mob flourishing their various weapons and flashing their torches in the air we'll starve 'em out mr wood trembled he felt he had raised a storm which it would be very difficult if not impossible to allay he knew not what to say or what to do and his confusion was increased by the threatening gestures and furious looks of the ruffians in his immediate vicinity i don't understand you gentlemen stammered he at length what does he say roared the long drover he says he don't understand flash replied the lady in gentleman's attire cease your confounded clutter said a young man whose swarthy visage seen in the torchlight struck wood as being that of a mulatto you frighten the cull out of his senses it's plain he don't understand our lingo as how should he take pattern by me and as he said this he strode up to the carpenter and slapping him on the shoulder propounded the following questions accompanying each interrogation with a formidable contortion of countenance curse you where are the bailiffs rot you have you lost your tongue devil seize you you could bawl loud enough a moment ago silence blueskin interposed an authoritative voice immediately behind the ruffian let me have a word with the cull ay ay cried several of the bystanders let jonathan kimbaw the cove he's got the gift of the gab the crowd accordingly drew aside and the individual in whose behalf the movement had been made immediately stepped forward he was a young man of about two and twenty who without having anything remarkable either in dress or appearance was yet a noticeable person if only for the indescribable expression of cunning pervading his countenance his eyes were small and grey as far apart and as sly looking as those of a fox a physiognomist indeed would have likened him to that crafty animal and it must be owned the general formation of his features favoured such a comparison the nose was long and sharp the chin pointed the forehead broad and flat and connected without any intervening hollow with the eyelid the teeth when displayed seemed to reach from ear to ear then his beard was of a reddish hue and his complexion warm and sanguine those who had seen him slumbering averred that he slept with his eyes open but this might be merely a figurative mode of describing his customary vigilance certain it was that the slightest sound aroused him this astute personage was somewhat under the middle size but fairly proportioned inclining rather to strength than symmetry and abounding more in muscle than in flesh it would seem from the attention which he evidently bestowed upon the hidden and complex machinery of the grand system of villany at work around him that his chief object in taking up his quarters in the mint must have been to obtain some private information respecting the habits and practices of its inhabitants to be turned to account hereafter advancing towards wood jonathan fixed his keen gray eyes upon him and demanded in a stern tone whether the persons who had taken refuge in the adjoining house were bailiffs not that i know of replied the carpenter who had in some degree recovered his confidence then i presume you've not been arrested i have not answered wood firmly i guessed as much perhaps you'll next inform us why you have occasioned this disturbance because this child's life was threatened by the persons you have mentioned rejoined wood an excellent reason i' faith exclaimed blueskin with a roar of surprise and indignation which was echoed by the whole assemblage and so we're to be summoned from our beds and snug firesides because a kid happens to squall eh by the soul of my grandmother but this is too good do you intend to claim the privileges of the mint said jonathan calmly pursuing his interrogations amid the uproar is your person in danger not from my creditors replied wood significantly will he post the cole will he come down with the dues ask him that cried blueskin you hear pursued jonathan my friend desires to know if you are willing to pay your footing as a member of the ancient and respectable fraternity of debtors i owe no man a farthing and my name shall never appear in any such rascally list replied wood angrily i don't see why i should be obliged to pay for doing my duty i tell you this child would have been strangled the noose was at its throat when i called for help i knew it was in vain to cry 'murder' in the mint so i had recourse to stratagem well sir i must say you deserve some credit for your ingenuity at all events replied jonathan repressing a smile but before you put out your foot so far it would have been quite as prudent to consider how you were to draw it back again for my own part i don't see in what way it is to be accomplished except by the payment of our customary fees do not imagine you can at one moment avail yourself of our excellent regulations with which you seem sufficiently well acquainted and the next break them with impunity if you assume the character of a debtor for your own convenience you must be content to maintain it for ours if you have not been arrested we have been disturbed and it is but just and reasonable you should pay for occasioning such disturbance by your own showing you are in easy circumstances for it is only natural to presume that a man who owes nothing must be in a condition to pay liberally and you cannot therefore feel the loss of such a trifle as ten guineas however illogical and inconclusive these arguments might appear to mr wood and however he might dissent from the latter proposition he did not deem it expedient to make any reply and the orator proceeded with his harangue amid the general applause of the assemblage i am perhaps exceeding my authority in demanding so slight a sum continued jonathan modestly and the master of the mint may not be disposed to let you off so lightly he will be here in a moment or so and you will then learn his determination in the mean time let me advise you as a friend not to irritate him by a refusal which would be as useless as vexatious he has a very summary mode of dealing with refractory persons i assure you my best endeavours shall be used to bring you off on the easy terms i have mentioned do you call ten guineas easy terms cried wood with a look of dismay why i should expect to purchase the entire freehold of the mint for less money many a man has been glad to pay double the amount to get his head from under the mint pump observed blueskin gruffly let the gentleman take his own course said jonathan mildly i should be sorry to persuade him to do anything his calmer judgment might disapprove exactly my sentiments rejoined blueskin i wouldn't force him for the world but if he don't tip the stivers may i be cursed if he don't get a taste of the aqua pompaginis let's have a look at the kinchen that ought to have been throttled added he snatching the child from wood my stars here's a pretty lullaby cheat to make a fuss about ho ho deal with me as you think proper gentlemen exclaimed wood but for mercy's sake don't harm the child let it be taken to its mother and who is its mother asked jonathan in an eager whisper tell me frankly and speak under your breath your own safety the child's safety depends upon your candour while mr wood underwent this examination blueskin felt a small and trembling hand placed upon his own and turning at the summons beheld a young female whose features were partially concealed by a loo or half mask standing beside him coarse as were the ruffian's notions of feminine beauty he could not be insensible to the surpassing loveliness of the fair creature who had thus solicited his attention her figure was in some measure hidden by a large scarf and a deep hood drawn over the head contributed to her disguise still it was evident from her lofty bearing that she had nothing in common except an interest in their proceedings with the crew by whom she was surrounded whence she came who she was and what she wanted were questions which naturally suggested themselves to blueskin and he was about to seek for some explanation when his curiosity was checked by a gesture of silence from the lady hush said she in a low but agitated voice would you earn this purse i've no objection replied blueskin in a tone intended to be gentle but which sounded like the murmuring whine of a playful bear how much is there in it it contains gold replied the lady but i will add this ring what am i to do to earn it asked blueskin with a disgusting leer cut a throat or throw myself at your feet eh my dear give me that child returned the lady with difficulty overcoming the loathing inspired by the ruffian's familiarity oh i see replied blueskin winking significantly come nearer or they'll observe us don't be afraid i won't hurt you i'm always agreeable to the women bless their kind hearts now slip the purse into my hand bravo the best cly faker of 'em all couldn't have done it better and now for the fawney the ring i mean i'm no great judge of these articles ma'am but i trust to your honour not to palm off paste upon me it is a diamond said the lady in an agony of distress the child a diamond here take the kid cried blueskin slipping the infant adroitly under her scarf and so this is a diamond added he contemplating the brilliant from the hollow of his hand it does sparkle almost as brightly as your ogles by the by my dear i forgot to ask your name perhaps you'll oblige me with it now hell and the devil gone he looked around in vain the lady had disappeared chapter iii the master of the mint jonathan meanwhile having ascertained the parentage of the child from wood proceeded to question him in an under tone as to the probable motives of the attempt upon its life and though he failed in obtaining any information on this point he had little difficulty in eliciting such particulars of the mysterious transaction as have already been recounted when the carpenter concluded his recital jonathan was for a moment lost in reflection devilish strange thought he chuckling to himself queer business capital trick of the cull in the cloak to make another person's brat stand the brunt for his own capital ha ha won't do though he must be a sly fox to get out of the mint without my knowledge i've a shrewd guess where he's taken refuge but i'll ferret him out these bloods will pay well for his capture if not he'll pay well to get out of their hands so i'm safe either way ha ha blueskin he added aloud and motioning that worthy follow me upon which he set off in the direction of the entry his progress however was checked by loud acclamations announcing the arrival of the master of the mint and his train baptist kettleby for so was the master named was a goodly portly man and a corpulent whose fair round paunch bespoke the affection he entertained for good liquor and good living he had a quick shrewd merry eye and a look in which duplicity was agreeably veiled by good humour it was easy to discover that he was a knave but equally easy to perceive that he was a pleasant fellow a combination of qualities by no means of rare occurrence so far as regards his attire baptist was not seen to advantage no great lover of state or state costume at any time he was generally towards the close of an evening completely in dishabille and in this condition he now presented himself to his subjects his shirt was unfastened his vest unbuttoned his hose ungartered his feet were stuck into a pair of pantoufles his arms into a greasy flannel dressing gown his head into a thrum cap the cap into a tie periwig and the wig into a gold edged hat a white apron was tied round his waist and into the apron was thrust a short thick truncheon which looked very much like a rolling pin the master of the mint was accompanied by another gentleman almost as portly as himself and quite as deliberate in his movements the costume of this personage was somewhat singular and might have passed for a masquerading habit had not the imperturbable gravity of his demeanour forbidden any such supposition it consisted of a close jerkin of brown frieze ornamented with a triple row of brass buttons loose dutch slops made very wide in the seat and very tight at the knees red stockings with black clocks and a fur cap the owner of this dress had a broad weather beaten face small twinkling eyes and a bushy grizzled beard though he walked by the side of the governor he seldom exchanged a word with him but appeared wholly absorbed in the contemplations inspired by a broadbowled dutch pipe behind the illustrious personages just described marched a troop of stalwart fellows with white badges in their hats quarterstaves oaken cudgels and links in their hands these were the master's body guard advancing towards the master and claiming an audience which was instantly granted jonathan without much circumlocution related the sum of the strange story he had just learnt from wood omitting nothing except a few trifling particulars which he thought it politic to keep back and with this view he said not a word of there being any probability of capturing the fugitive but on the contrary roundly asserted that his informant had witnessed that person's escape the master listened with becoming attention to the narrative and at its conclusion shook his head gravely applied his thumb to the side of his nose and twirling his fingers significantly winked at his phlegmatic companion the gentleman appealed to shook his head in reply coughed as only a dutchman can cough and raising his hand from the bowl of his pipe went through precisely the same mysterious ceremonial as the master putting his own construction upon this mute interchange of opinions jonathan ventured to observe that it certainly was a very perplexing case but that he thought something might be made of it and if left to him he would undertake to manage the matter to the master's entire satisfaction ja ja muntmeester said the dutchman removing the pipe from his mouth and speaking in a deep and guttural voice leave the affair to johannes he'll settle it bravely and let ush go back to our brandewyn and hollandsche genever dese ere not schouts as you faind but jonkers on a vrolyk and if dey'd chanshed to keel de vrow sheppard's pet lamb dey'd have done her a servish by shaving it from dat unpleasant complaint de hempen fever with which its laatter days are threatened and of which its poor vader died myn got hanging runs in some families muntmeester it's hereditary like de jigt vat you call it gout haw haw if the child is destined to the gibbet van galgebrok replied the master joining in the laugh it'll never be choked by a footman's cravat that's certain but in regard to going back empty handed continued he altering his tone and assuming a dignified air it's quite out of the question with baptist kettleby to engage in a matter is to go through with it besides this is an affair which no one but myself can settle common offences may be decided upon by deputy but outrages perpetrated by men of rank as these appear to be must be judged by the master of the mint in person these are the decrees of the island of bermuda and i will never suffer its excellent laws to be violated gentlemen of the mint added he pointing with his truncheon towards mrs sheppard's house forward hurrah shouted the mob and the whole phalanx was put in motion in that direction at the same moment a martial flourish proceeding from cow's horns tin canisters filled with stones bladders and cat gut with other sprightly instruments was struck up and enlivened by this harmonious accompaniment the troop reached its destination in the best possible spirits for an encounter let us in said the master rapping his truncheon authoritatively against the boards or we'll force an entrance but as no answer was returned to the summons though it was again and more peremptorily repeated baptist seized a mallet from a bystander and burst open the door followed by van galgebrok and others of his retinue he then rushed into the room where rowland sir cecil and their attendants stood with drawn swords prepared to receive them beat down their blades cried the master no bloodshed beat out their brains you mean rejoined blueskin with a tremendous imprecation no half measures now master hadn't you better hold a moment's parley with the gentlemen before proceeding to extremities suggested jonathan agreed responded the master surely he added staring at rowland either i'm greatly mistaken or it is you are not mistaken baptist returned rowland with a gesture of silence it is your old friend i'm glad to recognise you and i'm glad your worship's recognition doesn't come too late observed the master but why didn't you make yourself known at once i'd forgotten the office you hold in the mint baptist replied rowland but clear the room of this rabble if you have sufficient authority over them i would speak with you there's but one way of clearing it your worship said the master archly i understand replied rowland give them what you please i'll repay you it's all right pals cried baptist in a loud tone the gentlemen and i have settled matters no more scuffling what's the meaning of all this demanded sir cecil how have you contrived to still these troubled waters i've chanced upon an old ally in the master of the mint answered rowland we may trust him he added in a whisper he is a staunch friend of the good cause blueskin clear the room cried the master these gentlemen would be private they've paid for their lodging where's jonathan inquiries were instantly made after that individual but he was nowhere to be found strange observed the master i thought he'd been at my elbow all this time but it don't much matter though he's a devilish shrewd fellow and might have helped me out of a difficulty had any occurred hark ye blueskin continued he addressing that personage who in obedience to his commands had with great promptitude driven out the rabble and again secured the door a word in your ear what female entered the house with us blood and thunder exclaimed blueskin afraid if he admitted having seen the lady of being compelled to divide the plunder he had obtained from her among his companions how should i know d'ye suppose i'm always thinking of the petticoats i observed no female but if any one did join the assault it must have been either amazonian kate or fighting moll the woman i mean did not join the assault rejoined the master but rather seemed to shun observation and from the hasty glimpse i caught of her she appeared to have a child in her arms then most probably it was the widow sheppard answered blueskin sulkily right said the master i didn't think of her and now i've another job for you propose it returned blueskin inclining his head square accounts with the rascal who got up the sham arrest and if he don't tip the cole without more ado give him a taste of the pump that's all he shall go through the whole course replied blueskin with a ferocious grin unless he comes down to the last grig we'll lather him with mud shave him with a rusty razor and drench him with aqua pompaginis master your humble servant gentlemen your most obsequious trout having effected his object which was to get rid of blueskin baptist turned to rowland and sir cecil who had watched his proceedings with much impatience and remarked now gentlemen the coast's clear we've nothing to interrupt us i'm entirely at your service chapter iv the roof and the window leaving them to pursue their conference we shall follow the footsteps of jonathan who as the master surmised and as we have intimated had unquestionably entered the house but at the beginning of the affray when he thought every one was too much occupied with his own concerns to remark his absence he slipped out of the room not for the purpose of avoiding the engagement for cowardice was not one of his failings but because he had another object in view creeping stealthily up stairs unmasking a dark lantern and glancing into each room as he passed he was startled in one of them by the appearance of mrs sheppard who seemed to be crouching upon the floor satisfied however that she did not notice him jonathan glided away as noiselessly as he came and ascended another short flight of stairs leading to the garret as he crossed this chamber his foot struck against something on the floor which nearly threw him down and stooping to examine the object he found it was a key never throw away a chance thought jonathan who knows but this key may open a golden lock one of these days and picking it up he thrust it into his pocket arrived beneath an aperture in the broken roof he was preparing to pass through it when he observed a little heap of tiles upon the floor which appeared to have been recently dislodged he has passed this way cried jonathan exultingly i have him safe enough he then closed the lantern mounted without much difficulty upon the roof and proceeded cautiously along the tiles the night was now profoundly dark jonathan had to feel his way a single false step might have precipitated him into the street or if he had trodden upon an unsound part of the roof he must have fallen through it he had nothing to guide him for though the torches were blazing ruddily below their gleam fell only on the side of the building the venturous climber gazed for a moment at the assemblage beneath to ascertain that he was not discovered and having satisfied himself in this particular he stepped out more boldly on gaining a stack of chimneys at the back of the house he came to a pause and again unmasked his lantern nothing however could be discerned except the crumbling brickwork confusion ejaculated jonathan can he have escaped no the walls are too high and the windows too stoutly barricaded in this quarter to admit such a supposition he can't be far off i shall find him yet ah i have it he added after a moment's deliberation he's there i'll be sworn and once more enveloping himself in darkness he pursued his course he had now reached the adjoining house and scaling the roof approached another building which seemed to be at least one story loftier than its neighbours apparently jonathan was well acquainted with the premises for feeling about in the dark he speedily discovered a ladder up the steps of which he hurried drawing a pistol and unclosing his lantern with the quickness of thought he then burst through an open trap door into a small loft the light fell upon the fugitive who stood before him in an attitude of defence with the child in his arms illustration aha exclaimed jonathan acting upon the information he had obtained from wood i have found you at last your servant mr darrell who are you demanded the fugitive sternly a friend replied jonathan uncocking the pistol and placing it in his pocket how do i know you are a friend asked darrell what should i do here alone if i were an enemy but come don't let us waste time in bandying words when we might employ it so much more profitably your life and that of your child are in my power what will you give me to save you from your pursuers can you do so asked the other doubtfully i can and will now the reward i have but an ill furnished purse but if i escape my gratitude pshaw interrupted jonathan scornfully your gratitude will vanish with your danger pay fools with promises i must have something in hand you shall have all i have about me replied darrell well well grumbled jonathan i suppose i must be content an ill lined purse is a poor recompense for the risk i have run however come along i needn't tell you to tread carefully you know the danger of this breakneck road as well as i do the light would betray us so saying he closed the lantern harkye sir rejoined darrell one word before i move i know not who you are and as i cannot discern your face i may be doing you an injustice but there is something in your voice that makes me distrust you if you attempt to play the traitor you will do so at the hazard of your life i have already hazarded my life in this attempt to save you returned jonathan boldly and with apparent frankness this ought to be sufficient answer to your doubts your pursuers are below what was to hinder me if i had been so inclined from directing them to your retreat enough replied darrell lead on followed by darrell jonathan retraced his dangerous path as he approached the gable of mrs sheppard's house loud yells and vociferations reached his ears and looking downwards he perceived a great stir amid the mob the cause of this uproar was soon manifest blueskin and the minters were dragging wood to the pump the unfortunate carpenter struggled violently but ineffectually his hat was placed upon one pole his wig on another his shouts for help were answered by roars of mockery and laughter he continued alternately to be tossed in the air or rolled in the kennel until he was borne out of sight the spectacle seemed to afford as much amusement to jonathan as to the actors engaged in it he could not contain his satisfaction but chuckled and rubbed his hands with delight by heaven cried darrell it is the poor fellow whom i placed in such jeopardy a short time ago i am the cause of his ill usage to be sure you are replied jonathan laughing but what of that it'll be a lesson to him in future and will show him the folly of doing a good natured action but perceiving that his companion did not relish his pleasantry and fearing that his sympathy for the carpenter's situation might betray him into some act of imprudence jonathan without further remark and by way of putting an end to the discussion let himself drop through the roof his example was followed by darrell but though the latter was somewhat embarrassed by his burthen he peremptorily declined jonathan's offer of assistance both however having safely landed they cautiously crossed the room and passed down the first flight of steps in silence at this moment a door was opened below lights gleamed on the walls and the figures of rowland and sir cecil were distinguished at the foot of the stairs darrell stopped and drew his sword you have betrayed me said he in a deep whisper to his companion but you shall reap the reward of your treachery be still returned jonathan in the same under tone and with great self possession i can yet save you and see he added as the figures drew back and the lights disappeared it's a false alarm they have retired however not a moment is to be lost give me your hand he then hurried darrell down another short flight of steps and entered a small chamber at the back of the house closing the door jonathan next produced his lantern and hastening towards the window undrew a bolt by which it was fastened a stout wooden shutter opening inwardly being removed disclosed a grating of iron bars this obstacle which appeared to preclude the possibility of egress in that quarter was speedily got rid of withdrawing another bolt and unhooking a chain suspended from the top of the casement jonathan pushed the iron framework outwards the bars dropped noiselessly and slowly down till the chain tightened at the staple you are free said he that grating forms a ladder by which you may descend in safety i learned the trick of the place from one paul groves who used to live here and who contrived the machine he used to call it his fire escape ha ha i've often used the ladder for my own convenience but i never expected to turn it to such good account and now sir have i kept faith with you you have replied darrell here is my purse and i trust you will let me know to whom i am indebted for this important service it matters not who i am replied jonathan taking the money as i said before i have little reliance upon professions of gratitude i know not how it is sighed darrell but i feel an unaccountable misgiving at quitting this place something tells me i am rushing on greater danger you know best replied jonathan sneeringly but if i were in your place i would take the chance of a future and uncertain risk to avoid a present and certain peril you are right replied darrell the weakness is past which is the nearest way to the river why it's an awkward road to direct you returned jonathan but if you turn to the right when you reach the ground and keep close to the mint wall you'll speedily arrive at white cross street white cross street if you turn again to the right will bring you into queen street queen street bearing to the left will conduct you to deadman's place and deadman's place to the water side not fifty yards from saint saviour's stairs where you're sure to get a boat the very point i aim at said darrell as he passed through the outlet stay said jonathan aiding his descent you had better take my lantern it may be useful to you perhaps you'll give me in return some token by which i may remind you of this occurrence in case we meet again your glove will suffice there it is replied the other tossing him the glove are you sure these bars touch the ground they come within a yard of it answered jonathan safe shouted darrell as he effected a secure landing good night so muttered jonathan having started the hare i'll now unleash the hounds with this praiseworthy determination he was hastening down stairs with the utmost rapidity when he encountered a female whom he took in the darkness to be mrs sheppard the person caught hold of his arm and in spite of his efforts to disengage himself detained him where is he asked she in an agitated whisper i heard his voice but i saw them on the stairs and durst not approach him for fear of giving the alarm if you mean the fugitive darrell he has escaped through the back window replied jonathan thank heaven she gasped well you women are forgiving creatures i must say observed jonathan sarcastically you thank heaven for the escape of the man who did his best to get your child's neck twisted what do you mean asked the female in astonishment i mean what i say replied jonathan perhaps you don't know that this darrell so contrived matters that your child should be mistaken for his own by which means it had a narrow escape from a tight cravat i can assure you however the scheme answered well enough for darrell has got off with his own brat then this is not my child exclaimed she with increased astonishment if you have a child there it certainly is not answered jonathan a little surprised for i left your brat in the charge of blueskin who is still among the crowd in the street unless as is not unlikely he's gone to see your other friend disciplined at the pump merciful providence exclaimed the female whose child can this be how the devil should i know replied jonathan gruffly i suppose it didn't drop through the ceiling did it are you quite sure it's flesh and blood asked he playfully pinching its arm till it cried out with pain my child my child exclaimed mrs sheppard rushing from the adjoining room where is it are you the mother of this child inquired the person who had first spoken addressing mrs sheppard i am i am cried the widow snatching the babe and pressing it to her breast with rapturous delight god be thanked i have found it we have both good reason to be grateful added the lady with great emotion 'sblood cried jonathan who had listened to the foregoing conversation with angry wonder i've been nicely done here fool that i was to part with my lantern but i'll soon set myself straight what ho lights lights and shouting as he went he flung himself down stairs where shall i fly exclaimed the lady bewildered with terror they will kill me if they find me as they would have killed my husband and child oh god my limbs fail me make an effort madam cried mrs sheppard as a storm of furious voices resounded from below and torches were seen mounting the stairs they are coming they are coming fly to the roof to the roof no cried the lady this room i recollect it has a back window it is shut said mrs sheppard it is open replied the lady rushing towards it and springing through the outlet where is she thundered jonathan who at this moment reached mrs sheppard she has flown up stairs replied the widow you lie hussy replied jonathan rudely pushing her aside as she vainly endeavoured to oppose his entrance into the room she is here hist cried he as a scream was heard from without by g she has missed her footing there was a momentary and terrible silence broken only by a few feeble groans sir cecil who with rowland and some others had entered the room rushed to the window with a torch he held down the light and a moment afterwards beckoned with a blanched cheek to rowland your sister is dead said he in a deep whisper her blood be upon her own head then replied rowland sternly why came she here she could not resist the hand of fate which drew her hither replied sir cecil mournfully descend and take charge of the body said rowland conquering his emotion by a great effort i will join you in a moment this accident rather confirms than checks my purpose the stain upon our family is only half effaced i have sworn the death of the villain and his bastard and i will keep my oath now sir he added turning to jonathan as sir cecil and his followers obeyed his injunctions you say you know the road which the person whom we seek has taken i do replied jonathan but i give no information gratis speak then said rowland placing money in his hand you'll find him at st saviours's stairs answered jonathan he's about to cross the river you'd better lose no time he has got five minutes' start of you but i sent him the longest way about the words were scarcely pronounced when rowland disappeared and now to see the end of it said jonathan shortly afterwards passing through the window good night master three persons only were left in the room these were the master of the mint van galgebrok and mrs sheppard a bad business this van observed baptist with a prolonged shake of the head ja ja muntmeester said the hollander shaking his head in reply very bad very but then they're staunch supporters of our friend over the water continued baptist winking significantly so we must e'en hush it up in the best way we can ja answered van galgebrok but sapperment i wish they hadn't broken my pipe jonathan wild promises well observed the master after a pause he'll become a great man mind i baptist kettleby say so he'll be hanged nevertheless replied the hollander giving his collar an ugly jerk mind i rykhart van galgebrok predict it and now let's go back to the shovels and finish our brandewyn and bier muntmeester alas cried mrs sheppard relieved by their departure and giving way to a passionate flood of tears were it not for my child i should wish to be in the place of that unfortunate lady chapter v the denunciation for a short space mrs sheppard remained dissolved in tears she then dried her eyes and laying her child gently upon the floor knelt down beside him open my heart father of mercy she murmured in a humble tone and with downcast looks and make me sensible of the error of my ways i have sinned deeply but i have been sorely tried spare me yet a little while father not for my own sake but for the sake of this poor babe her utterance was here choked by sobs but if it is thy will to take me from him she continued as soon as her emotion permitted her if he must be left an orphan amid strangers implant i beseech thee a mother's feelings in some other bosom and raise up a friend who shall be to him what i would have been let him not bear the weight of my punishment spare him pity me with this she arose and taking up the infant was about to proceed down stairs when she was alarmed by hearing the street door opened and the sound of heavy footsteps entering the house halloa widow shouted a rough voice from below where the devil are you mrs sheppard returned no answer i've got something to say to you continued the speaker rather less harshly something to your advantage so come out o' your hiding place and let's have some supper for i'm infernally hungry d'ye hear still the widow remained silent well if you won't come i shall help myself and that's unsociable pursued the speaker evidently from the noise he made suiting the action to the word devilish nice ham you've got here capital pie and as i live a flask of excellent canary you're in luck to night widow here's your health in a bumper and wishing you a better husband than your first it'll be your own fault if you don't soon get another and a proper young man into the bargain here's his health likewise what mum still you're the first widow i ever heard of who could withstand that lure i'll try the effect of a jolly stave and he struck up the following ballad illustration illustration

gentleman come to offer you his hand 'he that woos a maid' fol de rol hiccupping i'll soon find you out mrs sheppard whose distress at the consumption of the provisions had been somewhat allayed by the anticipation of the intruder's departure after he had satisfied his appetite was now terrified in the extreme by seeing a light approach and hearing footsteps on the stairs her first impulse was to fly to the window and she was about to pass through it at the risk of sharing the fate of the unfortunate lady when her arm was grasped by some one in the act of ascending the ladder from without uttering a faint scream she sank backwards and would have fallen if it had not been for the interposition of blueskin who at that moment staggered into the room with a candle in one hand and the bottle in the other oh you're here are you said the ruffian with an exulting laugh i've been looking for you everywhere let me go implored mrs sheppard pray let me go you hurt the child don't you hear how you've made it cry throttle the kid rejoined blueskin fiercely if you don't stop its squalling i will i hate children and if i'd my own way i'd drown 'em all like a litter o' puppies well knowing the savage temper of the person she had to deal with and how likely he was to put his threat into execution mrs sheppard did not dare to return any answer but disengaging herself from his embrace endeavoured meekly to comply with his request and now widow continued the ruffian setting down the candle and applying his lips to the bottle neck as he flung his heavy frame upon a bench i've a piece o' good news for you good news will be news to me what is it guess rejoined blueskin attempting to throw a gallant expression into his forbidding countenance mrs sheppard trembled violently and though she understood his meaning too well she answered i can't guess well then returned the ruffian to put you out o' suspense as the topsman remarked to poor tom sheppard afore he turned him off i'm come to make you an honourable proposal o' marriage you won't refuse me i'm sure so no more need be said about the matter to morrow we'll go to the fleet and get spliced don't shake so what i said about your brat was all stuff i didn't mean it it's my way when i'm ruffled i shall take to him as nat'ral as if he were my own flesh and blood afore long i'll give him the edication of a prig teach him the use of his forks betimes and make him in the end as clever a cracksman as his father never shrieked mrs sheppard never never halloa what's this demanded blueskin springing to his feet do you mean to say that if i support your kid i shan't bring him up how i please eh don't question me but leave me replied the widow wildly you had better leave you echoed the ruffian with a contemptuous laugh not just yet i am not unprotected rejoined the poor woman there's some one at the window help help but her cries were unheeded and blueskin who for a moment had looked round distrustfully concluding it was a feint now laughed louder than ever it won't do widow said he drawing near her while she shrank from his approach so you may spare your breath come come be reasonable and listen to me your kid has already brought me good luck and may bring me still more if his edication's attended to this purse he added chinking it in the air and this ring were given me for him just now by the lady who made a false step on leaving your house if i'd been in the way instead of jonathan wild that accident wouldn't have happened as he said this a slight noise was heard without what's that ejaculated the ruffian glancing uneasily towards the window who's there pshaw it's only the wind it's jonathan wild returned the widow endeavouring to alarm him i told you i was not unprotected he protect you retorted blueskin maliciously you haven't a worse enemy on the face of the earth than jonathan wild if you'd read your husband's dying speech you'd know that he laid his death at jonathan's door and with reason too as i can testify man screamed mrs sheppard with a vehemence that shook even the hardened wretch beside her begone and tempt me not what should i tempt you to asked blueskin in surprise to to no matter what returned the widow distractedly go go i see what you mean rejoined blueskin tossing a large case knife which he took from his pocket in the air and catching it dexterously by the haft as it fell you owe jonathan a grudge so do i he hanged your first husband just speak the word he added drawing the knife significantly across his throat and i'll put it out of his power to do the same by your second but d n him let's talk o' something more agreeable look at this ring it's a diamond and worth a mint o' money it shall be your wedding ring look at it i say the lady's name's engraved inside but so small i can scarcely read it a l i v a aliva t r e n trencher that's it aliva trencher aliva trenchard exclaimed mrs sheppard hastily is that the name ay ay now i look again it is trenchard how came you to know it have you heard the name before i think i have long long ago when i was a child replied mrs sheppard passing her hand across her brow but my memory is gone quite gone where can i have heard it devil knows rejoined blueskin let it pass the ring's yours and you're mine here put it on your finger mrs sheppard snatched back her hand from his grasp and exerted all her force to repel his advances set down the kid roared blueskin savagely mercy screamed mrs sheppard struggling to escape and holding the infant at arm's length have mercy on this helpless innocent and the child alarmed by the strife added its feeble cries to its mother's shrieks set it down i tell you thundered blueskin or i shall do it a mischief never cried mrs sheppard uttering a terrible imprecation blueskin placed the knife between his teeth and endeavoured to seize the poor woman by the throat in the struggle her cap fell off the ruffian caught hold of her hair and held her fast the chamber rang with her shrieks but her cries instead of moving her assailant's compassion only added to his fury planting his knee against her side he pulled her towards him with one hand while with the other he sought his knife the child was now within reach and in another moment he would have executed his deadly purpose if an arm from behind had not felled him to the ground when mrs sheppard who had been stricken down by the blow that prostrated her assailant looked up she perceived jonathan wild kneeling beside the body of blueskin he was holding the ring to the light and narrowly examining the inscription trenchard he muttered aliva trenchard they were right then as to the name well if she survives the accident as the blood who styles himself sir cecil fancies she may do this ring will make my fortune by leading to the discovery of the chief parties concerned in this strange affair is the poor lady alive asked mrs sheppard eagerly 'sblood exclaimed jonathan hastily thrusting the ring into his vest and taking up a heavy horseman's pistol with which he had felled blueskin i thought you'd been senseless is she alive repeated the widow what's that to you demanded jonathan gruffly oh nothing nothing returned mrs sheppard but pray tell me if her husband has escaped her husband echoed jonathan scornfully a husband has little to fear from his wife's kinsfolk her lover darrell has embarked upon the thames where if he's not capsized by the squall for it's blowing like the devil he stands a good chance of getting his throat cut by his pursuers ha ha i tracked 'em to the banks of the river and should have followed to see it out if the watermen hadn't refused to take me however as things have turned up it's fortunate that i came back it is indeed replied mrs sheppard most fortunate for me for you exclaimed jonathan don't flatter yourself that i'm thinking of you blueskin might have butchered you and your brat before i'd have lifted a finger to prevent him if it hadn't suited my purposes to do so and he hadn't incurred my displeasure i never forgive an injury your husband could have told you that how had he offended you inquired the widow i'll tell you answered jonathan sternly he thwarted my schemes twice the first time i overlooked the offence but the second time when i had planned to break open the house of his master the fellow who visited you to night wood the carpenter of wych street he betrayed me i told him i would bring him to the gallows and i was as good as my word you were so replied mrs sheppard and for that wicked deed you will one day be brought to the gallows yourself not before i have conducted your child thither retorted jonathan with a withering look ah ejaculated mrs sheppard paralysed by the threat if that sickly brat lives to be a man continued jonathan rising i'll hang him upon the same tree as his father pity shrieked the widow i'll be his evil genius vociferated jonathan who seemed to enjoy her torture begone wretch cried the mother stung beyond endurance by his taunts or i will drive you hence with my curses curse on and welcome jeered wild mrs sheppard raised her hand and the malediction trembled upon her tongue but ere the words could find utterance her maternal tenderness overcame her indignation and sinking upon her knees she extended her arms over her child a mother's prayers a mother's blessings she cried with the fervour almost of inspiration will avail against a fiend's malice we shall see rejoined jonathan turning carelessly upon his heel and as he quitted the room the poor widow fell with her face upon the floor chapter vi the storm as soon as he was liberated by his persecutors mr wood set off at full speed from the mint and hurrying he scarce knew whither for there was such a continual buzzing in his ears and dancing in his eyes as almost to take away the power of reflection he held on at a brisk pace till his strength completely failed him on regaining his breath he began to consider whither chance had led him and rubbing his eyes to clear his sight he perceived a sombre pile with a lofty tower and broad roof immediately in front of him this structure at once satisfied him as to where he stood he knew it to be st saviour's church as he looked up at the massive tower the clock tolled forth the hour of midnight the solemn strokes were immediately answered by a multitude of chimes sounding across the thames amongst which the deep note of saint paul's was plainly distinguishable a feeling of inexplicable awe crept over the carpenter as the sounds died away he trembled not from any superstitious dread but from an undefined sense of approaching danger the peculiar appearance of the sky was not without some influence in awakening these terrors over one of the pinnacles of the tower a speck of pallid light marked the position of the moon then newly born and newly risen it was still profoundly dark but the wind which had begun to blow with some violence chased the clouds rapidly across the heavens and dispersed the vapours hanging nearer the earth sometimes the moon was totally eclipsed at others it shed a wan and ghastly glimmer over the masses rolling in the firmament not a star could be discerned but in their stead streaks of lurid radiance whence proceeding it was impossible to determine shot ever and anon athwart the dusky vault and added to the ominous and threatening appearance of the night alarmed by these prognostications of a storm and feeling too much exhausted from his late severe treatment to proceed further on foot wood endeavoured to find a tavern where he might warm and otherwise refresh himself with this view he struck off into a narrow street on the left and soon entered a small alehouse over the door of which hung the sign of the welsh trumpeter let me have a glass of brandy said he addressing the host too late master replied the landlord of the trumpeter in a surly tone for he did not much like the appearance of his customer just shut up shop zounds david pugh don't you know your old friend and countryman exclaimed the carpenter ah owen wood is it you cried david in astonishment what the devil makes you out so late and what has happened to you man eh you seem in a queer plight give me the brandy and i'll tell you replied wood here wife hostess fetch me that bottle from the second shelf in the corner cupboard there mr wood cried david pouring out a glass of the spirit and offering it to the carpenter that'll warm the cockles of your heart don't be afraid man off with it it's right nantz i keep it for my own drinking he added in a lower tone mr wood having disposed of the brandy and pronounced himself much better hurried close to the fire side and informed his friend in a few words of the inhospitable treatment he had experienced from the gentlemen of the mint whereupon mr pugh who as well as the carpenter was a descendant of cadwallader waxed extremely wrath gave utterance to a number of fierce sounding imprecations in the welsh tongue and was just beginning to express the greatest anxiety to catch some of the rascals at the trumpeter when mr wood cut him short by stating his intention of crossing the river as soon as possible in order to avoid the storm a storm exclaimed the landlord gadzooks i thought something was coming on for when i looked at the weather glass an hour ago it had sunk lower than i ever remember it we shall have a durty night on it to a sartinty landlord observed an old one eyed sailor who sat smoking his pipe by the fire side the glass never sinks in that way d'ye see without a hurricane follerin' i've knowed it often do so in the west injees moreover a souple o' porpusses came up with the tide this mornin' and ha' bin flounderin' about i' the thames abuv lunnun bridge all day long and them say monsters you know always proves sure fore runners of a gale then the sooner i'm off the better cried wood what's to pay david don't affront me owen by asking such a question returned the landlord hadn't you better stop and finish the bottle not a drop more replied wood enough's as good as a feast good night well if you won't be persuaded and must have a boat owen observed the landlord there's a waterman asleep on that bench will help you to as tidy a craft as any on the thames halloa ben cried he shaking a broad backed fellow equipped in a short skirted doublet and having a badge upon his arm scullers wanted holloa my hearty cried ben starting to his feet this gentleman wants a pair of oars said the landlord where to master asked ben touching his woollen cap arundel stairs replied wood the nearest point to wych street come along master said the waterman hark 'ee ben said the old sailor knocking the ashes from his pipe upon the hob you may try but dash my timbers if you'll ever cross the thames to night and why not old saltwater inquired ben turning a quid in his mouth 'cos there's a gale a getting up as'll perwent you young freshwater replied the tar it must look sharp then or i shall give it the slip laughed ben the gale never yet blowed as could perwent my crossing the thames the weather's been foul enough for the last fortnight but i've never turned my back upon it may be not replied the old sailor drily but you'll find it too stiff for you to night anyhow howsomdever if you should reach t'other side take an old feller's advice and don't be foolhardy enough to venter back again i tell 'ee what saltwater said ben i'll lay you my fare and that'll be two shillin' i'm back in an hour done cried the old sailor but vere'll be the use o' vinnin' you von't live to pay me never fear replied ben gravely dead or alive i'll pay you if i lose there's my thumb upon it come along master i tell 'ee what landlord observed the old sailor quietly replenishing his pipe from a huge pewter tobacco box as the waterman and wood quitted the house you've said good b'ye to your friend odd's me do you think so cried the host of the trumpeter i'll run and bring him back he's a welshman and i wouldn't for a trifle that any accident befel him never mind said the old sailor taking up a piece of blazing coal with the tongs and applying it to his pipe let 'em try they'll be back soon enough or not at all mr wood and the waterman meanwhile proceeded in the direction of st saviour's stairs casting a hasty glance at the old and ruinous prison belonging to the liberty of the bishop of winchester whose palace formerly adjoined the river called the clink which gave its name to the street along which he walked and noticing with some uneasiness the melancholy manner in which the wind whistled through its barred casements the carpenter followed his companion down an opening to the right and presently arrived at the water side moored to the steps several wherries were dancing in the rushing current as if impatient of restraint into one of these the waterman jumped and having assisted mr wood to a seat within it immediately pushed from land ben had scarcely adjusted his oars when the gleam of a lantern was seen moving towards the bank a shout was heard at a little distance and the next moment a person rushed with breathless haste to the stair head boat there cried a voice which mr wood fancied he recognised you'll find a waterman asleep under his tilt in one of them ere craft if you look about sir replied ben backing water as he spoke can't you take me with you urged the voice i'll make it well worth your while i've a child here whom i wish to convey across the water without loss of time a child thought wood it must be the fugitive darrell hold hard cried he addressing the waterman i'll give the gentleman a lift unpossible master rejoined ben the tide's running down like a mill sluice and the wind's right in our teeth old saltwater was right we shall have a reg'lar squall afore we gets across d'ye hear how the wanes creaks on old winchester house we shall have a touch on it ourselves presently but i shall lose my wager if i stay a moment longer so here goes upon which he plunged his oars deeply into the stream and the bark shot from the strand mr wood's anxiety respecting the fugitive was speedily relieved by hearing another waterman busy himself in preparation for starting and shortly after the dip of a second pair of oars sounded upon the river curse me if i don't think all the world means to cross the thames this fine night observed ben one'd think it rained fares as well as blowed great guns why there's another party on the stair head inquiring arter scullers and by the mass they appear in a greater hurry than any on us his attention being thus drawn to the bank the carpenter beheld three figures one of whom bore a torch leap into a wherry of a larger size than the others which immediately put off from shore manned by a couple of watermen who rowed with great swiftness this wherry dashed through the current in the track of the fugitive of whom it was evidently in pursuit and upon whom it perceptibly gained mr wood strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of the flying skiff but he could only discern a black and shapeless mass floating upon the water at a little distance which to his bewildered fancy appeared absolutely standing still to the practised eye of the waterman matters wore a very different air he perceived clearly enough that the chase was moving quickly and he was also aware from the increased rapidity with which the oars were urged that every exertion was made on board to get out of the reach of her pursuers at one moment it seemed as if the flying bark was about to put to shore but this plan probably from its danger was instantly abandoned not however before her momentary hesitation had been taken advantage of by her pursuers who redoubling their efforts at this juncture materially lessened the distance between them ben watched these manoeuvres with great interest and strained every sinew in his frame to keep ahead of the other boats them's catchpoles i s'pose sir arter the gemman with a writ he observed something worse i fear wood replied why you don't think as how they're crimps do you ben inquired i don't know what i think wood answered sulkily and he bent his eyes upon the water as if he wished to avert his attention forcibly from the scene there is something that inspires a feeling of inexpressible melancholy in sailing on a dark night upon the thames the sounds that reach the ear and the objects that meet the eye are all calculated to awaken a train of sad and serious contemplation the ripple of the water against the boat as its keel cleaves through the stream the darkling current hurrying by the indistinctly seen craft of all forms and all sizes hovering around and making their way in ghost like silence or warning each other of their approach by cries that heard from afar have something doleful in their note the solemn shadows cast by the bridges the deeper gloom of the echoing arches the lights glimmering from the banks the red reflection thrown upon the waves by a fire kindled on some stationary barge the tall and fantastic shapes of the houses as discerned through the obscurity these and other sights and sounds of the same character give a sombre colour to the thoughts of one who may choose to indulge in meditation at such a time and in such a place but it was otherwise with the carpenter this was no night for the indulgence of dreamy musing it was a night of storm and terror which promised each moment to become more stormy and more terrible not a bark could be discerned on the river except those already mentioned the darkness was almost palpable and the wind which hitherto had been blowing in gusts was suddenly lulled it was a dead calm but this calm was more awful than the previous roaring of the blast amid this portentous hush the report of a pistol reached the carpenter's ears and raising his head at the sound he beheld a sight which filled him with fresh apprehensions by the light of a torch borne at the stern of the hostile wherry he saw that the pursuers had approached within a short distance of the object of their quest the shot had taken effect upon the waterman who rowed the chase he had abandoned his oars and the boat was drifting with the stream towards the enemy escape was now impossible darrell stood erect in the bark with his drawn sword in hand prepared to repel the attack of his assailants who in their turn seemed to await with impatience the moment which should deliver him into their power they had not to tarry long in another instant the collision took place the watermen who manned the larger wherry immediately shipped their oars grappled with the drifting skiff and held it fast wood then beheld two persons one of whom he recognised as rowland spring on board the chase a fierce struggle ensued there was a shrill cry instantly succeeded by a deep splash put about waterman for god's sake cried wood whose humanity got the better of every personal consideration some one is overboard give way and let us render what assistance we can to the poor wretch it's all over with him by this time master replied ben turning the head of his boat and rowing swiftly towards the scene of strife but d n him he was the chap as hit poor bill thomson just now and i don't much care if he should be food for fishes as ben spoke they drew near the opposing parties the contest was now carried on between rowland and darrell the latter had delivered himself from one of his assailants the attendant davies hurled over the sides of the skiff the ruffian speedily found a watery grave it was a spring tide at half ebb and the current which was running fast and furiously bore him instantly away while the strife raged between the principals the watermen in the larger wherry were occupied in stemming the force of the torrent and endeavouring to keep the boats they had lashed together stationary owing to this circumstance mr wood's boat impelled alike by oar and tide shot past the mark at which it aimed and before it could be again brought about the struggle had terminated for a few minutes darrell seemed to have the advantage in the conflict neither combatant could use his sword and in strength the fugitive was evidently superior to his antagonist the boat rocked violently with the struggle had it not been lashed to the adjoining wherry it must have been upset and have precipitated the opponents into the water rowland felt himself sinking beneath the powerful grasp of his enemy he called to the other attendant who held the torch understanding the appeal the man snatched his master's sword from his grasp and passed it through darrell's body the next moment a heavy plunge told that the fugitive had been consigned to the waves darrell however rose again instantly and though mortally wounded made a desperate effort to regain the boat my child he groaned faintly well reminded answered rowland who had witnessed his struggles with a smile of gratified vengeance i had forgotten the accursed imp in this confusion take it he cried lifting the babe from the bottom of the boat and flinging it towards its unfortunate father the child fell within a short distance of darrell who hearing the splash struck out in that direction and caught it before it sank at this juncture the sound of oars reached his ears and he perceived mr wood's boat bearing up towards him here he is waterman exclaimed the benevolent carpenter i see him row for your life that's the way to miss him master replied ben coolly we must keep still the tide'll bring him to us fast enough ben judged correctly borne along by the current darrell was instantly at the boat's side seize this oar vociferated the waterman first take the child cried darrell holding up the infant and clinging to the oar with a dying effort give it me returned the carpenter all's safe now lend me your own hand my strength fails me gasped the fugitive i cannot climb the boat take my child to it is oh god i am sinking take it take it where shouted wood darrell attempted to reply but he could only utter an inarticulate exclamation the next moment his grasp relaxed and he sank to rise no more rowland meantime alarmed by the voices snatched a torch from his attendant and holding it over the side of the wherry witnessed the incident just described illustration confusion cried he there is another boat in our wake they have rescued the child loose the wherry and stand to your oars quick quick these commands were promptly obeyed the boat was set free and the men resumed their seats rowland's purposes were however defeated in a manner as unexpected as appalling during the foregoing occurrences a dead calm prevailed but as rowland sprang to the helm and gave the signal for pursuit a roar like a volley of ordnance was heard aloft and the wind again burst its bondage a moment before the surface of the stream was black as ink it was now whitening hissing and seething like an enormous cauldron the blast once more swept over the agitated river whirled off the sheets of foam scattered them far and wide in rain drops and left the raging torrent blacker than before the gale had become a hurricane that hurricane was the most terrible that ever laid waste our city destruction everywhere marked its course steeples toppled and towers reeled beneath its fury trees were torn up by the roots many houses were levelled to the ground others were unroofed the leads on the churches were ripped off and shrivelled up like scrolls of parchment nothing on land or water was spared by the remorseless gale most of the vessels lying in the river were driven from their moorings dashed tumultuously against each other or blown ashore all was darkness horror confusion ruin men fled from their tottering habitations and returned to them scared by greater dangers the end of the world seemed at hand at this time of universal havoc and despair when all london quaked at the voice of the storm the carpenter who was exposed to its utmost fury fared better than might have been anticipated the boat in which he rode was not overset fortunately her course had been shifted immediately after the rescue of the child and in consequence of this movement she received the first shock of the hurricane which blew from the southwest upon her stern her head dipped deeply into the current and she narrowly escaped being swamped righting however instantly afterwards she scudded with the greatest rapidity over the boiling waves to whose mercy she was now entirely abandoned on this fresh outburst of the storm wood threw himself instinctively into the bottom of the boat and clasping the little orphan to his breast endeavoured to prepare himself to meet his fate while he was thus occupied he felt a rough grasp upon his arm and presently afterwards ben's lips approached close to his ear the waterman sheltered his mouth with his hand while he spoke or his voice would have been carried away by the violence of the blast it's all up master groaned ben nothin' short of a merracle can save us the boat's sure to run foul o' the bridge and if she 'scapes stavin' above she'll be swamped to a sartainty below there'll be a fall of above twelve foot o' water and think o' that on a night as 'ud blow a whole fleet to the devil mr wood did think of it and groaned aloud heaven help us he exclaimed we were mad to neglect the old sailor's advice that's what troubles me rejoined ben i tell 'ee what master if you're more fortinate nor i am and get ashore give old saltwater your fare i pledged my thumb that dead or alive i'd pay the wager if i lost and i should like to be as good as my word i will i will replied wood hastily was that thunder he faltered as a terrible clap was heard overhead no it's only a fresh gale ben returned hark now it comes lord have mercy upon us miserable sinners ejaculated wood as a fearful gust dashed the water over the side of the boat deluging him with spray the hurricane had now reached its climax the blast shrieked as if exulting in its wrathful mission stunning and continuous the din seemed almost to take away the power of hearing he who had faced the gale would have been instantly stifled piercing through every crevice in the clothes it in some cases tore them from the wearer's limbs or from his grasp it penetrated the skin benumbed the flesh paralysed the faculties the intense darkness added to the terror of the storm the destroying angel hurried by shrouded in his gloomiest apparel none saw though all felt his presence and heard the thunder of his voice imagination coloured by the obscurity peopled the air with phantoms ten thousand steeds appeared to be trampling aloft charged with the work of devastation awful shapes seemed to flit by borne on the wings of the tempest animating and directing its fury the actual danger was lost sight of in these wild apprehensions and many timorous beings were scared beyond reason's verge by the excess of their fears this had well nigh been the case with the carpenter he was roused from the stupor of despair into which he had sunk by the voice of ben who roared in his ear the bridge the bridge chapter vii old london bridge london at the period of this history boasted only a single bridge but that bridge was more remarkable than any the metropolis now possesses covered with houses from one end to the other this reverend and picturesque structure presented the appearance of a street across the thames it was as if grace church street with all its shops its magazines and ceaseless throng of passengers were stretched from the middlesex to the surrey shore the houses were older the shops gloomier and the thoroughfare narrower it is true but the bustle the crowd the street like air was the same then the bridge had arched gateways bristling with spikes and garnished as all ancient gateways ought to be with the heads of traitors in olden days it boasted a chapel dedicated to saint thomas beneath which there was a crypt curiously constructed amid the arches where was sepultured peter the chaplain of colechurch who began the stone bridge at london and it still boasted an edifice though now in rather a tumbledown condition which had once vied with a palace we mean nonesuch house the other buildings stood close together in rows and so valuable was every inch of room accounted that in many cases cellars and even habitable apartments were constructed in the solid masonry of the piers old london bridge the grandsire of the present erection was supported on nineteen arches each of which would a rialto make for depth and height the arches stood upon enormous piers the piers on starlings or jetties built far out into the river to break the force of the tide roused by ben's warning the carpenter looked up and could just perceive the dusky outline of the bridge looming through the darkness and rendered indistinctly visible by the many lights that twinkled from the windows of the lofty houses as he gazed at these lights they suddenly seemed to disappear and a tremendous shock was felt throughout the frame of the boat wood started to his feet he found that the skiff had been dashed against one of the buttresses of the bridge jump cried ben in a voice of thunder wood obeyed his fears supplied him with unwonted vigour though the starling was more than two feet above the level of the water he alighted with his little charge which he had never for an instant quitted in safety upon it poor ben was not so fortunate just as he was preparing to follow the wherry containing rowland and his men which had drifted in their wake was dashed against his boat the violence of the collision nearly threw him backwards and caused him to swerve as he sprang his foot touched the rounded edge of the starling and glanced off precipitating him into the water as he fell he caught at the projecting masonry but the stone was slippery and the tide which here began to feel the influence of the fall was running with frightful velocity he could not make good his hold but uttering a loud cry he was swept away by the headlong torrent mr wood heard the cry but his own situation was too perilous to admit of his rendering any assistance to the ill fated waterman he fancied indeed that he beheld a figure spring upon the starling at the moment when the boats came in contact but as he could perceive no one near him he concluded he must have been mistaken illustration in order to make mr wood's present position and subsequent proceedings fully intelligible it may be necessary to give some notion of the shape and structure of the platform on which he had taken refuge it has been said that the pier of each arch or lock of old london bridge was defended from the force of the tide by a huge projecting spur called a starling these starlings varied in width according to the bulk of the pier they surrounded but they were all pretty nearly of the same length and built somewhat after the model of a boat having extremities as sharp and pointed as the keel of a canoe cased and ribbed with stone and braced with horizontal beams of timber the piles which formed the foundation of these jetties had resisted the strong encroachments of the current for centuries some of them are now buried at the bottom of the thames the starling on which the carpenter stood was the fourth from the surrey shore it might be three yards in width and a few more in length but it was covered with ooze and slime and the waves continually broke over it the transverse spars before mentioned were as slippery as ice and the hollows between them were filled ankle deep with water the carpenter threw himself flat upon the starling to avoid the fury of the wind but in this posture he fared worse than ever if he ran less risk of being blown over he stood a much greater chance of being washed off or stifled as he lay on his back he fancied himself gradually slipping off the platform springing to his feet in an ecstasy of terror he stumbled and had well nigh realized his worst apprehensions he next tried to clamber up the flying buttresses and soffits of the pier in the hope of reaching some of the windows and other apertures with which as a man of war is studded with port holes the sides of the bridge were pierced but this wild scheme was speedily abandoned and nerved by despair the carpenter resolved to hazard an attempt from the execution almost from the contemplation of which he had hitherto shrunk this was to pass under the arch along the narrow ledge of the starling and if possible attain the eastern platform where protected by the bridge he would suffer less from the excessive violence of the gale assured if he remained much longer where he was he would inevitably perish wood recommended himself to the protection of heaven and began his perilous course carefully sustaining the child which even in that terrible extremity he had not the heart to abandon he fell upon his knees and guiding himself with his right hand crept slowly on he had scarcely entered the arch when the indraught was so violent and the noise of the wind so dreadful and astounding that he almost determined to relinquish the undertaking but the love of life prevailed over his fears he went on the ledge along which he crawled was about a foot wide in length the arch exceeded seventy feet to the poor carpenter it seemed an endless distance when by slow and toilsome efforts he had arrived midway something obstructed his further progress it was a huge stone placed there by some workmen occupied in repairing the structure cold drops stood upon wood's brow as he encountered this obstacle to return was impossible to raise himself certain destruction he glanced downwards at the impetuous torrent which he could perceive shooting past him with lightning swiftness in the gloom he listened to the thunder of the fall now mingling with the roar of the blast and driven almost frantic by what he heard and saw he pushed with all his force against the stone to his astonishment and delight it yielded to the pressure toppled over the ledge and sank such was the hubbub and tumult around him that the carpenter could not hear its plunge into the flood his course however was no longer interrupted and he crept on after encountering other dangers and being twice compelled to fling himself flat upon his face to avoid slipping from the wet and slimy pathway he was at length about to emerge from the lock when to his inexpressible horror he found he had lost the child all the blood in his veins rushed to his heart and he shook in every limb as he made this discovery a species of vertigo seized him his brain reeled he fancied that the whole fabric of the bridge was cracking over head that the arch was tumbling upon him that the torrent was swelling around him whirling him off and about to bury him in the deafening abyss he shrieked with agony and clung with desperate tenacity to the roughened stones but calmer thoughts quickly succeeded on taxing his recollection the whole circumstance rushed to mind with painful distinctness he remembered that before he attempted to dislodge the stone he had placed the child in a cavity of the pier which the granite mass had been intended to fill this obstacle being removed in his eagerness to proceed he had forgotten to take his little charge with him it was still possible the child might be in safety and so bitterly did the carpenter reproach himself with his neglect that he resolved at all risks to go back in search of it acting upon this humane determination he impelled himself slowly backwards for he did not dare to face the blast and with incredible labour and fatigue reached the crevice his perseverance was amply rewarded the child was still safe it lay undisturbed in the remotest corner of the recess so overjoyed was the carpenter with the successful issue of his undertaking that he scarcely paused a moment to recruit himself but securing the child set out upon his return retracing his steps he arrived without further accident at the eastern platform of the starling as he anticipated he was here comparatively screened from the fury of the wind and when he gazed upon the roaring fall beneath him visible through the darkness in a glistening sheet of foam his heart overflowed with gratitude for his providential deliverance as he moved about upon the starling mr wood became sensible that he was not alone some one was standing beside him this then must be the person whom he had seen spring upon the western platform at the time of the collision between the boats the carpenter well knew from the obstacle which had interfered with his own progress that the unknown could not have passed through the same lock as himself but he might have crept along the left side of the pier and beneath the further arch whereas wood as we have seen took his course upon the right the darkness prevented the carpenter from discerning the features or figure of the stranger and the ceaseless din precluded the possibility of holding any communication by words with him wood however made known his presence to the individual by laying his hand upon his shoulder the stranger started at the touch and spoke but his words were borne away by the driving wind finding all attempts at conversation with his companion in misfortune in vain wood in order to distract his thoughts looked up at the gigantic structure standing like a wall of solid darkness before him what was his transport on perceiving that a few yards above him a light was burning the carpenter did not hesitate a moment he took a handful of the gravelly mud with which the platform was covered and threw the small pebbles one by one towards the gleam a pane of glass was shivered by each stone the signal of distress was evidently understood the light disappeared the window was shortly after opened and a rope ladder with a lighted horn lantern attached to it let down wood grasped his companion's arm to attract his attention to this unexpected means of escape the ladder was now within reach both advanced towards it when by the light of the lantern wood beheld in the countenance of the stranger the well remembered and stern features of rowland the carpenter trembled for he perceived rowland's gaze fixed first upon the infant and then on himself it is her child shrieked rowland in a voice heard above the howling of the tempest risen from this roaring abyss to torment me its parents have perished and shall their wretched offspring live to blight my hopes and blast my fame never and with these words he grasped wood by the throat and despite his resistance dragged him to the very verge of the platform all this juncture a thundering crash was heard against the side of the bridge a stack of chimneys on the house above them had yielded to the storm and descended in a shower of bricks and stones when the carpenter a moment afterwards stretched out his hand scarcely knowing whether he was alive or dead he found himself alone the fatal shower from which he and his little charge escaped uninjured had stricken his assailant and precipitated him into the boiling gulf it's an ill wind that blows nobody good thought the carpenter turning his attention to the child whose feeble struggles and cries proclaimed that as yet life had not been extinguished by the hardships it had undergone poor little creature he muttered pressing it tenderly to his breast as he grasped the rope and clambered up to the window if thou hast indeed lost both thy parents as that terrible man said just now thou art not wholly friendless and deserted for i myself will be a father to thee and in memory of this dreadful night and the death from which i have been the means of preserving thee thou shalt bear the name of thames darrell no sooner had wood crept through the window than nature gave way and he fainted on coming to himself he found he had been wrapped in a blanket and put to bed with a couple of hot bricks to his feet his first inquiries were concerning the child and he was delighted to find that it still lived and was doing well every care had been taken of it as well as of himself by the humane inmates of the house in which he had sought shelter about noon next day he was able to move and the gale having abated he set out homewards with his little charge the city presented a terrible picture of devastation london bridge had suffered a degree less than most places but it was almost choked up with fallen stacks of chimneys broken beams of timber and shattered tiles the houses overhung in a frightful manner and looked as if the next gust would precipitate them into the river with great difficulty wood forced a path through the ruins it was a work of no slight danger for every instant a wall or fragment of a building came crashing to the ground thames street was wholly impassable men were going hither and thither with barrows and ladders and ropes removing the rubbish and trying to support the tottering habitations grace church street was entirely deserted except by a few stragglers whose curiosity got the better of their fears or who like the carpenter were compelled to proceed along it the tiles lay a foot thick in the road in some cases they were ground almost to powder in others driven deeply into the earth as if discharged from a piece of ordnance the roofs and gables of many of the houses had been torn off the signs of the shops were carried to incredible distances here and there a building might be seen with the doors and windows driven in and all access to it prevented by the heaps of bricks and tilesherds through this confusion the carpenter struggled on now ascending now descending the different mountains of rubbish that beset his path at the imminent peril of his life and limbs until he arrived in fleet street the hurricane appeared to have raged in this quarter with tenfold fury mr wood scarcely knew where he was the old aspect of the place was gone in lieu of the substantial habitations which he had gazed on overnight he beheld a row of falling scaffoldings for such they seemed it was a dismal and depressing sight to see a great city thus suddenly overthrown and the carpenter was deeply moved by the spectacle as usual however on the occasion of any great calamity a crowd was scouring the streets whose sole object was plunder while involved in this crowd near temple bar where the thoroughfare was most dangerous from the masses of ruin that impeded it an individual whose swarthy features recalled to the carpenter one of his tormentors of the previous night collared him and with bitter imprecations accused him of stealing his child in vain wood protested his innocence the ruffian's companions took his part and the infant in all probability would have been snatched from its preserver if a posse of the watch sent out to maintain order and protect property had not opportunely arrived and by a vigorous application of their halberts dispersed his persecutors and set him at liberty mr wood then took to his heels and never once looked behind him till he reached his own dwelling in wych street his wife met him at the door and into her hands he delivered his little charge end the first epoch epoch the second thames darrell chapter i the idle apprentice twelve years how many events have occurred during that long interval how many changes have taken place the whole aspect of things is altered the child has sprung into a youth the youth has become a man the man has already begun to feel the advances of age beauty has bloomed and faded fresh flowers of loveliness have budded expanded died the fashions of the day have become antiquated new customs have prevailed over the old parties politics and popular opinions have changed the crown has passed from the brow of one monarch to that of another habits and tastes are no longer the same we ourselves are scarcely the same we were twelve years ago twelve years ago it is an awful retrospect dare we look back upon the darkened vista and in imagination retrace the path we have trod with how many vain hopes is it shaded with how many good resolutions never fulfilled is it paved where are the dreams of ambition in which twelve years ago we indulged where are the aspirations that fired us the passions that consumed us then has our success in life been commensurate with our own desires with the anticipations formed of us by others or are we not blighted in heart as in ambition has not the loved one been estranged by doubt or snatched from us by the cold hand of death is not the goal towards which we pressed further off than ever the prospect before us cheerless as the blank behind enough of this let us proceed with our tale twelve years then have elapsed since the date of the occurrences detailed in the preceding division of this history at that time we were beneath the sway of anne we are now at the commencement of the reign of george the first passing at a glance over the whole of the intervening period leaving in the words of the poet the growth untried of that wide gap we shall resume our narrative at the beginning of june one friday afternoon in this pleasant month it chanced that mr wood who had been absent on business during the greater part of the day returned perhaps not altogether undesignedly at an earlier hour than was expected to his dwelling in wych street drury lane and was about to enter his workshop when not hearing any sound of labour issue from within he began to suspect that an apprentice of whose habits of industry he entertained some doubt was neglecting his employment impressed with this idea he paused for a moment to listen but finding all continue silent he cautiously lifted the latch and crept into the room resolved to punish the offender in case his suspicions should prove correct the chamber into which he stole like all carpenters' workshops was crowded with the implements and materials of that ancient and honourable art saws hammers planes axes augers adzes chisels gimblets and an endless variety of tools were ranged like a stand of martial weapons at an armoury in racks against the walls over these hung levels bevels squares and other instruments of measurement amid a litter of nails without heads screws without worms and locks without wards lay a glue pot and an oilstone two articles which their owner was wont to term his right hand and his left on a shelf was placed a row of paint jars the contents of which had been daubed in rainbow streaks upon the adjacent closet and window sill divers plans and figures were chalked upon the walls and the spaces between them were filled up with an almanack for the year a godly ballad adorned with a rude wood cut purporting to be the history of chaste susannah an old print of the seven golden candlesticks an abstract of the various acts of parliament against drinking swearing and all manner of profaneness and a view of the interior of doctor daniel burgess's presbyterian meeting house in russell court with portraits of the reverend gentleman and the principal members of his flock the floor was thickly strewn with sawdust and shavings and across the room ran a long and wide bench furnished at one end with a powerful vice next to which three nails driven into the boards served it would appear from the lump of unconsumed tallow left in their custody as a substitute for a candlestick on the bench was set a quartern measure of gin a crust of bread and a slice of cheese attracted by the odour of the latter dainty a hungry cat had contrived to scratch open the paper in which it was wrapped displaying the following words in large characters the history of the four kings or child's best guide to the gallows and as if to make the moral more obvious a dirty pack of cards was scattered underneath upon the sawdust near the door stood a pile of deal planks behind which the carpenter ensconced himself in order to reconnoitre unobserved the proceedings of his idle apprentice illustration standing on tiptoe on a joint stool placed upon the bench with his back to the door and a clasp knife in his hand this youngster instead of executing his appointed task was occupied in carving his name upon a beam overhead boys at the time of which we write were attired like men of their own day or certain charity children of ours and the stripling in question was dressed in black plush breeches and a gray drugget waistcoat with immoderately long pockets both of which were evidently the cast off clothes of some one considerably his senior coat on the present occasion he had none it being more convenient as well as agreeable to him to pursue his avocations in his shirtsleeves but when fully equipped he wore a large cuffed long skirted garment which had once been the property of his master in concealing himself behind the timber mr wood could not avoid making a slight shuffling sound the noise startled the apprentice who instantly suspended his labour and gazed anxiously in the direction whence he supposed it proceeded his face was that of a quick intelligent looking boy with fine hazel eyes and a clear olive complexion his figure was uncommonly slim even for his age which could not be more than thirteen and the looseness of his garb made him appear thinner than he was in reality but if his frame was immature his looks were not so he seemed to possess a penetration and cunning beyond his years to hide a man's judgment under a boy's mask the glance which he threw at the door was singularly expressive of his character it was a mixture of alarm effrontery and resolution in the end resolution triumphed as it was sure to do over the weaker emotions and he laughed at his fears the only part of his otherwise interesting countenance to which one could decidedly object was the mouth a feature that more than any other is conceived to betray the animal propensities of the possessor if this is true it must be owned that the boy's mouth showed a strong tendency on his part to coarse indulgence the eyes too though large and bright and shaded by long lashes seemed to betoken as hazel eyes generally do in men a faithless and uncertain disposition the cheek bones were prominent the nose slightly depressed with rather wide nostrils the chin narrow but well formed the forehead broad and lofty and he possessed such an extraordinary flexibility of muscle in this region that he could elevate his eye brows at pleasure up to the very verge of his sleek and shining black hair which being closely cropped to admit of his occasionally wearing a wig gave a singular bullet shape to his head taken altogether his physiognomy resembled one of those vagabond heads which murillo delighted to paint and for which guzman d'alfarache lazarillo de tormes or estevanillo gonzalez might have sat faces that almost make one in love with roguery they seem so full of vivacity and enjoyment there was all the knavery and more than all the drollery of a spanish picaroon in the laughing eyes of the english apprentice and with a little more warmth and sunniness of skin on the side of the latter the resemblance between them would have been complete satisfied as he thought that he had nothing to apprehend the boy resumed his task chanting as he plied his knife with redoubled assiduity the following not inappropriate strains the newgate stone when claude du val was in newgate thrown he carved his name on the dungeon stone quoth a dubsman who gazed on the shattered wall you have carved your epitaph claude du val with your chisel so fine tra la this s wants a little deepening mused the apprentice retouching the letter in question ay that's better du val was hang'd and the next who came on the selfsame stone inscribed his name aha quoth the dubsman with devilish glee tom waters your doom is the triple tree with your chisel so fine tra la tut tut tut he cried what a fool i am to be sure i ought to have cut john not jack however it don't signify nobody ever called me john that i recollect so i dare say i was christened jack deuce take it i was very near spelling my name with one p within that dungeon lay captain bew rumbold and whitney a jolly crew all carved their names on the stone and all share the fate of the brave du val with their chisels so fine tra la save us continued the apprentice i hope this beam doesn't resemble the newgate stone or i may chance like the great men the song speaks of to swing on the tyburn tree for my pains no fear o' that though if my name should become as famous as theirs it wouldn't much matter the prospect of the gallows would never deter me from taking to the road if i were so inclined full twenty highwaymen blithe and bold rattled their chains in that dungeon old of all that number there 'scaped not one who carved his name on the newgate stone with his chisel so fine tra la there cried the boy leaping from the stool and drawing back a few paces on the bench to examine his performance that'll do claude du val himself couldn't have carved it better ha ha the name inscribed upon the beam of which as it has been carefully preserved by the subsequent owners of mr wood's habitation in wych street we are luckily enabled to furnish a facsimile was illustration jack sheppard signature i've half a mind to give old wood the slip and turn highwayman cried jack as he closed the knife and put it in his pocket the devil you have thundered a voice from behind that filled the apprentice with dismay come down sirrah and i'll teach you how to deface my walls in future come down i say instantly or i'll make you upon which mr wood caught hold of jack's leg and dragged him off the bench and so you'll turn highwayman will you you young dog continued the carpenter cuffing him soundly rob the mails like jack hall i suppose yes i will replied jack sullenly if you beat me in that way amazed at the boy's assurance wood left off boxing his ears for a moment and looking at him steadfastly said in a grave tone jack jack you'll come to be hanged better be hanged than hen pecked retorted the lad with a malicious grin what do you mean by that sirrah cried wood reddening with anger do you dare to insinuate that mrs wood governs me it's plain you can't govern yourself at all events replied jack coolly but be that as it may i won't be struck for nothing nothing echoed wood furiously do you call neglecting your work and singing flash songs nothing zounds you incorrigible rascal many a master would have taken you before a magistrate and prayed for your solitary confinement in bridewell for the least of these offences but i'll be more lenient and content myself with merely chastising you on condition you may do as you please master interrupted jack thrusting his hand into his pocket as if in search of the knife but i wouldn't advise you to lay hands on me again mr wood glanced at the hardy offender and not liking the expression of his countenance thought it advisable to postpone the execution of his threats to a more favourable opportunity so by way of gaining time he resolved to question him further where did you learn the song i heard just now he demanded in an authoritative tone at the black lion in our street replied jack without hesitation the worst house in the neighbourhood the constant haunt of reprobates and thieves groaned wood and who taught it you the landlord joe hind no one blueskin a fellow who frequents the lion answered jack with a degree of candour that astonished his master nearly as much as his confidence it was that song that put it into my head to cut my name on the beam a white wall is a fool's paper jack remember that rejoined wood pretty company for an apprentice to keep pretty houses for an apprentice to frequent why the rascal you mention is a notorious house breaker he was tried at the last old bailey sessions and only escaped the gallows by impeaching his accomplices jonathan wild brought him off do you happen to know jonathan wild master inquired jack altering his tone and assuming a more respectful demeanour i've seen him some years ago i believe answered wood and though he must be much changed by this time i dare say i should know him again a short man isn't he about your height sir with a yellow beard and a face as sly as a fox's hem replied wood coughing slightly to conceal a smile the description's not amiss but why do you ask because stammered the boy speak out don't be alarmed said wood in a kind and encouraging tone if you've done wrong confess it and i'll forgive you i don't deserve to be forgiven returned jack bursting into tears for i'm afraid i've done very wrong do you know this sir he added taking a key from his pocket where did you find it asked wood it was given me by a man who was drinking t'other night with blueskin at the lion and who though he slouched his hat over his eyes and muffled his chin in a handkerchief must have been jonathan wild where did he get it inquired wood in surprise that i can't say but he promised to give me a couple of guineas if i'd ascertain whether it fitted your locks zounds exclaimed wood it's my old master key this key he added taking it from the boy was purloined from me by your father jack what he intended to do with it is of little consequence now but before he suffered at tyburn he charged your mother to restore it she lost it in the mint jonathan wild must have stolen it from her he must exclaimed jack hastily but only let me have it till to morrow and if i don't entrap him in a snare from which with all his cunning he shall find it difficult to escape my name's not jack sheppard i see through your design jack returned the carpenter gravely but i don't like under hand work even when you've a knave to deal with let your actions be plain and above board that's my maxim and it's the maxim of every honest man it would be a great matter i must own to bring jonathan wild to justice but i can't consent to the course you would pursue at least not till i've given it due consideration in regard to yourself you've had a very narrow escape wild's intention doubtless was to use you as far as he found necessary and then to sell you let this be a caution to you in future with whom and about what you deal we're told that 'whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul' avoid taverns and bad company and you may yet do well you promise to become a first rate workman but you want one quality without which all others are valueless you want industry you want steadiness idleness is the key of beggary jack if you don't conquer this disgraceful propensity in time you'll soon come to want and then nothing can save you be warned by your father's fate as you brew so must you drink i've engaged to watch over you as a son and i will do so as far as i'm able but if you neglect my advice what chance have i of benefitting you on one point i've made up my mind you shall either obey me or leave me please yourself here are your indentures if you choose to seek another master i will obey you master indeed i will implored jack seriously alarmed at the carpenter's calm displeasure we shall see good words without deeds are rushes and reeds and now take away those cards and never let me see them again drive away the cat throw that measure of gin through the window and tell me why you've not so much as touched the packing case for lady trafford which i particularly desired you to complete against my return it must be sent home this evening she leaves town to morrow it shall be ready in two hours answered jack seizing a piece of wood and a plane it isn't more than four o'clock i'll engage to get the job done by six i didn't expect you home before that hour sir ah jack said wood shaking his head where there's a will there's a way you can do anything you please i wish i could get you to imitate thames darrell i'm sure i understand the business of a carpenter much better than he does replied jack adroitly adjusting the board and using the plane with the greatest rapidity perhaps replied wood doubtfully thames was always your favourite observed jack as he fastened another piece of wood on the teeth of the iron stopper i've made no distinction between you hitherto answered wood nor shall i do so unless i'm compelled i've had the hard work to do at all events rejoined jack but i won't complain i'd do anything for thames darrell and thames darrell would do anything for you jack replied a blithe voice what's the matter father continued the new comer addressing wood has jack displeased you if so overlook his fault this once i'm sure he'll do his best to content you won't you jack that i will answered sheppard eagerly when it thunders the thief becomes honest muttered wood can i help you jack asked thames taking up a plane no no let him alone interposed wood he has undertaken to finish this job by six o'clock and i wish to see whether he'll be as good as his word he'll have hard work to do it by that time father remonstrated thames you'd better let me help him on no account rejoined wood peremptorily a little extra exertion will teach him the advantage of diligence at the proper season lost ground must be regained i need scarcely ask whether you've executed your appointed task my dear you're never behindhand thames turned away at the question which he felt might be construed into a reproach but sheppard answered for him darrell's job was done early this morning he said and if i'd attended to his advice the packing case would have been finished at the same time you trusted too much to your own skill jack rejoined thames if i could work as fast as you i might afford to be as idle see how he gets on father he added appealing to wood the box seems to grow under his hands you're a noble hearted little fellow thames rejoined wood casting a look of pride and affection at his adopted son whose head he gently patted and give promise of a glorious manhood thames darrell was indeed a youth of whom a person of far greater worldly consequence than the worthy carpenter might have been justly proud though a few months younger than his companion jack sheppard he was half a head taller and much more robustly formed the two friends contrasted strikingly with each other in darrell's open features frankness and honour were written in legible characters while in jack's physiognomy cunning and knavery were as strongly imprinted in all other respects they differed as materially jack could hardly be accounted good looking thames on the contrary was one of the handsomest boys possible jack's complexion was that of a gipsy darrell's as fresh and bright as a rose jack's mouth was coarse and large darrell's small and exquisitely carved with the short proud upper lip which belongs to the highest order of beauty jack's nose was broad and flat darrell's straight and fine as that of antinous the expression pervading the countenance of the one was vulgarity of the other that which is rarely found except in persons of high birth darrell's eyes were of that clear gray which it is difficult to distinguish from blue by day and black at night and his rich brown hair which he could not consent to part with even on the promise of a new and modish peruke from his adoptive father fell in thick glossy ringlets upon his shoulders whereas jack's close black crop imparted the peculiar bullet shape we have noticed to his head while thames modestly expressed a hope that he might not belie the carpenter's favourable prediction jack sheppard thought fit to mount a small ladder placed against the wall and springing with the agility of an ape upon a sort of frame contrived to sustain short spars and blocks of timber began to search about for a piece of wood required in the work on which he was engaged being in a great hurry he took little heed where he set his feet and a board giving way he must have fallen if he had not grasped a large plank laid upon the transverse beam immediately over his head take care jack shouted thames who witnessed the occurrence that plank isn't properly balanced you'll have it down but the caution came too late sheppard's weight had destroyed the equilibrium of the plank it swerved and slowly descended losing his presence of mind jack quitted his hold and dropped upon the frame the plank hung over his head a moment more and he would have been crushed beneath the ponderous board when a slight but strong arm arrested its descent get from under it jack vociferated thames i can't hold it much longer it'll break my wrist down we come he exclaimed letting go the plank which fell with a crash and leaping after sheppard who had rolled off the frame all this was the work of a minute no bones broken i hope said thames laughing at jack who limped towards the bench rubbing his shins as he went all right replied sheppard with affected indifference it's a mercy you both escaped ejaculated wood only just finding his tongue i declare i'm all in a cold sweat how came you sir he continued addressing sheppard to venture upon that frame i always told you some accident would happen don't scold him father interposed thames he's been frightened enough already well well since you desire it i'll say no more returned wood you hay'n't hurt your arm i trust my dear he added anxiously only sprained it a little that's all answered thames the pain will go off presently then you are hurt cried the carpenter in alarm come down stairs directly and let your mother look at your wrist she has an excellent remedy for a sprain and do you jack attend to your work and mind you don't get into further mischief hadn't jack better go with us said thames his shin may need rubbing by no means rejoined wood hastily a little suffering will do him good i meant to give him a drubbing that bruise will answer the same purpose thames said sheppard in a low voice as he threw a vindictive glance at the carpenter i shan't forget this you've saved my life pshaw you'd do as much for me any day and think no more about it it'll be your turn to save mine next true and i shan't be easy till my turn arrives i tell you what jack whispered thames who had noticed sheppard's menacing glance and dreaded some further indiscretion on his part if you really wish to oblige me you'll get that packing case finished by six o'clock you can do it if you will and i will if i can depend upon it answered sheppard with a laugh so saying he manfully resumed his work while wood and thames quitted the room and went down stairs chapter ii thames darrell thames darrell's arm having been submitted to the scrutiny of mrs wood was pronounced by that lady to be very much sprained and she forthwith proceeded to bathe it with a reddish coloured lotion during this operation the carpenter underwent a severe catechism as to the cause of the accident and on learning that the mischance originated with jack sheppard the indignation of his helpmate knew no bounds and she was with difficulty prevented from flying to the workshop to inflict summary punishment on the offender i knew how it would be she cried in the shrill voice peculiar to a shrew when you brought that worthless hussy's worthless brat into the house i told you no good would come of it and every day's experience proves that i was right but like all your overbearing sex you must have your own way you'll never be guided by me never indeed my love you're entirely mistaken returned the carpenter endeavouring to deprecate his wife's rising resentment by the softest looks and the meekest deportment so far however was this submission from producing the desired effect that it seemed only to lend additional fuel to her displeasure forgetting her occupation in her anger she left off bathing darrell's wrist and squeezing his arm so tightly that the boy winced with pain she clapped her right hand upon her hip and turned with flashing eyes and an inflamed countenance towards her crest fallen spouse what she exclaimed almost choked with passion i advised you to burthen yourself with that idle and good for nothing pauper who'm you ought rather to send to the workhouse than maintain at your own expense did i i advised you to take him as an apprentice and so far from getting the regular fee with him to give him a salary i advised you to feed him and clothe him and treat him like his betters to put up with his insolence and wink at his faults i counselled all this i suppose you'll tell me next i dare say that i recommended you to go and visit his mother so frequently under the plea of charity to give her wine and provisions and money to remove her from the only fit quarters for such people the mint and to place her in a cottage at willesden of which you must needs pay the rent marry come up charity should begin at home a discreet husband would leave the dispensation of his bounty where women are concerned to his wife and for my part if i were inclined to exercise my benevolence at all it should be in favour of some more deserving object than that whining hypocritical magdalene it was the knowledge of this feeling on your part my love that made me act without your express sanction i did all for the best i'm sure mrs sheppard is i know what mrs sheppard is without your information sir i haven't forgotten her previous history you've your own reasons no doubt for bringing up her son perhaps i ought rather to say your son mr wood really my love these accusations are most groundless this violence is most unnecessary i can't endure the odious baggage i hope i may never come near her i hope you never may my love humbly acquiesced the carpenter is my house to be made a receptacle for all your natural children sir answer me that winny said thames whose glowing cheek attested the effect produced upon him by the insinuation winny said he addressing a pretty little damsel of some twelve years of age who stood by his side holding the bottle of embrocation help me on with my coat please this is no place for me sit down my dear sit down interposed mrs wood softening her asperity what i said about natural children doesn't apply to you don't suppose she added with a scornful glance at her helpmate that i would pay him the compliment of thinking he could possibly be the father of such a boy as you mr wood lifted up his hands in mute despair owen owen pursued mrs wood sinking into a chair and fanning herself violently what a fluster you have put me into with your violence to be sure and at the very time too when you know i'm expecting a visit from mr kneebone on his return from manchester i wouldn't have him see me in this state for the world he'd never forgive you poh poh my dear mr kneebone invariably takes part with me when any trifling misunderstanding arises between us i only wish he was not a papist and a jacobite jacobite echoed mrs wood marry come up mightn't he just as reasonably complain of your being a hanoverian and a presbyterian it's all matter of opinion and now my love she added with a relenting look i'm content to make up our quarrel but you must promise me not to go near that abandoned hussy at willesden one can't help being jealous you know even of an unworthy object glad to make peace on any terms mr wood gave the required promise though he could not help thinking that if either of them had cause to be jealous he was the party and here we may be permitted to offer an observation upon the peculiar and unaccountable influence which ladies of a shrewish turn so frequently exercise over we can scarcely in this case say their lords and masters an influence which seems not merely to extend to the will of the husband but even to his inclinations we do not remember to have met with a single individual reported to be under petticoat government who was not content with his lot nay who so far from repining did not exult in his servitude and we see no way of accounting for this apparently inexplicable conduct for which among other phenomena of married life various reasons have been assigned though none entirely satisfactory to us except upon the ground that these domineering dames possess some charm sufficiently strong to counteract the irritating effect of their tempers some secret and attractive quality of which the world at large is in ignorance and with which their husbands alone can be supposed to be acquainted an influence of this description appeared to be exerted on the present occasion the worthy carpenter was restored to instant good humour by a glance from his helpmate and notwithstanding the infliction he had just endured he would have quarrelled with any one who had endeavoured to persuade him that he was not the happiest of men and mrs wood the best of wives women must have their wills while they live since they can make none when they die observed wood as he imprinted a kiss of reconciliation on the plump hand of his consort a sentiment to the correctness of which the party chiefly interested graciously vouchsafed her assent lest the carpenter should be taxed with too much uxoriousness it behoves us to ascertain whether the personal attractions of his helpmate would in any degree justify the devotion he displayed in the first place mrs wood had the advantage of her husband in point of years being on the sunny side of forty a period pronounced by competent judges to be the most fascinating and at the same time most critical epoch of woman's existence whereas he was on the shady side of fifty a term of life not generally conceived to have any special recommendation in female eyes in the next place she really had some pretensions to beauty accounted extremely pretty in her youth her features and person expanded as she grew older without much detriment to their original comeliness hers was beauty on a large scale no doubt but it was beauty nevertheless and the carpenter thought her eyes as bright her complexion as blooming and her figure if a little more buxom quite as captivating as when he led her to the altar some twenty years ago on the present occasion in anticipation of mr kneebone's visit mrs wood was dressed with more than ordinary care and in more than ordinary finery a dove coloured kincob gown embroidered with large trees and made very low in front displayed to the greatest possible advantage the rounded proportions of her figure while a high heeled red leather shoe did not detract from the symmetry of a very neat ankle and a very small foot a stomacher fastened by imitation diamond buckles girded that part of her person which should have been a waist a coral necklace encircled her throat and a few black patches or mouches as they were termed served as a foil to the bloom of her cheek and chin upon a table where they had been hastily deposited on the intelligence of darrell's accident lay a pair of pink kid gloves bordered with lace and an enormous fan the latter when opened represented the metamorphosis and death of actaeon from her stomacher to which it was attached by a multitude of glittering steel chains depended an immense turnip shaped watch in a pinchbeck case her hair was gathered up behind in a sort of pad according to the then prevailing mode and she wore a muslin cap and pinners with crow foot edging a black silk fur belowed scarf covered her shoulders and over the kincob gown hung a yellow satin apron trimmed with white persian but in spite of her attractions we shall address ourselves to the younger and more interesting couple i could almost find in my heart to quarrel with jack sheppard for occasioning you so much pain observed little winifred wood as having completed her ministration to the best of her ability she helped thames on with his coat i don't think you could find in your heart to quarrel with any one winny much less with a person whom i like so much as jack sheppard my arm's nearly well again and i've already told you the accident was not jack's fault so let's think no more about it it's strange you should like jack so much dear thames he doesn't resemble you at all the very reason why i like him winny if he did resemble me i shouldn't care about him and whatever you may think i assure you jack's a downright good natured fellow good natured fellows are always especial favourites with boys and in applying the term to his friend thames meant to pay him a high compliment and so winifred understood him well she said in reply i may have done jack an injustice i'll try to think better of him in future and if you want an additional inducement to do so i can tell you there's no one not even his mother whom he loves so well as you loves echoed winifred slightly colouring yes loves winny poor fellow he sometimes indulges the hope of marrying you when he grows old enough thames have i said anything to offend you oh no but if you wouldn't have me positively dislike jack sheppard you'll never mention such a subject again besides she added blushing yet more deeply it isn't a proper one to talk upon well then to change it replied thames gravely suppose i should be obliged to leave you winifred looked as if she could not indulge such a supposition for a single moment surely she said after a pause you don't attach any importance to what my mother has just said she has already forgotten it but i never can forget it winny i will no longer be a burthen to those upon whom i have no claim but compassion as he said this in a low and mournful but firm voice the tears gathered thickly in winifred's dark eyelashes if you are in earnest thames she replied with a look of gentle reproach you are very foolish and if in jest very cruel my mother i'm sure didn't intend to hurt your feelings she loves you too well for that and i'll answer for it she'll never say a syllable to annoy you again thames tried to answer her but his voice failed him come i see the storm has blown over cried winifred brightening up you're mistaken winny nothing can alter my determination i shall quit this roof to morrow the little girl's countenance fell do nothing without consulting my father your father thames she implored promise me that willingly and what's more i promise to abide by his decision then i'm quite easy cried winifred joyfully i'm sure he won't attempt to prevent me rejoined thames the slight smile that played upon winifred's lips seemed to say that she was not quite so sure but she made no answer in case he should consent he never will interrupted winifred in case he should i say continued thames will you promise to let jack sheppard take my place in your affections winny never replied the little damsel i can never love any one so much as you excepting your father winifred was going to say no but she checked herself and with cheeks mantling with blushes murmured i wish you wouldn't tease me about jack sheppard the foregoing conversation having been conducted throughout in a low tone and apart had not reached the ears of mr and mrs wood who were furthermore engaged in a little conjugal tete a tete of their own the last observation however caught the attention of the carpenter's wife what's that you're saying about jack sheppard she cried thames was just observing thames echoed mrs wood glancing angrily at her husband there's another instance of your wilfulness and want of taste who but you would have dreamed of giving the boy such a name why it's the name of a river not a christian no gentleman was ever called thames and darrell is a gentleman unless the whole story of his being found in the river is a fabrication my dear you forget no mr wood i forget nothing i've an excellent memory thank god and i perfectly remember that everybody was drowned upon that occasion except yourself and the child my love you're beside yourself i was beside myself to take charge of your mother interposed winifred it's of no use observed thames quietly but with a look that chilled the little damsel's heart my resolution is taken you at least appear to forget that mr kneebone is coming my dear ventured mr wood good gracious so i do exclaimed his amiable consort but you do agitate me so much come into the parlour winifred and dry your eyes directly or i'll send you to bed mr wood i desire you'll put on your best things and join us as soon as possible thames you needn't tidy yourself as you've hurt your arm mr kneebone will excuse you dear me if there isn't his knock oh i'm in such a fluster upon which she snatched up her fan cast a look into the glass smoothed down her scarf threw a soft expression into her features and led the way into the next room whither she was followed by her daughter and thames darrell chapter iii the jacobite mr william kneebone was a woollen draper of credit and renown whose place of business was held at the sign of the angel for in those days every shop had its sign opposite saint clement's church in the strand a native of manchester he was the son of kenelm kneebone a staunch catholic and a sergeant of dragoons who lost his legs and his life while fighting for james the second at the battle of the boyne and who had little to bequeath his son except his laurels and his loyalty to the house of stuart the gallant woollen draper was now in his thirty sixth year he had a handsome jolly looking face stood six feet two in his stockings and measured more than a cloth yard shaft across the shoulders athletic proportions derived from his father the dragoon and if it had not been for a taste for plotting which was continually getting him into scrapes he might have been accounted a respectable member of society of late however his plotting had assumed a more dark and dangerous complexion the times were such that with the opinions he entertained he could not remain idle the spirit of disaffection was busy throughout the kingdom it was on the eve of that memorable rebellion which broke forth two months later in scotland since the accession of george the first to the throne in the preceding year every effort had been made by the partisans of the stuarts to shake the credit of the existing government and to gain supporters to their cause disappointed in their hopes of the restoration of the fallen dynasty after the death of anne the adherents of the chevalier de saint george endeavoured by sowing the seeds of dissension far and wide to produce a general insurrection in his favour no means were neglected to accomplish this end agents were dispersed in all directions offers the most tempting held out to induce the wavering to join the chevalier's standard plots were hatched in the provinces where many of the old and wealthy catholic families resided whose zeal for the martyr of their religion as the chevalier was esteemed sharpened by the persecutions they themselves endured rendered them hearty and efficient allies arms horses and accoutrements were secretly purchased and distributed and it is not improbable that if the unfortunate prince in whose behalf these exertions were made and who was not deficient in courage as he proved at the battle of malplaquet had boldly placed himself at the head of his party at an earlier period he might have regained the crown of his ancestors but the indecision which had been fatal to his race was fatal to him he delayed the blow till the fortunate conjuncture was past and when at length it was struck he wanted energy to pursue his advantages but we must not anticipate the course of events at the precise period of this history the jacobite party was full of hope and confidence louis the fourteenth yet lived and expectations were therefore indulged of assistance from france the disgrace of the leaders of the late tory administration had strengthened rather than injured their cause mobs were gathered together on the slightest possible pretext and these tumultuous assemblages while committing the most outrageous excesses loudly proclaimed their hatred to the house of hanover and their determination to cut off the protestant succession the proceedings of this faction were narrowly watched by a vigilant and sagacious administration the government was not deceived indeed every opportunity was sought by the jacobites of parading their numbers as to the force of its enemies and precautionary measures were taken to defeat their designs on the very day of which we write namely the th of june bolingbroke and oxford were impeached of high treason the committee of secrecy that english council of ten were sitting with walpole at their head and the most extraordinary discoveries were reported to be made on the same day moreover which by a curious coincidence was the birthday of the chevalier de saint george mobs were collected together in the streets and the health of that prince was publicly drunk under the title of james the third while in many country towns the bells were rung and rejoicings held as if for a reigning monarch the cry of the populace almost universally being no king george but a stuart the adherents of the chevalier de saint george we have said were lavish in promises to their proselytes posts were offered to all who chose to accept them blank commissions signed by the prince to be filled up by the name of the person who could raise a troop for his service were liberally bestowed amongst others mr kneebone whose interest was not inconsiderable with the leaders of his faction obtained an appointment as captain in a regiment of infantry on the conditions above specified with a view to raise recruits for his corps the warlike woollen draper started for lancashire under the colour of a journey on business he was pretty successful in manchester a town which may be said to have been the head quarters of the disaffected on his return to london he found that applications had been made from a somewhat doubtful quarter by two individuals for the posts of subordinate officers in his troop mr kneebone or as he would have preferred being styled captain kneebone was not perfectly satisfied with the recommendations forwarded by the applicants but this was not a season in which to be needlessly scrupulous he resolved to judge for himself accordingly he was introduced to the two military aspirants at the cross shovels in the mint by our old acquaintance baptist kettleby the master of the mint with whom the jacobite captain had often had transactions before vouched for their being men of honour and loyalty and kneebone was so well satisfied with his representations that he at once closed the matter by administering to the applicants the oath of allegiance and fidelity to king james the third and several other oaths besides all of which those gentlemen took with as little hesitation as the sum of money afterwards tendered to make the compact binding the party then sat down to a bowl of punch and at its conclusion captain kneebone regretted that an engagement to spend the evening with mrs wood would preclude the possibility of his remaining with his new friends as long as his inclinations prompted at this piece of information the two subordinate officers were observed to exchange glances and after a little agreeable raillery on their captain's gallantry they begged permission to accompany him in his visit kneebone who had drained his glass to the restoration of the house of stuart and the downfall of the house of hanover more frequently than was consistent with prudence consented and the trio set out for wych street where they arrived in the jolliest humour possible chapter iv mr kneebone and his friends mrs wood was scarcely seated before mr kneebone made his appearance to her great surprise and mortification he was not alone but brought with him a couple of friends whom he begged to introduce as mr jeremiah jackson and mr solomon smith chapmen or what in modern vulgar parlance would be termed bagmen travelling to procure orders for the house of an eminent cloth manufacturer in manchester neither the manners the looks nor the attire of these gentlemen prepossessed mrs wood in their favour accordingly on their presentation mr jeremiah jackson and mr solomon smith received something very like a rebuff luckily they were not easily discomposed two persons possessing a more comfortable stock of assurance could not be readily found imitating the example of mr kneebone who did not appear in the slightest degree disconcerted by his cool reception each sank carelessly into a chair and made himself at home in a moment both had very singular faces very odd wigs very much pulled over their brows and very large cravats very much raised above their chins besides this each had a large black patch over his right eye and a very queer twist at the left side of his mouth so that if their object had been disguise they could not have adopted better precautions mrs wood thought them both remarkably plain but mr smith decidedly the plainest of the two his complexion was as blue as a sailor's jacket and though mr jackson had one of the ugliest countenances imaginable he had a very fine set of teeth that was something in his favour one peculiarity she did not fail to notice they were both dressed in every respect alike in fact mr solomon smith seemed to be mr jeremiah jackson's double he talked in the same style and pretty nearly in the same language laughed in the same manner and coughed or sneezed at the same time if mr jackson took an accurate survey of the room with his one eye mr smith's solitary orb followed in the same direction when jeremiah admired the compasses in the arms of the carpenter's company over the chimney piece or the portraits of the two eminent masters of the rule and plane william portington and john scott esquires on either side of it solomon was lost in wonder when mr jackson noticed a fine service of old blue china in an open japan closet mr smith had never seen anything like it and finally when jeremiah having bestowed upon mrs wood a very free and easy sort of stare winked at mr kneebone his impertinence was copied to the letter by solomon all three then burst into an immoderate fit of laughter mrs wood's astonishment and displeasure momentarily increased such freedoms from such people were not to be endured her patience was waning fast still in spite of her glances and gestures mr kneebone made no effort to check the unreasonable merriment of his companions but rather seemed to encourage it so mrs wood went on fuming and the trio went on laughing for some minutes nobody knew why or wherefore until the party was increased by mr wood in his sunday habiliments and sunday buckle without stopping to inquire into the cause of their mirth or even to ask the names of his guests the worthy carpenter shook hands with the one eyed chapmen slapped mr kneebone cordially on the shoulder and began to laugh as heartily as any of them mrs wood could stand it no longer i think you're all bewitched she cried so we are ma'am by your charms returned mr jackson gallantly quite captivated ma'am added mr smith placing his hand on his breast mr kneebone and mr wood laughed louder than ever mr wood said the lady bridling up my request may perhaps have some weight with you i desire sir you'll recollect yourself mr kneebone she added with a glance at that gentleman which was meant to speak daggers will do as he pleases here the chapmen set up another boisterous peal no offence i hope my dear mrs w said mr kneebone in a conciliatory tone my friends mr jackson and mr smith may have rather odd ways with them but they have very odd ways interrupted mrs wood disdainfully our worthy friend was going to observe ma'am that we never fail in our devotion to the fair sex said mr jackson never ma'am echoed mr smith upon my conscience my dear said the hospitable carpenter i dare say mr kneebone and his friends would be glad of a little refreshment they shall have it then replied his better half rising you base ingrate she added in a whisper as she flounced past mr kneebone on her way to the door how could you bring such creatures with you especially on an occasion like this when we haven't met for a fortnight couldn't help it my life returned the gentleman addressed in the same tone but you little know who those individuals are lord bless us you alarm me who are they mr kneebone assumed a mysterious air and bringing his lips close to mrs wood's ear whispered secret agents from france you understand friends to the cause hem i see persons of rank mr kneebone nodded noblemen mr kneebone smiled assent mercy on us well i thought their manners quite out o' the common and so the invasion really is to take place after all and the chevalier de saint george is to land at the tower with fifty thousand frenchmen and the hanoverian usurper's to be beheaded and doctor sacheverel's to be made a bishop and we're all to be eh all in good time returned kneebone putting his finger to his lips don't let your imagination run away with you my charmer that boy he added looking at thames has his eye upon us mrs wood however was too much excited to attend to the caution o lud she cried french noblemen in disguise and so rude as i was i shall never recover it a good supper will set all to rights insinuated kneebone but be prudent my angel never fear replied the lady i'm prudence personified you might trust me with the chevalier himself i'd never betray him but why didn't you let me know they were coming i'd have got something nice as it is we've only a couple of ducks and they were intended for you winny my love come with me i shall want you sorry to quit your lord worships i mean i don't know what i mean she added a little confused and dropping a profound curtsey to the disguised noblemen each of whom replied by a bow worthy in her opinion of a prince of the blood at the least but i've a few necessary orders to give below don't mind us ma'am said mr jackson ha ha not in the least ma'am echoed mr smith ho ho how condescending thought mrs wood not proud in the least i declare well i'd no idea she continued pursuing her ruminations as she left the room that people of quality laughed so but it's french manners i suppose chapter v hawk and buzzard mrs wood's anxiety to please her distinguished guests speedily displayed itself in a very plentiful if not very dainty repast to the duckling peas and other delicacies intended for mr kneebone's special consumption she added a few impromptu dishes tossed off in her best style such as lamb chops broiled kidneys fried ham and eggs and toasted cheese side by side with the cheese its never failing accompaniment in all seasons at the carpenter's board came a tankard of swig and a toast besides these there was a warm gooseberry tart and a cold pigeon pie the latter capacious enough even allowing for its due complement of steak to contain the whole produce of a dovecot a couple of lobsters and the best part of a salmon swimming in a sea of vinegar and shaded by a forest of fennel while the cloth was laid the host and thames descended to the cellar whence they returned laden with a number of flasks of the same form and apparently destined to the same use as those depicted in hogarth's delectable print the modern midnight conversation mrs wood now re appeared with a very red face and followed by winifred took her seat at the table operations then commenced mr wood carved the ducks mr kneebone helped to the pigeon pie while thames unwired and uncorked a bottle of stout carnarvonshire ale the woollen draper was no despicable trencherman in a general way but his feats with the knife and fork were child's sport compared with those of mr smith the leg and wing of a duck were disposed of by this gentleman in a twinkling a brace of pigeons and a pound of steak followed with equal celerity and he had just begun to make a fierce assault upon the eggs and ham his appetite was perfectly gargantuan nor must it be imagined that while he thus exercised his teeth he neglected the flagon on the contrary his glass was never idle and finding it not filled quite so frequently as he desired he applied himself notwithstanding the expressive looks and muttered remonstrances of mr jackson to the swig the latter gentleman did full justice to the good things before him but he drank sparingly and was visibly annoyed by his companion's intemperance as to mr kneebone what with flirting with mrs wood carving for his friends and pledging the carpenter he had his hands full at this juncture and just as a cuckoo clock in the corner struck sis jack sheppard walked into the room with the packing case under his arm i was in the right you see father observed thames smiling jack has done his task so i perceive replied wood where am i to take it to asked sheppard i told you that before rejoined wood testily you must take it to sir rowland trenchard's in southampton fields and mind it's for his sister lady trafford very well sir replied sheppard wet your whistle before you start jack said kneebone pouring out a glass of ale what's that you're taking to sir rowland trenchard's only a box sir answered sheppard emptying the glass it's an odd shaped one rejoined kneebone examining it attentively but i can guess what it's for sir rowland is one of us he added winking at his companions and so was his brother in law sir cecil trafford old lancashire families both strict catholics and loyal to the backbone fine woman lady trafford a little on the wane though ah you're so very particular sighed mrs wood not in the least returned kneebone slyly not in the least another glass jack thank'ee sir grinned sheppard off with it to the health of king james the third and confusion to his enemies hold interposed wood that is treason i'll have no such toast drunk at my table it's the king's birthday urged the woollen draper not my king's returned wood i quarrel with no man's political opinions but i will have my own respected eh day exclaimed mrs wood here's a pretty to do about nothing marry come up i'll see who's to be obeyed drink the toast jack at your peril sirrah cried wood he was hanged that left his drink behind you know master rejoined sheppard here's king james the third and confusion to his enemies very well said the carpenter sitting down amid the laughter of the company jack cried thames in a loud voice you deserve to be hanged for a rebel as you are to your lawful king and your lawful master but since we must have toasts he added snatching up a glass listen to mine here's king george the first a long reign to him and confusion to the popish pretender and his adherents bravely done said wood with tears in his eyes that's the kinchin as was to try the dub for us ain't it muttered smith to his companion as he stole a glance at jack sheppard silence returned jackson in a deep whisper and don't muddle your brains with any more of that pharaoh you'll need all your strength to grab him what's the matter remarked kneebone addressing sheppard who as he caught the single but piercing eye of jackson fixed upon him started and trembled what's the matter repeated mrs wood in a sharp tone ay what's the matter boy reiterated jackson sternly did you never see two gentlemen with only a couple of peepers between them before never i'll be sworn said smith taking the opportunity of filling his glass while his comrade's back was turned we're a nat'ral cur'osity can i have a word with you master said sheppard approaching wood not a syllable answered the carpenter angrily get about your business thames cried jack beckoning to his friend but darrell averted his head mistress said the apprentice making a final appeal to mrs wood leave the room instantly sirrah rejoined the lady bouncing up and giving him a slap on the cheek that made his eyes flash fire may i be cursed muttered sheppard as he slunk away with as the woollen draper pleasantly observed 'a couple of boxes in charge' if ever i try to be honest again illustration take a little toasted cheese with the swig mr smith observed wood that's an incorrigible rascal he added as sheppard closed the door it's only to day that i discovered what asked jackson pricking up his ears don't speak ill of him behind his back father interposed thames if i were your father young gentleman returned jackson enraged at the interruption i'd teach you not to speak till you were spoken to thames was about to reply but a glance from wood checked him the rebuke is just said the carpenter at the same time i'm not sorry to find you're a friend to fair play which as you seem to know is a jewel open that bottle with a blue seal my dear gentlemen a glass of brandy will be no bad finish to our meal this proposal giving general satisfaction the bottle circulated swiftly and smith found the liquor so much to his taste that he made it pay double toll on its passage your son is a lad of spirit mr wood observed jackson in a slightly sarcastic tone he's not my son rejoined the carpenter how sir except by adoption thames darrell is my husband nicknames him thames interrupted mrs wood because he found him in the river ha ha ha ha echoed smith taking another bumper of brandy he'll set the thames on fire one of these days i'll warrant him that's more than you'll ever do you drunken fool growled jackson in an under tone be cautious or you'll spoil all suppose we send for a bowl of punch said kneebone with all my heart replied wood and turning to his daughter he gave the necessary directions in a low tone winifred accordingly left the room and a servant being despatched to the nearest tavern soon afterwards returned with a crown bowl of the ambrosian fluid the tables were then cleared bottles and glasses usurped the place of dishes and plates pipes were lighted and mr kneebone began to dispense the fragrant fluid begging mrs wood in a whisper as he filled a rummer to the brim not to forget the health of the chevalier de saint george a proposition to which the lady immediately responded by drinking the toast aloud the chevalier shall hear of this whispered the woollen draper you don't say so replied mrs wood delighted at the idea mr kneebone assured her that he did say so and as a further proof of his sincerity squeezed her hand very warmly under the table mr smith now being more than half seas over became very uproarious and claiming the attention of the table volunteered the following drinking song i jolly nose the bright rubies that garnish thy tip are dug from the mines of canary and to keep up their lustre i moisten my lip with hogsheads of claret and sherry ii jolly nose he who sees thee across a broad glass beholds thee in all thy perfection and to the pale snout of a temperate ass entertains the profoundest objection iii for a big bellied glass is the palette i use and the choicest of wine is my colour and i find that my nose takes the mellowest hues the fuller i fill it the fuller iv jolly nose there are fools who say drink hurts the sight such dullards know nothing about it 't is better with wine to extinguish the light than live always in darkness without it how long may it be since that boy was found in the way mrs wood mentions inquired jackson as soon as the clatter that succeeded mr smith's melody had subsided let me see replied wood exactly twelve years ago last november why that must be about the time of the great storm rejoined jackson egad exclaimed wood you've hit the right nail on the head anyhow it was on the night of the great storm that i found him i should like to hear all particulars of the affair said jackson if it wouldn't be troubling you too much mr wood required little pressing he took a sip of punch and commenced his relation though meant to produce a totally different effect the narrative seemed to excite the risible propensities rather than the commiseration of his auditor and when mr wood wound it up by a description of the drenching he had undergone at the mint pump the other could hold out no longer but leaning back in his chair gave free scope to his merriment i beg your pardon he cried but really ha ha you must excuse me that is so uncommonly diverting ha ha do let me hear it again ha ha ha upon my word rejoined wood you seem vastly entertained by my misfortunes to be sure nothing entertains me so much people always rejoice at the misfortunes of others never at their own the droll dogs how they must have enjoyed it ha ha i dare say they did but i found it no laughing matter i can assure you and though it's a long time ago i feel as sore on the subject as ever quite natural never forgive an injury i never do ha ha really mr jackson i could almost fancy we had met before your laugh reminds me of of whose sir demanded jackson becoming suddenly grave you'll not be offended i hope returned wood drily if i say that your voice your manner and above all your very extraordinary way of laughing put me strangely in mind of one of the 'droll dogs' as you term them who helped to perpetrate the outrage i've just described whom do you mean demanded jackson i allude to an individual who has since acquired an infamous notoriety as a thief taker but who in those days was himself the associate of thieves well sir his name jonathan wild 'sblood cried jackson rising i can't sit still and hear mr wild whom i believe to be as honest a gentleman as any in the kingdom calumniated fire and fury exclaimed smith getting up with the brandy bottle in his grasp no man shall abuse mr wild in my presence he's the right hand of the community we could do nothing without him we repeated wood significantly every honest man sir he helps us to our own again humph ejaculated the carpenter surely observed thames laughing to one who entertains so high an opinion of jonathan wild as mr jackson appears to do it can't be very offensive to be told that he's like him i don't object to the likeness if any such exists young sir returned jackson darting an angry glance at thames indeed i'm rather flattered by being thought to resemble a gentleman of mr wild's figure but i can't submit to hear the well earned reputation of my friend termed an 'infamous notoriety' no we can't stand that hiccupped smith scarcely able to keep his legs well gentlemen rejoined wood mildly since mr wild is a friend of yours i'm sorry for what i said i've no doubt he's as honest as either of you enough returned jackson extending his hand and if i've expressed myself warmly i'm sorry for it likewise but you must allow me to observe my good sir that you're wholly in the wrong respecting my friend mr wild never was the associate of thieves never echoed smith emphatically upon my honour i'm satisfied with your assurance replied the carpenter drily it's more than i am muttered thames i was not aware that jonathan wild was an acquaintance of yours mr jackson said kneebone whose assiduity to mrs wood had prevented him from paying much attention to the previous scene i've known him all my life replied the other the devil you have then perhaps you can tell me when he intends to put his threat into execution what threat asked jackson why of hanging the fellow who acts as his jackal one blake or blueskin i think he's called you've been misinformed sir interposed smith mr wild is incapable of such baseness bah returned the woollen draper i see you don't know him as well as you pretend jonathan is capable of anything he has hanged twelve of his associates already the moment they cease to be serviceable or become dangerous he lodges an information and the matter's settled he has always plenty of evidence in reserve blueskin is booked as sure as you're sitting there mr smith he'll swing after next old bailey sessions i wouldn't be in his skin for a trifle but he may peach said smith casting an oblique glance at jackson it would avail him little if he did replied kneebone jonathan does what he pleases in the courts very true chuckled jackson very true blueskin's only chance would be to carry his threat into effect pursued the woollen draper aha exclaimed jackson he threatens does he more than that replied kneebone i understand he drew a knife upon jonathan in a quarrel between them lately and since then he has openly avowed his determination of cutting his master's throat on the slightest inkling of treachery but perhaps mr smith will tell you i'm misinformed also on that point on the contrary rejoined smith looking askance at his companion i happen to know you're in the right well sir i'm obliged to you said jackson i shall take care to put mr wild on his guard against an assassin and i shall put blueskin on the alert against the designs of a traitor rejoined smith in a tone that sounded like a menace in my opinion remarked kneebone it doesn't matter how soon society is rid of two such scoundrels and if blueskin dies by the rope and jonathan by the hand of violence they'll meet the fate they merit wild was formerly an agent to the jacobite party but on the offer of a bribe from the opposite faction he unhesitatingly deserted and betrayed his old employers of late he has become the instrument of walpole and does all the dirty work for the secret committee several arrests of importance have been intrusted to him but forewarned forearmed we have constantly baffled his schemes ha ha jonathan's a devilish clever fellow but he can't have his eyes always about him or he'd have been with us this morning at the mint eh mr jackson so he would replied the latter so he would with all his cunning he may meet with his match continued kneebone laughing i've set a trap for him take care you don't fall into it yourself returned jackson with a slight sneer were i in your place said smith i should be apprehensive of wild because he's a declared enemy and were i in yours rejoined the woollen draper i should be doubly apprehensive because he's a professed friend but we're neglecting the punch all this time a bumper round gentlemen success to our enterprise success to our enterprise echoed the others significantly may i ask whether you made any further inquiries into the mysterious affair about which we were speaking just now observed jackson turning to the carpenter i can't say i did replied wood somewhat reluctantly what with the confusion incident to the storm and the subsequent press of business i put it off till it was too late i've often regretted that i didn't investigate the matter however it doesn't much signify all concerned in the dark transaction must have perished are you sure of that inquired jackson as sure as one reasonably can be i saw their boat swept away and heard the roar of the fall beneath the bridge and no one who was present could doubt the result if the principal instigator of the crime whom i afterwards encountered on the platform and who was dashed into the raging flood by the shower of bricks escaped his preservation must have been indeed miraculous your own was equally so said jackson ironically what if he did escape my utmost efforts should be used to bring him to justice hum have you any reason to suppose he survived the accident inquired thames eagerly jackson smiled and put on the air of a man who knows more than he cares to tell i merely asked the question he said after he had enjoyed the boy's suspense for a moment the hope that had been suddenly kindled in the youth's bosom was as suddenly extinguished if i thought he lived observed wood if interrupted jackson changing his tone he does live and it has been well for you that he imagines the child was drowned who is he asked thames impatiently you're inquisitive young gentleman replied jackson coldly when you're older you'll know that secrets of importance are not disclosed gratuitously your adoptive father understands mankind better i'd give half i'm worth to hang the villain and restore this boy to his rights said mr wood how do you know he has any rights to be restored to returned jackson with a grin judging from what you tell me i've no doubt he's the illegitimate offspring of some handsome but lowborn profligate in which case he'll neither have name nor wealth for his inheritance the assassination as you call it was obviously the vengeance of a kinsman of the injured lady who no doubt was of good family upon her seducer the less said therefore on this point the better because as nothing is to be gained by it it would only be trouble thrown away but if you have any particular fancy for hanging the gentleman who chose to take the law into his own hands and i think your motive extremely disinterested and praiseworthy why it's just possible if you make it worth my while that your desires may be gratified i don't see how this is to be effected unless you yourself were present at the time said wood glancing suspiciously at the speaker i had no hand in the affair replied jackson bluntly but i know those who had and could bring forward evidence if you require it the best evidence would be afforded by an accomplice of the assassin rejoined thames who was greatly offended by the insinuation as to his parentage perhaps you could point out such a party mr jackson said wood significantly i could replied thames then you need no further information from me rejoined jackson sternly stay cried wood this is a most perplexing business if you really are privy to the affair we'll talk of it to morrow sir returned jackson cutting him short in the mean time with your permission i'll just make a few minutes of our conversation as many as you please replied wood walking towards the chimney piece and taking down a constable's staff which hung upon a nail jackson mean time produced a pocket book and after deliberately sharpening the point of a pencil began to write on a blank leaf while he was thus occupied thames prompted by an unaccountable feeling of curiosity took up the penknife which the other had just used and examined the haft what he there noticed occasioned a marked change in his demeanour he laid down the knife and fixed a searching and distrustful gaze upon the writer who continued his task unconscious of anything having happened there cried jackson closing the book and rising that'll do to morrow at twelve i'll be with you mr wood make up your mind as to the terms and i'll engage to find the man hold exclaimed the carpenter in an authoritative voice we can't part thus thames look the door an order which was promptly obeyed now sir i must insist upon a full explanation of your mysterious hints or as i am headborough of the district i shall at once take you into custody jackson treated this menace with a loud laugh of derision what ho he cried slapping smith who had fallen asleep with the brandy bottle in his grasp upon the shoulder it is time for what grumbled the latter rubbing his eyes for the caption replied jackson coolly drawing a brace of pistols from his pockets ready answered smith shaking himself and producing a similar pair of weapons in heaven's name what's all this cried wood be still and you'll receive no injury returned jackson we're merely about to discharge our duty by apprehending a rebel captain kneebone we must trouble you to accompany us i've no intention of stirring replied the woollen draper who was thus unceremoniously disturbed and i beg you'll sit down mr jackson come sir thundered the latter no trifling perhaps he added opening a warrant you'll obey this mandate a warrant ejaculated kneebone starting to his feet ay sir from the secretary of state for your arrest you're charged with high treason by those who've conspired with me no by those who've entrapped you you've long eluded our vigilance but we've caught you at last damnation exclaimed the woollen draper that i should be the dupe of such a miserable artifice it's no use lamenting now captain you ought rather to be obliged to us for allowing you to pay this visit we could have secured you when you left the mint but we wished to ascertain whether mrs wood's charms equalled your description wretches screamed the lady don't dare to breathe your vile insinuations against me oh mr kneebone are these your french noblemen don't upbraid me rejoined the woollen draper bring him along joe said jackson in a whisper to his comrade smith obeyed but he had scarcely advanced a step when he was felled to the ground by a blow from the powerful arm of kneebone who instantly possessing himself of a pistol levelled it at jackson's head begone or i fire he cried mr wood returned jackson with the utmost composure you're a headborough and a loyal subject of king george i call upon you to assist me in the apprehension of this person you'll be answerable for his escape mr wood i command you not to stir vociferated the carpenter's better half recollect you'll be answerable to me i declare i don't know what to do said wood burned by conflicting emotions mr kneebone you would greatly oblige me by surrendering yourself never replied the woollen draper and if that treacherous rascal by your side doesn't make himself scarce quickly i'll send a bullet through his brain my death will lie at your door remarked jackson to the carpenter show me your warrant said wood almost driven to his wit's end perhaps it isn't regular ask him who he is suggested thames a good idea exclaimed the carpenter may i beg to know whom i've the pleasure of addressing jackson i conclude is merely an assumed name what does it signify returned the latter angrily a great deal replied thames if you won't disclose your name i will for you you are jonathan wild further concealment is needless answered the other pulling off his wig and black patch and resuming his natural tone of voice i am jonathan wild say you so rejoined kneebone then be this your passport to eternity upon which he drew the trigger of the pistol which luckily for the individual against whom it was aimed flashed in the pan i might now send you on a similar journey replied jonathan with a bitter smile and preserving the unmoved demeanour he had maintained throughout but i prefer conveying you in the first instance to newgate the jacobite daws want a scarecrow so saying he sprang with a bound like that of a tiger cat against the throat of the woollen draper and so sudden and well directed was the assault that he completely overthrew his gigantic antagonist lend a hand with the ruffles blueskin he shouted as that personage who had just recovered from the stunning effects of the blow contrived to pick himself up look quick d n you or we shall never master him murder shrieked mrs wood at the top of her voice here's a pistol cried thames darting towards the undischarged weapon dropped by blueskin in the scuffle and pointing it at jonathan shall i shoot him yes yes put it to his ear cried mrs wood that's the surest way no no give it me vociferated wood snatching the pistol and rushing to the door against which he placed his back i'll soon settle this business jonathan wild he added in a loud voice i command you to release your prisoner so i will replied jonathan who with blueskin's aid had succeeded in slipping a pair of handcuffs over the woollen draper's wrists when i've mr walpole's order to that effect but not before you'll take the consequences then willingly in that case i arrest you and your confederate joseph blake alias blueskin on a charge of felony returned wood brandishing his staff resist my authority if you dare a clever device replied jonathan but it won't serve your turn let us pass sir strike the gag blueskin you shall not stir a footstep open the window thames and call for assistance stop cried jonathan who did not care to push matters too far let me have a word with you mr wood i'll have no explanations whatever replied the carpenter disdainfully except before a magistrate at least state your charge it is a serious accusation it is answered wood do you recollect this key do you recollect to whom you gave it and for what purpose or shall i refresh your memory wild appeared confounded release your prisoner continued wood or the window is opened mr wood said jonathan advancing towards him and speaking in a low tone the secret of your adopted son's birth is known to me the name of his father's murderer is also known to me i can help you to both nay i will help you to both if you do not interfere with my plans the arrest of this person is of consequence to me do not oppose it and i will serve you thwart me and i become your mortal enemy i have but to give a hint of that boy's existence in the proper quarter and his life will not be worth a day's purchase don't listen to him father cried thames unconscious of what was passing there are plenty of people outside make your choice said jonathan if you don't decide quickly i'll scream cried mrs wood popping her head through the window set your prisoner free returned wood take off the ruffles blueskin rejoined wild you know my fixed determination he added in a low tone as he passed the carpenter before to morrow night that boy shall join his father so saying he unlocked the door and strode out of the room here are some letters which will let you see what a snake you've cherished in your bosom you uxorious old dotard said blueskin tossing a packet of papers to wood as he followed his leader 'odd's my life what's this exclaimed the carpenter looking at the superscription of one of them why this is your writing dolly and addressed to mr kneebone my writing no such thing ejaculated the lady casting a look of alarm at the woollen draper confusion the rascal must have picked my pocket of your letters whispered kneebone what's to be done what's to be done why i'm undone how imprudent in you not to burn them but men are so careless there's no trusting anything to them however i must try to brazen it out give me the letters my love she added aloud and in her most winning accents they're some wicked forgeries excuse me madam replied the carpenter turning his back upon her and sinking into a chair thames my love bring me my spectacles my heart misgives me fool that i was to marry for beauty i ought to have remembered that a fair woman and a slashed gown always find some nail in the way chapter vi the first step towards the ladder if there is one thing on earth more lovely than another it is a fair girl of the tender age of winifred wood her beauty awakens no feeling beyond that of admiration the charm of innocence breathes around her as fragrance is diffused by the flower sanctifying her lightest thought and action and shielding her like a spell from the approach of evil beautiful is the girl of twelve who is neither child nor woman but something between both something more exquisite than either such was the fairy creature presented to thames darrell under the following circumstances glad to escape from the scene of recrimination that ensued between his adopted parents thames seized the earliest opportunity of retiring and took his way to a small chamber in the upper part of the house where he and jack were accustomed to spend most of their leisure in the amusements or pursuits proper to their years he found the door ajar and to his surprise perceived little winifred seated at a table busily engaged in tracing some design upon a sheet of paper she did not hear his approach but continued her occupation without raising her head it was a charming sight to watch the motions of her tiny fingers as she pursued her task and though the posture she adopted was not the most favourable that might have been chosen for the display of her sylphlike figure there was something in her attitude and the glow of her countenance lighted up by the mellow radiance of the setting sun falling upon her through the panes of the little dormer window that seemed to the youth inexpressibly beautiful winifred's features would have been pretty for they were regular and delicately formed if they had not been slightly marked by the small pox a disorder that sometimes spares more than it destroys and imparts an expression to be sought for in vain in the smoothest complexion we have seen pitted cheeks which we would not exchange for dimples and a satin skin winifred's face had a thoroughly amiable look her mouth was worthy of her face with small pearly white teeth lips glossy rosy and pouting and the sweetest smile imaginable playing constantly about them her eyes were soft and blue arched over by dark brows and fringed by long silken lashes her hair was of the darkest brown and finest texture and when unloosed hung down to her heels she was dressed in a little white frock with a very long body and very short sleeves which looked from a certain fullness about the hips as if it was intended to be worn with a hoop her slender throat was encircled by a black riband with a small locket attached to it and upon the top of her head rested a diminutive lace cap the room in which she sat was a portion of the garret assigned as we have just stated by mr wood as a play room to the two boys and like most boy's playrooms it exhibited a total absence of order or neatness things were thrown here and there to be taken up or again cast aside as the whim arose while the broken backed chairs and crazy table bore the marks of many a conflict the characters of the youthful occupants of the room might be detected in every article it contained darell's peculiar bent of mind was exemplified in a rusty broadsword a tall grenadier's cap a musket without lock or ramrod a belt and cartouch box with other matters evincing a decided military taste among his books plutarch's lives and the histories of great commanders appeared to have been frequently consulted but the dust had gathered thickly upon the carpenter's manual and a treatise on trigonometry and geometry beneath the shelf containing these books hung the fine old ballad of 'st george for england' and a loyal ditty then much in vogue called 'true protestant gratitude or britain's thanksgiving for the first of august being the day of his majesty's happy accession to the throne' jack sheppard's library consisted of a few ragged and well thumbed volumes abstracted from the tremendous chronicles bequeathed to the world by those froissarts and holinsheds of crime the ordinaries of newgate his vocal collection comprised a couple of flash songs pasted against the wall entitled 'the thief catcher's prophecy' and the 'life and death of the darkman's budge' while his extraordinary mechanical skill was displayed in what he termed jack had a supreme contempt for orthography a 'moddle of his mas jale off newgate' another model of the pillory at fleet bridge and a third of the permanent gibbet at tyburn the latter specimen of his workmanship was adorned with a little scarecrow figure intended to represent a housebreaking chimney sweeper of the time described in sheppard's own hand writing as 'jack hall a hanging' we must not omit to mention that a family group from the pencil of little winifred representing mr and mrs wood in very characteristic attitudes occupied a prominent place on the walls for a few moments thames regarded the little girl through the half opened door in silence on a sudden a change came over her countenance which up to this moment had worn a smiling and satisfied expression throwing down the pencil she snatched up a piece of india rubber and exclaiming it isn't at all like him it isn't half handsome enough was about to efface the sketch when thames darted into the room who isn't it like he asked endeavouring to gain possession of the drawing which af the sound of his footstep she crushed between her fingers i can't tell you she replied blushing deeply and clinching her little hand as tightly as possible it's a secret i'll soon find it out then he returned playfully forcing the paper from her grasp don't look at it i entreat she cried but her request was unheeded thames unfolded the drawing smoothed out its creases and beheld a portrait of himself i've a good mind not to speak to you again sir cried winifred with difficulty repressing a tear of vexation you've acted unfairly i feel i have dear winny replied thames abashed at his own rudeness my conduct is inexcusable i'll excuse it nevertheless returned the little damsel affectionately extending her hand to him why were you afraid to show me this picture winny asked the youth because it's not like you was her answer well like or not i'm greatly pleased with it and must beg it from you as a memorial of what she interrupted startled by his change of manner of yourself he replied in a mournful tone i shall value it highly and will promise never to part with it winny this is the last night i shall pass beneath your father's roof have you told him so she inquired reproachfully no but i shall before he retires to rest then you will stay she cried clapping her hands joyfully for i'm sure he won't part with you oh thank you thank you i'm so happy stop winny he answered gravely i haven't promised yet but you will won't you she rejoined looking him coaxingly in the face unable to withstand this appeal thames gave the required promise adding oh winny i wish mr wood had been my father as well as yours so do i she cried for then you would have been really my brother no i don't either because well winny i don't know what i was going to say she added in some confusion only i'm sorry you were born a gentleman perhaps i wasn't returned thames gloomily as the remembrance of jonathan wild's foul insinuation crossed him but never mind who or what i am give me this picture i'll keep it for your sake i'll give you something better worth keeping she answered detaching the ornament from her neck and presenting it to him this contains a lock of my hair and may remind you sometimes of your little sister as to the picture i'll keep it myself though if you do go i shall need no memorial of you i'd a good many things to say to you besides but you've put them all out of my head with this she burst into tears and sank with her face upon his shoulder thames did not try to cheer her his own heart was too full of melancholy foreboding he felt that he might soon be separated perhaps for ever from the fond little creature he held in his arms whom he had always regarded with the warmest fraternal affection and the thought of how much she would suffer from the separation so sensibly affected him that he could not help joining in her grief from this sorrowful state he was aroused by a loud derisive whistle followed by a still louder laugh and looking up he beheld the impudent countenance of jack sheppard immediately before him aha exclaimed jack with a roguish wink i've caught you have i the carpenter's daughter was fair and free fair and fickle and false was she she slighted the journeyman meaning me and smiled on a gallant of high degree degree degree she smiled on a gallant of high degree ha ha ha jack exclaimed thames angrily but sheppard was not to be silenced he went on with his song accompanying it with the most ridiculous grimaces when years were gone by she began to rue her love for the gentleman meaning you 'i slighted the journeyman fond' quoth she 'but where is my gallant of high degree where where oh where is my gallant of high degree' ho ho ho what are you doing here demanded thames oh nothing at all answered jack sneeringly though this room's as much mine as yours for that matter 'but i don't desire to spoil sport not i and if you'll give me such a smack of your sweet lips miss as you've just given thames i'll take myself off in less than no time the answer to this request was a smack of a very different description bestowed upon sheppard's outstretched face by the little damsel as she ran out of the room 'odd's bodikins cried jack rubbing his cheek i'm in luck to day however i'd rather have a blow from the daughter than the mother i know who hits hardest i tell you what thames he added flinging himself carelessly into a chair i'd give my right hand and that's no light offer for a carpenter's 'prentice if that little minx were half as fond of me as she is of you that's not likely to be the case if you go on in this way replied thames sharply why what the devil would you have had me do make myself scarce eh you should have tipped me the wink no more of this rejoined thames or we shall quarrel who cares if we do retorted sheppard with a look of defiance jack said the other sternly don't provoke me further or i'll give you a thrashing two can play at that game my blood replied sheppard rising and putting himself into a posture of defence take care of yourself then rejoined thames doubling his fists and advancing towards him though my right arm's stiff i can use it as you'll find sheppard was no match for his opponent for though he possessed more science he was deficient in weight and strength and after a short round in which he had decidedly the worst of it a well directed hit on the nob stretched him at full length on the floor that'll teach you to keep a civil tongue in your head for the future observed thames as he helped jack to his feet i didn't mean to give offence replied sheppard sulkily but let me tell you it's not a pleasant sight to see the girl one likes in the arms of another you want another drubbing i perceive said thames frowning no i don't enough's as good as a feast of the dainties you provide i'll think no more about her save us he cried as his glance accidentally alighted on the drawing which winifred had dropped in her agitation is this her work it is answered thames do you see any likeness don't i returned jack bitterly strange he continued as if talking to himself how very like it is not so strange surely laughed thames that a picture should resemble the person for whom it's intended ay but it is strange how much it resembles somebody for whom it's not intended it's exactly like a miniature i have in my pocket a miniature of whom that i can't say replied jack mysteriously but i half suspect of your father my father exclaimed thames in the utmost astonishment let me see it here it is returned jack producing a small picture in a case set with brilliants thames took it and beheld the portrait of a young man apparently judging from his attire of high rank whose proud and patrician features certainly presented a very striking resemblance to his own you're right jack he said after a pause during which he contemplated the picture with the most fixed attention this must have been my father no doubt of it answered sheppard only compare it with winny's drawing and you'll find they're as like as two peas in a pod where did you get it inquired thames from lady trafford's where i took the box surely you haven't stolen it stolen's an awkward word but as you perceive i brought it away with me it must be restored instantly be the consequences what they may you're not going to betray me cried jack in alarm i am not replied thames but i insist upon your taking it back at once take it back yourself retorted jack sullenly i shall do no such thing very well replied thames about to depart stop exclaimed jack planting himself before the door do you want to get me sent across the water i want to save you from disgrace and ruin returned thames bah cried jack contemptuously nobody's disgraced and ruined unless he's found out i'm safe enough if you hold your tongue give me that picture or i'll make you hear me said thames calmly you well know you're no match for me not at fisticuffs perhaps interrupted jack fiercely but i've my knife you daren't use it try to leave the room and see whether i daren't returned jack opening the blade i didn't expect this from you rejoined thames resolutely but your threats won't prevent my leaving the room when i please and as i please now will you stand aside i won't answered jack obstinately thames said not another word but marched boldly towards him and seized him by the collar leave go cried jack struggling violently and raising his hand or i'll maul you for life but thames was not to be deterred from his purpose and the strife might have terminated seriously if a peace maker had not appeared in the shape of little winifred who alarmed by the noise rushed suddenly into the room illustration ah she screamed seeing the uplifted weapon in sheppard's hand don't hurt thames don't dear jack if you want to kill somebody kill me not him and she flung herself between them jack dropped the knife and walked sullenly aside what has caused this quarrel thames asked the little girl anxiously you answered jack abruptly no such thing rejoined thames i'll tell you all about it presently but you must leave us now dear winny jack and i have something to settle between ourselves don't be afraid our quarrel's quite over are you sure of that returned winifred looking uneasily at jack ay ay rejoined sheppard he may do what he pleases hang me if he thinks proper if you wish it with this assurance and at the reiterated request of thames the little girl reluctantly withdrew come come jack said thames walking up to sheppard and taking his hand have done with this i tell you once more i'll say and do nothing to get you into trouble best assured of that but i'm resolved to see lady trafford perhaps she may tell me whose picture this is so she may returned jack brightening up it's a good idea i'll go with you but you must see her alone and that'll be no easy matter to manage for she's a great invalid and has generally somebody with her above all beware of sir rowland trenchard he's as savage and suspicious as the devil himself i should never have noticed the miniature at all if it hadn't been for him he was standing by rating her ladyship who can scarcely stir from the sofa while i was packing up her jewels in the case and i observed that she tried to hide a small casket from him his back was no sooner turned than she slipped this casket into the box the next minute i contrived without either of 'em perceiving me to convey it into my own pocket i was sorry for what i did afterwards for i don't know why but poor lady with her pale face and black eyes she reminded me of my mother that alone ought to have prevented you from acting as you did jack returned thames gravely i should never have acted as i did rejoined sheppard bitterly if mrs wood hadn't struck me that blow made me a thief and if ever i'm brought to the gallows i shall lay my death at her door well think no more about it returned thames do better in future i will when i've had my revenge muttered jack but take my advice and keep out of sir rowland's way or you'll get the poor lady into trouble as well as me never fear replied thames taking up his hat come let's be off the two boys then emerged upon the landing and were about to descend the stairs when the voices of mr and mrs wood resounded from below the storm appeared to have blown over for they were conversing in a very amicable manner with mr kneebone who was on the point of departing quite sorry my good friend there should have been any misunderstanding between us observed the woollen draper don't mention it returned wood in the conciliatory tone of one who admits he has been in the wrong your explanation is perfectly satisfactory we shall expect you to morrow insinuated mrs wood and pray don't bring anybody with you especially jonathan wild no fear of that laughed kneebone oh about that boy thames darrell his safety must be looked to jonathan's threats are not to be sneezed at the rascal will be at work before the morning keep your eye upon the lad and mind he doesn't stir out of your sight on any pretence whatever till i call you hear that whispered jack i do replied thames in the same tone we haven't a moment to lose take care of yourself said mr wood and i'll take care of thames it's never a bad day that has a good ending good night god bless you upon this there was a great shaking of hands with renewed apologies and protestations of friendship on both sides after which mr kneebone took his leave and so you really suspected me murmured mrs wood reproachfully as they returned to the parlour oh you men you men once get a thing into your head and nothing will beat it out why my love rejoined her husband appearances you must allow were a little against you but since you assure me you didn't write the letters and mr kneebone assures me he didn't receive them i can't do otherwise than believe you and i've made up my mind that a husband ought to believe only half that he hears and nothing that he sees an excellent maxim replied his wife approvingly the best i ever heard you utter i must now go and look after thames observed the carpenter oh never mind him he'll take no harm come with me into the parlour i can't spare you at present heigho now for it cried jack as the couple entered the room the coast's clear thames was about to follow when he felt a gentle grasp upon his arm he turned and beheld winifred where are you going she asked i shall be back presently replied thames evasively don't go i beg of you she implored you're in danger i overheard what mr kneebone said just now death and the devil what a cursed interruption cried jack impatiently if you loiter in this way old wood will catch us if you stir i'll call him rejoined winifred it's you jack who are persuading my brother to do wrong thames she urged the errand on which you're going can't be for any good or you wouldn't be afraid of mentioning it to my father he's coming cried jack stamping his foot with vexation another moment and it'll be too late winny i must go said thames breaking from her stay dear thames stay cried the little girl he hears me not he's gone she added as the door was opened and shut with violence something tells me i shall never see him again when her father a moment afterwards issued from the parlour to ascertain the cause of the noise he found her seated on the stairs in an agony of grief where's thames he hastily inquired winifred pointed to the door she could not speak and jack gone too sobbed his daughter mr wood uttered something like an imprecation god forgive me for using such a word he cried in a troubled tone if i hadn't yielded to my wife's silly request this wouldn't have happened chapter vii brother and sister on the same evening in a stately chamber of a noble old mansion of elizabeth's time situated in southampton fields two persons were seated one of these a lady evidently a confirmed invalid and attired in deep mourning reclined upon a sort of couch or easy chair set on wheels with her head supported by cushions and her feet resting upon a velvet footstool a crutch with a silver handle stood by her side proving the state of extreme debility to which she was reduced it was no easy matter to determine her age for though she still retained a certain youthfulness of appearance she had many marks in her countenance usually indicating the decline of life but which in her case were no doubt the result of constant and severe indisposition her complexion was wan and faded except where it was tinged by a slight hectic flush that made the want of colour more palpable her eyes were large and black but heavy and lustreless her cheeks sunken her frame emaciated her dark hair thickly scattered with gray when younger and in better health she must have been eminently lovely and there were still the remains of great beauty about her the expression however which would chiefly have interested a beholder was that of settled and profound melancholy her companion was a person of no inferior condition indeed it was apparent from the likeness between them that they were nearly related he had the same dark eyes though lighted by a fierce flame the same sallow complexion the same tall thin figure and majestic demeanour the same proud cast of features but here the resemblance stopped the expression was wholly different he looked melancholy enough it is true but his gloom appeared to be occasioned by remorse rather than sorrow no sterner head was ever beheld beneath the cowl of a monk or the bonnet of an inquisitor he seemed inexorable and inscrutable as fate itself well lady trafford he said fixing a severe look upon her you depart for lancashire to morrow have i your final answer you have sir rowland she answered in a feeble tone but firmly you shall have the sum you require but but what madam do not misunderstand me she proceeded i give it to king james not so you for the furtherance of a great and holy cause not for the prosecution of wild and unprofitable schemes sir rowland bit his lips to repress the answer that rose to them and the will he said with forced calmness do you still refuse to make one i have made one replied lady trafford how cried her brother starting rowland she rejoined you strive in vain to terrify me into compliance with your wishes nothing shall induce me to act contrary to the dictates of my conscience my will is executed and placed in safe custody in whose favour is it made he inquired sternly in favour of my son you have no son rejoined sir rowland moodily i had one answered his sister in a mournful voice and perhaps i have one still if i thought so cried the knight fiercely but this is idle he added suddenly checking himself aliva your child perished with its father and by whom were they both destroyed demanded his sister raising herself by a painful effort and regarding him with a searching glance by the avenger of his family's dishonour by your brother he replied coolly brother cried lady trafford her eye blazing with unnatural light and her cheek suffused with a crimson stain brother she cried lifting her thin fingers towards heaven as god shall judge me i was wedded to that murdered man a lie ejaculated sir rowland furiously a black and damning lie it is the truth replied his sister falling backwards upon the couch i will swear it upon the cross his name then demanded the knight tell me that and i will believe you not now not now she returned with a shudder when i am dead you will learn it do not disquiet yourself you will not have to wait long for the information rowland she added in an altered tone i am certain i shall not live many days and if you treat me in this way you will have my death to answer for as well as the deaths of my husband and child let us part in peace we shall take an eternal farewell of each other be it so rejoined sir rowland with concentrated fury but before we do part i am resolved to know the name of your pretended husband torture shall not wrest it from me answered his sister firmly what motive have you for concealment he demanded a vow she answered a vow to my dead husband sir rowland looked at her for a moment as if he meditated some terrible reply he then arose and taking a few turns in the chamber stopped suddenly before her what has put it into your head that your son yet lives he asked i have dreamed that i shall see him before i die she rejoined dreamed echoed the knight with a ghastly smile is that all then learn from me that your hopes are visionary as their foundation unless he can arise from the bottom of the thames where he and his abhorred father lie buried you will never behold him again in this world heaven have compassion on you rowland murmured his sister crossing her hands and looking upwards you have none on me i will have none till i have forced the villain's name from you he cried stamping the floor with rage rowland your violence is killing me she returned in a plaintive tone his name i say his name thundered the knight and he unsheathed his sword lady trafford uttered a prolonged scream and fainted when she came to herself she found that her brother had quitted the room leaving her to the care of a female attendant her first orders were to summon the rest of her servants to make immediate preparations for her departure for lancashire to night your ladyship ventured an elderly domestic instantly hobson returned lady trafford as soon as the carriage can be brought round it shall be at the door in ten minutes has your ladyship any further commands none whatever yet stay there is one thing i wish you to do take that box and put it into the carriage yourself where is sir rowland in the library your ladyship he has given orders that no one is to disturb him but there's a person in the hall a very odd sort of man waiting to see him who won't be sent away very well lose not a moment hobson the elderly domestic bowed took up the case and retired your ladyship is far too unwell to travel remarked the female attendant assisting her to rise you'll never be able to reach manchester it matters not norris replied lady trafford i would rather die on the road than be exposed to another such scene as i have just encountered dear me sympathised mrs norris i was afraid from the scream i heard that something dreadful had happened sir rowland has a terrible temper indeed a shocking temper i declare he frightens me out of my senses sir rowland is my brother resumed lady trafford coldly well that's no reason why he should treat your ladyship so shamefully i'm sure ah how i wish poor dear sir cecil were alive he'd keep him in order lady trafford sighed deeply your ladyship has never been well since you married sir cecil rejoined mrs norris for my part i don't think you ever quite got over the accident you met with on the night of the great storm norris gasped lady trafford trembling violently mercy on us what have i said cried the attendant greatly alarmed by the agitation of her mistress do sit down your ladyship while i run for the ratifia and rosa solis it is past rejoined lady trafford recovering herself by a powerful effort but never allude to the circumstance again go and prepare for our departure in less time than hobson had mentioned the carriage was announced and lady trafford having been carried down stairs and placed within it the postboy drove off at a rapid pace for barnet chapter viii miching mallecho sir rowland meantime paced his chamber with a quick and agitated step he was ill at ease though he would not have confessed his disquietude even to himself not conceiving that his sister feeble as she was and yielding as she had ever shown herself to his wishes whether expressed or implied would depart without consulting him he was equally surprised and enraged to hear the servants busied in transporting her to the carriage his pride however would not suffer him to interfere with their proceedings much less could he bring himself to acknowledge that he had been in the wrong and entreat lady trafford to remain though he was well aware that her life might be endangered if she travelled by night but when the sound of the carriage wheels died away and he felt that she was actually gone his resolution failed him and he rang the bell violently my horses charcam he said as a servant appeared the man lingered 'sdeath why am i not obeyed exclaimed the knight angrily i wish to overtake lady trafford use despatch her ladyship will not travel beyond saint alban's to night sir rowland so mrs norris informed me returned charcam respectfully and there's a person without anxious for an audience whom with submission i think your honour would desire to see ah exclaimed sir rowland glancing significantly at charcam who was a confidant in his jacobite schemes is it the messenger from orchard windham from sir william no sir rowland from mr corbet kynaston then sir john packington's courier was here yesterday no sir rowland perhaps he is from lord derwentwater or mr forster news is expected from northumberland i can't exactly say sir rowland the gentleman didn't communicate his business to me but i'm sure it's important charcam said this not because he knew anything about the matter but having received a couple of guineas to deliver the message he naturally enough estimated its importance by the amount of the gratuity well i will see him replied the knight after a moment's pause he may be from the earl of mar but let the horses be in readiness i shall ride to st alban's to night so saying he threw himself into a chair and charcam fearful of another charge in his master's present uncertain mood disappeared the person shortly afterwards ushered into the room seemed by the imperfect light for the evening was advancing and the chamber darkened by heavy drapery to be a middle sized middle aged man of rather vulgar appearance but with a very shrewd aspect he was plainly attired in a riding dress and boots of the period and wore a hanger by his side your servant sir rowland said the stranger ducking his head as he advanced your business sir returned the other stiffly the new comer looked at charcam sir rowland waved his hand and the attendant withdrew you don't recollect me i presume premised the stranger taking a seat the knight who could ill brook this familiarity instantly arose don't disturb yourself continued the other nowise disconcerted by the rebuke i never stand upon ceremony where i know i shall be welcome we have met before indeed rejoined sir rowland haughtily perhaps you will refresh my memory as to the time and place let me see the time was the th of november the place the mint in southwark i have a good memory you perceive sir rowland the knight staggered as if struck by a mortal wound speedily recovering himself however he rejoined with forced calmness you are mistaken sir i was in lancashire at our family seat at the time you mention the stranger smiled incredulously well sir rowland he said after a brief pause during which the knight regarded him with a searching glance as if endeavouring to recall his features i will not gainsay your words you are in the right to be cautious till you know with whom you have to deal and even then you can't be too wary 'avow nothing believe nothing give nothing for nothing' is my own motto and it's a maxim of universal application or at least of universal practice i am not come here to play the part of your father confessor i am come to serve you in what way sir demanded trenchard in astonishment you will learn anon you refuse me your confidence i applaud your prudence it is however needless your history your actions nay your very thoughts are better known to me than to your spiritual adviser make good your assertions cried trenchard furiously or to the proof interrupted the stranger calmly you are the son of sir montacute trenchard of ashton hall near manchester sir montacute had three children two daughters and yourself the eldest constance was lost by the carelessness of a servant during her infancy and has never since been heard of the youngest aliva is the present lady trafford i merely mention these circumstances to show the accuracy of my information if this is the extent of it sir returned the knight ironically you may spare yourself further trouble these particulars are familiar to all who have any title to the knowledge perhaps so rejoined the stranger but i have others in reserve not so generally known with your permission i will go on in my own way where i am in error you can set me right your father sir montacute trenchard who had been a loyal subject of king james the second and borne arms in his service on the abdication of that monarch turned his back upon the stuarts and would never afterwards recognise their claims to the crown it was said that he received an affront from james in the shape of a public reprimand which his pride could not forgive be this as it may though a catholic he died a friend to the protestant succession so far you are correct observed trenchard still this is no secret suffer me to proceed replied the stranger the opinions entertained by the old knight naturally induced him to view with displeasure the conduct of his son who warmly espoused the cause he had deserted finding remonstrances of no avail he had recourse to threats and when threats failed he adopted more decided measures ha ejaculated trenchard as yet pursued the stranger sir montacute had placed no limit to his son's expenditure he did not quarrel with rowland's profusion for his own revenues were ample but he did object to the large sums lavished by him in the service of a faction he was resolved not to support accordingly the old knight reduced his son's allowance to a third of its previous amount and upon further provocation he even went so far as to alter his will in favour of his daughter aliva who was then betrothed to her cousin sir cecil trafford proceed sir said trenchard breathing hard under these circumstances rowland did what any other sensible person would do aware of his father's inflexibility of purpose he set his wits to work to defeat the design he contrived to break off his sister's match and this he accomplished so cleverly that he maintained the strictest friendship with sir cecil for two years he thought himself secure and secretly engaged in the jacobite schemes of the time in which also sir cecil was deeply involved he began to relax in his watchfulness over aliva about this time namely in november while young trenchard was in lancashire and his sister in london on a visit he received a certain communication from his confidential servant davies which at once destroyed his hopes he learnt that his sister was privately married the name or rank of her husband could not be ascertained and living in retirement in an obscure dwelling in the borough where she had given birth to a son rowland's plans were quickly formed and as quickly executed accompanied by sir cecil who still continued passionately enamoured of his sister and to whom he represented that she had fallen a victim to the arts of a seducer he set off at fiery speed for the metropolis arrived there their first object was to seek out davies by whom they were conducted to the lady's retreat a lone habitation situated on the outskirts of saint george's fields in southwark refused admittance they broke open the door aliva's husband who passed by the name of darrell confronted them sword in hand for a few minutes he kept them at bay but urged by his wife's cries who was more anxious for the preservation of her child's life than her own he snatched up the infant and made his escape from the back of the premises rowland and his companions instantly started in pursuit leaving the lady to recover as she might they tracked the fugitive to the mint but like hounds at fault they here lost all scent of their prey meantime the lady had overtaken them but terrified by the menaces of her vindictive kinsmen she did not dare to reveal herself to her husband of whose concealment on the roof of the very house the party were searching she was aware aided by an individual who was acquainted with a secret outlet from the tenement darrell escaped before his departure he gave his assistant a glove that glove is still preserved in her endeavour to follow him aliva met with a severe fall and was conveyed away in a state of insensibility by sir cecil she was supposed to be lifeless but she survived the accident though she never regained her strength directed by the same individual who had helped darrell to steal a march upon him rowland with davies and another attendant continued the pursuit both the fugitive and his chasers embarked on the thames the elements were wrathful as their passions the storm burst upon them in its fury unmindful of the terrors of the night unscared by the danger that threatened him rowland consigned his sister's husband and his sister's child to the waves bring your story to an end sir said trenchard who had listened to the recital with mingled emotions of rage and fear i have nearly done replied the stranger as rowland's whole crew perished in the tempest and he only escaped by miracle he fancied himself free from detection and for twelve years he has been so until his long security well nigh obliterating remembrance of the deed has bred almost a sense of innocence within his breast during this period sir montacute has been gathered to his fathers his title has descended to rowland his estates to aliva the latter has since been induced to unite herself to sir cecil on terms originating with her brother and which however strange and unprecedented were acquiesced in by the suitor sir rowland looked bewildered with surprise the marriage was never consummated continued the imperturbable stranger sir cecil is no more lady trafford supposed to be childless broken in health and spirits frail both in mind and body is not likely to make another marriage the estates must ere long revert to sir rowland are you man or fiend exclaimed trenchard staring at the stranger as he concluded his narration you are complimentary sir rowland returned the other with a grim smile if you are human rejoined trenchard with stern emphasis i insist upon knowing whence you derived your information i might refuse to answer the question sir rowland but i am not indisposed to gratify you partly from your confessor partly from other sources my confessor ejaculated the knight in the extremity of surprise has he betrayed his sacred trust he has replied the other grinning and this will be a caution to you in future how you confide a secret of consequence to a priest i should as soon think of trusting a woman tickle the ears of their reverences with any idle nonsense you please but tell them nothing you care to have repeated i was once a disciple of saint peter myself and speak from experience who are you ejaculated trenchard scarcely able to credit his senses i'm surprised you've not asked that question before sir rowland it would have saved me much circumlocution and you some suspense my name is wild jonathan wild and the great thief taker indulged himself in a chuckle at the effect produced by this announcement he was accustomed to such surprises and enjoyed them sir rowland laid his hand upon his sword mr wild he said in a sarcastic tone but with great firmness a person of your well known sagacity must be aware that some secrets are dangerous to the possessor i am fully aware of it sir rowland replied jonathan coolly but i have nothing to fear because in the first place it will be to your advantage not to molest me and in the second i am provided against all contingencies i never hunt the human tiger without being armed my janizaries are without one of them is furnished with a packet containing the heads of the statement i have just related which if i don't return at a certain time will be laid before the proper authorities i have calculated my chances you perceive you have forgotten that you are in my power returned the knight sternly and that all your allies cannot save you from my resentment i can at least protect myself replied wild with provoking calmness i am accounted a fair shot as well as a tolerable swordsman and i will give proof of my skill in both lines should occasion require it i have had a good many desperate engagements in my time and have generally come off victorious i bear the marks of some of them about me still he continued taking off his wig and laying bare a bald skull covered with cicatrices and plates of silver this gash he added pointing to one of the larger scars was a wipe from the hanger of tom thurland whom i apprehended for the murder of mrs knap this wedge of silver pointing to another which would mend a coffee pot serves to stop up a breach made by will colthurst who robbed mr hearl on hounslow heath i secured the dog after he had wounded me this fracture was the handiwork of jack parrot otherwise called jack the grinder who broke into the palace of the bishop of norwich jack was a comical scoundrel and made a little too free with his grace's best burgundy as well as his grace's favourite housekeeper the bishop however to show him the danger of meddling with the church gave him a dance at tyburn for his pains not a scar but has its history the only inconvenience i feel from my shattered noddle is an incapacity to drink but that's an infirmity shared by a great many sounder heads than mine the hardest bout i ever had was with a woman sally wells who was afterwards lagged for shoplifting she attacked me with a carving knife and when i had disarmed her the jade bit off a couple of fingers from my left hand thus you see i've never hesitated and never shall hesitate to expose my life where anything is to be gained my profession has hardened me and with this he coolly re adjusted his peruke what do you expect to gain from this interview mr wild demanded trenchard as if he had formed a sudden resolution ah now we come to business returned jonathan rubbing his hands gleefully these are my terms sir rowland he added taking a sheet of paper from his pocket and pushing it towards the knight trenchard glanced at the document a thousand pounds he observed gloomily is a heavy price to pay for doubtful secrecy when certain silence might be so cheaply procured you would purchase it at the price of your head replied jonathan knitting his brows sir rowland he added savagely and with somewhat of the look of a bull dog before he flies at his foe if it were my pleasure to do so i could crush you with a breath you are wholly in my power your name with the fatal epithet of 'dangerous' attached to it stands foremost on the list of disaffected now before the secret committee i hold a warrant from mr walpole for your apprehension arrested exclaimed trenchard drawing his sword put up your blade sir rowland rejoined jonathan resuming his former calm demeanour king james the third will need it i have no intention of arresting you i have a different game to play and it'll be your own fault if you don't come off the winner i offer you my assistance on certain terms the proposal is so far from being exorbitant that it should be trebled if i had not a fellow feeling in the cause to be frank with you i have an affront to requite which can be settled at the same time and in the same way with your affair that's worth something to me for i don't mind paying for revenge after all a thousand pounds is a trifle to rid you of an upstart who may chance to deprive you of tens of thousands did i hear you aright asked trenchard with startling eagerness certainly replied jonathan with the most perfect sangfroid i'll undertake to free you from the boy that's part of the bargain is he alive vociferated trenchard to be sure returned wild he's not only alive but likely for life if we don't clip the thread sir rowland caught at a chair for support and passed his hand across his brow on which the damp had gathered thickly the intelligence seems new to you i thought i'd been sufficiently explicit continued jonathan most persons would have guessed my meaning then it was not a dream ejaculated sir rowland in a hollow voice and as if speaking to himself i did see them on the platform of the bridge the child and his preserver they were not struck by the fallen ruin nor whelmed in the roaring flood or if they were they escaped as i escaped god i have cheated myself into a belief that the boy perished and now my worst fears are realized he lives as yet returned jonathan with fearful emphasis i cannot dare not injure him rejoined trenchard with a haggard look and sinking as if paralysed into a chair jonathan laughed scornfully leave him to me he said he shan't trouble you further no replied sir rowland who appeared completely prostrated i will struggle no longer with destiny too much blood has been shed already this comes of fine feelings muttered jonathan contemptuously give me your thorough paced villain but i shan't let him off thus i'll try a strong dose am i to understand that you intend to plead guilty sir rowland he added if so i may as well execute my warrant stand off sir exclaimed trenchard starting suddenly backwards i knew that would bring him to thought wild where is the boy demanded sir rowland at present under the care of his preserver one owen wood a carpenter by whom he was brought up wood exclaimed trenchard of wych street the same a boy from his shop was here a short time ago could it be him you mean no that boy was the carpenter's apprentice jack sheppard i've just left your nephew at this moment charcam entered the room beg pardon sir rowland said the attendant but there's a boy from mr wood with a message for lady trafford from whom vociferated trenchard from mr wood the carpenter the same who was here just now no sir rowland a much finer boy 'tis he by heaven cried jonathan this is lucky sir rowland he added in a deep whisper do you agree to my terms i do answered trenchard in the same tone enough rejoined wild he shall not return have you acquainted him with lady trafford's departure said the knight addressing charcam with as much composure as he could assume no sir rowland replied the attendant as you proposed to ride to saint albans to night i thought you might choose to see him yourself besides there's something odd about the boy for though i questioned him pretty closely concerning his business he declined answering my questions and said he could only deliver his message to her ladyship i thought it better not to send him away till i'd mentioned the circumstance to you you did right returned trenchard where is he asked jonathan in the hall replied charcam alone not exactly sir there's another lad at the gate waiting for him the same who was here just now that sir rowland was speaking of who fastened up the jewel case for her ladyship a jewel case exclaimed jonathan ah i see it all he cried with a quick glance jack sheppard's fingers are lime twigs was anything missed after the lad's departure sir rowland not that i'm aware of said the knight stay something occurs to me and he conferred apart with jonathan that's it cried wild when trenchard concluded this young fool is come to restore the article whatever it may be which lady trafford was anxious to conceal and which his companion purloined it's precisely what such a simpleton would do we have him as safe as a linnet in a cage and could wring his neck round as easily oblige me by acting under my guidance in the matter sir rowland i'm an old hand at such things harkee he added mr what's your name charcam replied the attendant bowing very well mr charcoal you may bring in the boy but not a word to him of lady trafford's absence mind that a robbery has been committed and your master suspects this lad as an accessory to the offence he therefore desires to interrogate him it will be necessary to secure his companion and as you say he is not in the house some caution must be used in approaching him or he may chance to take to his heels for he's a slippery little rascal when you've seized him cough thrice thus and two rough looking gentlemen will make their appearance don't be alarmed by their manners mr charcoal they're apt to be surly to strangers but it soon wears off the gentleman with the red beard will relieve you of your prisoner the other must call a coach as quickly as he can for whom sir inquired charcam for me his master mr jonathan wild are you mr jonathan wild asked the attendant in great trepidation i am charcoal but don't let my name frighten you though said the thief taker with a complacent smile all the world seems to tremble at it obey my orders and you've nothing to fear about them quickly lead the lad to suppose that he'll be introduced to lady trafford you understand me charcoal the attendant did not understand him he was confounded by the presence in which he found himself but not daring to confess his want of comprehension he made a profound reverence and retired chapter ix consequences of the theft how do you mean to act sir inquired trenchard as soon as they were left alone as circumstances shall dictate sir rowland returned jonathan something is sure to arise in the course of the investigation of which i can take advantage if not i'll convey him to st giles's round house on my own responsibility is this your notable scheme asked the knight scornfully once there proceeded wild without noticing the interruption he's as good as in his grave the constable sharples is in my pay i can remove the prisoner at any hour of the night i think fit and i will remove him you must know sir rowland for i've no secrets from you that in the course of my business i've found it convenient to become the owner of a small dutch sloop by means of which i can transmit any light ware such as gold watches rings and plate as well as occasionally a bank or goldsmith's note which has been spoken with by way of the mail you understand me to holland or flanders and obtain a secure and ready market for them this vessel is now in the river off wapping her cargo is nearly shipped she will sail at early dawn to morrow for rotterdam her commander rykhart van galgebrok is devoted to my interests as soon as he gets into blue water he'll think no more of pitching the boy overboard than of lighting his pipe this will be safer than cutting his throat on shore i've tried the plan and found it answer the northern ocean keeps a secret better than the thames sir rowland before midnight your nephew shall be safe beneath the hatches of the zeeslang poor child muttered trenchard abstractedly the whole scene upon the river is passing before me i hear the splash in the water i see the white object floating like a sea bird on the tide it will not sink 'sblood exclaimed jonathan in a tone of ill disguised contempt it won't do to indulge those fancies now be seated and calm yourself i have often conjured up some frightful vision of the dead murmured the knight but i never dreamed of an interview with the living it'll be over in a few minutes rejoined jonathan impatiently in fact it'll be over too soon for me i like such interviews but we waste time have the goodness to affix your name to that memorandum sir rowland i require nothing you see till my share of the contract is fulfilled trenchard took up a pen it's the boy's death warrant observed jonathan with a sinister smile i cannot sign it returned trenchard damnation exclaimed wild with a snarl that displayed his glistening fangs to the farthest extremity of his mouth i'm not to be trifled with thus that paper must be signed or i take my departure go sir rejoined the knight haughtily ay ay i'll go fast enough returned jonathan putting his hands into his pockets but not alone sir rowland at this juncture the door was flung open and charcam entered dragging in thames whom he held by the collar and who struggled in vain to free himself from the grasp imposed upon him here's one of the thieves sir rowland cried the attendant i was only just in time the young rascal had learnt from some of the women servants that lady trafford was from home and was in the very act of making off when i got down stairs come along my newgate bird he continued shaking him with great violence jonathan gave utterance to a low whistle if things had gone smoothly he thought i should have cursed the fellow's stupidity as it is i'm not sorry for the blunder trenchard meanwhile whose gaze was fixed upon the boy became livid as death but he moved not a muscle 't is he he mentally ejaculated what do you think of your nephew sir rowland whispered jonathan who sat with his back towards thames so that his features were concealed from the youth's view it would be a thousand pities wouldn't it to put so promising a lad out of the way devil exclaimed the knight fiercely give me the paper jonathan hastily picked up the pen and presented it to trenchard who attached his signature to the document if i am the devil observed wild as some folks assert and i myself am not unwilling to believe you'll find that i differ from the generally received notions of the arch fiend and faithfully execute the commands of those who confide their souls to my custody take hence this boy then rejoined trenchard his looks unman me of what am i accused asked thames who though a good deal alarmed at first had now regained his courage of robbery replied jonathan in a thundering voice and suddenly confronting him you've charged with assisting your comrade jack sheppard to purloin certain articles of value from a jewel case belonging to lady trafford aha he continued producing a short silver staff which he carried constantly about with him and uttering a terrible imprecation i see you're confounded down on your marrow bones sirrah confess your guilt and sir rowland may yet save you from the gallows i've nothing to confess replied thames boldly i've done no wrong are you my accuser i am replied wild have you anything to allege to the contrary only this returned thames that the charge is false and malicious and that you know it to be so is that all retorted jonathan come i must search you my youngster you shan't touch me rejoined thames and suddenly bursting from charcam he threw himself at the feet of trenchard hear me sir rowland he cried i am innocent f have stolen nothing this person this jonathan wild whom i beheld for the first time scarcely an hour ago in wych street is i know not why my enemy he has sworn that he'll take away my life bah interrupted jonathan you won't listen to this nonsense sir rowland if you are innocent boy said the knight controlling his emotion you have nothing to apprehend but what brought you here excuse me sir rowland i cannot answer that question my business is with lady trafford are you aware that i am her ladyship's brother returned the knight she has no secrets from me possibly not replied thames in some confusion but i am not at liberty to speak your hesitation is not in your favour observed trenchard sternly will he consent to be searched inquired jonathan no rejoined thames i won't be treated like a common felon if i can help it you shall be treated according to your deserts then said jonathan maliciously and in spite of the boy's resistance he plunged his hands into his pockets and drew forth the miniature where did you get this from asked wild greatly surprised at the result of his investigation thames returned no answer i thought as much continued jonathan but we'll find a way to make you open your lips presently bring in his comrade he added in a whisper to charcam i'll take care of him and don't neglect my instructions this time upon which with an assurance that he would not do so the attendant departed you can of course identify this picture as lady trafford's property pursued jonathan with a meaning glance as he handed it to the knight i can replied trenchard ha he exclaimed with a sudden start as his glance fell upon the portrait how came this into your possession boy why don't you answer sirrah cried wild in a savage tone and striking him with the silver staff can't you speak i don't choose replied thames sturdily and your brutality shan't make me we'll see that replied jonathan dealing him another and more violent blow let him alone said trenchard authoritatively i have another question to propose do you know whoso portrait this is i do not replied thames repressing his tears but i believe it to be the portrait of my father indeed exclaimed the knight in astonishment is your father alive no returned thames he was assassinated while i was an infant who told you this is his portrait demanded trenchard my heart rejoined thames firmly which now tells me i am in the presence of his murderer that's me interposed jonathan a thief taker is always a murderer in the eyes of a thief i'm almost sorry your suspicions are unfounded if your father in any way resembled you my youngster but i can tell you who'll have the pleasure of hanging your father's son and that's a person not a hundred miles distant from you at this moment ha ha as he said this the door was opened and charcam entered accompanied by a dwarfish shabby looking man in a brown serge frock with coarse jewish features and a long red beard between the jew and the attendant came jack sheppard while a crowd of servants attracted by the news that the investigation of a robbery was going forward lingered at the doorway in hopes of catching something of the proceedings when jack was brought in he cast a rapid glance around him and perceiving thames in the custody of jonathan instantly divined how matters stood as he looked in this direction wild gave him a significant wink the meaning of which he was not slow to comprehend get it over quickly said trenchard in a whisper to the thief taker jonathan nodded assent what's your name he said addressing the audacious lad who was looking about him as coolly as if nothing material was going on jack sheppard returned the boy fixing his eyes upon a portrait of the earl of mar who's that queer cove in the full bottomed wig attend to me sirrah rejoined wild sternly do you know this picture he added with another significant look and pointing to the miniature i do replied jack carelessly that's well can you inform us whence it came i should think so state the facts then it came from lady trafford's jewel box here a murmur of amazement arose from the assemblage outside close the door commanded trenchard impatiently in my opinion sir rowland suggested jonathan you'd better allow the court to remain open be it so replied the knight who saw the force of this reasoning continue the proceedings you say that the miniature was abstracted from lady trafford's jewel box said jonathan in a loud voice who took it thence thames darrell the boy at your side jack cried thames in indignant surprise but sheppard took no notice of the exclamation illustration a loud buzz of curiosity circulated among the domestics some of whom especially the females leaned forward to obtain a peep at the culprit si lence vociferated charcam laying great emphasis on the last syllable were you present at the time of the robbery pursued jonathan i was answered sheppard and will swear to it i will liar ejaculated thames enough exclaimed wild triumphantly close the court mr charcoal they've heard quite enough for my purpose he muttered as his orders were obeyed and the domestics excluded it's too late to carry 'em before a magistrate now sir rowland so with your permission i'll give 'em a night's lodging in saint giles's round house you jack sheppard have nothing to fear as you've become evidence against your accomplice to morrow i shall carry you before justice walters who'll take your information and i've no doubt but thames darrell will be fully committed now for the cage my pretty canary bird before we start i'll accommodate you with a pair of ruffles and he proceeded to handcuff his captive hear me cried thames bursting into tears i am innocent i could not have committed this robbery i have only just left wych street send for mr wood and you'll find that i've spoken the truth you'd better hold your peace my lad observed jonathan in a menacing tone lady trafford would not have thus condemned me cried thames away with him exclaimed sir rowland impatiently take the prisoners below nab said jonathan addressing the dwarfish jew i'll join you in an instant the bearded miscreant seized jack by the waist and thames by the nape of the neck and marched off like the ogre in the fairy tale with a boy under each arm while charcam brought upt the rear chapter x mother and son they had scarcely been gone a moment when a confused noise was heard without and charcam re entered the room with a countenance of the utmost bewilderment and alarm what's the matter with the man demanded wild her ladyship faltered the attendant what of her cried the knight is she returned y e s sir rowland stammered charcam the devil ejaculated jonathan here's a cross bite but that's not all your honour continued charcam mrs norris says she's dying dying echoed the knight dying sir rowland she was taken dreadfully ill on the road with spasms and short breath and swoonings worse than ever she was before and mrs norris was so frightened that she ordered the postboys to drive back as fast as they could she never expected to get her ladyship home alive my god cried trenchard stunned by the intelligence i have killed her no doubt rejoined wild with a sneer but don't let all the world know it they're lifting her out of the carriage interposed charcam will it please your honour to send for some advice and the chaplain fly for both returned sir rowland in a tone of bitter anguish stay interposed jonathan where are the boys in the hall her ladyship will pass through it of course there's no other way then bring them into this room the first thing quick they must not meet sir rowland he added as charcam hastened to obey his instructions heaven has decreed it otherwise replied the knight dejectedly i yield to fate yield to nothing returned wild trying to re assure him above all when your designs prosper man's fate is in his own hands you are your nephew's executioner or he is yours cast off this weakness the next hour makes or mars you for ever go to your sister and do not quit her till all is over leave the rest to me sir rowland moved irresolutely towards the door but recoiled before a sad spectacle this was his sister evidently in the last extremity borne in the arms of a couple of assistants and preceded by mrs norris wringing her hands and wepping the unfortunate lady was placed upon a couch at the same time charcam who seemed perfectly distracted by the recent occurrences dragged in thames leaving jack sheppard outside in the custody of the dwarfish jew hell's curses muttered jonathan between his teeth that fool will ruin all take him away he added striding up to charcam let him remain interposed trenchard as you please sir rowland returned jonathan with affected indifference but i'm not going to hunt the deer for another to eat the ven'son depend on 't but seeing that no notice was taken of the retort he drew a little aside and folded his arms muttering this whim will soon be over she can't last long i can pull the strings of this stiff necked puppet as i please sir rowland meantime throw himself on his knees beside his sister and clasping her chilly fingers within his own besought her forgiveness in the most passionate terms for a few minutes she appeared scarcely sensible of his presence but after some restoratives had been administered by mrs norris she revived a little rowland she said in a faint voice i have not many minutes to live where is father spencer i must have absolution i have something that weighs heavily upon my mind sir rowland's brow darkened i have sent for him aliva he answered he will be here directly with your medical advisers they are useless she returned medicine cannot save mo now dear sister i should die happy if i could behold my child comfort yourself then aliva you shall behold him you are mocking me rowland jests are not for seasons like this i am not by heaven returned the knight solemnly leave us mrs norris and do not return till father spencer arrives your ladyship hesitated norris go said lady trafford it is my last request and her faithful attendant drowned in tears withdrew followed by the two assistants jonathan stepped behind a curtain rowland said lady trafford regarding him with a look of indescribable anxiety you have assured me that i shall behold my son where is he within this room replied the knight here shrieked lady trafford here repeated her brother but calm yourself dear sister or the interview will be too much for you i am calm quite calm rowland she answered with lips whose agitation belied her words then the story of his death was false i knew it i was sure you could not have the heart to slay a child an innocent child god forgive you may he indeed forgive me returned trenchard crossing himself devoutly but my guilt is not the less heavy because your child escaped this hand consigned him to destruction but another was stretched forth to save him the infant was rescued from a watery grave by an honest mechanic who has since brought him up as his own son blessings upon him cried lady trafford fervently but trifle with mo no longer moments are ages now let me see my child if he is really here behold him returned trenchard taking thames who had been a mute but deeply interested witness of the scene by the hand and leading him towards her ah exclaimed lady trafford exerting all her strength my sight is failing me let me have more light that i may behold him yes she screamed these are his father's features it is it is my son mother cried thames are you indeed my mother i am indeed my own sweet boy she sobbed pressing him tenderly to her breast oh to see you thus cried thames in an agony of affliction don't weep my love replied the lady straining him still more closely to her i am happy quite happy now during this touching interview a change had come over sir rowland and he half repented of what he had done you can no longer refuse to tell me the name of this youth's father aliva he said i dare not rowland she answered i cannot break my vow i will confide it to father spencer who will acquaint you with it when i am no more undraw the curtain love she added to thames that i may look at you ha exclaimed her son starting back as he obeyed her and disclosed jonathan wild be silent said jonathan in a menacing whisper what have you seen inquired lady trafford my enemy replied her son your enemy she returned imperfectly comprehending him sir rowland is your uncle he will be your guardian he will protect you will you not brother promise said a deep voice in trenchard's ear he will kill me cried thames there is a man in this room who seeks my life impossible rejoined his mother look at these fetters returned thames holding up his manacled wrists they were put on by my uncle's command ah shrieked lady trafford not a moment is to be lost whispered jonathan to trenchard his life or yours no one shall harm you more my dear cried lady trafford your uncle must protect you it will be his interest to do so he will be dependent on you do what you please with him muttered trenchard to wild take off these chains rowland said lady trafford instantly i command you i will replied jonathan advancing and rudely seizing thames mother cried the son help what is this shrieked lady trafford raising herself on the couch and extending her hands towards him oh god would you take him from me would you murder him his father's name and he is free rejoined rowland holding her arms release him first and i will disclose it cried lady trafford on my soul i will speak then returned rowland too late shrieked the lady falling heavily backwards too late oh heedless of her cries jonathan passed a handkerchief tightly over her son's mouth and forced him out of the room when he returned a moment or so afterwards he found sir rowland standing by the lifeless body of his sister his countenance was almost as white and rigid as that of the corpse by his side this is your work said the knight sternly not entirely replied jonathan calmly though i shouldn't be ashamed of it if it were after all you failed in obtaining the secret from her sir rowland women are hypocrites to the last true only to themselves peace cried the knight fiercely no offence returned jonathan i was merely about to observe that i am in possession of her secret you didn't i tell you that the fugitive darrell gave me a glove but we'll speak of this hereafter you can purchase the information from me whenever you're so disposed i shan't drive a hard bargain to the point however i came back to say that i've placed your nephew in a coach and if you'll be at my lock in the old bailey an hour after midnight you shall hear the last tidings of him i will be there answered trenchard gloomily you'll not forget the thousand sir rowland short accounts you know fear nothing you shall have your reward thank'ee thank'ee my house is the next door to the cooper's arms in the old bailey opposite newgate you'll find me at supper so saying he bowed and departed that man should have been an italian bravo murmured the knight sinking into a chair he has neither fear nor compunction would i could purchase his apathy as easily as i can procure his assistance soon after this mrs norris entered the room followed by father spencer on approaching the couch they found sir rowland senseless and extended over the dead body of his unfortunate sister chapter xi the mohocks jonathan wild meanwhile had quitted the house he found a coach at the door with the blinds carefully drawn up and ascertained from a tall ill looking though tawdrily dressed fellow who held his horse by the bridle and whom he addressed as quilt arnold that the two boys were safe inside in the custody of abraham mendez the dwarfish jew as soon as he had delivered his instructions to quilt who with abraham constituted his body guard or janizaries as he termed them jonathan mounted his steed and rode off at a gallop quilt was not long in following his example springing upon the box he told the coachman to make the best of his way to saint giles's stimulated by the promise of something handsome to drink the man acquitted himself to admiration in the management of his lazy cattle crack went the whip and away floundered the heavy vehicle through the deep ruts of the ill kept road or rather lane for it was little better which then led across southampton fields skirting the noble gardens of montague house now we need scarcely say the british museum the party speedily reached great russell street a quarter described by strype in his edition of old stow's famous survey as being graced with the best buildings in all bloomsbury and the best inhabited by the nobility and gentry especially the north side as having gardens behind the houses and the prospect of the pleasant fields up to hampstead and highgate insomuch that this place by physicians is esteemed the most healthful of any in london neither of the parties outside bestowed much attention upon these stately and salubriously situated mansions indeed as it was now not far from ten o'clock and quite dark they could scarcely discern them but in spite of his general insensibility to such matters quilt could not help commenting upon the delicious perfume wafted from the numerous flower beds past which they were driving the coachman answered by a surly grunt and plying his whip with redoubled zeal shaped his course down dyot street traversed that part of holborn which is now called broad street and where two ancient alms houses were then standing in the middle of that great thoroughfare exactly opposite the opening of compston street and diving under a wide gateway on the left soon reached a more open space surrounded by mean habitations coach houses and stables called kendrick yard at the further end of which saint giles's round house was situated no sooner did the vehicle turn the corner of this yard than quilt became aware from the tumultuous sounds that reached his ears as well as from the flashing of various lanterns at the door of the round house that some disturbance was going on and apprehensive of a rescue if he drew up in the midst of the mob he thought it prudent to come to a halt accordingly he stopped the coach dismounted and hastened towards the assemblage which he was glad to find consisted chiefly of a posse of watchmen and other guardians of the night quilt who was an ardent lover of mischief could not help laughing most heartily at the rueful appearance of these personages not one of them but bore the marks of having been engaged in a recent and severe conflict quarter staves bludgeons brown bills lanterns swords and sconces were alike shivered and to judge from the sullied state of their habiliments the claret must have been tapped pretty freely never was heard such a bawling as these unfortunate wights kept up oaths exploded like shells from a battery in full fire accompanied by threats of direst vengeance against the individuals who had maltreated them here might be seen a poor fellow whose teeth were knocked down his throat spluttering out the most tremendous menaces and gesticulating like a madman there another whose nose was partially slit vented imprecations and lamentations in the same breath on the right stood a bulky figure with a broken rattle hanging out of his great coat pocket who held up a lantern to his battered countenance to prove to the spectators that both his orbs of vision were darkened on the left a meagre constable had divested himself of his shirt to bind up with greater convenience a gaping cut in the arm so the mohocks have been at work i perceive remarked quilt as he drew near the group 'faith an' you may say that returned a watchman who was wiping a ruddy stream from his brow they've broken the paice and our pates into the bargain but shurely i'd know that vice he added turning his lantern towards the janizary ah quilt arnold my man is it you by the powers i'm glad to see you the sight o' your 'andsome phiz allys does me good i wish i could return the compliment terry but your cracked skull is by no means a pleasing spectacle how came you by the hurt eh how did i come by it that's a nate question why honestly enouch it was lent me by a countryman o' mine but i paid him back in his own coin ha ha a countryman of yours terry ay and a noble one too quilt more's the pity you've heard of the marquis of slaughterford belike of course who has not he's the leader of the mohocks the general of the scourers the prince of rakes the friend of the surgeons and glaziers the terror of your tribe and the idol of the girls that's him to a hair cried terence rapturously och he's a broth of a boy why i thought he'd broken your head terry phooh that's nothing a piece o' plaster'll set all to rights and terry o'flaherty's not the boy to care for the stroke of a supple jack besides didn't i tell you that i giv' him as good as he brought and better i jist touched him with my 'evenin' star' as i call this shillelah said the watchman flourishing an immense bludgeon the knob of which appeared to be loaded with lead and by saint patrick down he cum'd like a bullock zounds exclaimed quilt did you kill him not quite replied terence laughing but i brought him to his senses by depriving him of 'em eh but i'm sorry you hurt his lordship terry young noblemen ought to be indulged in their frolics if they do now and then run away with a knocker paint a sign beat the watch or huff a magistrate they pay for their pastime and that's sufficient what more could any reasonable man especially a watchman desire besides the marquis is a devilish fine fellow and a particular friend of mine there's not his peer among the peerage och if he's a friend o' yours my dear joy there's no more to be said and right sorry am i i struck him but bloodan' 'ouns man if ould nick himself were to hit me a blow i'd be afther givin' him another well well wait awhile returned quilt his lordship won't forget you he's as generous as he's frolicsome as he spoke the door of the round house was opened and a stout man with a lantern in his hand presented himself at the threshold there's sharples cried quilt whist exclaimed terence he elevates his glim by jasus he's about to spake to us gem'men o' the votch cried sharples as loudly as a wheezy cough would permit him my noble pris'ner ough ough the markis o' slaughterford further speech was cut short by a volley of execrations from the angry guardians of the night no mohocks no scourers cried the mob hear hear vociferated quilt his lordship desires me to say ough ough fresh groans and hisses von't you hear me ough ough demanded sharples after a pause by all means rejoined quilt raise your vice and lave off coughin' added terence the long and the short o' the matter's this then returned sharples with dignity the markis begs your acceptance o' ten guineas to drink his health the hooting was instantaneously changed to cheers and his lordship furthermore requests me to state proceeded sharples in a hoarse tone that he'll be responsible for the doctors' bill of all such gem'men as have received broken pates or been otherwise damaged in the fray ough ough hurrah shouted the mob we're all damaged we've all got broken pates cried a dozen voices ay good luck to him so we have rejoined terence but we've no objection to take out the dochter's bill in drink none whatever replied the mob your answer gem'men demanded sharples long life to the markis and we accept his honourable proposal responded the mob long life to the marquis reiterated terence he's an honour to ould ireland didn't i tell you how it would be remarked quilt troth and so did you returned the watchman but i couldn't belave it in futur' i'll keep the 'evenin' star' for his lordship's enemies you'd better replied quilt but bring your glim this way i've a couple of kinchens in yonder rattler whom i wish to place under old sharples's care be handy then rejoined terence or i'll lose my share of the smart money with the assistance of terence and a linkboy who volunteered his services quilt soon removed the prisoners from the coach and leaving sheppard to the custody of abraham proceeded to drag thames towards the round house not a word had been exchanged between the two boys on the road whenever jack attempted to speak he was checked by an angry growl from abraham and thames though his heart was full almost to bursting felt no inclination to break the silence his thoughts indeed were too painful for utterance and so acute were his feelings that for some time they quite overcame him but his grief was of short duration the elastic spirits of youth resumed their sway and before the coach stopped his tears had ceased to flow as to jack sheppard he appeared utterly reckless and insensible and did nothing but whistle and sing the whole way while he was dragged along in the manner just described thames looked around to ascertain if possible where he was for he did not put entire faith in jonathan's threat of sending him to the round house and apprehensive of something even worse than imprisonment the aspect of the place so far as he could discern through the gloom was strange to him but chancing to raise his eyes above the level of the surrounding habitations he beheld relieved against the sombre sky the tall steeple of saint giles's church the precursor of the present structure which was not erected till some fifteen years later he recognised this object at once jonathan had not deceived him what's this here kinchen in for asked terence as he and quilt strode along with thames between them what for rejoined quilt evasively oh nothin' partickler mere curossity replied terence by the powers he added turning his lantern full upon the face of the captive he's a nice genn teel lookin' kiddy i must say pity he's ta'en to bad ways so airly you may spare me your compassion friend observed thames i am falsely detained of course rejoined quilt maliciously every thief is so if we were to wait till a prig was rightfully nabbed we might tarry till doomsday we never supposed you helped yourself to a picture set with diamonds not we is the guv'ner consarned in this job asked terence in a whisper he is returned quilt significantly zounds what's that he cried as the noise of a scuffle was heard behind them the other kid's given my partner the slip here take this youngster terry my legs are lighter than old nab's and committing thames to the care of the watchman he darted after the fugitive do you wish to earn a rich reward my good friend said thames to the watchman as soon as they were left alone is it by lettin' you go my darlin' that i'm to airn it inquired terence if so it won't pay you're mister wild's pris'ner and worse luck to it i don't ask you to liberate me urged thames but will you convey a message for me where to honey to mr wood's the carpenter in wych street he lives near the black lion the black lion echoed terence i know the house well by the same token that it's a flash crib och many a mug o' bubb have i drained wi' the landlord joe hind and so misther wudd lives near the black lion eh he does replied thames tell him that i his adopted son thames darrell am detained here by jonathan wild thames ditton is that your name no replied the boy impatiently darrell thames darrell i'll not forget it it's a mighty quare 'un though i never yet heard of a christians as was named after the shannon or the liffy and the thames is no better than a dhurty puddle compared wi' them two noble strames but then you're an adopted son and that makes all the difference people do call their unlawful children strange names are you quite shure you haven't another alyas masther thames ditton darrell i tell you will you go you'll be paid handsomely for your trouble i don't mind the throuble hesitated terence who was really a good hearted fellow at the bottom and i'd like to sarve you if i could for you look like a gentleman's son and that goes a great way wi' me but if misther wild were to find out that i thwarted his schames i'd not be in your skin for a trifle interrupted quilt who having secured sheppard and delivered him to abraham now approached them unawares and it shan't be my fault if he don't hear of it 'ouns ejaculated terence in alarm would you turn snitch on your old pal quilt ay if he plays a cross returned quilt come along my sly shaver with all your cunning we're more than a match for you but not for me growled terence in an under tone remember cried quilt as he forced the captive along remember the devil retorted terence who had recovered his natural audacity do you think i'm afeard of a beggarly thief taker and his myrmidons not i master thames ditton i'll do your biddin' and you misther quilt arnold may do your worst i defy you dog exclaimed quilt turning fiercely upon him do you threaten but the watchman eluded his grasp and mingling with the crowd disappeared chapter xii saint giles's round house saint giles's round house was an old detached fabric standing in an angle of kendrick yard originally built as its name imports in a cylindrical form like a modern martello tower it had undergone from time to time so many alterations that its symmetry was in a great measure destroyed bulging out more in the middle than at the two extremities it resembled an enormous cask set on its end a sort of heidelberg tun on a large scale and this resemblance was increased by the small circular aperture it hardly deserved to be called a door pierced like the bung hole of a barrell through the side of the structure at some distance from the ground and approached by a flight of wooden steps the prison was two stories high with a flat roof surmounted by a gilt vane fashioned like a key and possessing considerable internal accommodation it had in its day lodged some thousands of disorderly personages the windows were small and strongly grated looking in front on kendrick yard and at the back upon the spacious burial ground of saint giles's church lights gleamed from the lower rooms and on a nearer approach to the building the sound of revelry might be heard from within warned of the approach of the prisoners by the increased clamour sharples who was busied in distributing the marquis's donation affected to throw the remainder of the money among the crowd though in reality he kept back a couple of guineas which he slipped into his sleeve and running hastily up the steps unlocked the door he was followed more leisurely by the prisoners and during their ascent jack sheppard made a second attempt to escape by ducking suddenly down and endeavouring to pass under his conductor's legs the dress of the dwarfish jew was not however favourable to this expedient jack was caught as in a trap by the pendant tails of abraham's long frock and instead of obtaining his release by his ingenuity he only got a sound thrashing sharples received them at the threshold and holding his lantern towards the prisoners to acquaint himself with their features nodded to quilt between whom and himself some secret understanding seemed to subsist and then closed and barred the door vell he growled addressing quilt you know who's here i suppose to be sure i do replied quilt my noble friend the marquis of slaughterford what of that vot 'o that echoed sharples peevishly everythin' vot am i to do vith these young imps eh what you generally do with your prisoners mr sharples replied quilt lock 'em up that's easily said but suppose i've no place to lock 'em up in how then quilt looked a little perplexed he passed his arm under that of the constable and drew him aside vell vell growled sharples after he had listened to the other's remonstrances it shall be done but it's confounded inconvenient one don't often get sich a vindfal as the markis or such a customer as mr wild edged in quilt now then saint giles interposed sheppard are we to be kept here all night eh day exclaimed sharples wot new fledged bantam's this one that wants to go to roost replied sheppard so stir your stumps saint giles and if you mean to lock us up use despatch comin' comin' returned the constable shuffling towards him coming so is midnight so is jonathan wild retorted jack with a significant look at thames have you never an out o the vay corner into vich you could shtow these troublesome warmint observed abraham the guv'ner'll be here afore midnight darrell's attention was drawn to the latter part of this speech by a slight pressure on his foot and turning at the touch he perceived sheppard's glance fixed meaningly upon him stow it nab exclaimed quilt angrily the kinchen's awake awake to be sure i am my flash cove replied sheppard i'm down as a hammer i've just bethought me of a crib as'll serve their turn interposed sharples at any rate they'll be out o' the vay and as safe as two chicks in a coop lead the way to it then saint giles said jack in a tone of mock authority the place in which they stood was a small entrance chamber cut off like the segment of a circle from the main apartment of which it is needless to say it originally constituted a portion by a stout wooden partition a door led to the inner room and it was evident from the peals of merriment and other noises that ever and anon resounded from within that this chamber was occupied by the marquis and his friends against the walls hung an assortment of staves brown bills weapons then borne by the watch muskets handcuffs great coats and lanterns in one angle of the room stood a disused fire place with a rusty grate and broken chimney piece in the other there was a sort of box contrived between the wall and the boards that looked like an apology for a cupboard towards this box sharples directed his steps and unlocking a hatch in the door disclosed a recess scarcely as large and certainly not as clean as a dog kennel vill this do demanded the constable taking the candle from the lantern the better to display the narrow limits of the hole i call this ere crib the little ease arter the runaway prentices' cells in guildhall i have squeezed three kids into it afore now to be sure he added lowering his tone they wos little 'uns and one on 'em was smothered ough ough how this cough chokes me sheppard meanwhile whose hands were at liberty managed to possess himself unperceived of the spike of a halbert which was lying apart from the pole upon a bench near him having secured this implement he burst from his conductor and leaping into the hatch as clowns generally spring into the clock faces when in pursuit of harlequin in the pantomime that is back foremost broke into a fit of loud and derisive laughter kicking his heels merrily all the time against the boards his mirth however received an unpleasant check for abraham greatly incensed by his previous conduct caught him by the legs and pushed him with such violence into the hole that the point of the spike which he had placed in his pocket found its way through his clothes to the flesh inflicting a slight but painful wound jack who had something of the spartan in his composition endured his martyrdom without flinching and carried his stoical indifference so far as even to make a mocking grimace in sharples's face while that amiable functionary thrust thames into the recess beside him how go you like your quarters sauce box asked sharples in a jeering tone better than your company saint giles replied sheppard so shut the door and make yourself scarce that boy'll never rest till he finds his vay to bridewell observed sharples or the street returned jack mind my words the prison's not built that can keep me we'll see that young hempseed replied sharples shutting the hatch furiously in his face and locking it if you get out o' that cage i'll forgive you now come along gem'men and i'll show you some precious sport the two janizaries followed him as far as the entrance to the inner room when abraham raising his finger to his lips and glancing significantly in the direction of the boys to explain his intention to his companions closed the door after them and stole softly back again planting himself near the recess for a few minutes all was silent at length jack sheppard observed the coast's clear they're gone into the next room darrell returned no answer don't be angry with me thames continued sheppard in a tone calculated as he thought to appease his companion's indignation i did all for the best as i'll explain i won't reproach you jack said the other sternly i've done with you not quite i hope rejoined sheppard at all events i've not done with you if you owe your confinement to me you shall owe your liberation to me also i'd rather lie here for ever than be indebted to you for my freedom returned thames i've done nothing to offend you persisted jack nothing echoed the other scornfully you've perjured yourself that's my own concern rejoined sheppard an oath weighs little with me compared with your safety no more of this interrupted thames you make the matter worse by these excuses quarrel with me as much as you please thames but hear me returned sheppard i took the course i pursued to serve you tush cried thames you accused me to skreen yourself on my soul thames you wrong me replied jack passionately i'd lay down my life for yours and you expect me to believe you after what has passed i do and more than that i expect you to thank me for procuring my imprisonment for saving your life how listen to me thames you're in a more serious scrape than you imagine i overheard jonathan wild's instructions to quilt arnold and though he spoke in slang and in an under tone my quick ears and acquaintance with the thieves' lingo enabled me to make out every word he uttered jonathan is in league with sir rowland to make away with you you are brought here that their designs may be carried into effect with greater security before morning unless we can effect an escape you'll be kidnapped or murdered and your disappearance attributed to the negligence of the constable are you sure of this asked thames who though as brave a lad as need be could not repress a shudder at the intelligence certain the moment i entered the room and found you a prisoner in the hands of jonathan wild i guessed how matters stood and acted accordingly things haven't gone quite as smoothly as i anticipated but they might have been worse i can save you and will but say we're friends you're not deceiving me said thames doubtfully i am not by heaven replied sheppard firmly don't swear jack or i shall distrust you i can't give you my hand but you may take it thank you thank you faltered jack in a voice full of emotion i'll soon free you from these bracelets you needn't trouble yourself replied thames mr wood will be here presently mr wood exclaimed jack in surprise how have you managed to communicate with him abraham who had listened attentively to the foregoing conversation not a word of which escaped him now drew in his breath and brought his ear closer to the boards by means of the watchman who had the charge of me replied thames curse him muttered abraham hist exclaimed jack i thought i heard a noise speak lower somebody may be on the watch perhaps that old ginger hackled jew i don't care if he is rejoined thames boldly he'll learn that his plans will be defeated he may learn how to defeat yours replied jack so he may rejoined abraham aloud so he may death and fiends exclaimed jack the old thief is there i knew it you've betrayed yourself thames vot o' that chuckled abraham you can shave him you know i can rejoined jack and you too old aaron if i'd a razor how soon do you expect mishter vudd inquired the janizary tauntingly what's that to you retorted jack surlily because i shouldn't like to be out o' the vay ven he arrives returned abraham in a jeering tone it vouldn't be vell bred vouldn't it replied jack mimicking his snuffling voice then shtay vere you are and be cursed to you it's all up muttered thames mr wood will be intercepted i've destroyed my only chance not your only chance thames returned jack in the same undertone but your best never mind we'll turn the tables upon 'em yet do you think we could manage that old clothesman between us if we got out of this box i'd manage him myself if my arms were free replied thames boldly shpeak up vill you cried abraham rapping his knuckles against the hatch i likes to hear vot you says you can have no shecrets from me vy don't you talk to your partner or saint giles if you vant conversation aaron asked jack slyly because they're in the next room and the door's shut that's vy my jack a dandy replied abraham unsuspiciously oh they are are they muttered jack triumphantly that'll do now for it thames make as great a row as you can to divert his attention with this he drew the spike from his pocket and drowning the sound of the operation by whistling singing shuffling and other noises contrived in a few minutes to liberate his companion from the handcuffs now jack cried thames warmly grasping sheppard's hand you are my friend again i freely forgive you sheppard cordially returned the pressure and cautioning thames not to let the ruffles drop or they might tell a tale began to warble the following fragment of a robber melody oh give me a chisel a knife or a file and the dubsmen shall find that i'll do it in style tol de rol vot the devil are you about noisy inquired abraham practising singing aaron replied jack vot are you practising patience growled abraham not before it's needed returned jack aloud adding in a whisper get upon my shoulders thames now you're up take this spike feel for the lock and prize it open you don't need to be told how when it's done i'll push you through take care of the old clothesman and leave the rest to me when the turnkey next morning stepp'd into his room the sight of the hole in the wall struck him dumb the sheriff's black bracelets lay strewn on the ground but the lad that had worn 'em could nowhere be found tol de rol as jack concluded his ditty the door flew open with a crash and thames sprang through the aperture this manoeuvre was so suddenly executed that it took abraham completely by surprise he was standing at the moment close to the hatch with his ear at the keyhole and received a severe blow in the face he staggered back a few paces and before he could recover himself thames tripped up his heels and placing the point of the spike at his throat threatened to stab him if he attempted to stir or cry out nor had jack been idle all this time clearing the recess the instant after his companion he flew to the door of the inner room and locking it took out the key the policy of this step was immediately apparent alarmed by the noise of the scuffle quilt and sharples rushed to the assistance of their comrade but they were too late the entrance was barred against them and they had the additional mortification of hearing sheppard's loud laughter at their discomfiture i told you the prison wasn't built that could hold me cried jack you're not out yet you young hound rejoined quilt striving ineffectually to burst open the door but i soon shall be returned jack take these he added flinging the handcuffs against the wooden partition and wear 'em yourself halloo nab vociferated quilt what the devil are you about will you allow yourself to be beaten by a couple of kids not if i can help it returned abraham making a desperate effort to regain his feet by my shalvation boy he added fiercely if you don't take your hande off my peard i'll sthrangle you help me jack shouted thames or i shan't be able to keep the villain down stick the spike into him then returned sheppard coolly while i unbar the outlet but thames had no intention of following his friend's advice contenting himself with brandishing the weapon in the jew's eyes he exerted all his force to prevent him from rising while this took place while quilt thundered at the inner door and jack drew back the bolts of the outer a deep manly voice was heard chanting as if in contempt of the general uproar the following strain with pipe and punch upon the board and smiling nymphs around us no tavern could more mirth afford than old saint giles's round house the round house the round house the jolly jolly round house the jolly jolly round house chorussed sheppard as the last bar yielded to his efforts hurrah come along thames we're free not sho fasht not sho fasht cried abraham struggling with thames and detaining him if you go you musht take me along vid you save yourself jack shouted thames sinking beneath the superior weight and strength of his opponent leave me to my fate never replied jack hurrying towards him and snatching the spike from thames he struck the janizary a severe blow on the head i'll make sure work this time he added about to repeat the blow hold interposed thames he can do no more mischief let us be gone as you please returned jack leaping up but i feel devilishly inclined to finish him however it would only be robbing the hangman of his dues with this he was preparing to follow his friend when their egress was prevented by the sudden appearance of jonathan wild and blueskin end volume i
