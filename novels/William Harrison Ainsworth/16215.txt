jonathan wild jack sheppard chapter i the widow and her child on the night of friday the th of november and at the hour of eleven the door of a miserable habitation situated in an obscure quarter of the borough of southwark known as the old mint was opened and a man with a lantern in his hand appeared at the threshold this person whose age might be about forty was attired in a brown doublebreasted frieze coat with very wide skirts and a very narrow collar a light drugget waistcoat with pockets reaching to the knees black plush breeches grey worsted hose and shoes with round toes wooden heels and high quarters fastened by small silver buckles he wore a threecornered hat a sandycoloured scratch wig and had a thick woollen wrapper folded round his throat his clothes had evidently seen some service and were plentifully begrimed with the dust of the workshop still he had a decent look and decidedly the air of one welltodo in the world in stature he was short and stumpy in person corpulent and in countenance sleek snubnosed and demure immediately behind this individual came a pale povertystricken woman whose forlorn aspect contrasted strongly with his plump and comfortable physiognomy she was dressed in a tattered black stuff gown discoloured by various stains and intended it would seem from the remnants of rusty crape with which it was here and there tricked out to represent the garb of widowhood and held in her arms a sleeping infant swathed in the folds of a linseywoolsey shawl notwithstanding her emaciation her features still retained something of a pleasing expression and might have been termed beautiful had it not been for that repulsive freshness of lip denoting the habitual dramdrinker a freshness in her case rendered the more shocking from the almost livid hue of the rest of her complexion she could not be more than twenty and though want and other suffering had done the work of time had wasted her frame and robbed her cheek of its bloom and roundness they had not extinguished the lustre of her eyes nor thinned her raven hair checking an ominous cough that ever and anon convulsed her lungs the poor woman addressed a few parting words to her companion who lingered at the doorway as if he had something on his mind which he did not very well know how to communicate well good night mr wood said she in the deep hoarse accents of consumption and may god almighty bless and reward you for your kindness you were always the best of masters to my poor husband and now youve proved the best of friends to his widow and orphan boy poh poh say no more about it rejoined the man hastily ive done no more than my duty mrs sheppard and neither deserve nor desire your thanks whoso giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord thats my comfort and such slight relief as i can afford should have been offered earlier if id known where youd taken refuge after your unfortunate husbands execution you would say sir added mrs sheppard with a deep sigh perceiving that her benefactor hesitated to pronounce the word you show more consideration to the feelings of a hempen widow than there is any need to show im used to insult as i am to misfortune and am grown callous to both but im not used to compassion and know not how to take it my heart would speak if it could for it is very full there was a time long long ago when the tears would have rushed to my eyes unbidden at the bare mention of generosity like yours mr wood but they never come now i have never wept since that day and i trust you will never have occasion to weep again my poor soul replied wood setting down his lantern and brushing a few drops from his eyes unless it be tears of joy pshaw added he making an effort to subdue his emotion i cant leave you in this way i must stay a minute longer if only to see you smile so saying he reentered the house closed the door and followed by the widow proceeded to the fireplace where a handful of chips apparently just lighted crackled within the rusty grate the room in which this interview took place had a sordid and miserable look rotten and covered with a thick coat of dirt the boards of the floor presented a very insecure footing the bare walls were scored all over with grotesque designs the chief of which represented the punishment of nebuchadnezzar the rest were hieroglyphic characters executed in red chalk and charcoal the ceiling had in many places given way the laths had been removed and where any plaster remained it was either mapped and blistered with damps or festooned with dusty cobwebs over an old crazy bedstead was thrown a squalid patchwork counterpane and upon the counterpane lay a black hood and scarf a pair of bodice of the cumbrous form in vogue at the beginning of the last century and some other articles of female attire on a small shelf near the foot of the bed stood a couple of empty phials a cracked ewer and basin a brown jug without a handle a small tin coffeepot without a spout a saucer of rouge a fragment of lookingglass and a flask labelled rosa solis broken pipes littered the floor if that can be said to be littered which in the first instance was a mass of squalor and filth over the chimneypiece was pasted a handbill purporting to be the last dying speech and confession of tom sheppard the notorious housebreaker who suffered at tyburn on the th of february this placard was adorned with a rude woodcut representing the unhappy malefactor at the place of execution on one side of the handbill a print of the reigning sovereign anne had been pinned over the portrait of william the third whose aquiline nose keen eyes and luxuriant wig were just visible above the diadem of the queen on the other a wretched engraving of the chevalier de saint george or as he was styled in the label attached to the portrait james the third raised a suspicion that the inmate of the house was not altogether free from some tincture of jacobitism beneath these prints a cluster of hobnails driven into the wall formed certain letters which if properly deciphered produced the words paul groves cobler and under the name traced in charcoal appeared the following record of the poor fellows fate hung himsel in this rum for luv off licker accompanied by a graphic sketch of the unhappy suicide dangling from a beam a farthing candle stuck in a bottle neck shed its feeble light upon the table which owing to the provident kindness of mr wood was much better furnished with eatables than might have been expected and boasted a loaf a knuckle of ham a meatpie and a flask of wine youve but a sorry lodging mrs sheppard said wood glancing round the chamber as he expanded his palms before the scanty flame its wretched enough indeed sir rejoined the widow but poor as it is its better than the cold stones and open streets of courseof course returned wood hastily anythings better than that but take a drop of wine urged he filling a drinkinghorn and presenting it to her its choice canary andll do you good and now come and sit by me my dear and lets have a little quiet chat together when things are at the worst theyll mend take my word for it your troubles are over i hope they are sir answered mrs sheppard with a faint smile and a doubtful shake of the head as wood drew her to a seat beside him for ive had my full share of misery but i dont look for peace on this side the grave nonsense cried wood while theres life theres hope never be downhearted besides added he opening the shawl in which the infant was wrapped and throwing the light of the candle full upon its sickly but placid features its sinful to repine while youve a child like this to comfort you lord help him hes the very image of his father like carpenter like chips that likeness is the chief cause of my misery replied the widow shuddering were it not for that he would indeed be a blessing and a comfort to me he never cries nor frets as children generally do but lies at my bosom or on my knee as quiet and as gentle as you see him now but when i look upon his innocent face and see how like he is to his fatherwhen i think of that fathers shameful ending and recollect how free from guilt he once wasat such times mr wood despair will come over me and dear as this babe is to me far dearer than my own wretched life which i would lay down for him any minute i have prayed to heaven to remove him rather than he should grow up to be a man and be exposed to his fathers temptationsrather than he should live as wickedly and die as disgracefully as his father and when i have seen him pining away before my eyes getting thinner and thinner every day i have sometimes thought my prayers were heard marriage and hanging go by destiny observed wood after a pause but i trust your child is reserved for a better fate than either mrs sheppard the latter part of this speech was delivered with so much significance of manner that a bystander might have inferred that mr wood was not particularly fortunate in his own matrimonial connections goodness only knows what hes reserved for rejoined the widow in a desponding tone but if mynheer van galgebrok whom i met last night at the cross shovels spoke the truth little jack will never die in his bed save us exclaimed wood and who is this van galgalwhats his outlandish name van galgebrok replied the widow hes the famous dutch conjuror who foretold king williams accident and death last february but one a month before either event happened and gave out that another prince over the water would soon enjoy his own again for which he was committed to newgate and whipped at the carts tail he went by another name thenrykhart scherprechter i think he called himself his fellowprisoners nicknamed him the gallowsprovider from a habit he had of picking out all those who were destined to the gibbet he was never known to err and was as much dreaded as the jailfever in consequence he singled out my poor husband from a crowd of other felons and you know how right he was in that case sir ay marry replied wood with a look that seemed to say that he did not think it required any surprising skill in the art of divination to predict the doom of the individual in question but whatever opinion he might entertain he contented himself with inquiring into the grounds of the conjurors evil augury respecting the infant what did the old fellow judge from eh joan asked he from a black mole under the childs right ear shaped like a coffin which is a bad sign and a deep line just above the middle of the left thumb meeting round about in the form of a noose which is a worse replied mrs sheppard to be sure its not surprising the poor little thing should be so marked for when i lay in the womenfelons ward in newgate where he first saw the light or at least such light as ever finds entrance into that gloomy place i had nothing whether sleeping or waking but halters and gibbets and coffins and such like horrible visions for ever dancing round me and then you know sirbut perhaps you dont know that little jack was born a month before his time on the very day his poor father suffered lord bless us ejaculated wood how shocking no i did not know that you may see the marks on the child yourself if you choose sir urged the widow see the devilnot i cried wood impatiently i didnt think youd been so easily fooled joan fooled or not returned mrs sheppard mysteriously old van told me one thing which has come true already whats that asked wood with some curiosity he said by way of comfort i suppose after the fright he gave me at first that the child would find a friend within twentyfour hours who would stand by him through life a friend is not so soon gained as lost replied wood but how has the prediction been fulfilled joan eh i thought you would have guessed sir replied the widow timidly im sure little jack has but one friend beside myself in the world and thats more than i would have ventured to say for him yesterday however ive not told you all for old van did say something about the child saving his newfound friends life at the time of meeting but how thats to happen im sure i cant guess nor any one else in his senses rejoined wood with a laugh its not very likely that a babby of nine months old will save my life if im to be his friend as you seem to say mrs sheppard but ive not promised to stand by him yet nor will i unless he turns out an honest ladmind that of all craftsand it was the only craft his poor father who to do him justice was one of the best workmen that ever handled a saw or drove a nail could never understandof all crafts i say to be an honest man is the mastercraft as long as your son observes that precept ill befriend him but no longer i dont desire it sir replied mrs sheppard meekly theres an old proverb continued wood rising and walking towards the fire which saysput another mans child in your bosom and hell creep out at your elbow but i dont value that because i think it applies to one who marries a widow with encumbrances and thats not my case you know well sir gasped mrs sheppard well my dear ive a proposal to make in regard to this babby of yours which may or may not be agreeable all i can say is its well meant and i may add id have made it five minutes ago if youd given me the opportunity pray come to the point sir said mrs sheppard somewhat alarmed by this preamble i am coming to the point joan the more haste the worse speedbetter the feet slip than the tongue however to cut a long matter short my proposals thisive taken a fancy to your bantling and as ive no son of my own if it meets with your concurrence and that of mrs wood for i never do anything without consulting my better half ill take the boy educate him and bring him up to my own business of a carpenter the poor widow hung her head and pressed her child closer to her breast well joan said the benevolent mechanic after he had looked at her steadfastly for a few moments what say yousilence gives consent eh mrs sheppard made an effort to speak but her voice was choked by emotion shall i take the babby home with me persisted wood in a tone between jest and earnest i cannot part with him replied the widow bursting into tears indeed indeed i cannot so ive found out the way to move her thought the carpenter those tears will do her some good at all events not part with him added he aloud why you wouldnt stand in the way of his good fortune surely ill be a second father to him i tell you remember what the conjuror said i do remember it sir replied mrs sheppard and am most grateful for your offer but i dare not accept it dare not echoed the carpenter i dont understand you joan i mean to say sir answered mrs sheppard in a troubled voice that if i lost my child i should lose all i have left in the world i have neither father mother brother sister nor husbandi have only him if i ask you to part with him my good woman its to better his condition i suppose aint it rejoined wood angrily for though he had no serious intention of carrying his proposal into effect he was rather offended at having it declined its not an offer continued he that im likely to make or youre likely to receive every day in the year and muttering some remarks which we do not care to repeat reflecting upon the consistency of the sex he was preparing once more to depart when mrs sheppard stopped him give me till tomorrow implored she and if i can bring myself to part with him you shall have him without another word take time to consider of it replied wood sulkily theres no hurry dont be angry with me sir cried the widow sobbing bitterly pray dont i know i am undeserving of your bounty but if i were to tell you what hardships i have undergoneto what frightful extremities i have been reducedand to what infamy i have submitted to earn a scanty subsistence for this childs sakeif you could feel what it is to stand alone in the world as i do bereft of all who have ever loved me and shunned by all who have ever known me except the worthless and the wretchedif you knew and heaven grant you may be spared the knowledge how much affliction sharpens love and how much more dear to me my child has become for every sacrifice i have made for himif you were told all this you would i am sure pity rather than reproach me because i cannot at once consent to a separation which i feel would break my heart but give me till tomorrowonly till tomorrowi may be able to part with him then the worthy carpenter was now far more angry with himself than he had previously been with mrs sheppard and as soon as he could command his feelings which were considerably excited by the mention of her distresses he squeezed her hand warmly bestowed a hearty execration upon his own inhumanity and swore he would neither separate her from her child nor suffer any one else to separate them plague ont added he i never meant to take your babby from you but id a mind to try whether you really loved him as much as you pretended i was to blame to carry the matter so far however confession of a fault makes half amends for it a time may come when this little chap will need my aid and depend upon it he shall never want a friend in owen wood as he said this the carpenter patted the cheek of the little object of his benevolent professions and in so doing unintentionally aroused him from his slumbers opening a pair of large black eyes the child fixed them for an instant upon wood and then alarmed by the light uttered a low and melancholy cry which however was speedily stilled by the caresses of his mother towards whom he extended his tiny arms as if imploring protection i dont think he would leave me even if i could part with him observed mrs sheppard smiling through her tears i dont think he would acquiesced the carpenter no friend like the mother for the babby knows no other and thats true rejoined mrs sheppard for if i had not been a mother i would not have survived the day on which i became a widow you mustnt think of that mrs sheppard said wood in a soothing tone i cant help thinking of it sir answered the widow i can never get poor toms last look out of my head as he stood in the stonehall at newgate after his irons had been knocked off unless i manage to stupify myself somehow the dismal tolling of st sepulchres bell is for ever ringing in my earsoh if thats the case observed wood im surprised you should like to have such a frightful picture constantly in view as that over the chimneypiece id good reasons for placing it there sir but dont question me about them now or youll drive me mad returned mrs sheppard wildly well well well say no more about it replied wood and by way of changing the subject let me advise you on no account to fly to strong waters for consolation joan one nail drives out another its true but the worst nail you can employ is a coffinnail gin lanes the nearest road to the churchyard it may be but if it shortens the distance and lightens the journey i care not retorted the widow who seemed by this reproach to be roused into sudden eloquence to those who like me have never been able to get out of the dark and dreary paths of life the grave is indeed a refuge and the sooner they reach it the better the spirit i drink may be poisonit may kill meperhaps it is killing mebut so would hunger cold miseryso would my own thoughts i should have gone mad without it gin is the poor mans friendhis sole setoff against the rich mans luxury it comforts him when he is most forlorn it may be treacherous it may lay up a store of future woe but it insures present happiness and that is sufficient when i have traversed the streets a houseless wanderer driven with curses from every door where i have solicited alms and with blows from every gateway where i have sought shelterwhen i have crept into some deserted building and stretched my wearied limbs upon a bulk in the vain hope of reposeor worse than all when frenzied with want i have yielded to horrible temptation and earned a meal in the only way i could earn onewhen i have felt at times like these my heart sink within me i have drank of this drink and have at once forgotten my cares my poverty my guilt old thoughts old feelings old faces and old scenes have returned to me and i have fancied myself happyas happy as i am now and she burst into a wild hysterical laugh poor creature ejaculated wood do you call this frantic glee happiness its all the happiness i have known for years returned the widow becoming suddenly calm and its shortlived enough as you perceive i tell you what mr wood added she in a hollow voice and with a ghastly look gin may bring ruin but as long as poverty vice and illusage exist it will be drunk god forbid exclaimed wood fervently and as if afraid of prolonging the interview he added with some precipitation but i must be going ive stayed here too long already you shall hear from me tomorrow stay said mrs sheppard again arresting his departure ive just recollected that my husband left a key with me which he charged me to give you when i could find an opportunity a key exclaimed wood eagerly i lost a very valuable one some time ago whats it like joan its a small key with curiouslyfashioned wards its mine ill be sworn rejoined wood well whod have thought of finding it in this unexpected way dont be too sure till you see it said the widow shall i fetch it for you sir by all means i must trouble you to hold the child then for a minute while i run up to the garret where ive hidden it for safety said mrs sheppard i think i may trust him with you sir added she taking up the candle dont leave him if youre at all fearful my dear replied wood receiving the little burthen with a laugh poor thing muttered he as the widow departed on her errand shes seen better days and better circumstances than shell ever see again im sure strange i could never learn her history tom sheppard was always a close file and would never tell whom he married of this im certain however she was much too good for him and was never meant to be a journeyman carpenters wife still less what is she now her hearts in the right place at all events and since thats the case the rest may perhaps come roundthat is if she gets through her present illness a dry coughs the trumpeter of death if thats true shes not long for this world as to this little fellow in spite of the dutchman who in my opinion is more of a jacobite than a conjurer and more of a knave than either he shall never mount a horse foaled by an acorn if i can help it the course of the carpenters meditations was here interrupted by a loud note of lamentation from the child who disturbed by the transfer and not receiving the gentle solace to which he was ordinarily accustomed raised his voice to the utmost and exerted his feeble strength to escape for a few moments mr wood dandled his little charge to and fro after the most approved nursery fashion essaying at the same time the soothing influence of an infantine melody proper to the occasion but failing in his design he soon lost all patience and being as we have before hinted rather irritable though extremely wellmeaning he lifted the unhappy bantling in the air and shook him with so much good will that he had wellnigh silenced him most effectually a brief calm succeeded but with returning breath came returning vociferations and the carpenter with a faint hope of lessening the clamour by change of scene took up his lantern opened the door and walked out chapter ii the old mint mrs sheppards habitation terminated a row of old ruinous buildings called wheelers rents a dirty thoroughfare part street and part lane running from mint street through a variety of turnings and along the brink of a deep kennel skirted by a number of petty and neglected gardens in the direction of saint georges fields the neighbouring houses were tenanted by the lowest order of insolvent traders thieves mendicants and other worthless and nefarious characters who fled thither to escape from their creditors or to avoid the punishment due to their different offenses for we may observe that the old mint although it had been divested of some of its privileges as a sanctuary by a recent statute passed in the reign of william the third still presented a safe asylum to the debtor and even continued to do so until the middle of the reign of george the first when the crying nature of the evil called loudly for a remedy and another and more sweeping enactment entirely took away its immunities in consequence of the encouragement thus offered to dishonesty and the security afforded to crime this quarter of the borough of southwark was accounted at the period of our narrative the grand receptacle of the superfluous villainy of the metropolis infested by every description of vagabond and miscreant it was perhaps a few degrees worse than the rookery near saint giless and the desperate neighbourhood of saffron hill in our own time and yet on the very site of the sordid tenements and squalid courts we have mentioned where the felon openly made his dwelling and the fraudulent debtor laughed the object of his knavery to scornon this spot not two centuries ago stood the princely residence of charles brandon the chivalrous duke of suffolk whose stout heart was a well of honour and whose memory breathes of loyalty and valour suffolk house as brandons palace was denominated was subsequently converted into a mint by his royal brotherinlaw henry the eighth and after its demolition and the removal of the place of coinage to the tower the name was still continued to the district in which it had been situated old and dilapidated the widows domicile looked the very picture of desolation and misery nothing more forlorn could be conceived the roof was partially untiled the chimneys were tottering the sidewalls bulged and were supported by a piece of timber propped against the opposite house the glass in most of the windows was broken and its place supplied with paper while in some cases the very frames of the windows had been destroyed and the apertures were left free to the airs of heaven on the groundfloor the shutters were closed or to speak more correctly altogether nailed up and presented a very singular appearance being patched all over with the soles of old shoes rusty hobnails and bits of iron hoops the ingenious device of the former occupant of the apartment paul groves the cobbler to whom we have before alluded it was owing to the untimely end of this poor fellow that mrs sheppard was enabled to take possession of the premises in a fit of despondency superinduced by drunkenness he made away with himself and when the body was discovered after a lapse of some months such was the impression produced by the spectaclesuch the alarm occasioned by the crazy state of the building and above all by the terror inspired by strange and unearthly noises heard during the night which were of course attributed to the spirit of the suicide that the place speedily enjoyed the reputation of being haunted and was consequently entirely abandoned in this state mrs sheppard found it and as no one opposed her she at once took up her abode there nor was she long in discovering that the dreaded sounds proceeded from the nocturnal gambols of a legion of rats a narrow entry formed by two low walls communicated with the main thoroughfare and in this passage under the cover of a penthouse stood wood with his little burthen to whom we shall now return as mrs sheppard did not make her appearance quite so soon as he expected the carpenter became a little fidgetty and having succeeded in tranquillizing the child he thought proper to walk so far down the entry as would enable him to reconnoitre the upper windows of the house a light was visible in the garret feebly struggling through the damp atmosphere for the night was raw and overcast this light did not remain stationary but could be seen at one moment glimmering through the rents in the roof and at another shining through the cracks in the wall or the broken panes of the casement wood was unable to discover the figure of the widow but he recognised her dry hacking cough and was about to call her down if she could not find the key as he imagined must be the case when a loud noise was heard as though a chest or some weighty substance had fallen upon the floor before wood had time to inquire into the cause of this sound his attention was diverted by a man who rushed past the entry with the swiftness of desperation this individual apparently met with some impediment to his further progress for he had not proceeded many steps when he turned suddenly about and darted up the passage in which wood stood uttering a few inarticulate ejaculationsfor he was completely out of breaththe fugitive placed a bundle in the arms of the carpenter and regardless of the consternation he excited in the breast of that personage who was almost stupified with astonishment he began to divest himself of a heavy horsemans cloak which he threw over woods shoulder and drawing his sword seemed to listen intently for the approach of his pursuers the appearance of the newcomer was extremely prepossessing and after his trepidation had a little subsided wood began to regard him with some degree of interest evidently in the flower of his age he was scarcely less remarkable for symmetry of person than for comeliness of feature and though his attire was plain and unpretending it was such as could be worn only by one belonging to the higher ranks of society his figure was tall and commanding and the expression of his countenance though somewhat disturbed by his recent exertion was resolute and stern at this juncture a cry burst from the child who nearly smothered by the weight imposed upon him only recovered the use of his lungs as wood altered the position of the bundle the stranger turned his head at the sound by heaven cried he in a tone of surprise you have an infant there to be sure i have replied wood angrily for finding that the intentions of the stranger were pacific so far as he was concerned he thought he might safely venture on a slight display of spirit its very well you havent crushed the poor little thing to death with this confounded clothesbag but some people have no consideration that child may be the means of saving me muttered the stranger as if struck by a new idea i shall gain time by the expedient do you live here not exactly answered the carpenter no matter the door is open so it is needless to ask leave to enter ha exclaimed the stranger as shouts and other vociferations resounded at no great distance along the thoroughfare not a moment is to be lost give me that precious charge he added snatching the bundle from wood if i escape i will reward you your name owen wood replied the carpenter ive no reason to be ashamed of it and now a fair exchange sir yours the stranger hesitated the shouts drew nearer and lights were seen flashing ruddily against the sides and gables of the neighbouring houses my name is darrell said the fugitive hastily but if you are discovered answer no questions as you value your life wrap yourself in my cloak and keep it remember not a word so saying he huddled the mantle over woods shoulders dashed the lantern to the ground and extinguished the light a moment afterwards the door was closed and bolted and the carpenter found himself alone mercy on us cried he as a thrill of apprehension ran through his frame the dutchman was right after all this exclamation had scarcely escaped him when the discharge of a pistol was heard and a bullet whizzed past his ears i have him cried a voice in triumph a man then rushed up the entry and seizing the unlucky carpenter by the collar presented a drawn sword to his throat this person was speedily followed by half a dozen others some of whom carried flambeaux murder roared wood struggling to free himself from his assailant by whom he was half strangled damnation exclaimed one of the leaders of the party in a furious tone snatching a torch from an attendant and throwing its light full upon the face of the carpenter this is not the villain sir cecil so i find rowland replied the other in accents of deep disappointment and at the same time relinquishing his grasp i could have sworn i saw him enter this passage and how comes his cloak on this knaves shoulders it is his cloak of a surety returned rowland harkye sirrah continued he haughtily interrogating wood where is the person from whom you received this mantle throttling a man isnt the way to make him answer questions replied the carpenter doggedly youll get nothing out of me i can promise you unless you show a little more civility we waste time with this fellow interposed sir cecil and may lose the object of our quest who beyond doubt has taken refuge in this building let us search it just then the infant began to sob piteously hist cried rowland arresting his comrade do you hear that we are not wholly at fault the dogfox cannot be far off since the cub is found with these words he tore the mantle from woods back and perceiving the child endeavoured to seize it in this attempt he was however foiled by the agility of the carpenter who managed to retreat to the door against which he placed his back kicking the boards vigorously with his heel joan joan vociferated he open the door for gods sake or i shall be murdered and so will your babby open the door quickly i say knock him on the head thundered sir cecil or we shall have the watch upon us no fear of that rejoined rowland such vermin never dare to show themselves in this privileged district all we have to apprehend is a rescue the hint was not lost upon wood he tried to raise an outcry but his throat was again forcibly griped by rowland another such attempt said the latter and you are a dead man yield up the babe and i pledge my word you shall remain unmolested i will yield it to no one but its mother answered wood sdeath do you trifle with me sirrah cried rowland fiercely give me the child or as he spoke the door was thrown open and mrs sheppard staggered forward she looked paler than ever but her countenance though bewildered did not exhibit the alarm which might naturally have been anticipated from the strange and perplexing scene presented to her view take it cried wood holding the infant towards her take it and fly mrs sheppard put out her arms mechanically but before the child could be committed to her care it was wrested from the carpenter by rowland these people are all in league with him cried the latter but dont wait for me sir cecil enter the house with your men ill dispose of the brat this injunction was instantly obeyed the knight and his followers crossed the threshold leaving one of the torchbearers behind them davies said rowland delivering the babe with a meaning look to his attendant i understand sir replied davies drawing a little aside and setting down the link he proceeded deliberately to untie his cravat my god will you see your child strangled before your eyes and not so much as scream for help said wood staring at the widow with a look of surprise and horror woman your wits are fled and so it seemed for all the answer she could make was to murmur distractedly i cant find the key devil take the key ejaculated wood theyre about to murder your childyour child i tell you do you comprehend what i say joan ive hurt my head replied mrs sheppard pressing her hand to her temples and then for the first time wood noticed a small stream of blood coursing slowly down her cheek at this moment davies who had completed his preparations extinguished the torch its all over groaned wood and perhaps its as well her senses are gone however ill make a last effort to save the poor little creature if it costs me my life and with this generous resolve he shouted at the top of his voice arrest arrest help help seconding the words with a shrill and peculiar cry well known at the time to the inhabitants of the quarter in which it was uttered in reply to this summons a horn was instantly blown at the corner of the street arrest vociferated wood mint mint death and hell cried rowland making a furious pass at the carpenter who fortunately avoided the thrust in the darkness will nothing silence you help ejaculated wood renewing his cries arrest jigger closed shouted a hoarse voice in reply alls bowman my covey fear nothing well be upon the bandogs before they can shake their trotters and the alarm was sounded more loudly than ever another horn now resounded from the further extremity of the thoroughfare this was answered by a third and presently a fourth and more remote blast took up the note of alarm the whole neighbourhood was disturbed a garrison called to arms at dead of night on the sudden approach of the enemy could not have been more expeditiously or effectually aroused rattles were sprung lanterns lighted and hoisted at the end of poles windows thrown open doors unbarred and as if by magic the street was instantaneously filled with a crowd of persons of both sexes armed with such weapons as came most readily to hand and dressed in such garments as could be most easily slipped on hurrying in the direction of the supposed arrest they encouraged each other with shouts and threatened the offending parties with their vengeance regardless as the gentry of the mint usually were for indeed they had become habituated from their frequent occurrence to such scenes of any outrages committed in their streets deaf as they had been to the recent scuffle before mrs sheppards door they were always sufficiently on the alert to maintain their privileges and to assist each other against the attacks of their common enemythe sheriffs officer it was only by the adoption of such a course especially since the late act of suppression to which we have alluded that the inviolability of the asylum could be preserved incursions were often made upon its territories by the functionaries of the law sometimes attended with success but more frequently with discomfiture and it rarely happened unless by stratagem or bribery that in the language of the gentlemen of the short staff an important caption could be effected in order to guard against accidents or surprises watchmen or scouts as they were styled were stationed at the three main outlets of the sanctuary ready to give the signal in the manner just described bars were erected which in case of emergency could be immediately stretched across the streets doors were attached to the alleys and were never opened without due precautions gates were affixed to the courts wickets to the gates and bolts to the wickets the back windows of the houses where any such existed were strongly barricaded and kept constantly shut and the fortress was furthermore defended by high walls and deep ditches in those quarters where it appeared most exposed there was also a maze the name is still retained in the district into which the debtor could run and through the intricacies of which it was impossible for an officer to follow him without a clue whoever chose to incur the risk of so doing might enter the mint at any hour but no one was suffered to depart without giving a satisfactory account of himself or producing a pass from the master in short every contrivance that ingenuity could devise was resorted to by this horde of reprobates to secure themselves from danger or molestation whitefriars had lost its privileges salisbury court and the savoy no longer offered places of refuge to the debtor and it was therefore doubly requisite that the island of bermuda as the mint was termed by its occupants should uphold its rights as long as it was able to do so mr wood meantime had not remained idle aware that not a moment was to be lost if he meant to render any effectual assistance to the child he ceased shouting and defending himself in the best way he could from the attacks of rowland by whom he was closely pressed forced his way in spite of all opposition to davies and dealt him a blow on the head with such good will that had it not been for the intervention of the wall the ruffian must have been prostrated before he could recover from the stunning effects of the blow wood possessed himself of the child and untying the noose which had been slipped round its throat had the satisfaction of hearing it cry lustily at this juncture sir cecil and his followers appeared at the threshold he has escaped exclaimed the knight we have searched every corner of the house without finding a trace of him back cried rowland dont you hear those shouts yon fellows clamour has brought the whole horde of jailbirds and cutthroats that infest this place about our ears we shall be torn in pieces if we are discovered davies he added calling to the attendant who was menacing wood with a severe retaliation dont heed him but if you value a whole skin come into the house and bring that woman with you she may afford us some necessary information davies reluctantly complied and dragging mrs sheppard who made no resistance along with him entered the house the door of which was instantly shut and barricaded a moment afterwards the street was illumined by a blaze of torchlight and a tumultuous uproar mixed with the clashing of weapons and the braying of horns announced the arrival of the first detachment of minters mr wood rushed instantly to meet them hurrah shouted he waving his hat triumphantly over his head saved ay ay its all bob my covey youre safe enough thats certain responded the minters baying yelping leaping and howling around him like a pack of hounds when the huntsman is beating cover but where are the lurchers who asked wood the traps responded a bystander the shoulderclappers added a lady who in her anxiety to join the party had unintentionally substituted her husbands nether habiliments for her own petticoats the bandogs thundered a tall man whose stature and former avocations had procured him the nickname of the long drover of the borough market where are they ay where are they chorussed the mob flourishing their various weapons and flashing their torches in the air well starve em out mr wood trembled he felt he had raised a storm which it would be very difficult if not impossible to allay he knew not what to say or what to do and his confusion was increased by the threatening gestures and furious looks of the ruffians in his immediate vicinity i dont understand you gentlemen stammered he at length what does he say roared the long drover he says he dont understand flash replied the lady in gentlemans attire cease your confounded clutter said a young man whose swarthy visage seen in the torchlight struck wood as being that of a mulatto you frighten the cull out of his senses its plain he dont understand our lingo as how should he take pattern by me and as he said this he strode up to the carpenter and slapping him on the shoulder propounded the following questions accompanying each interrogation with a formidable contortion of countenance curse you where are the bailiffs rot you have you lost your tongue devil seize you you could bawl loud enough a moment ago silence blueskin interposed an authoritative voice immediately behind the ruffian let me have a word with the cull ay ay cried several of the bystanders let jonathan kimbaw the cove hes got the gift of the gab the crowd accordingly drew aside and the individual in whose behalf the movement had been made immediately stepped forward he was a young man of about twoandtwenty who without having anything remarkable either in dress or appearance was yet a noticeable person if only for the indescribable expression of cunning pervading his countenance his eyes were small and grey as far apart and as slylooking as those of a fox a physiognomist indeed would have likened him to that crafty animal and it must be owned the general formation of his features favoured such a comparison the nose was long and sharp the chin pointed the forehead broad and flat and connected without any intervening hollow with the eyelid the teeth when displayed seemed to reach from ear to ear then his beard was of a reddish hue and his complexion warm and sanguine those who had seen him slumbering averred that he slept with his eyes open but this might be merely a figurative mode of describing his customary vigilance certain it was that the slightest sound aroused him this astute personage was somewhat under the middle size but fairly proportioned inclining rather to strength than symmetry and abounding more in muscle than in flesh it would seem from the attention which he evidently bestowed upon the hidden and complex machinery of the grand system of villany at work around him that his chief object in taking up his quarters in the mint must have been to obtain some private information respecting the habits and practices of its inhabitants to be turned to account hereafter advancing towards wood jonathan fixed his keen gray eyes upon him and demanded in a stern tone whether the persons who had taken refuge in the adjoining house were bailiffs not that i know of replied the carpenter who had in some degree recovered his confidence then i presume youve not been arrested i have not answered wood firmly i guessed as much perhaps youll next inform us why you have occasioned this disturbance because this childs life was threatened by the persons you have mentioned rejoined wood an excellent reason i faith exclaimed blueskin with a roar of surprise and indignation which was echoed by the whole assemblage and so were to be summoned from our beds and snug firesides because a kid happens to squall eh by the soul of my grandmother but this is too good do you intend to claim the privileges of the mint said jonathan calmly pursuing his interrogations amid the uproar is your person in danger not from my creditors replied wood significantly will he post the cole will he come down with the dues ask him that cried blueskin you hear pursued jonathan my friend desires to know if you are willing to pay your footing as a member of the ancient and respectable fraternity of debtors i owe no man a farthing and my name shall never appear in any such rascally list replied wood angrily i dont see why i should be obliged to pay for doing my duty i tell you this child would have been strangled the noose was at its throat when i called for help i knew it was in vain to cry murder in the mint so i had recourse to stratagem well sir i must say you deserve some credit for your ingenuity at all events replied jonathan repressing a smile but before you put out your foot so far it would have been quite as prudent to consider how you were to draw it back again for my own part i dont see in what way it is to be accomplished except by the payment of our customary fees do not imagine you can at one moment avail yourself of our excellent regulations with which you seem sufficiently well acquainted and the next break them with impunity if you assume the character of a debtor for your own convenience you must be content to maintain it for ours if you have not been arrested we have been disturbed and it is but just and reasonable you should pay for occasioning such disturbance by your own showing you are in easy circumstancesfor it is only natural to presume that a man who owes nothing must be in a condition to pay liberallyand you cannot therefore feel the loss of such a trifle as ten guineas however illogical and inconclusive these arguments might appear to mr wood and however he might dissent from the latter proposition he did not deem it expedient to make any reply and the orator proceeded with his harangue amid the general applause of the assemblage i am perhaps exceeding my authority in demanding so slight a sum continued jonathan modestly and the master of the mint may not be disposed to let you off so lightly he will be here in a moment or so and you will then learn his determination in the mean time let me advise you as a friend not to irritate him by a refusal which would be as useless as vexatious he has a very summary mode of dealing with refractory persons i assure you my best endeavours shall be used to bring you off on the easy terms i have mentioned do you call ten guineas easy terms cried wood with a look of dismay why i should expect to purchase the entire freehold of the mint for less money many a man has been glad to pay double the amount to get his head from under the mint pump observed blueskin gruffly let the gentleman take his own course said jonathan mildly i should be sorry to persuade him to do anything his calmer judgment might disapprove exactly my sentiments rejoined blueskin i wouldnt force him for the world but if he dont tip the stivers may i be cursed if he dont get a taste of the aqua pompaginis lets have a look at the kinchen that ought to have been throttled added he snatching the child from wood my stars heres a pretty lullabycheat to make a fuss aboutho ho deal with me as you think proper gentlemen exclaimed wood but for mercys sake dont harm the child let it be taken to its mother and who is its mother asked jonathan in an eager whisper tell me frankly and speak under your breath your own safetythe childs safetydepends upon your candour while mr wood underwent this examination blueskin felt a small and trembling hand placed upon his own and turning at the summons beheld a young female whose features were partially concealed by a loo or half mask standing beside him coarse as were the ruffians notions of feminine beauty he could not be insensible to the surpassing loveliness of the fair creature who had thus solicited his attention her figure was in some measure hidden by a large scarf and a deep hood drawn over the head contributed to her disguise still it was evident from her lofty bearing that she had nothing in common except an interest in their proceedings with the crew by whom she was surrounded whence she camewho she wasand what she wantedwere questions which naturally suggested themselves to blueskin and he was about to seek for some explanation when his curiosity was checked by a gesture of silence from the lady hush said she in a low but agitated voice would you earn this purse ive no objection replied blueskin in a tone intended to be gentle but which sounded like the murmuring whine of a playful bear how much is there in it it contains gold replied the lady but i will add this ring what am i to do to earn it asked blueskin with a disgusting leercut a throator throw myself at your feeteh my dear give me that child returned the lady with difficulty overcoming the loathing inspired by the ruffians familiarity oh i see replied blueskin winking significantly come nearer or theyll observe us dont be afraidi wont hurt you im always agreeable to the women bless their kind hearts now slip the purse into my hand bravothe best clyfaker of em all couldnt have done it better and now for the fawneythe ring i mean im no great judge of these articles maam but i trust to your honour not to palm off paste upon me it is a diamond said the lady in an agony of distressthe child a diamond here take the kid cried blueskin slipping the infant adroitly under her scarf and so this is a diamond added he contemplating the brilliant from the hollow of his hand it does sparkle almost as brightly as your ogles by the by my dear i forgot to ask your nameperhaps youll oblige me with it now hell and the devilgone he looked around in vain the lady had disappeared chapter iii the master of the mint jonathan meanwhile having ascertained the parentage of the child from wood proceeded to question him in an under tone as to the probable motives of the attempt upon its life and though he failed in obtaining any information on this point he had little difficulty in eliciting such particulars of the mysterious transaction as have already been recounted when the carpenter concluded his recital jonathan was for a moment lost in reflection devilish strange thought he chuckling to himself queer business capital trick of the cull in the cloak to make another persons brat stand the brunt for his owncapital ha ha wont do though he must be a sly fox to get out of the mint without my knowledge ive a shrewd guess where hes taken refuge but ill ferret him out these bloods will pay well for his capture if not hell pay well to get out of their hands so im safe either wayha ha blueskin he added aloud and motioning that worthy follow me upon which he set off in the direction of the entry his progress however was checked by loud acclamations announcing the arrival of the master of the mint and his train baptist kettleby for so was the master named was a goodly portly man and a corpulent whose fair round paunch bespoke the affection he entertained for good liquor and good living he had a quick shrewd merry eye and a look in which duplicity was agreeably veiled by good humour it was easy to discover that he was a knave but equally easy to perceive that he was a pleasant fellow a combination of qualities by no means of rare occurrence so far as regards his attire baptist was not seen to advantage no great lover of state or state costume at any time he was generally towards the close of an evening completely in dishabille and in this condition he now presented himself to his subjects his shirt was unfastened his vest unbuttoned his hose ungartered his feet were stuck into a pair of pantoufles his arms into a greasy flannel dressinggown his head into a thrumcap the cap into a tieperiwig and the wig into a goldedged hat a white apron was tied round his waist and into the apron was thrust a short thick truncheon which looked very much like a rollingpin the master of the mint was accompanied by another gentleman almost as portly as himself and quite as deliberate in his movements the costume of this personage was somewhat singular and might have passed for a masquerading habit had not the imperturbable gravity of his demeanour forbidden any such supposition it consisted of a close jerkin of brown frieze ornamented with a triple row of brass buttons loose dutch slops made very wide in the seat and very tight at the knees red stockings with black clocks and a fur cap the owner of this dress had a broad weatherbeaten face small twinkling eyes and a bushy grizzled beard though he walked by the side of the governor he seldom exchanged a word with him but appeared wholly absorbed in the contemplations inspired by a broadbowled dutch pipe behind the illustrious personages just described marched a troop of stalwart fellows with white badges in their hats quarterstaves oaken cudgels and links in their hands these were the masters bodyguard advancing towards the master and claiming an audience which was instantly granted jonathan without much circumlocution related the sum of the strange story he had just learnt from wood omitting nothing except a few trifling particulars which he thought it politic to keep back and with this view he said not a word of there being any probability of capturing the fugitive but on the contrary roundly asserted that his informant had witnessed that persons escape the master listened with becoming attention to the narrative and at its conclusion shook his head gravely applied his thumb to the side of his nose and twirling his fingers significantly winked at his phlegmatic companion the gentleman appealed to shook his head in reply coughed as only a dutchman can cough and raising his hand from the bowl of his pipe went through precisely the same mysterious ceremonial as the master putting his own construction upon this mute interchange of opinions jonathan ventured to observe that it certainly was a very perplexing case but that he thought something might be made of it and if left to him he would undertake to manage the matter to the masters entire satisfaction ja ja muntmeester said the dutchman removing the pipe from his mouth and speaking in a deep and guttural voice leave the affair to johannes hell settle it bravely and let ush go back to our brandewyn and hollandsche genever dese ere not schouts as you faind but jonkers on a vrolyk and if deyd chanshed to keel de vrow sheppards pet lamb deyd have done her a servish by shaving it from dat unpleasant complaint de hempen fever with which its laatter days are threatened and of which its poor vader died myn got haanging runs in some families muntmeester its hereditary like de jigt vat you call itgouthaw haw if the child is destined to the gibbet van galgebrok replied the master joining in the laugh itll never be choked by a footmans cravat thats certain but in regard to going back emptyhanded continued he altering his tone and assuming a dignified air its quite out of the question with baptist kettleby to engage in a matter is to go through with it besides this is an affair which no one but myself can settle common offences may be decided upon by deputy but outrages perpetrated by men of rank as these appear to be must be judged by the master of the mint in person these are the decrees of the island of bermuda and i will never suffer its excellent laws to be violated gentlemen of the mint added he pointing with his truncheon towards mrs sheppards house forward hurrah shouted the mob and the whole phalanx was put in motion in that direction at the same moment a martial flourish proceeding from cows horns tin canisters filled with stones bladders and catgut with other sprightly instruments was struck up and enlivened by this harmonious accompaniment the troop reached its destination in the best possible spirits for an encounter let us in said the master rapping his truncheon authoritatively against the boards or well force an entrance but as no answer was returned to the summons though it was again and more peremptorily repeated baptist seized a mallet from a bystander and burst open the door followed by van galgebrok and others of his retinue he then rushed into the room where rowland sir cecil and their attendants stood with drawn swords prepared to receive them beat down their blades cried the master no bloodshed beat out their brains you mean rejoined blueskin with a tremendous imprecation no half measures now master hadnt you better hold a moments parley with the gentlemen before proceeding to extremities suggested jonathan agreed responded the master surely he added staring at rowland either im greatly mistaken or it is you are not mistaken baptist returned rowland with a gesture of silence it is your old friend im glad to recognise you and im glad your worships recognition doesnt come too late observed the master but why didnt you make yourself known at once id forgotten the office you hold in the mint baptist replied rowland but clear the room of this rabble if you have sufficient authority over them i would speak with you theres but one way of clearing it your worship said the master archly i understand replied rowland give them what you please ill repay you its all right pals cried baptist in a loud tone the gentlemen and i have settled matters no more scuffling whats the meaning of all this demanded sir cecil how have you contrived to still these troubled waters ive chanced upon an old ally in the master of the mint answered rowland we may trust him he added in a whisper he is a staunch friend of the good cause blueskin clear the room cried the master these gentlemen would be private theyve paid for their lodging wheres jonathan inquiries were instantly made after that individual but he was nowhere to be found strange observed the master i thought hed been at my elbow all this time but it dont much matterthough hes a devilish shrewd fellow and might have helped me out of a difficulty had any occurred hark ye blueskin continued he addressing that personage who in obedience to his commands had with great promptitude driven out the rabble and again secured the door a word in your ear what female entered the house with us blood and thunder exclaimed blueskin afraid if he admitted having seen the lady of being compelled to divide the plunder he had obtained from her among his companions how should i know dye suppose im always thinking of the petticoats i observed no female but if any one did join the assault it must have been either amazonian kate or fighting moll the woman i mean did not join the assault rejoined the master but rather seemed to shun observation and from the hasty glimpse i caught of her she appeared to have a child in her arms then most probably it was the widow sheppard answered blueskin sulkily right said the master i didnt think of her and now ive another job for you propose it returned blueskin inclining his head square accounts with the rascal who got up the sham arrest and if he dont tip the cole without more ado give him a taste of the pump thats all he shall go through the whole course replied blueskin with a ferocious grin unless he comes down to the last grig well lather him with mud shave him with a rusty razor and drench him with aqua pompaginis master your humble servantgentlemen your most obsequious trout having effected his object which was to get rid of blueskin baptist turned to rowland and sir cecil who had watched his proceedings with much impatience and remarked now gentlemen the coasts clear weve nothing to interrupt us im entirely at your service chapter iv the roof and the window leaving them to pursue their conference we shall follow the footsteps of jonathan who as the master surmised and as we have intimated had unquestionably entered the house but at the beginning of the affray when he thought every one was too much occupied with his own concerns to remark his absence he slipped out of the room not for the purpose of avoiding the engagement for cowardice was not one of his failings but because he had another object in view creeping stealthily up stairs unmasking a dark lantern and glancing into each room as he passed he was startled in one of them by the appearance of mrs sheppard who seemed to be crouching upon the floor satisfied however that she did not notice him jonathan glided away as noiselessly as he came and ascended another short flight of stairs leading to the garret as he crossed this chamber his foot struck against something on the floor which nearly threw him down and stooping to examine the object he found it was a key never throw away a chance thought jonathan who knows but this key may open a golden lock one of these days and picking it up he thrust it into his pocket arrived beneath an aperture in the broken roof he was preparing to pass through it when he observed a little heap of tiles upon the floor which appeared to have been recently dislodged he has passed this way cried jonathan exultingly i have him safe enough he then closed the lantern mounted without much difficulty upon the roof and proceeded cautiously along the tiles the night was now profoundly dark jonathan had to feel his way a single false step might have precipitated him into the street or if he had trodden upon an unsound part of the roof he must have fallen through it he had nothing to guide him for though the torches were blazing ruddily below their gleam fell only on the side of the building the venturous climber gazed for a moment at the assemblage beneath to ascertain that he was not discovered and having satisfied himself in this particular he stepped out more boldly on gaining a stack of chimneys at the back of the house he came to a pause and again unmasked his lantern nothing however could be discerned except the crumbling brickwork confusion ejaculated jonathan can he have escaped no the walls are too high and the windows too stoutly barricaded in this quarter to admit such a supposition he cant be far off i shall find him yet ah i have it he added after a moments deliberation hes there ill be sworn and once more enveloping himself in darkness he pursued his course he had now reached the adjoining house and scaling the roof approached another building which seemed to be at least one story loftier than its neighbours apparently jonathan was well acquainted with the premises for feeling about in the dark he speedily discovered a ladder up the steps of which he hurried drawing a pistol and unclosing his lantern with the quickness of thought he then burst through an open trapdoor into a small loft the light fell upon the fugitive who stood before him in an attitude of defence with the child in his arms aha exclaimed jonathan acting upon the information he had obtained from wood i have found you at last your servant mr darrell who are you demanded the fugitive sternly a friend replied jonathan uncocking the pistol and placing it in his pocket how do i know you are a friend asked darrell what should i do here alone if i were an enemy but come dont let us waste time in bandying words when we might employ it so much more profitably your life and that of your child are in my power what will you give me to save you from your pursuers can you do so asked the other doubtfully i can and will now the reward i have but an illfurnished purse but if i escape my gratitude pshaw interrupted jonathan scornfully your gratitude will vanish with your danger pay fools with promises i must have something in hand you shall have all i have about me replied darrell wellwell grumbled jonathan i suppose i must be content an illlined purse is a poor recompense for the risk i have run however come along i neednt tell you to tread carefully you know the danger of this breakneck road as well as i do the light would betray us so saying he closed the lantern harkye sir rejoined darrell one word before i move i know not who you are and as i cannot discern your face i may be doing you an injustice but there is something in your voice that makes me distrust you if you attempt to play the traitor you will do so at the hazard of your life i have already hazarded my life in this attempt to save you returned jonathan boldly and with apparent frankness this ought to be sufficient answer to your doubts your pursuers are below what was to hinder me if i had been so inclined from directing them to your retreat enough replied darrell lead on followed by darrell jonathan retraced his dangerous path as he approached the gable of mrs sheppards house loud yells and vociferations reached his ears and looking downwards he perceived a great stir amid the mob the cause of this uproar was soon manifest blueskin and the minters were dragging wood to the pump the unfortunate carpenter struggled violently but ineffectually his hat was placed upon one pole his wig on another his shouts for help were answered by roars of mockery and laughter he continued alternately to be tossed in the air or rolled in the kennel until he was borne out of sight the spectacle seemed to afford as much amusement to jonathan as to the actors engaged in it he could not contain his satisfaction but chuckled and rubbed his hands with delight by heaven cried darrell it is the poor fellow whom i placed in such jeopardy a short time ago i am the cause of his illusage to be sure you are replied jonathan laughing but what of that itll be a lesson to him in future and will show him the folly of doing a goodnatured action but perceiving that his companion did not relish his pleasantry and fearing that his sympathy for the carpenters situation might betray him into some act of imprudence jonathan without further remark and by way of putting an end to the discussion let himself drop through the roof his example was followed by darrell but though the latter was somewhat embarrassed by his burthen he peremptorily declined jonathans offer of assistance both however having safely landed they cautiously crossed the room and passed down the first flight of steps in silence at this moment a door was opened below lights gleamed on the walls and the figures of rowland and sir cecil were distinguished at the foot of the stairs darrell stopped and drew his sword you have betrayed me said he in a deep whisper to his companion but you shall reap the reward of your treachery be still returned jonathan in the same under tone and with great selfpossession i can yet save you and see he added as the figures drew back and the lights disappeared its a false alarm they have retired however not a moment is to be lost give me your hand he then hurried darrell down another short flight of steps and entered a small chamber at the back of the house closing the door jonathan next produced his lantern and hastening towards the window undrew a bolt by which it was fastened a stout wooden shutter opening inwardly being removed disclosed a grating of iron bars this obstacle which appeared to preclude the possibility of egress in that quarter was speedily got rid of withdrawing another bolt and unhooking a chain suspended from the top of the casement jonathan pushed the iron framework outwards the bars dropped noiselessly and slowly down till the chain tightened at the staple you are free said he that grating forms a ladder by which you may descend in safety i learned the trick of the place from one paul groves who used to live here and who contrived the machine he used to call it his fireescapeha ha ive often used the ladder for my own convenience but i never expected to turn it to such good account and now sir have i kept faith with you you have replied darrell here is my purse and i trust you will let me know to whom i am indebted for this important service it matters not who i am replied jonathan taking the money as i said before i have little reliance upon professions of gratitude i know not how it is sighed darrell but i feel an unaccountable misgiving at quitting this place something tells me i am rushing on greater danger you know best replied jonathan sneeringly but if i were in your place i would take the chance of a future and uncertain risk to avoid a present and certain peril you are right replied darrell the weakness is past which is the nearest way to the river why its an awkward road to direct you returned jonathan but if you turn to the right when you reach the ground and keep close to the mint wall youll speedily arrive at white cross street white cross street if you turn again to the right will bring you into queen street queen street bearing to the left will conduct you to deadmans place and deadmans place to the waterside not fifty yards from saint saviours stairs where youre sure to get a boat the very point i aim at said darrell as he passed through the outlet stay said jonathan aiding his descent you had better take my lantern it may be useful to you perhaps youll give me in return some token by which i may remind you of this occurrence in case we meet again your glove will suffice there it is replied the other tossing him the glove are you sure these bars touch the ground they come within a yard of it answered jonathan safe shouted darrell as he effected a secure landing good night so muttered jonathan having started the hare ill now unleash the hounds with this praiseworthy determination he was hastening down stairs with the utmost rapidity when he encountered a female whom he took in the darkness to be mrs sheppard the person caught hold of his arm and in spite of his efforts to disengage himself detained him where is he asked she in an agitated whisper i heard his voice but i saw them on the stairs and durst not approach him for fear of giving the alarm if you mean the fugitive darrell he has escaped through the back window replied jonathan thank heaven she gasped well you women are forgiving creatures i must say observed jonathan sarcastically you thank heaven for the escape of the man who did his best to get your childs neck twisted what do you mean asked the female in astonishment i mean what i say replied jonathan perhaps you dont know that this darrell so contrived matters that your child should be mistaken for his own by which means it had a narrow escape from a tight cravat i can assure you however the scheme answered well enough for darrell has got off with his own brat then this is not my child exclaimed she with increased astonishment if you have a child there it certainly is not answered jonathan a little surprised for i left your brat in the charge of blueskin who is still among the crowd in the street unless as is not unlikely hes gone to see your other friend disciplined at the pump merciful providence exclaimed the female whose child can this be how the devil should i know replied jonathan gruffly i suppose it didnt drop through the ceiling did it are you quite sure its flesh and blood asked he playfully pinching its arm till it cried out with pain my child my child exclaimed mrs sheppard rushing from the adjoining room where is it are you the mother of this child inquired the person who had first spoken addressing mrs sheppard i ami am cried the widow snatching the babe and pressing it to her breast with rapturous delight god be thanked i have found it we have both good reason to be grateful added the lady with great emotion sblood cried jonathan who had listened to the foregoing conversation with angry wonder ive been nicely done here fool that i was to part with my lantern but ill soon set myself straight what ho lights lights and shouting as he went he flung himself down stairs where shall i fly exclaimed the lady bewildered with terror they will kill me if they find me as they would have killed my husband and child oh god my limbs fail me make an effort madam cried mrs sheppard as a storm of furious voices resounded from below and torches were seen mounting the stairs they are comingthey are comingflyto the roof to the roof no cried the lady this roomi recollectit has a back window it is shut said mrs sheppard it is open replied the lady rushing towards it and springing through the outlet where is she thundered jonathan who at this moment reached mrs sheppard she has flown up stairs replied the widow you lie hussy replied jonathan rudely pushing her aside as she vainly endeavoured to oppose his entrance into the room she is here hist cried he as a scream was heard from without by g she has missed her footing there was a momentary and terrible silence broken only by a few feeble groans sir cecil who with rowland and some others had entered the room rushed to the window with a torch he held down the light and a moment afterwards beckoned with a blanched cheek to rowland your sister is dead said he in a deep whisper her blood be upon her own head then replied rowland sternly why came she here she could not resist the hand of fate which drew her hither replied sir cecil mournfully descend and take charge of the body said rowland conquering his emotion by a great effort i will join you in a moment this accident rather confirms than checks my purpose the stain upon our family is only half effaced i have sworn the death of the villain and his bastard and i will keep my oath now sir he added turning to jonathan as sir cecil and his followers obeyed his injunctions you say you know the road which the person whom we seek has taken i do replied jonathan but i give no information gratis speak then said rowland placing money in his hand youll find him at st saviourss stairs answered jonathan hes about to cross the river youd better lose no time he has got five minutes start of you but i sent him the longest way about the words were scarcely pronounced when rowland disappeared and now to see the end of it said jonathan shortly afterwards passing through the window good night master three persons only were left in the room these were the master of the mint van galgebrok and mrs sheppard a bad business this van observed baptist with a prolonged shake of the head ja ja muntmeester said the hollander

mrs sheppard relieved by their departure and giving way to a passionate flood of tears were it not for my child i should wish to be in the place of that unfortunate lady chapter v the denunciation for a short space mrs sheppard remained dissolved in tears she then dried her eyes and laying her child gently upon the floor knelt down beside him open my heart father of mercy she murmured in a humble tone and with downcast looks and make me sensible of the error of my ways i have sinned deeply but i have been sorely tried spare me yet a little while father not for my own sake but for the sake of

and taking up the infant was about to proceed down stairs when she was alarmed by hearing the streetdoor opened and the sound of heavy footsteps entering the house halloa widow shouted a rough voice from below where the devil are you mrs sheppard returned no answer ive got something to say to you continued the speaker rather less harshly something to your advantage so come out o your hidingplace

its only a gentleman come to offer you his hand he that woos a maidfolderolhiccuppingill soon find you out mrs sheppard whose distress at the consumption of the provisions had been somewhat allayed by the anticipation of the intruders departure after he had satisfied his appetite was now terrified in the extreme by seeing a light approach and hearing footsteps on the stairs her first impulse was to fly to the window and she was about to pass through it at the risk of sharing the fate of the unfortunate lady when her arm was grasped by some one in the act of ascending the ladder from without uttering a faint scream she sank backwards and would have fallen if it had not been for the interposition of blueskin who at that moment staggered into the room with a candle in one hand and the bottle in the other oh youre here are you said the ruffian with an exulting laugh ive been looking for you everywhere let me go implored mrs sheppardpray let me go you hurt the child dont you hear how youve made it cry throttle the kid rejoined blueskin fiercely if you dont stop its squalling i will i hate children and if id my own way id drown em all like a litter o puppies well knowing the savage temper of the person she had to deal with and how likely he was to put his threat into execution mrs sheppard did not dare to return any answer but disengaging herself from his embrace endeavoured meekly to comply with his request and now widow continued the ruffian setting down the candle and applying his lips to the bottle neck as he flung his heavy frame upon a bench ive a piece o good news for you good news will be news to me what is it guess rejoined blueskin attempting to throw a gallant expression into his forbidding countenance mrs sheppard trembled violently and though she understood his meaning too well she answeredi cant guess well then returned the ruffian to put you out o suspense as the topsman remarked to poor tom sheppard afore he turned him off im come to make you an honourable proposal o marriage you wont refuse me im sure so no more need be said about the matter tomorrow well go to the fleet and get spliced dont shake so what i said about your brat was

support your kid i shant bring him up how i pleaseeh dont question me but leave me replied the widow wildly you had better leave you echoed the ruffian with a contemptuous laugh not just yet i am not unprotected rejoined the poor woman theres some one at the window help help but her cries were unheeded and blueskin who for a moment had looked round distrustfully concluding it was a feint now laughed louder than ever it wont do widow said he drawing near her while she shrank from his approach so you may spare your breath come come be reasonable and listen to me your kid has already brought me good luck and may bring me still more if his edications attended to this purse he added chinking it in the air and this ring were given me for him just now by the lady who made a false step on leaving your house if id been in the way instead of jonathan wild that accident wouldnt have happened as he said this a slight noise was heard without whats that ejaculated the ruffian glancing uneasily towards the window whos therepshaw its only the wind its jonathan wild returned the widow endeavouring to alarm him i told you i was not unprotected he protect you retorted blueskin maliciously you havent a worse enemy on the face of the earth than jonathan wild if youd read your husbands dying speech youd know that he laid his death at jonathans doorand with reason too as i can testify man screamed mrs sheppard with a vehemence that shook even the hardened wretch beside her begone and tempt me not what should i tempt you to asked blueskin in surprise totono matter what returned the widow distractedly gogo i see what you mean rejoined blueskin tossing a large caseknife which he took from his pocket in the air and catching it dexterously by the haft as it fell you owe jonathan a grudgeso do i he hanged your first husband just speak the word he added drawing the knife significantly across his throat and ill put it out of his power to do the same by your second but dn him lets talk o something more agreeable look at this ringits a diamond and worth a mint o money it shall be your wedding ring look at it i say the ladys names engraved inside but so small i can scarcely read it alivaalivatrentrencher thats it aliva trencher aliva trenchard exclaimed mrs sheppard hastily is that the name ay ay now i look again it is trenchard how came you to know it have you heard the name before i think i havelong long ago when i was a child replied mrs sheppard passing her hand across her brow but my memory is gonequite gone where can i have heard it devil knows rejoined blueskin let it pass the rings yours and youre mine here put it on your finger mrs sheppard snatched back her hand from his grasp and exerted all her force to repel his advances set down the kid roared blueskin savagely mercy screamed mrs sheppard struggling to escape and holding the infant at arms length have mercy on this helpless innocent and the child alarmed by the strife added its feeble cries to its mothers shrieks set it down i tell you thundered blueskin or i shall do it a mischief never cried mrs sheppard uttering a terrible imprecation blueskin placed the knife between his teeth and endeavoured to seize the poor woman by the throat in the struggle her cap fell off the ruffian caught hold of her hair and held her fast the chamber rang with her shrieks but her cries instead of moving her assailants compassion only added to his fury planting his knee against her side he pulled her towards him with one hand while with the other he sought his knife the child was now within reach and in another moment he would have executed his deadly purpose if an arm from behind had not felled him to the ground when mrs sheppard who had been stricken down by the blow that prostrated her assailant looked up she perceived jonathan wild kneeling beside the body of blueskin he was holding the ring to the light and narrowly examining the inscription trenchard he muttered aliva trenchardthey were right then as to the name well if she survives the accidentas the blood who styles himself sir cecil fancies she may dothis ring will make my fortune by leading to the discovery of the chief parties concerned in this strange affair is the poor lady alive asked mrs sheppard eagerly sblood exclaimed jonathan hastily thrusting the ring into his vest and taking up a heavy horsemans pistol with which he had felled blueskini thought youd been senseless is she alive repeated the widow whats that to you demanded jonathan gruffly oh nothingnothing returned mrs sheppard but pray tell me if her husband has escaped her husband echoed jonathan scornfully a husband has little to fear from his wifes kinsfolk her lover darrell has embarked upon the thames where if hes not capsized by the squall for its blowing like the devil he stands a good chance of getting his throat cut by his pursuersha ha i tracked em to the banks of the river and should have followed to see it out if the watermen hadnt refused to take me however as things have turned up its fortunate that i came back it is indeed replied mrs sheppard most fortunate for me for you exclaimed jonathan dont flatter yourself that im thinking of you blueskin might have butchered you and your brat before id have lifted a finger to prevent him if it hadnt suited my purposes to do so and he hadnt incurred my displeasure i never forgive an injury your husband could have told you that how had he offended you inquired the widow ill tell you answered jonathan sternly he thwarted my schemes twice the first time i overlooked the offence but the second time when i had planned to break open the house of his master the fellow who visited you tonightwood the carpenter of wych streethe betrayed me i told him i would bring him to the gallows and i was as good as my word you were so replied mrs sheppard and for that wicked deed you will one day be brought to the gallows yourself not before i have conducted your child thither retorted jonathan with a withering look ah ejaculated mrs sheppard paralysed by the threat if that sickly brat lives to be a man continued jonathan rising ill hang him upon the same tree as his father pity shrieked the widow ill be his evil genius vociferated jonathan who seemed to enjoy her torture begone wretch cried the mother stung beyond endurance by his taunts or i will drive you hence with my curses curse on and welcome jeered wild mrs sheppard raised her hand and the malediction trembled upon her tongue but ere the words could find utterance her maternal tenderness overcame her indignation and sinking upon her knees she extended her arms over her child a mothers prayersa mothers blessings she cried with the fervour almost of inspiration will avail against a fiends malice we shall see rejoined jonathan turning carelessly upon his heel and as he quitted the room the poor widow fell with her face upon the floor footnotes footnote a at the hospital of saint giles for lazars the prisoners conveyed from the city of london towards tyburn there to be executed for treasons felonies or other trespasses were presented with a bowl of ale thereof to drink as their last refreshing in this lifestrypes stow book ix ch iii chapter vi the storm as soon as he was liberated by his persecutors mr wood set off at full speed from the mint and hurrying he scarce knew whither for there was such a continual buzzing in his ears and dancing in his eyes as almost to take away the power of reflection he held on at a brisk pace till his strength completely failed him on regaining his breath he began to consider whither chance had led him and rubbing his eyes to clear his sight he perceived a sombre pile with a lofty tower and broad roof immediately in front of him this structure at once satisfied him as to where he stood he knew it to be st saviours church as he looked up at the massive tower the clock tolled forth the hour of midnight the solemn strokes were immediately answered by a multitude of chimes sounding across the thames amongst which the deep note of saint pauls was plainly distinguishable a feeling of inexplicable awe crept over the carpenter as the sounds died away he trembled not from any superstitious dread but from an undefined sense of approaching danger the peculiar appearance of the sky was not without some influence in awakening these terrors over one of the pinnacles of the tower a speck of pallid light marked the position of the moon then newly born and newly risen it was still profoundly dark but the wind which had begun to blow with some violence chased the clouds rapidly across the heavens and dispersed the vapours hanging nearer the earth sometimes the moon was totally eclipsed at others it shed a wan and ghastly glimmer over the masses rolling in the firmament not a star could be discerned but in their stead streaks of lurid radiance whence proceeding it was impossible to determine shot ever and anon athwart the dusky vault and added to the ominous and threatening appearance of the night alarmed by these prognostications of a storm and feeling too much exhausted from his late severe treatment to proceed further on foot wood endeavoured to find a tavern where he might warm and otherwise refresh himself with this view he struck off into a narrow street on the left and soon entered a small alehouse over the door of which hung the sign of the welsh trumpeter let me have a glass of brandy said he addressing the host too late master replied the landlord of the trumpeter in a surly tone for he did not much like the appearance of his customer just shut up shop zounds david pugh dont you know your old friend and countryman exclaimed the carpenter ah owen wood is it you cried david in astonishment what the devil makes you out so late and what has happened to you man ehyou seem in a queer plight give me the brandy and ill tell you replied wood here wifehostessfetch me that bottle from the second shelf in the corner cupboardthere mr wood cried david pouring out a glass of the spirit and offering it to the carpenter thatll warm the cockles of your heart dont be afraid manoff with it its right nantz i keep it for my own drinking he added in a lower tone mr wood having disposed of the brandy and pronounced himself much better hurried close to the fireside and informed his friend in a few words of the inhospitable treatment he had experienced from the gentlemen of the mint whereupon mr pugh who as well as the carpenter was a descendant of cadwallader waxed extremely wrath gave utterance to a number of fiercesounding imprecations in the welsh tongue and was just beginning to express the greatest anxiety to catch some of the rascals at the trumpeter when mr wood cut him short by stating his intention of crossing the river as soon as possible in order to avoid the storm a storm exclaimed the landlord gadzooks i thought something was coming on for when i looked at the weatherglass an hour ago it had sunk lower than i ever remember it we shall have a durty night on it to a sartinty landlord observed an old oneeyed sailor who sat smoking his pipe by the fireside the glass never sinks in that way dye see without a hurricane follerin ive knowed it often do so in the west injees moreover a souple o porpusses came up with the tide this mornin and ha bin flounderin about i the thames abuv lunnun bridge all day long and them saymonsters you know always proves sure fore runners of a gale then the sooner im off the better cried wood whats to pay david dont affront me owen by asking such a question returned the landlord hadnt you better stop and finish the bottle not a drop more replied wood enoughs as good as a feast good night well if you wont be persuaded and must have a boat owen observed the landlord theres a waterman asleep on that bench will help you to as tidy a craft as any on the thames halloa ben cried he shaking a broadbacked fellow equipped in a shortskirted doublet and having a badge upon his armscullers wanted holloa my hearty cried ben starting to his feet this gentleman wants a pair of oars said the landlord where to master asked ben touching his woollen cap arundel stairs replied wood the nearest point to wych street come along master said the waterman hark ee ben said the old sailor knocking the ashes from his pipe upon the hob you may try but dash my timbers if youll ever cross the thames tonight and why not old saltwater inquired ben turning a quid in his mouth cos theres a gale agetting up asll perwent you young freshwater replied the tar it must look sharp then or i shall give it the slip laughed ben the gale never yet blowed as could perwent my crossing the thames the weathers been foul enough for the last fortnight but ive never turned my back upon it may be not replied the old sailor drily but youll find it too stiff for you tonight anyhow howsomdever if you should reach tother side take an old fellers advice and dont be foolhardy enough to venter back again i tell ee what saltwater said ben ill lay you my fareand thatll be two shillinim back in an hour done cried the old sailor but verell be the use o vinnin you vont live to pay me never fear replied ben gravely dead or alive ill pay you if i lose theres my thumb upon it come along master i tell ee what landlord observed the old sailor quietly replenishing his pipe from a huge pewter tobaccobox as the waterman and wood quitted the house youve said goodbye to your friend odds me do you think so cried the host of the trumpeter ill run and bring him back hes a welshman and i wouldnt for a trifle that any accident befel him never mind said the old sailor taking up a piece of blazing coal with the tongs and applying it to his pipe let em try theyll be back soon enoughor not at all mr wood and the waterman meanwhile proceeded in the direction of st saviours stairs casting a hasty glance at the old and ruinous prison belonging to the liberty of the bishop of winchester whose palace formerly adjoined the river called the clink which gave its name to the street along which he walked and noticing with some uneasiness the melancholy manner in which the wind whistled through its barred casements the carpenter followed his companion down an opening to the right and presently arrived at the waterside moored to the steps several wherries were dancing in the rushing current as if impatient of restraint into one of these the waterman jumped and having assisted mr wood to a seat within it immediately pushed from land ben had scarcely adjusted his oars when the gleam of a lantern was seen moving towards the bank a shout was heard at a little distance and the next moment a person rushed with breathless haste to the stairhead boat there cried a voice which mr wood fancied he recognised youll find a waterman asleep under his tilt in one of them ere craft if you look about sir replied ben backing water as he spoke cant you take me with you urged the voice ill make it well worth your while ive a child here whom i wish to convey across the water without loss of time a child thought wood it must be the fugitive darrell hold hard cried he addressing the waterman ill give the gentleman a lift unpossible master rejoined ben the tides running down like a millsluice and the winds right in our teeth old saltwater was right we shall have a reglar squall afore we gets across dye hear how the wanes creaks on old winchester house we shall have a touch on it ourselves presently but i shall lose my wager if i stay a moment longerso here goes upon which he plunged his oars deeply into the stream and the bark shot from the strand mr woods anxiety respecting the fugitive was speedily relieved by hearing another waterman busy himself in preparation for starting and shortly after the dip of a second pair of oars sounded upon the river curse me if i dont think all the world means to cross the thames this fine night observed ben oned think it rained fares as well as blowed great guns why theres another party on the stairhead inquiring arter scullers and by the mass they appear in a greater hurry than any on us his attention being thus drawn to the bank the carpenter beheld three figures one of whom bore a torch leap into a wherry of a larger size than the others which immediately put off from shore manned by a couple of watermen who rowed with great swiftness this wherry dashed through the current in the track of the fugitive of whom it was evidently in pursuit and upon whom it perceptibly gained mr wood strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of the flying skiff but he could only discern a black and shapeless mass floating upon the water at a little distance which to his bewildered fancy appeared absolutely standing still to the practised eye of the waterman matters wore a very different air he perceived clearly enough that the chase was moving quickly and he was also aware from the increased rapidity with which the oars were urged that every exertion was made on board to get out of the reach of her pursuers at one moment it seemed as if the flying bark was about to put to shore but this plan probably from its danger was instantly abandoned not however before her momentary hesitation had been taken advantage of by her pursuers who redoubling their efforts at this juncture materially lessened the distance between them ben watched these manoeuvres with great interest and strained every sinew in his frame to keep ahead of the other boats thems catchpoles i spose sir arter the gemman with a writ he observed something worse i fear wood replied why you dont think as how theyre crimps do you ben inquired i dont know what i think wood answered sulkily and he bent his eyes upon the water as if he wished to avert his attention forcibly from the scene there is something that inspires a feeling of inexpressible melancholy in sailing on a dark night upon the thames the sounds that reach the ear and the objects that meet the eye are all calculated to awaken a train of sad and serious contemplation the ripple of the water against the boat as its keel cleaves through the streamthe darkling current hurrying bythe indistinctlyseen craft of all forms and all sizes hovering around and making their way in ghostlike silence or warning each other of their approach by cries that heard from afar have something doleful in their notethe solemn shadows cast by the bridgesthe deeper gloom of the echoing archesthe lights glimmering from the banksthe red reflection thrown upon the waves by a fire kindled on some stationary bargethe tall and fantastic shapes of the houses as discerned through the obscuritythese and other sights and sounds of the same character give a sombre colour to the thoughts of one who may choose to indulge in meditation at such a time and in such a place but it was otherwise with the carpenter this was no night for the indulgence of dreamy musing it was a night of storm and terror which promised each moment to become more stormy and more terrible not a bark could be discerned on the river except those already mentioned the darkness was almost palpable and the wind which hitherto had been blowing in gusts was suddenly lulled it was a dead calm but this calm was more awful than the previous roaring of the blast amid this portentous hush the report of a pistol reached the carpenters ears and raising his head at the sound he beheld a sight which filled him with fresh apprehensions by the light of a torch borne at the stern of the hostile wherry he saw that the pursuers had approached within a short distance of the object of their quest the shot had taken effect upon the waterman who rowed the chase he had abandoned his oars and the boat was drifting with the stream towards the enemy escape was now impossible darrell stood erect in the bark with his drawn sword in hand prepared to repel the attack of his assailants who in their turn seemed to await with impatience the moment which should deliver him into their power they had not to tarry long in another instant the collision took place the watermen who manned the larger wherry immediately shipped their oars grappled with the drifting skiff and held it fast wood then beheld two persons one of whom he recognised as rowland spring on board the chase a fierce struggle ensued there was a shrill cry instantly succeeded by a deep splash put about waterman for gods sake cried wood whose humanity got the better of every personal consideration some one is overboard give way and let us render what assistance we can to the poor wretch its all over with him by this time master replied ben turning the head of his boat and rowing swiftly towards the scene of strife but dn him he was the chap as hit poor bill thomson just now and i dont much care if he should be food for fishes as ben spoke they drew near the opposing parties the contest was now carried on between rowland and darrell the latter had delivered himself from one of his assailants the attendant davies hurled over the sides of the skiff the ruffian speedily found a watery grave it was a springtide at half ebb and the current which was running fast and furiously bore him instantly away while the strife raged between the principals the watermen in the larger wherry were occupied in stemming the force of the torrent and endeavouring to keep the boats they had lashed together stationary owing to this circumstance mr woods boat impelled alike by oar and tide shot past the mark at which it aimed and before it could be again brought about the struggle had terminated for a few minutes darrell seemed to have the advantage in the conflict neither combatant could use his sword and in strength the fugitive was evidently superior to his antagonist the boat rocked violently with the struggle had it not been lashed to the adjoining wherry it must have been upset and have precipitated the opponents into the water rowland felt himself sinking beneath the powerful grasp of his enemy he called to the other attendant who held the torch understanding the appeal the man snatched his masters sword from his grasp and passed it through darrells body the next moment a heavy plunge told that the fugitive had been consigned to the waves darrell however rose again instantly and though mortally wounded made a desperate effort to regain the boat my child he groaned faintly well reminded answered rowland who had witnessed his struggles with a smile of gratified vengeance i had forgotten the accursed imp in this confusion take it he cried lifting the babe from the bottom of the boat and flinging it towards its unfortunate father the child fell within a short distance of darrell who hearing the splash struck out in that direction and caught it before it sank at this juncture the sound of oars reached his ears and he perceived mr woods boat bearing up towards him here he is waterman exclaimed the benevolent carpenter i see himrow for your life thats the way to miss him master replied ben coolly we must keep still the tidell bring him to us fast enough ben judged correctly borne along by the current darrell was instantly at the boats side seize this oar vociferated the waterman first take the child cried darrell holding up the infant and clinging to the oar with a dying effort give it me returned the carpenter alls safe now lend me your own hand my strength fails me gasped the fugitive i cannot climb the boat take my child toit isoh godi am sinkingtake ittake it where shouted wood darrell attempted to reply but he could only utter an inarticulate exclamation the next moment his grasp relaxed and he sank to rise no more rowland meantime alarmed by the voices snatched a torch from his attendant and holding it over the side of the wherry witnessed the incident just described confusion cried he there is another boat in our wake they have rescued the child loose the wherry and stand to your oarsquickquick these commands were promptly obeyed the boat was set free and the men resumed their seats rowlands purposes were however defeated in a manner as unexpected as appalling during the foregoing occurrences a dead calm prevailed but as rowland sprang to the helm and gave the signal for pursuit a roar like a volley of ordnance was heard aloft and the wind again burst its bondage a moment before the surface of the stream was black as ink it was now whitening hissing and seething like an enormous cauldron the blast once more swept over the agitated river whirled off the sheets of foam scattered them far and wide in raindrops and left the raging torrent blacker than before the gale had become a hurricane that hurricane was the most terrible that ever laid waste our city destruction everywhere marked its course steeples toppled and towers reeled beneath its fury trees were torn up by the roots many houses were levelled to the ground others were unroofed the leads on the churches were ripped off and shrivelled up like scrolls of parchment nothing on land or water was spared by the remorseless gale most of the vessels lying in the river were driven from their moorings dashed tumultuously against each other or blown ashore all was darkness horror confusion ruin men fled from their tottering habitations and returned to them scared by greater dangers the end of the world seemed at hand at this time of universal havoc and despairwhen all london quaked at the voice of the stormthe carpenter who was exposed to its utmost fury fared better than might have been anticipated the boat in which he rode was not overset fortunately her course had been shifted immediately after the rescue of the child and in consequence of this movement she received the first shock of the hurricane which blew from the southwest upon her stern her head dipped deeply into the current and she narrowly escaped being swamped righting however instantly afterwards she scudded with the greatest rapidity over the boiling waves to whose mercy she was now entirely abandoned on this fresh outburst of the storm wood threw himself instinctively into the bottom of the boat and clasping the little orphan to his breast endeavoured to prepare himself to meet his fate while he was thus occupied he felt a rough grasp upon his arm and presently afterwards bens lips approached close to his ear the waterman sheltered his mouth with his hand while he spoke or his voice would have been carried away by the violence of the blast its all up master groaned ben nothin short of a merracle can save us the boats sure to run foul o the bridge and if she scapes stavin above shell be swamped to a sartainty below therell be a fall of above twelve foot o water and think o that on a night as ud blow a whole fleet to the devil mr wood did think of it and groaned aloud heaven help us he exclaimed we were mad to neglect the old sailors advice thats what troubles me rejoined ben i tell ee what master if youre more fortinate nor i am and get ashore give old saltwater your fare i pledged my thumb that dead or alive id pay the wager if i lost and i should like to be as good as my word i willi will replied wood hastily was that thunder he faltered as a terrible clap was heard overhead no its only a fresh gale ben returned hark now it comes lord have mercy upon us miserable sinners ejaculated wood as a fearful gust dashed the water over the side of the boat deluging him with spray the hurricane had now reached its climax the blast shrieked as if exulting in its wrathful mission stunning and continuous the din seemed almost to take away the power of hearing he who had faced the gale would have been instantly stifled piercing through every crevice in the clothes it in some cases tore them from the wearers limbs or from his grasp it penetrated the skin benumbed the flesh paralysed the faculties the intense darkness added to the terror of the storm the destroying angel hurried by shrouded in his gloomiest apparel none saw though all felt his presence and heard the thunder of his voice imagination coloured by the obscurity peopled the air with phantoms ten thousand steeds appeared to be trampling aloft charged with the work of devastation awful shapes seemed to flit by borne on the wings of the tempest animating and directing its fury the actual danger was lost sight of in these wild apprehensions and many timorous beings were scared beyond reasons verge by the excess of their fears this had well nigh been the case with the carpenter he was roused from the stupor of despair into which he had sunk by the voice of ben who roared in his ear the bridgethe bridge chapter vii old london bridge london at the period of this history boasted only a single bridge but that bridge was more remarkable than any the metropolis now possesses covered with houses from one end to the other this reverend and picturesque structure presented the appearance of a street across the thames it was as if gracechurch street with all its shops its magazines and ceaseless throng of passengers were stretched from the middlesex to the surrey shore the houses were older the shops gloomier and the thoroughfare narrower it is true but the bustle the crowd the streetlike air was the same then the bridge had arched gateways bristling with spikes and garnished as all ancient gateways ought to be with the heads of traitors in olden days it boasted a chapel dedicated to saint thomas beneath which there was a crypt curiously constructed amid the arches where was sepultured peter the chaplain of colechurch who began the stone bridge at london and it still boasted an edifice though now in rather a tumbledown condition which had once vied with a palacewe mean nonesuch house the other buildings stood close together in rows and so valuable was every inch of room accounted that in many cases cellars and even habitable apartments were constructed in the solid masonry of the piers old london bridge the grandsire of the present erection was supported on nineteen arches each of which would a rialto make for depth and height the arches stood upon enormous piers the piers on starlings or jetties built far out into the river to break the force of the tide roused by bens warning the carpenter looked up and could just perceive the dusky outline of the bridge looming through the darkness and rendered indistinctly visible by the many lights that twinkled from the windows of the lofty houses as he gazed at these lights they suddenly seemed to disappear and a tremendous shock was felt throughout the frame of the boat wood started to his feet he found that the skiff had been dashed against one of the buttresses of the bridge jump cried ben in a voice of thunder wood obeyed his fears supplied him with unwonted vigour though the starling was more than two feet above the level of the water he alighted with his little chargewhich he had never for an instant quittedin safety upon it poor ben was not so fortunate just as he was preparing to follow the wherry containing rowland and his men which had drifted in their wake was dashed against his boat the violence of the collision nearly threw him backwards and caused him to swerve as he sprang his foot touched the rounded edge of the starling and glanced off precipitating him into the water as he fell he caught at the projecting masonry but the stone was slippery and the tide which here began to feel the influence of the fall was running with frightful velocity he could not make good his hold but uttering a loud cry he was swept away by the headlong torrent mr wood heard the cry but his own situation was too perilous to admit of his rendering any assistance to the illfated waterman he fancied indeed that he beheld a figure spring upon the starling at the moment when the boats came in contact but as he could perceive no one near him he concluded he must have been mistaken in order to make mr woods present position and subsequent proceedings fully intelligible it may be necessary to give some notion of the shape and structure of the platform on which he had taken refuge it has been said that the pier of each arch or lock of old london bridge was defended from the force of the tide by a huge projecting spur called a starling these starlings varied in width according to the bulk of the pier they surrounded but they were all pretty nearly of the same length and built somewhat after the model of a boat having extremities as sharp and pointed as the keel of a canoe cased and ribbed with stone and braced with horizontal beams of timber the piles which formed the foundation of these jetties had resisted the strong encroachments of the current for centuries some of them are now buried at the bottom of the thames the starling on which the carpenter stood was the fourth from the surrey shore it might be three yards in width and a few more in length but it was covered with ooze and slime and the waves continually broke over it the transverse spars before mentioned were as slippery as ice and the hollows between them were filled ankledeep with water the carpenter threw himself flat upon the starling to avoid the fury of the wind but in this posture he fared worse than ever if he ran less risk of being blown over he stood a much greater chance of being washed off or stifled as he lay on his back he fancied himself gradually slipping off the platform springing to his feet in an ecstasy of terror he stumbled and had well nigh realized his worst apprehensions he next tried to clamber up the flying buttresses and soffits of the pier in the hope of reaching some of the windows and other apertures with which as a manofwar is studded with portholes the sides of the bridge were pierced but this wild scheme was speedily abandoned and nerved by despair the carpenter resolved to hazard an attempt from the execution almost from the contemplation of which he had hitherto shrunk this was to pass under the arch along the narrow ledge of the starling and if possible attain the eastern platform where protected by the bridge he would suffer less from the excessive violence of the gale assured if he remained much longer where he was he would inevitably perish wood recommended himself to the protection of heaven and began his perilous course carefully sustaining the child which even in that terrible extremity he had not the heart to abandon he fell upon his knees and guiding himself with his right hand crept slowly on he had scarcely entered the arch when the indraught was so violent and the noise of the wind so dreadful and astounding that he almost determined to relinquish the undertaking but the love of life prevailed over his fears he went on the ledge along which he crawled was about a foot wide in length the arch exceeded seventy feet to the poor carpenter it seemed an endless distance when by slow and toilsome efforts he had arrived midway something obstructed his further progress it was a huge stone placed there by some workmen occupied in repairing the structure cold drops stood upon woods brow as he encountered this obstacle to return was impossibleto raise himself certain destruction he glanced downwards at the impetuous torrent which he could perceive shooting past him with lightning swiftness in the gloom he listened to the thunder of the fall now mingling with the roar of the blast and driven almost frantic by what he heard and saw he pushed with all his force against the stone to his astonishment and delight it yielded to the pressure toppled over the ledge and sank such was the hubbub and tumult around him that the carpenter could not hear its plunge into the flood his course however was no longer interrupted and he crept on after encountering other dangers and being twice compelled to fling himself flat upon his face to avoid slipping from the wet and slimy pathway he was at length about to emerge from the lock when to his inexpressible horror he found he had lost the child all the blood in his veins rushed to his heart and he shook in every limb as he made this discovery a species of vertigo seized him his brain reeled he fancied that the whole fabric of the bridge was cracking over headthat the arch was tumbling upon himthat the torrent was swelling around him whirling him off and about to bury him in the deafening abyss he shrieked with agony and clung with desperate tenacity to the roughened stones but calmer thoughts quickly succeeded on taxing his recollection the whole circumstance rushed to mind with painful distinctness he remembered that before he attempted to dislodge the stone he had placed the child in a cavity of the pier which the granite mass had been intended to fill this obstacle being removed in his eagerness to proceed he had forgotten to take his little charge with him it was still possible the child might be in safety and so bitterly did the carpenter reproach himself with his neglect that he resolved at all risks to go back in search of it acting upon this humane determination he impelled himself slowly backwardsfor he did not dare to face the blastand with incredible labour and fatigue reached the crevice his perseverance was amply rewarded the child was still safe it lay undisturbed in the remotest corner of the recess so overjoyed was the carpenter with the successful issue of his undertaking that he scarcely paused a moment to recruit himself but securing the child set out upon his return retracing his steps he arrived without further accident at the eastern platform of the starling as he anticipated he was here comparatively screened from the fury of the wind and when he gazed upon the roaring fall beneath him visible through the darkness in a glistening sheet of foam his heart overflowed with gratitude for his providential deliverance as he moved about upon the starling mr wood became sensible that he was not alone some one was standing beside him this then must be the person whom he had seen spring upon the western platform at the time of the collision between the boats the carpenter well knew from the obstacle which had interfered with his own progress that the unknown could not have passed through the same lock as himself but he might have crept along the left side of the pier and beneath the further arch whereas wood as we have seen took his course upon the right the darkness prevented the carpenter from discerning the features or figure of the stranger and the ceaseless din precluded the possibility of holding any communication by words with him wood however made known his presence to the individual by laying his hand upon his shoulder the stranger started at the touch and spoke but his words were borne away by the driving wind finding all attempts at conversation with his companion in misfortune in vain wood in order to distract his thoughts looked up at the gigantic structure standing like a wall of solid darkness before him what was his transport on perceiving that a few yards above him a light was burning the carpenter did not hesitate a moment he took a handful of the gravelly mud with which the platform was covered and threw the small pebbles one by one towards the gleam a pane of glass was shivered by each stone the signal of distress was evidently understood the light disappeared the window was shortly after opened and a rope ladder with a lighted horn lantern attached to it let down wood grasped his companions arm to attract his attention to this unexpected means of escape the ladder was now within reach both advanced towards it when by the light of the lantern wood beheld in the countenance of the stranger the wellremembered and stern features of rowland the carpenter trembled for he perceived rowlands gaze fixed first upon the infant and then on himself it is her child shrieked rowland in a voice heard above the howling of the tempest risen from this roaring abyss to torment me its parents have perished and shall their wretched offspring live to blight my hopes and blast my fame never and with these words he grasped wood by the throat and despite his resistance dragged him to the very verge of the platform all this juncture a thundering crash was heard against the side of the bridge a stack of chimneys on the house above them had yielded to the storm and descended in a shower of bricks and stones when the carpenter a moment afterwards stretched out his hand scarcely knowing whether he was alive or dead he found himself alone the fatal shower from which he and his little charge escaped uninjured had stricken his assailant and precipitated him into the boiling gulf its an ill wind that blows nobody good thought the carpenter turning his attention to the child whose feeble struggles and cries proclaimed that as yet life had not been extinguished by the hardships it had undergone poor little creature he muttered pressing it tenderly to his breast as he grasped the rope and clambered up to the window if thou hast indeed lost both thy parents as that terrible man said just now thou art not wholly friendless and deserted for i myself will be a father to thee and in memory of this dreadful night and the death from which i have been the means of preserving thee thou shalt bear the name of thames darrell no sooner had wood crept through the window than nature gave way and he fainted on coming to himself he found he had been wrapped in a blanket and put to bed with a couple of hot bricks to his feet his first inquiries were concerning the child and he was delighted to find that it still lived and was doing well every care had been taken of it as well as of himself by the humane inmates of the house in which he had sought shelter about noon next day he was able to move and the gale having abated he set out homewards with his little charge the city presented a terrible picture of devastation london bridge had suffered a degree less than most places but it was almost choked up with fallen stacks of chimneys broken beams of timber and shattered tiles the houses overhung in a frightful manner and looked as if the next gust would precipitate them into the river with great difficulty wood forced a path through the ruins it was a work of no slight danger for every instant a wall or fragment of a building came crashing to the ground thames street was wholly impassable men were going hither and thither with barrows and ladders and ropes removing the rubbish and trying to support the tottering habitations gracechurch street was entirely deserted except by a few stragglers whose curiosity got the better of their fears or who like the carpenter were compelled to proceed along it the tiles lay a foot thick in the road in some cases they were ground almost to powder in others driven deeply into the earth as if discharged from a piece of ordnance the roofs and gables of many of the houses had been torn off the signs of the shops were carried to incredible distances here and there a building might be seen with the doors and windows driven in and all access to it prevented by the heaps of bricks and tilesherds through this confusion the carpenter struggled onnow ascending now descending the different mountains of rubbish that beset his path at the imminent peril of his life and limbs until he arrived in fleet street the hurricane appeared to have raged in this quarter with tenfold fury mr wood scarcely knew where he was the old aspect of the place was gone in lieu of the substantial habitations which he had gazed on overnight he beheld a row of falling scaffoldings for such they seemed it was a dismal and depressing sight to see a great city thus suddenly overthrown and the carpenter was deeply moved by the spectacle as usual however on the occasion of any great calamity a crowd was scouring the streets whose sole object was plunder while involved in this crowd near temple barwhere the thoroughfare was most dangerous from the masses of ruin that impeded itan individual whose swarthy features recalled to the carpenter one of his tormentors of the previous night collared him and with bitter imprecations accused him of stealing his child in vain wood protested his innocence the ruffians companions took his part and the infant in all probability would have been snatched from its preserver if a posse of the watch sent out to maintain order and protect property had not opportunely arrived and by a vigorous application of their halberts dispersed his persecutors and set him at liberty mr wood then took to his heels and never once looked behind him till he reached his own dwelling in wych street his wife met him at the door and into her hands he delivered his little charge end of the first epoch epoch the second

where are the aspirations that fired usthe passions that consumed us then has our success in life been commensurate with our own desireswith the anticipations formed of us by others or are we not

before us cheerless as the blank behindenough of this let us proceed with our tale twelve years then have elapsed since the date of the occurrences detailed in the preceding division of this history at that time we were beneath the sway of anne we are now at the commencement of the reign of george the first passing at a glance over the whole of the intervening period leaving in the words of the poet the growth untried of that wide gap we shall resume our narrative at the beginning of june one friday afternoon in this pleasant month it chanced that mr wood who had been absent on business during the greater part of the day returned perhaps not altogether undesignedly at an earlier hour than was expected to his dwelling in wych street drury lane and was about to enter his workshop when not hearing any sound of labour issue from within he began to suspect that an apprentice of whose habits of industry he entertained some doubt was neglecting his employment impressed with this idea he paused for a moment to listen but finding all continue silent he cautiously lifted the latch and crept into the room resolved to punish the offender in case his suspicions should prove correct the chamber into which he stole like all carpenters workshops was crowded with the implements and materials of that ancient and honourable art saws hammers planes axes augers adzes chisels gimblets and an endless variety of tools were ranged like a stand of martial weapons at an armoury in racks against the walls over these hung levels bevels squares and other instruments of measurement amid a litter of nails without heads screws without worms and locks without wards lay a gluepot and an oilstone two articles which their owner was wont to term his right hand and his left on a shelf was placed a row of paintjars the contents of which had been daubed in rainbow streaks upon the adjacent closet and window sill divers plans and figures were chalked upon the walls and the spaces between them were filled up with an almanack for the year a godly ballad adorned with a rude woodcut purporting to be the history of chaste susannah an old print of the seven golden candlesticks an abstract of the various acts of parliament against drinking swearing and all manner of profaneness and a view of the interior of doctor daniel burgesss presbyterian meetinghouse in russell court with portraits of the reverend gentleman and the principal members of his flock the floor was thickly strewn with sawdust and shavings and across the room ran a long and wide bench furnished at one end with a powerful vice next to which three nails driven into the boards served it would appear from the lump of unconsumed tallow left in their custody as a substitute for a candlestick on the bench was set a quartern measure of gin a crust of bread and a slice of cheese attracted by the odour of the latter dainty a hungry cat had contrived to scratch open the paper in which it was wrapped displaying the following words in large charactersthe history of the four kings or childs best guide to the gallows and as if to make the moral more obvious a dirty pack of cards was scattered underneath upon the sawdust near the door stood a pile of deal planks behind which the carpenter ensconced himself in order to reconnoitre unobserved the proceedings of his idle apprentice standing on tiptoe on a jointstool placed upon the bench with his back to the door and a claspknife in his hand this youngster instead of executing his appointed task was occupied in carving his name upon a beam overhead boys at the time of which we write were attired like men of their own day or certain charitychildren of ours and the stripling in question was dressed in black plush breeches and a gray drugget waistcoat with immoderately long pockets both of which were evidently the castoff clothes of some one considerably his senior coat on the present occasion he had none it being more convenient as well as agreeable to him to pursue his avocations in his shirtsleeves but when fully equipped he wore a largecuffed longskirted garment which had once been the property of his master in concealing himself behind the timber mr wood could not avoid making a slight shuffling sound the noise startled the apprentice who instantly suspended his labour and gazed anxiously in the direction whence he supposed it proceeded his face was that of a quick intelligentlooking boy with fine hazel eyes and a clear olive complexion his figure was uncommonly slim even for his age which could not be more than thirteen and the looseness of his garb made him appear thinner than he was in reality but if his frame was immature his looks were not so he seemed to possess a penetration and cunning beyond his yearsto hide a mans judgment under a boys mask the glance which he threw at the door was singularly expressive of his character it was a mixture of alarm effrontery and resolution in the end resolution triumphed as it was sure to do over the weaker emotions and he laughed at his fears the only part of his otherwiseinteresting countenance to which one could decidedly object was the mouth a feature that more than any other is conceived to betray the animal propensities of the possessor if this is true it must be owned that the boys mouth showed a strong tendency on his part to coarse indulgence the eyes too though large and bright and shaded by long lashes seemed to betoken as hazel eyes generally do in men a faithless and uncertain disposition the cheekbones were prominent the nose slightly depressed with rather wide nostrils the chin narrow but wellformed the forehead broad and lofty and he possessed such an extraordinary flexibility of muscle in this region that he could elevate his eyebrows at pleasure up to the very verge of his sleek and shining black hair which being closely cropped to admit of his occasionally wearing a wig gave a singular bulletshape to his head taken altogether his physiognomy resembled one of those vagabond heads which murillo delighted to paint and for which guzman dalfarache lazarillo de tormes or estevanillo gonzalez might have satfaces that almost make one in love with roguery they seem so full of vivacity and enjoyment there was all the knavery and more than all the drollery of a spanish picaroon in the laughing eyes of the english apprentice and with a little more warmth and sunniness of skin on the side of the latter the resemblance between them would have been complete satisfied as he thought that he had nothing to apprehend the boy resumed his task chanting as he plied his knife with redoubled assiduity the followingnot inappropriate strains the newgate stone when claude du val was in newgate thrown he carved his name on the dungeon stone quoth a dubsman who gazed on the shattered wall you have carved your epitaph claude du val with your chisel so fine tra la this s wants a little deepening mused the apprentice retouching the letter in question ay thats better du val was hangd and the next who came on the selfsame stone inscribed his name aha quoth the dubsman with devilish glee tom waters your doom is the triple tree with your chisel so fine tra la tut tut tut he cried what a fool i am to be sure i ought to have cut john not jack however it dont signify nobody ever called me john that i recollect so i dare say i was christened jack deuce take it i was very near spelling my name with one p within that dungeon lay captain bew rumbold and whitneya jolly crew all carved their names on the stone and all share the fate of the brave du val with their chisels so fine tra la save us continued the apprentice i hope this beam doesnt resemble the newgate stone or i may chance like the great men the song speaks of to swing on the tyburn tree for my pains no fear o thatthough if my name should become as famous as theirs it wouldnt much matter the prospect of the gallows would never deter me from taking to the road if i were so inclined full twenty highwaymen blithe and bold rattled their chains in that dungeon old of all that number there scaped not one who carved his name on the newgate stone with his chisel so fine tra la there cried the boy leaping from the stool and drawing back a few paces on the bench to examine his performancethatll do claude du val himself couldnt have carved it betterha ha the name inscribed upon the beam of which as it has been carefully preserved by the subsequent owners of mr woods habitation in wych street we are luckily enabled to furnish a facsimile was illustration jack sheppard signature ive half a mind to give old wood the slip and turn highwayman cried jack as he closed the knife and put it in his pocket the devil you have thundered a voice from behind that filled the apprentice with dismay come down sirrah and ill teach you how to deface my walls in future come down i say instantly or ill make you upon which mr wood caught hold of jacks leg and dragged him off the bench and so youll turn highwayman will you you young dog continued the carpenter cuffing him soundlyrob the mails like jack hall i suppose yes i will replied jack sullenly if you beat me in that way amazed at the boys assurance wood left off boxing his ears for a moment and looking at him steadfastly said in a grave tone jack jack youll come to be hanged better be hanged than henpecked retorted the lad with a malicious grin what do you mean by that sirrah cried wood reddening with anger do you dare to insinuate that mrs wood governs me its plain you cant govern yourself at all events replied jack coolly but be that as it may i wont be struck for nothing nothing echoed wood furiously do you call neglecting your work and singing flash songs nothing zounds you incorrigible rascal many a master would have taken you before a magistrate and prayed for your solitary confinement in bridewell for the least of these offences but ill be more lenient and content myself with merely chastising you on condition you may do as you please master interrupted jack thrusting his hand into his pocket as if in search of the knife but i wouldnt advise you to lay hands on me again mr wood glanced at the hardy offender and not liking the expression of his countenance thought it advisable to postpone the execution of his threats to a more favourable opportunity so by way of gaining time he resolved to question him further where did you learn the song i heard just now he demanded in an authoritative tone at the black lion in our street replied jack without hesitation the worst house in the neighbourhoodthe constant haunt of reprobates and thieves groaned wood and who taught it youthe landlord joe hind no one blueskin a fellow who frequents the lion answered jack with a degree of candour that astonished his master nearly as much as his confidence it was that song that put it into my head to cut my name on the beam a white wall is a fools paper jackremember that rejoined wood pretty company for an apprentice to keeppretty houses for an apprentice to frequent why the rascal you mention is a notorious housebreaker he was tried at the last old bailey sessions and only escaped the gallows by impeaching his accomplices jonathan wild brought him off do you happen to know jonathan wild master inquired jack altering his tone and assuming a more respectful demeanour ive seen him some years ago i believe answered wood and though he must be much changed by this time i dare say i should know him again a short man isnt he about your height sirwith a yellow beard and a face as sly as a foxs hem replied wood coughing slightly to conceal a smile the descriptions not amiss but why do you ask because stammered the boy speak outdont be alarmed said wood in a kind and encouraging tone if youve done wrong confess it and ill forgive you i dont deserve to be forgiven returned jack bursting into tears for im afraid ive done very wrong do you know this sir he added taking a key from his pocket where did you find it asked wood it was given me by a man who was drinking tother night with blueskin at the lion and who though he slouched his hat over his eyes and muffled his chin in a handkerchief must have been jonathan wild where did he get it inquired wood in surprise that i cant say but he promised to give me a couple of guineas if id ascertain whether it fitted your locks zounds exclaimed wood its my old masterkey this key he added taking it from the boy was purloined from me by your father jack what he intended to do with it is of little consequence now but before he suffered at tyburn he charged your mother to restore it she lost it in the mint jonathan wild must have stolen it from her he must exclaimed jack hastily but only let me have it till tomorrow and if i dont entrap him in a snare from which with all his cunning he shall find it difficult to escape my names not jack sheppard i see through your design jack returned the carpenter gravely but i dont like underhand work even when youve a knave to deal with let your actions be plain and aboveboard thats my maxim and its the maxim of every honest man it would be a great matter i must own to bring jonathan wild to justice but i cant consent to the course you would pursueat least not till ive given it due consideration in regard to yourself youve had a very narrow escape wilds intention doubtless was to use you as far as he found necessary and then to sell you let this be a caution to you in futurewith whom and about what you deal were told that whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul avoid taverns and bad company and you may yet do well you promise to become a firstrate workman but you want one quality without which all others are valueless you want industryyou want steadiness idleness is the key of beggary jack if you dont conquer this disgraceful propensity in time youll soon come to want and then nothing can save you be warned by your fathers fate as you brew so must you drink ive engaged to watch over you as a son and i will do so as far as im able but if you neglect my advice what chance have i of benefitting you on one point ive made up my mindyou shall either obey me or leave me please yourself here are your indentures if you choose to seek another master i will obey you masterindeed i will implored jack seriously alarmed at the carpenters calm displeasure we shall see good words without deeds are rushes and reeds and now take away those cards and never let me see them again drive away the cat throw that measure of gin through the window and tell me why youve not so much as touched the packingcase for lady trafford which i particularly desired you to complete against my return it must be sent home this evening she leaves town tomorrow it shall be ready in two hours answered jack seizing a piece of wood and a plane it isnt more than four oclock ill engage to get the job done by six i didnt expect you home before that hour sir ah jack said wood shaking his head where theres a will theres a way you can do anything you please i wish i could get you to imitate thames darrell im sure i understand the business of a carpenter much better than he does replied jack adroitly adjusting the board and using the plane with the greatest rapidity perhaps replied wood doubtfully thames was always your favourite observed jack as he fastened another piece of wood on the teeth of the iron stopper ive made no distinction between you hitherto answered wood nor shall i do so unless im compelled ive had the hard work to do at all events rejoined jack but i wont complain id do anything for thames darrell and thames darrell would do anything for you jack replied a blithe voice whats the matter father continued the newcomer addressing wood has jack displeased you if so overlook his fault this once im sure hell do his best to content you wont you jack that i will answered sheppard eagerly when it thunders the thief becomes honest muttered wood can i help you jack asked thames taking up a plane no no let him alone interposed wood he has undertaken to finish this job by six oclock and i wish to see whether hell be as good as his word hell have hard work to do it by that time father remonstrated thames youd better let me help him on no account rejoined wood peremptorily a little extra exertion will teach him the advantage of diligence at the proper season lost ground must be regained i need scarcely ask whether youve executed your appointed task my dear youre never behindhand thames turned away at the question which he felt might be construed into a reproach but sheppard answered for him darrells job was done early this morning he said and if id attended to his advice the packingcase would have been finished at the same time you trusted too much to your own skill jack rejoined thames if i could work as fast as you i might afford to be as idle see how he gets on father he added appealing to wood the box seems to grow under his hands youre a noblehearted little fellow thames rejoined wood casting a look of pride and affection at his adopted son whose head he gently patted and give promise of a glorious manhood thames darrell was indeed a youth of whom a person of far greater worldly consequence than the worthy carpenter might have been justly proud though a few months younger than his companion jack sheppard he was half a head taller and much more robustly formed the two friends contrasted strikingly with each other in darrells open features frankness and honour were written in legible characters while in jacks physiognomy cunning and knavery were as strongly imprinted in all other respects they differed as materially jack could hardly be accounted goodlooking thames on the contrary was one of the handsomest boys possible jacks complexion was that of a gipsy darrells as fresh and bright as a rose jacks mouth was coarse and large darrells small and exquisitely carved with the short proud upper lip which belongs to the highest order of beauty jacks nose was broad and flat darrells straight and fine as that of antinous the expression pervading the countenance of the one was vulgarity of the other that which is rarely found except in persons of high birth darrells eyes were of that clear gray which it is difficult to distinguish from blue by day and black at night and his rich brown hair which he could not consent to part with even on the promise of a new and modish peruke from his adoptive father fell in thick glossy ringlets upon his shoulders whereas jacks close black crop imparted the peculiar bulletshape we have noticed to his head while thames modestly expressed a hope that he might not belie the carpenters favourable prediction jack sheppard thought fit to mount a small ladder placed against the wall and springing with the agility of an ape upon a sort of frame contrived to sustain short spars and blocks of timber began to search about for a piece of wood required in the work on which he was engaged being in a great hurry he took little heed where he set his feet and a board giving way he must have fallen if he had not grasped a large plank laid upon the transverse beam immediately over his head take care jack shouted thames who witnessed the occurrence that plank isnt properly balanced youll have it down but the caution came too late sheppards weight had destroyed the equilibrium of the plank it swerved and slowly descended losing his presence of mind jack quitted his hold and dropped upon the frame the plank hung over his head a moment more and he would have been crushed beneath the ponderous board when a slight but strong arm arrested its descent get from under it jack vociferated thames i cant hold it much longeritll break my wrist down we come he exclaimed letting go the plank which fell with a crash and leaping after sheppard who had rolled off the frame all this was the work of a minute no bones broken i hope said thames laughing at jack who limped towards the bench rubbing his shins as he went all right replied sheppard with affected indifference its a mercy you both escaped ejaculated wood only just finding his tongue i declare im all in a cold sweat how came you sir he continued addressing sheppard to venture upon that frame i always told you some accident would happen dont scold him father interposed thames hes been frightened enough already well well since you desire it ill say no more returned wood you haynt hurt your arm i trust my dear he added anxiously only sprained it a little thats all answered thames the pain will go off presently then you are hurt cried the carpenter in alarm come down stairs directly and let your mother look at your wrist she has an excellent remedy for a sprain and do you jack attend to your work and mind you dont get into further mischief hadnt jack better go with us said thames his shin may need rubbing by no means rejoined wood hastily a little suffering will do him good i meant to give him a drubbing that bruise will answer the same purpose thames said sheppard in a low voice as he threw a vindictive glance at the carpenter i shant forget this youve saved my life pshaw youd do as much for me any day and think no more about it itll be your turn to save mine next true and i shant be easy till my turn arrives i tell you what jack whispered thames who had noticed sheppards menacing glance and dreaded some further indiscretion on his part if you really wish to oblige me youll get that packingcase finished by six oclock you can do it if you will and i will if i can depend upon it answered sheppard with a laugh so saying he manfully resumed his work while wood and thames quitted the room and went down stairs chapter ii thames darrell thames darrells arm having been submitted to the scrutiny of mrs wood was pronounced by that lady to be very much sprained and she forthwith proceeded to bathe it with a reddishcoloured lotion during this operation the carpenter underwent a severe catechism as to the cause of the accident and on learning that the mischance originated with jack sheppard the indignation of his helpmate knew no bounds and she was with difficulty prevented from flying to the workshop to inflict summary punishment on the offender i knew how it would be she cried in the shrill voice peculiar to a shrew when you brought that worthless hussys worthless brat into the house i told you no good would come of it and every days experience proves that i was right but like all your overbearing sex you must have your own way youll never be guided by menever indeed my love youre entirely mistaken returned the carpenter endeavouring to deprecate his wifes rising resentment by the softest looks and the meekest deportment so far however was this submission from producing the desired effect that it seemed only to lend additional fuel to her displeasure forgetting her occupation in her anger she left off bathing darrells wrist and squeezing his arm so tightly that the boy winced with pain she clapped her right hand upon her hip and turned with flashing eyes and an inflamed countenance towards her crestfallen spouse what she exclaimed almost choked with passioni advised you to burthen yourself with that idle and goodfornothing pauper whom you ought rather to send to the workhouse than maintain at your own expense did i i advised you to take him as an apprentice and so far from getting the regular fee with him to give him a salary i advised you to feed him and clothe him and treat him like his betters to put up with his insolence and wink at his faults i counselled all this i suppose youll tell me next i dare say that i recommended you to go and visit his mother so frequently under the plea of charity to give her wine and provisions and money to remove her from the only fit quarters for such peoplethe mint and to place her in a cottage at willesden of which you must needs pay the rent marry come up charity should begin at home a discreet husband would leave the dispensation of his bounty where women are concerned to his wife and for my part if i were inclined to exercise my benevolence at all it should be in favour of some more deserving object than that whining hypocritical magdalene it was the knowledge of this feeling on your part my love that made me act without your express sanction i did all for the best im sure mrs sheppard is i know what mrs sheppard is without your information sir i havent forgotten her previous history youve your own reasons no doubt for bringing up her sonperhaps i ought rather to say your son mr wood really my love these accusations are most groundlessthis violence is most unnecessary i cant endure the odious baggage i hope i may never come near her i hope you never may my love humbly acquiesced the carpenter is my house to be made a receptacle for all your natural children sir answer me that winny said thames whose glowing cheek attested the effect produced upon him by the insinuation winny said he addressing a pretty little damsel of some twelve years of age who stood by his side holding the bottle of embrocation help me on with my coat please this is no place for me sit down my dear sit down interposed mrs wood softening her asperity what i said about natural children doesnt apply to you dont suppose she added with a scornful glance at her helpmate that i would pay him the compliment of thinking he could possibly be the father of such a boy as you mr wood lifted up his hands in mute despair owen owen pursued mrs wood sinking into a chair and fanning herself violentlywhat a fluster you have put me into with your violence to be sure and at the very time too when you know im expecting a visit from mr kneebone on his return from manchester i wouldnt have him see me in this state for the world hed never forgive you poh poh my dear mr kneebone invariably takes part with me when any trifling misunderstanding arises between us i only wish he was not a papist and a jacobite jacobite echoed mrs wood marry come up mightnt he just as reasonably complain of your being a hanoverian and a presbyterian its all matter of opinion and now my love she added with a relenting look im content to make up our quarrel but you must promise me not to go near that abandoned hussy at willesden one cant help being jealous you know even of an unworthy object glad to make peace on any terms mr wood gave the required promise though he could not help thinking that if either of them had cause to be jealous he was the party and here we may be permitted to offer an observation upon the peculiar and unaccountable influence which ladies of a shrewish turn so frequently exercise overwe can scarcely in this case saytheir lords and masters an influence which seems not merely to extend to the will of the husband but even to his inclinations we do not remember to have met with a single individual reported to be under petticoat government who was not content with his lotnay who so far from repining did not exult in his servitude and we see no way of accounting for this apparently inexplicable conductfor which among other phenomena of married life various reasons have been assigned though none entirely satisfactory to usexcept upon the ground that these domineering dames possess some charm sufficiently strong to counteract the irritating effect of their tempers some secret and attractive quality of which the world at large is in ignorance and with which their husbands alone can be supposed to be acquainted an influence of this description appeared to be exerted on the present occasion the worthy carpenter was restored to instant good humour by a glance from his helpmate and notwithstanding the infliction he had just endured he would have quarrelled with any one who had endeavoured to persuade him that he was not the happiest of men and mrs wood the best of wives women must have their wills while they live since they can make none when they die observed wood as he imprinted a kiss of reconciliation on the plump hand of his consorta sentiment to the correctness of which the party chiefly interested graciously vouchsafed her assent lest the carpenter should be taxed with too much uxoriousness it behoves us to ascertain whether the personal attractions of his helpmate would in any degree justify the devotion he displayed in the first place mrs wood had the advantage of her husband in point of years being on the sunny side of fortya period pronounced by competent judges to be the most fascinating and at the same time most critical epoch of womans existencewhereas he was on the shady side of fiftya term of life not generally conceived to have any special recommendation in female eyes in the next place she really had some pretensions to beauty accounted extremely pretty in her youth her features and person expanded as she grew older without much detriment to their original comeliness hers was beauty on a large scale no doubt but it was beauty nevertheless and the carpenter thought her eyes as bright her complexion as blooming and her figure if a little more buxom quite as captivating as when he led her to the altar some twenty years ago on the present occasion in anticipation of mr kneebones visit mrs wood was dressed with more than ordinary care and in more than ordinary finery a dovecoloured kincob gown embroidered with large trees and made very low in front displayed to the greatest possible advantage the rounded proportions of her figure while a highheeled redleather shoe did not detract from the symmetry of a very neat ankle and a very small foot a stomacher fastened by imitationdiamond buckles girded that part of her person which should have been a waist a coral necklace encircled her throat and a few black patches or mouches as they were termed served as a foil to the bloom of her cheek and chin upon a table where they had been hastily deposited on the intelligence of darrells accident lay a pair of pink kid gloves bordered with lace and an enormous fan the latter when opened represented the metamorphosis and death of actaeon from her stomacher to which it was attached by a multitude of glittering steel chains depended an immense turnipshaped watch in a pinchbeck case her hair was gathered up behind in a sort of pad according to the then prevailing mode and she wore a muslin cap and pinners with crowfoot edging a black silk furbelowed scarf covered her shoulders and over the kincob gown hung a yellow satin apron trimmed with white persian but in spite of her attractions we shall address ourselves to the younger and more interesting couple i could almost find in my heart to quarrel with jack sheppard for occasioning you so much pain observed little winifred wood as having completed her ministration to the best of her ability she helped thames on with his coat i dont think you could find in your heart to quarrel with any one winny much less with a person whom i like so much as jack sheppard my arms nearly well again and ive already told you the accident was not jacks fault so lets think no more about it its strange you should like jack so much dear thames he doesnt resemble you at all the very reason why i like him winny if he did resemble me i shouldnt care about him and whatever you may think i assure you jacks a downright goodnatured fellow goodnatured fellows are always especial favourites with boys and in applying the term to his friend thames meant to pay him a high compliment and so winifred understood him well she said in reply i may have done jack an injustice ill try to think better of him in future and if you want an additional inducement to do so i can tell you theres no onenot even his motherwhom he loves so well as you loves echoed winifred slightly colouring yes loves winny poor fellow he sometimes indulges the hope of marrying you when he grows old enough thames have i said anything to offend you oh no but if you wouldnt have me positively dislike jack sheppard youll never mention such a subject again besides she added blushing yet more deeply it isnt a proper one to talk upon well then to change it replied thames gravely suppose i should be obliged to leave you winifred looked as if she could not indulge such a supposition for a single moment surely she said after a pause you dont attach any importance to what my mother has just said she has already forgotten it but i never can forget it winny i will no longer be a burthen to those upon whom i have no claim but compassion as he said this in a low and mournful but firm voice the tears gathered thickly in winifreds dark eyelashes if you are in earnest thames she replied with a look of gentle reproach you are very foolish and if in jest very cruel my mother im sure didnt intend to hurt your feelings she loves you too well for that and ill answer for it shell never say a syllable to annoy you again thames tried to answer her but his voice failed him come i see the storm has blown over cried winifred brightening up youre mistaken winny nothing can alter my determination i shall quit this roof tomorrow the little girls countenance fell do nothing without consulting my fatheryour father thames she implored promise me that willingly and whats more i promise to abide by his decision then im quite easy cried winifred joyfully im sure he wont attempt to prevent me rejoined thames the slight smile that played upon winifreds lips seemed to say that she was not quite so sure but she made no answer in case he should consent he never will interrupted winifred in case he should i say continued thames will you promise to let jack sheppard take my place in your affections winny never replied the little damsel i can never love any one so much as you excepting your father winifred was going to say no but she checked herself and with cheeks mantling with blushes murmured i wish you wouldnt tease me about jack sheppard the foregoing conversation having been conducted throughout in a low tone and apart had not reached the ears of mr and mrs wood who were furthermore engaged in a little conjugal teteatete of their own the last observation however caught the attention of the carpenters wife whats that youre saying about jack sheppard she cried thames was just observing thames echoed mrs wood glancing angrily at her husband theres another instance of your wilfulness and want of taste who but you would have dreamed of giving the boy such a name why its the name of a river not a christian no gentleman was ever called thames and darrell is a gentleman unless the whole story of his being found in the river is a fabrication my dear you forget no mr wood i forget nothing ive an excellent memory thank god and i perfectly remember that everybody was drowned upon that occasionexcept yourself and the child my love youre beside yourself i was beside myself to take charge of your mother interposed winifred its of no use observed thames quietly but with a look that chilled the little damsels heartmy resolution is taken you at least appear to forget that mr kneebone is coming my dear ventured mr wood good gracious so i do exclaimed his amiable consort but you do agitate me so much come into the parlour winifred and dry your eyes directly or ill send you to bed mr wood i desire youll put on your best things and join us as soon as possible thames you neednt tidy yourself as youve hurt your arm mr kneebone will excuse you dear me if there isnt his knock oh im in such a fluster upon which she snatched up her fan cast a look into the glass smoothed down her scarf threw a soft expression into her features and led the way into the next room whither she was followed by her daughter and thames darrell chapter iii the jacobite mr william kneebone was a woollendraper of credit and renown whose place of business was held at the sign of the angel for in those days every shop had its sign opposite saint clements church in the strand a native of manchester he was the son of kenelm kneebone a staunch catholic and a sergeant of dragoons who lost his legs and his life while fighting for james the second at the battle of the boyne and who had little to bequeath his son except his laurels and his loyalty to the house of stuart the gallant woollendraper was now in his thirtysixth year he had a handsome jollylooking face stood six feet two in his stockings and measured more than a clothyard shaft across the shouldersathletic proportions derived from his father the dragoon and if it had not been for a taste for plotting which was continually getting him into scrapes he might have been accounted a respectable member of society of late however his plotting had assumed a more dark and dangerous complexion the times were such that with the opinions he entertained he could not remain idle the spirit of disaffection was busy throughout the kingdom it was on the eve of that memorable rebellion which broke forth two months later in scotland since the accession of george the first to the throne in the preceding year every effort had been made by the partisans of the stuarts to shake the credit of the existing government and to gain supporters to their cause disappointed in their hopes of the restoration of the fallen dynasty after the death of anne the adherents of the chevalier de saint george endeavoured by sowing the seeds of dissension far and wide to produce a general insurrection in his favour no means were neglected to accomplish this end agents were dispersed in all directionsoffers the most tempting held out to induce the wavering to join the chevaliers standard plots were hatched in the provinces where many of the old and wealthy catholic families resided whose zeal for the martyr of their religion as the chevalier was esteemed sharpened by the persecutions they themselves endured rendered them hearty and efficient allies arms horses and accoutrements were secretly purchased and distributed and it is not improbable that if the unfortunate prince in whose behalf these exertions were made and who was not deficient in courage as he proved at the battle of malplaquet had boldly placed himself at the head of his party at an earlier period he might have regained the crown of his ancestors but the indecision which had been fatal to his race was fatal to him he delayed the blow till the fortunate conjuncture was past and when at length it was struck he wanted energy to pursue his advantages but we must not anticipate the course of events at the precise period of this history the jacobite party was full of hope and confidence louis the fourteenth yet lived and expectations were therefore indulged of assistance from france the disgrace of the leaders of the late tory administration had strengthened rather than injured their cause mobs were gathered together on the slightest possible pretext and these tumultuous assemblages while committing the most outrageous excesses loudly proclaimed their hatred to the house of hanover and their determination to cut off the protestant succession the proceedings of this faction were narrowly watched by a vigilant and sagacious administration the government was not deceived indeed every opportunity was sought by the jacobites of parading their numbers as to the force of its enemies and precautionary measures were taken to defeat their designs on the very day of which we write namely the th of june bolingbroke and oxford were impeached of high treason the committee of secrecythat english council of tenwere sitting with walpole at their head and the most extraordinary discoveries were reported to be made on the same day moreover which by a curious coincidence was the birthday of the chevalier de saint george mobs were collected together in the streets and the health of that prince was publicly drunk under the title of james the third while in many country towns the bells were rung and rejoicings held as if for a reigning monarchthe cry of the populace almost universally being no king george but a stuart the adherents of the chevalier de saint george we have said were lavish in promises to their proselytes posts were offered to all who chose to accept them blank commissions signed by the prince to be filled up by the name of the person who could raise a troop for his service were liberally bestowed amongst others mr kneebone whose interest was not inconsiderable with the leaders of his faction obtained an appointment as captain in a regiment of infantry on the conditions above specified with a view to raise recruits for his corps the warlike woollendraper started for lancashire under the colour of a journey on business he was pretty successful in manchestera town which may be said to have been the headquarters of the disaffected on his return to london he found that applications had been made from a somewhat doubtful quarter by two individuals for the posts of subordinate officers in his troop mr kneebone or as he would have preferred being styled captain kneebone was not perfectly satisfied with the recommendations forwarded by the applicants but this was not a season in which to be needlessly scrupulous he resolved to judge for himself accordingly he was introduced to the two military aspirants at the cross shovels in the mint by our old acquaintance baptist kettleby the master of the mint with whom the jacobite captain had often had transactions before vouched for their being men of honour and loyalty and kneebone was so well satisfied with his representations that he at once closed the matter by administering to the applicants the oath of allegiance and fidelity to king james the third and several other oaths besides all of which those gentlemen took with as little hesitation as the sum of money afterwards tendered to make the compact binding the party then sat down to a bowl of punch and at its conclusion captain kneebone regretted that an engagement to spend the evening with mrs wood would preclude the possibility of his remaining with his new friends as long as his inclinations prompted at this piece of information the two subordinate officers were observed to exchange glances and after a little agreeable raillery on their captains gallantry they begged permission to accompany him in his visit kneebone who had drained his glass to the restoration of the house of stuart and the downfall of the house of hanover more frequently than was consistent with prudence consented and the trio set out for wych street where they arrived in the jolliest humour possible chapter iv mr kneebone and his friends mrs wood was scarcely seated before mr kneebone made his appearance to her great surprise and mortification he was not alone but brought with him a couple of friends whom he begged to introduce as mr jeremiah jackson and mr solomon smith chapmen or what in modern vulgar parlance would be termed bagmen travelling to procure orders for the house of an eminent cloth manufacturer in manchester neither the manners the looks nor the attire of these gentlemen prepossessed mrs wood in their favour accordingly on their presentation mr jeremiah jackson and mr solomon smith received something very like a rebuff luckily they were not easily discomposed two persons possessing a more comfortable stock of assurance could not be readily found imitating the example of mr kneebone who did not appear in the slightest degree disconcerted by his cool reception each sank carelessly into a chair and made himself at home in a moment both had very singular faces very odd wigs very much pulled over their brows and very large cravats very much raised above their chins besides this each had a large black patch over his right eye and a very queer twist at the left side of his mouth so that if their object had been disguise they could not have adopted better precautions mrs wood thought them both remarkably plain but mr smith decidedly the plainest of the two his complexion was as blue as a sailors jacket and though mr jackson had one of the ugliest countenances imaginable he had a very fine set of teeth that was something in his favour one peculiarity she did not fail to notice they were both dressed in every respect alike in fact mr solomon smith seemed to be mr jeremiah jacksons double he talked in the same style and pretty nearly in the same language laughed in the same manner and coughed or sneezed at the same time if mr jackson took an accurate survey of the room with his one eye mr smiths solitary orb followed in the same direction when jeremiah admired the compasses in the arms of the carpenters company over the chimneypiece or the portraits of the two eminent masters of the rule and plane william portington and john scott esquires on either side of it solomon was lost in wonder when mr jackson noticed a fine service of old blue china in an open japan closet mr smith had never seen anything like it and finally when jeremiah having bestowed upon mrs wood a very freeandeasy sort of stare winked at mr kneebone his impertinence was copied to the letter by solomon all three then burst into an immoderate fit of laughter mrs woods astonishment and displeasure momentarily increased such freedoms from such people were not to be endured her patience was waning fast still in spite of her glances and gestures mr kneebone made no effort to check the unreasonable merriment of his companions but rather seemed to encourage it so mrs wood went on fuming and the trio went on laughing for some minutes nobody knew why or wherefore until the party was increased by mr wood in his sunday habiliments and sunday buckle without stopping to inquire into the cause of their mirth or even to ask the names of his guests the worthy carpenter shook hands with the oneeyed chapmen slapped mr kneebone cordially on the shoulder and began to laugh as heartily as any of them mrs wood could stand it no longer i think youre all bewitched she cried so we are maam by your charms returned mr jackson gallantly quite captivated maam added mr smith placing his hand on his breast mr kneebone and mr wood laughed louder than ever mr wood said the lady bridling up my request may perhaps have some weight with you i desire sir youll recollect yourself mr kneebone she added with a glance at that gentleman which was meant to speak daggers will do as he pleases here the chapmen set up another boisterous peal no offence i hope my dear mrs w said mr kneebone in a conciliatory tone my friends mr jackson and mr smith may have rather odd ways with them but they have very odd ways interrupted mrs wood disdainfully our worthy friend was going to observe maam that we never fail in our devotion to the fair sex said mr jackson never maam echoed mr smith upon my conscience my dear said the hospitable carpenter i dare say mr kneebone and his friends would be glad of a little refreshment they shall have it then replied his better half rising you base ingrate she added in a whisper as she flounced past mr kneebone on her way to the door how could you bring such creatures with you especially on an occasion like this when we havent met for a fortnight couldnt help it my life returned the gentleman addressed in the same tone but you little know who those individuals are lord bless us you alarm me who are they mr kneebone assumed a mysterious air and bringing his lips close to mrs woods ear whispered secret agents from franceyou understandfriends to the causehem i seepersons of rank mr kneebone nodded noblemen mr kneebone smiled assent mercy on us well i thought their manners quite out o the common and so the invasion really is to take place after all and the chevalier de saint george is to land at the tower with fifty thousand frenchmen and the hanoverian usurpers to be beheaded and doctor sacheverels to be made a bishop and were all to beeh all in good time returned kneebone putting his finger to his lips dont let your imagination run away with you my charmer that boy he added looking at thames has his eye upon us mrs wood however was too much excited to attend to the caution o lud she cried french noblemen in disguise and so rude as i was i shall never recover it a good supper will set all to rights insinuated kneebone but be prudent my angel never fear replied the lady im prudence personified you might trust me with the chevalier himselfid never betray him but why didnt you let me know they were coming id have got something nice as it is weve only a couple of ducksand they were intended for you winny my love come with me i shall want yousorry to quit your lordworships i meani dont know what i mean she added a little confused and dropping a profound curtsey to the disguised noblemen each of whom replied by a bow worthy in her opinion of a prince of the blood at the leastbut ive a few necessary orders to give below dont mind us maam said mr jackson ha ha not in the least maam echoed mr smith ho ho how condescending thought mrs wood not proud in the least i declare well id no idea she continued pursuing her ruminations as she left the room that people of quality laughed so but its french manners i suppose chapter v hawk and buzzard mrs woods anxiety to please her distinguished guests speedily displayed itself in a very plentiful if not very dainty repast to the duckling peas and other delicacies intended for mr kneebones special consumption she added a few impromptu dishes tossed off in her best style such as lamb chops broiled kidneys fried ham and eggs and toasted cheese side by side with the cheese its neverfailing accompaniment in all seasons at the carpenters board came a tankard of swig and a toast besides these there was a warm gooseberrytart and a cold pigeon piethe latter capacious enough even allowing for its due complement of steak to contain the whole produce of a dovecot a couple of lobsters and the best part of a salmon swimming in a sea of vinegar and shaded by a forest of fennel while the cloth was laid the host and thames descended to the cellar whence they returned laden with a number of flasks of the same form and apparently destined to the same use as those depicted in hogarths delectable printthe modern midnight conversation mrs wood now reappeared with a very red face and followed by winifred took her seat at the table operations then commenced mr wood carved the ducks mr kneebone helped to the pigeonpie while thames unwired and uncorked a bottle of stout carnarvonshire ale the woollendraper was no despicable trencherman in a general way but his feats with the knife and fork were childs sport compared with those of mr smith the leg and wing of a duck were disposed of by this gentleman in a twinkling a brace of pigeons and a pound of steak followed with equal celerity and he had just begun to make a fierce assault upon the eggs and ham his appetite was perfectly gargantuan nor must it be imagined that while he thus exercised his teeth he neglected the flagon on the contrary his glass was never idle and finding it not filled quite so frequently as he desired he applied himself notwithstanding the expressive looks and muttered remonstrances of mr jackson to the swig the latter gentleman did full justice to the good things before him but he drank sparingly and was visibly annoyed by his companions intemperance as to mr kneebone what with flirting with mrs wood carving for his friends and pledging the carpenter he had his hands full at this juncture and just as a cuckooclock in the corner struck sis jack sheppard walked into the room with the packingcase under his arm i was in the right you see father observed thames smiling jack has done his task so i perceive replied wood where am i to take it to asked sheppard i told you that before rejoined wood testily you must take it to sir rowland trenchards in southampton fields and mind its for his sister lady trafford very well sir replied sheppard wet your whistle before you start jack said kneebone pouring out a glass of ale whats that youre taking to sir rowland trenchards only a box sir answered sheppard emptying the glass its an oddshaped one rejoined kneebone examining it attentively but i can guess what its for sir rowland is one of us he added winking at his companions and so was his brotherinlaw sir cecil trafford old lancashire families both strict catholics and loyal to the backbone fine woman lady trafforda little on the wane though ah youre so very particular sighed mrs wood not in the least returned kneebone slyly not in the least another glass jack thankee sir grinned sheppard off with it to the health of king james the third and confusion to his enemies hold interposed wood that is treason ill have no such toast drunk at my table its the kings birthday urged the woollen draper not my kings returned wood i quarrel with no mans political opinions but i will have my own respected eh day exclaimed mrs wood heres a pretty todo about nothing marry come up ill see whos to be obeyed drink the toast jack at your peril sirrah cried wood he was hanged that left his drink behind you know master rejoined sheppard heres king james the third and confusion to his enemies very well said the carpenter sitting down amid the laughter of the company jack cried thames in a loud voice you deserve to be hanged for a rebel as you are to your lawful king and your lawful master but since we must have toasts he added snatching up a glass listen to mine heres king george the first a long reign to him and confusion to the popish pretender and his adherents bravely done said wood with tears in his eyes thats the kinchin as was to try the dub for us aint it muttered smith to his companion as he stole a glance at jack sheppard silence returned jackson in a deep whisper and dont muddle your brains with any more of that pharaoh youll need all your strength to grab him whats the matter remarked kneebone addressing sheppard who as he caught the single but piercing eye of jackson fixed upon him started and trembled whats the matter repeated mrs wood in a sharp tone ay whats the matter boy reiterated jackson sternly did you never see two gentlemen with only a couple of peepers between them before never ill be sworn said smith taking the opportunity of filling his glass while his comrades back was turned were a natral curosity can i have a word with you master said sheppard approaching wood not a syllable answered the carpenter angrily get about your business thames cried jack beckoning to his friend but darrell averted his head mistress said the apprentice making a final appeal to mrs wood leave the room instantly sirrah rejoined the lady bouncing up and giving him a slap on the cheek that made his eyes flash fire may i be cursed muttered sheppard as he slunk away with as the woollendraper pleasantly observed a couple of boxes in charge if ever i try to be honest again take a little toasted cheese with the swig mr smith observed wood thats an incorrigible rascal he added as sheppard closed the door its only today that i discovered what asked jackson pricking up his ears dont speak ill of him behind his back father interposed thames if i were your father young gentleman returned jackson enraged at the interruption id teach you not to speak till you were spoken to thames was about to reply but a glance from wood checked him the rebuke is just said the carpenter at the same time im not sorry to find youre a friend to fair play which as you seem to know is a jewel open that bottle with a blue seal my dear gentlemen a glass of brandy will be no bad finish to our meal this proposal giving general satisfaction the bottle circulated swiftly and smith found the liquor so much to his taste that he made it pay double toll on its passage your son is a lad of spirit mr wood observed jackson in a slightlysarcastic tone hes not my son rejoined the carpenter how sir except by adoption thames darrell is my husband nicknames him thames interrupted mrs wood because he found him in the riverha ha ha ha echoed smith taking another bumper of brandy hell set the thames on fire one of these days ill warrant him thats more than youll ever do you drunken fool growled jackson in an under tone be cautious or youll spoil all suppose we send for a bowl of punch said kneebone with all my heart replied wood and turning to his daughter he gave the necessary directions in a low tone winifred accordingly left the room and a servant being despatched to the nearest tavern soon afterwards returned with a crown bowl of the ambrosian fluid the tables were then cleared bottles and glasses usurped the place of dishes and plates pipes were lighted and mr kneebone began to dispense the fragrant fluid begging mrs wood in a whisper as he filled a rummer to the brim not to forget the health of the chevalier de saint georgea proposition to which the lady immediately responded by drinking the toast aloud the chevalier shall hear of this whispered the woollendraper you dont say so replied mrs wood delighted at the idea mr kneebone assured her that he did say so and as a further proof of his sincerity squeezed her hand very warmly under the table mr smith now being more than halfseas over became very uproarious and claiming the attention of the table volunteered the following drinking song i jolly nose the bright rubies that garnish thy tip are dug from the mines of canary and to keep up their lustre i moisten my lip with hogsheads of claret and sherry ii jolly nose he who sees thee across a broad glass beholds thee in all thy perfection and to the pale snout of a temperate ass entertains the profoundest objection iii for a bigbellied glass is the palette i use and the choicest of wine is my colour and i find that my nose takes the mellowest hues the fuller i fill itthe fuller iv jolly nose there are fools who say drink hurts the sight such dullards know nothing about it t is better with wine to extinguish the light than live always in darkness without it how long may it be since that boy was found in the way mrs wood mentions inquired jackson as soon as the clatter that succeeded mr smiths melody had subsided let me see replied wood exactly twelve years ago last november why that must be about the time of the great storm rejoined jackson egad exclaimed wood youve hit the right nail on the head anyhow it was on the night of the great storm that i found him i should like to hear all particulars of the affair said jackson if it wouldnt be troubling you too much mr wood required little pressing he took a sip of punch and commenced his relation though meant to produce a totally different effect the narrative seemed to excite the risible propensities rather than the commiseration of his auditor and when mr wood wound it up by a description of the drenching he had undergone at the mint pump the other could hold out no longer but leaning back in his chair gave free scope to his merriment i beg your pardon he cried but reallyha hayou must excuse methat is so uncommonly divertingha ha do let me hear it againha ha ha upon my word rejoined wood you seem vastly entertained by my misfortunes to be sure nothing entertains me so much people always rejoice at the misfortunes of othersnever at their own the droll dogs how they must have enjoyed itha ha i dare say they did but i found it no laughing matter i can assure you and though its a long time ago i feel as sore on the subject as ever quite natural never forgive an injuryi never doha ha really mr jackson i could almost fancy we had met before your laugh reminds me ofof whose sir demanded jackson becoming suddenly grave youll not be offended i hope returned wood drily if i say that your voice your manner and above all your very extraordinary way of laughing put me strangely in mind of one of the droll dogs as you term them who helped to perpetrate the outrage ive just described whom do you mean demanded jackson i allude to an individual who has since acquired an infamous notoriety as a thieftaker but who in those days was himself the associate of thieves well sir his name jonathan wild sblood cried jackson rising i cant sit still and hear mr wild whom i believe to be as honest a gentleman as any in the kingdom calumniated fire and fury exclaimed smith getting up with the brandybottle in his grasp no man shall abuse mr wild in my presence hes the righthand of the community we could do nothing without him we repeated wood significantly every honest man sir he helps us to our own again humph ejaculated the carpenter surely observed thames laughing to one who entertains so high an opinion of jonathan wild as mr jackson appears to do it cant be very offensive to be told that hes like him i dont object to the likeness if any such exists young sir returned jackson darting an angry glance at thames indeed im rather flattered by being thought to resemble a gentleman of mr wilds figure but i cant submit to hear the wellearned reputation of my friend termed an infamous notoriety no we cant stand that hiccupped smith scarcely able to keep his legs well gentlemen rejoined wood mildly since mr wild is a friend of yours im sorry for what i said ive no doubt hes as honest as either of you enough returned jackson extending his hand and if ive expressed myself warmly im sorry for it likewise but you must allow me to observe my good sir that youre wholly in the wrong respecting my friend mr wild never was the associate of thieves never echoed smith emphatically upon my honour im satisfied with your assurance replied the carpenter drily its more than i am muttered thames i was not aware that jonathan wild was an acquaintance of yours mr jackson said kneebone whose assiduity to mrs wood had prevented him from paying much attention to the previous scene ive known him all my life replied the other the devil you have then perhaps you can tell me when he intends to put his threat into execution what threat asked jackson why of hanging the fellow who acts as his jackal one blake or blueskin i think hes called youve been misinformed sir interposed smith mr wild is incapable of such baseness bah returned the woollendraper i see you dont know him as well as you pretend jonathan is capable of anything he has hanged twelve of his associates already the moment they cease to be serviceable or become dangerous he lodges an information and the matters settled he has always plenty of evidence in reserve blueskin is booked as sure as youre sitting there mr smith hell swing after next old bailey sessions i wouldnt be in his skin for a trifle but he may peach said smith casting an oblique glance at jackson it would avail him little if he did replied kneebone jonathan does what he pleases in the courts very true chuckled jackson very true blueskins only chance would be to carry his threat into effect pursued the woollendraper aha exclaimed jackson he threatens does he more than that replied kneebone i understand he drew a knife upon jonathan in a quarrel between them lately and since then he has openly avowed his determination of cutting his masters throat on the slightest inkling of treachery but perhaps mr smith will tell you im misinformed also on that point on the contrary rejoined smith looking askance at his companion i happen to know youre in the right well sir im obliged to you said jackson i shall take care to put mr wild on his guard against an assassin and i shall put blueskin on the alert against the designs of a traitor rejoined smith in a tone that sounded like a menace in my opinion remarked kneebone it doesnt matter how soon society is rid of two such scoundrels and if blueskin dies by the rope and jonathan by the hand of violence theyll meet the fate they merit wild was formerly an agent to the jacobite party but on the offer of a bribe from the opposite faction he unhesitatingly deserted and betrayed his old employers of late he has become the instrument of walpole and does all the dirty work for the secret committee several arrests of importance have been intrusted to him but forewarned forearmed we have constantly baffled his schemesha ha jonathans a devilish clever fellow but he cant have his eyes always about him or hed have been with us this morning at the mint eh mr jackson so he would replied the latter so he would with all his cunning he may meet with his match continued kneebone laughing ive set a trap for him take care you dont fall into it yourself returned jackson with a slight sneer were i in your place said smith i should be apprehensive of wild because hes a declared enemy and were i in yours rejoined the woollendraper i should be doubly apprehensive because hes a professed friend but were neglecting the punch all this time a bumper round gentlemen success to our enterprise success to our enterprise echoed the others significantly may i ask whether you made any further inquiries into the mysterious affair about which we were speaking just now observed jackson turning to the carpenter i cant say i did replied wood somewhat reluctantly what with the confusion incident to the storm and the subsequent press of business i put it off till it was too late ive often regretted that i didnt investigate the matter however it doesnt much signify all concerned in the dark transaction must have perished are you sure of that inquired jackson as sure as one reasonably can be i saw their boat swept away and heard the roar of the fall beneath the bridge and no one who was present could doubt the result if the principal instigator of the crime whom i afterwards encountered on the platform and who was dashed into the raging flood by the shower of bricks escaped his preservation must have been indeed miraculous your own was equally so said jackson ironically what if he did escape my utmost efforts should be used to bring him to justice hum have you any reason to suppose he survived the accident inquired thames eagerly jackson smiled and put on the air of a man who knows more than he cares to tell i merely asked the question he said after he had enjoyed the boys suspense for a moment the hope that had been suddenly kindled in the youths bosom was as suddenly extinguished if i thought he lived observed wood if interrupted jackson changing his tone he does live and it has been well for you that he imagines the child was drowned who is he asked thames impatiently youre inquisitive young gentleman replied jackson coldly when youre older youll know that secrets of importance are not disclosed gratuitously your adoptive father understands mankind better id give half im worth to hang the villain and restore this boy to his rights said mr wood how do you know he has any rights to be restored to returned jackson with a grin judging from what you tell me ive no doubt hes the illegitimate offspring of some handsome but lowborn profligate in which case hell neither have name nor wealth for his inheritance the assassination as you call it was obviously the vengeance of a kinsman of the injured lady who no doubt was of good family upon her seducer the less said therefore on this point the better because as nothing is to be gained by it it would only be trouble thrown away but if you have any particular fancy for hanging the gentleman who chose to take the law into his own handsand i think your motive extremely disinterested and praiseworthywhy its just possible if you make it worth my while that your desires may be gratified i dont see how this is to be effected unless you yourself were present at the time said wood glancing suspiciously at the speaker i had no hand in the affair replied jackson bluntly but i know those who had and could bring forward evidence if you require it the best evidence would be afforded by an accomplice of the assassin rejoined thames who was greatly offended by the insinuation as to his parentage perhaps you could point out such a party mr jackson said wood significantly i could replied thames then you need no further information from me rejoined jackson sternly stay cried wood this is a most perplexing businessif you really are privy to the affair well talk of it tomorrow sir returned jackson cutting him short in the mean time with your permission ill just make a few minutes of our conversation as many as you please replied wood walking towards the chimneypiece and taking down a constables staff which hung upon a nail jackson mean time produced a pocketbook and after deliberately sharpening the point of a pencil began to write on a blank leaf while he was thus occupied thames prompted by an unaccountable feeling of curiosity took up the penknife which the other had just used and examined the haft what he there noticed occasioned a marked change in his demeanour he laid down the knife and fixed a searching and distrustful gaze upon the writer who continued his task unconscious of anything having happened there cried jackson closing the book and rising thatll do tomorrow at twelve ill be with you mr wood make up your mind as to the terms and ill engage to find the man hold exclaimed the carpenter in an authoritative voice we cant part thus thames look the door an order which was promptly obeyed now sir i must insist upon a full explanation of your mysterious hints or as i am headborough of the district i shall at once take you into custody jackson treated this menace with a loud laugh of derision what ho he cried slapping smith who had fallen asleep with the brandybottle in his grasp upon the shoulder it is time for what grumbled the latter rubbing his eyes for the caption replied jackson coolly drawing a brace of pistols from his pockets ready answered smith shaking himself and producing a similar pair of weapons in heavens name whats all this cried wood be still and youll receive no injury returned jackson were merely about to discharge our duty by apprehending a rebel captain kneebone we must trouble you to accompany us ive no intention of stirring replied the woollendraper who was thus unceremoniously disturbed and i beg youll sit down mr jackson come sir thundered the latter no trifling perhaps he added opening a warrant youll obey this mandate a warrant ejaculated kneebone starting to his feet ay sir from the secretary of state for your arrest youre charged with hightreason by those whove conspired with me no by those whove entrapped you youve long eluded our vigilance but weve caught you at last damnation exclaimed the woollendraper that i should be the dupe of such a miserable artifice its no use lamenting now captain you ought rather to be obliged to us for allowing you to pay this visit we could have secured you when you left the mint but we wished to ascertain whether mrs woods charms equalled your description wretches screamed the lady dont dare to breathe your vile insinuations against me oh mr kneebone are these your french noblemen dont upbraid me rejoined the woollendraper bring him along joe said jackson in a whisper to his comrade smith obeyed but he had scarcely advanced a step when he was felled to the ground by a blow from the powerful arm of kneebone who instantly possessing himself of a pistol levelled it at jacksons head begone or i fire he cried mr wood returned jackson with the utmost composure youre a headborough and a loyal subject of king george i call upon you to assist me in the apprehension of this person youll be answerable for his escape mr wood i command you not to stir vociferated the carpenters betterhalf recollect youll be answerable to me i declare i dont know what to do said wood burned by conflicting emotions mr kneebone you would greatly oblige me by surrendering yourself never replied the woollendraper and if that treacherous rascal by your side doesnt make himself scarce quickly ill send a bullet through his brain my death will lie at your door remarked jackson to the carpenter show me your warrant said wood almost driven to his witsend perhaps it isnt regular ask him who he is suggested thames a good idea exclaimed the carpenter may i beg to know whom ive the pleasure of adressing jackson i conclude is merely an assumed name what does it signify returned the latter angrily a great deal replied thames if you wont disclose your name i will for you you are jonathan wild further concealment is needless answered the other pulling off his wig and black patch and resuming his natural tone of voice i am jonathan wild say you so rejoined kneebone then be this your passport to eternity upon which he drew the trigger of the pistol which luckily for the individual against whom it was aimed flashed in the pan i might now send you on a similar journey replied jonathan with a bitter smile and preserving the unmoved demeanour he had maintained throughout but i prefer conveying you in the first instance to newgate the jacobite daws want a scarecrow so saying he sprang with a bound like that of a tigercat against the throat of the woollendraper and so sudden and welldirected was the assault that he completely overthrew his gigantic antagonist lend a hand with the ruffles blueskin he shouted as that personage who had just recovered from the stunning effects of the blow contrived to pick himself up look quick dn you or we shall never master him murder shrieked mrs wood at the top of her voice heres a pistol cried thames darting towards the undischarged weapon dropped by blueskin in the scuffle and pointing it at jonathan shall i shoot him yes yes put it to his ear cried mrs wood thats the surest way no no give it me vociferated wood snatching the pistol and rushing to the door against which he placed his back ill soon settle this business jonathan wild he added in a loud voice i command you to release your prisoner so i will replied jonathan who with blueskins aid had succeeded in slipping a pair of handcuffs over the woollendrapers wrists when ive mr walpoles order to that effectbut not before youll take the consequences then willingly in that case i arrest you and your confederate joseph blake alias blueskin on a charge of felony returned wood brandishing his staff resist my authority if you dare a clever device replied jonathan but it wont serve your turn let us pass sir strike the gag blueskin you shall not stir a footstep open the window thames and call for assistance stop cried jonathan who did not care to push matters too far let me have a word with you mr wood ill have no explanations whatever replied the carpenter disdainfully except before a magistrate at least state your charge it is a serious accusation it is answered wood do you recollect this key do you recollect to whom you gave it and for what purpose or shall i refresh your memory wild appeared confounded release your prisoner continued wood or the window is opened mr wood said jonathan advancing towards him and speaking in a low tone the secret of your adopted sons birth is known to me the name of his fathers murderer is also known to me i can help you to bothnay i will help you to both if you do not interfere with my plans the arrest of this person is of consequence to me do not oppose it and i will serve you thwart me and i become your mortal enemy i have but to give a hint of that boys existence in the proper quarter and his life will not be worth a days purchase dont listen to him father cried thames unconscious of what was passing there are plenty of people outside make your choice said jonathan if you dont decide quickly ill scream cried mrs wood popping her head through the window set your prisoner free returned wood take off the ruffles blueskin rejoined wild you know my fixed determination he added in a low tone as he passed the carpenter before tomorrow night that boy shall join his father so saying he unlocked the door and strode out of the room here are some letters which will let you see what a snake youve cherished in your bosom you uxorious old dotard said blueskin tossing a packet of papers to wood as he followed his leader oddsmylife whats this exclaimed the carpenter looking at the superscription of one of them why this is your writing dolly and addressed to mr kneebone my writing no such thing ejaculated the lady casting a look of alarm at the woollendraper confusion the rascal must have picked my pocket of your letters whispered kneebone whats to be done whats to be done why im undone how imprudent in you not to burn them but men are so careless theres no trusting anything to them however i must try to brazen it outgive me the letters my love she added aloud and in her most winning accents theyre some wicked forgeries excuse me madam replied the carpenter turning his back upon her and sinking into a chair thames my love bring me my spectacles my heart misgives me fool that i was to marry for beauty i ought to have remembered that a fair woman and a slashed gown always find some nail in the way chapter vi the first step towards the ladder if there is one thing on earth more lovely than another it is a fair girl of the tender age of winifred wood her beauty awakens no feeling beyond that of admiration the charm of innocence breathes around her as fragrance is diffused by the flower sanctifying her lightest thought and action and shielding her like a spell from the approach of evil beautiful is the girl of twelvewho is neither child nor woman but something between both something more exquisite than either such was the fairy creature presented to thames darrell under the following circumstances glad to escape from the scene of recrimination that ensued between his adopted parents thames seized the earliest opportunity of retiring and took his way to a small chamber in the upper part of the house where he and jack were accustomed to spend most of their leisure in the amusements or pursuits proper to their years he found the door ajar and to his surprise perceived little winifred seated at a table busily engaged in tracing some design upon a sheet of paper she did not hear his approach but continued her occupation without raising her head it was a charming sight to watch the motions of her tiny fingers as she pursued her task and though the posture she adopted was not the most favourable that might have been chosen for the display of her sylphlike figure there was something in her attitude and the glow of her countenance lighted up by the mellow radiance of the setting sun falling upon her through the panes of the little dormerwindow that seemed to the youth inexpressibly beautiful winifreds features would have been pretty for they were regular and delicately formed if they had not been slightly marked by the smallpoxa disorder that sometimes spares more than it destroys and imparts an expression to be sought for in vain in the smoothest complexion we have seen pitted cheeks which we would not exchange for dimples and a satin skin winifreds face had a thoroughly amiable look her mouth was worthy of her face with small pearlywhite teeth lips glossy rosy and pouting and the sweetest smile imaginable playing constantly about them her eyes were soft and blue arched over by dark brows and fringed by long silken lashes her hair was of the darkest brown and finest texture and when unloosed hung down to her heels she was dressed in a little white frock with a very long body and very short sleeves which looked from a certain fullness about the hips as if it was intended to be worn with a hoop her slender throat was encircled by a black riband with a small locket attached to it and upon the top of her head rested a diminutive lace cap the room in which she sat was a portion of the garret assigned as we have just stated by mr wood as a playroom to the two boys and like most boys playrooms it exhibited a total absence of order or neatness things were thrown here and there to be taken up or again cast aside as the whim arose while the brokenbacked chairs and crazy table bore the marks of many a conflict the characters of the youthful occupants of the room might be detected in every article it contained darells peculiar bent of mind was exemplified in a rusty broadsword a tall grenadiers cap a musket without lock or ramrod a belt and cartouchbox with other matters evincing a decided military taste among his books plutarchs lives and the histories of great commanders appeared to have been frequently consulted but the dust had gathered thickly upon the carpenters manual and a treatise on trigonometry and geometry beneath the shelf containing these books hung the fine old ballad of st george for england and a loyal ditty then much in vogue called true protestant gratitude or britains thanksgiving for the first of august being the day of his majestys happy accession to the throne jack sheppards library consisted of a few ragged and wellthumbed volumes abstracted from the tremendous chronicles bequeathed to the world by those froissarts and holinsheds of crimethe ordinaries of newgate his vocal collection comprised a couple of flash songs pasted against the wall entitled the thiefcatchers prophecy and the life and death of the darkmans budge while his extraordinary mechanical skill was displayed in what he termed jack had a supreme contempt for orthography a moddle of his mas jale off newgate another model of the pillory at fleet bridge and a third of the permanent gibbet at tyburn the latter specimen of his workmanship was adorned with a little scarecrow figure intended to represent a housebreaking chimneysweeper of the time described in sheppards own handwriting as jack hall ahanging we must not omit to mention that a family group from the pencil of little winifred representing mr and mrs wood in very characteristic attitudes occupied a prominent place on the walls for a few moments thames regarded the little girl through the halfopened door in silence on a sudden a change came over her countenance which up to this moment had worn a smiling and satisfied expression throwing down the pencil she snatched up a piece of indiarubber and exclaimingit isnt at all like him it isnt half handsome enough was about to efface the sketch when thames darted into the room who isnt it like he asked endeavouring to gain possession of the drawing which af the sound of his footstep she crushed between her fingers i cant tell you she replied blushing deeply and clinching her little hand as tightly as possible its a secret ill soon find it out then he returned playfully forcing the paper from her grasp dont look at it i entreat she cried but her request was unheeded thames unfolded the drawing smoothed out its creases and beheld a portrait of himself ive a good mind not to speak to you again sir cried winifred with difficulty repressing a tear of vexation youve acted unfairly i feel i have dear winny replied thames abashed at his own rudeness my conduct is inexcusable ill excuse it nevertheless returned the little damsel affectionately extending her hand to him why were you afraid to show me this picture winny asked the youth because its not like you was her answer well like or not im greatly pleased with it and must beg it from you as a memorial of what she interrupted startled by his change of manner of yourself he replied in a mournful tone i shall value it highly and will promise never to part with it winny this is the last night i shall pass beneath your fathers roof have you told him so she inquired reproachfully no but i shall before he retires to rest then you will stay she cried clapping her hands joyfully for im sure he wont part with you oh thank youthank you im so happy stop winny he answered gravely i havent promised yet but you willwont you she rejoined looking him coaxingly in the face unable to withstand this appeal thames gave the required promise addingoh winny i wish mr wood had been my father as well as yours so do i she cried for then you would have been really my brother no i dont either because well winny i dont know what i was going to say she added in some confusion only im sorry you were born a gentleman perhaps i wasnt returned thames gloomily as the remembrance of jonathan wilds foul insinuation crossed him but never mind who or what i am give me this picture ill keep it for your sake ill give you something better worth keeping she answered detaching the ornament from her neck and presenting it to him this contains a lock of my hair and may remind you sometimes of your little sister as to the picture ill keep it myself though if you do go i shall need no memorial of you id a good many things to say to you besidesbut youve put them all out of my head with this she burst into tears and sank with her face upon his shoulder thames did not try to cheer her his own heart was too full of melancholy foreboding he felt that he might soon be separatedperhaps for everfrom the fond little creature he held in his arms whom he had always regarded with the warmest fraternal affection and the thought of how much she would suffer from the separation so sensibly affected him that he could not help joining in her grief from this sorrowful state he was aroused by a loud derisive whistle followed by a still louder laugh and looking up he beheld the impudent countenance of jack sheppard immediately before him aha exclaimed jack with a roguish wink ive caught youhave i the carpenters daughter was fair and free fair and fickle and false was she she slighted the journeyman meaning me and smiled on a gallant of high degree degree degree she smiled on a gallant of high degree ha ha ha jack exclaimed thames angrily but sheppard was not to be silenced he went on with his song accompanying it with the most ridiculous grimaces when years were gone by she began to rue her love for the gentleman meaning you i slighted the journeyman fond quoth she but where is my gallant of high degree where where oh where is my gallant of high degree ho ho ho what are you doing here demanded thames oh nothing at all answered jack sneeringly though this rooms as much mine as yours for that matter but i dont desire to spoil sportnot i and if youll give me such a smack of your sweet lips miss as youve just given thames ill take myself off in less than no time the answer to this request was a smack of a very different description bestowed upon sheppards outstretched face by the little damsel as she ran out of the room odds bodikins cried jack rubbing his cheek im in luck today however id rather have a blow from the daughter than the mother i know who hits hardest i tell you what thames he added flinging himself carelessly into a chair id give my right handand thats no light offer for a carpenters prenticeif that little minx were half as fond of me as she is of you thats not likely to be the case if you go on in this way replied thames sharply why what the devil would you have had me domake myself scarce eh you should have tipped me the wink no more of this rejoined thames or we shall quarrel who cares if we do retorted sheppard with a look of defiance jack said the other sternly dont provoke me further or ill give you a thrashing two can play at that game my blood replied sheppard rising and putting himself into a posture of defence take care of yourself then rejoined thames doubling his fists and advancing towards him though my right arms stiff i can use it as youll find sheppard was no match for his opponent for though he possessed more science he was deficient in weight and strength and after a short round in which he had decidedly the worst of it a welldirected hit on the nob stretched him at full length on the floor thatll teach you to keep a civil tongue in your head for the future observed thames as he helped jack to his feet i didnt mean to give offence replied sheppard sulkily but let me tell you its not a pleasant sight to see the girl one likes in the arms of another you want another drubbing i perceive said thames frowning no i dont enoughs as good as a feast of the dainties you provide ill think no more about her save us he cried as his glance accidentally alighted on the drawing which winifred had dropped in her agitation is this her work it is answered thames do you see any likeness dont i returned jack bitterly strange he continued as if talking to himself how very like it is not so strange surely laughed thames that a picture should resemble the person for whom its intended ay but it is strange how much it resembles somebody for whom its not intended its exactly like a miniature i have in my pocket a miniature of whom that i cant say replied jack mysteriously but i half suspect of your father my father exclaimed thames in the utmost astonishment let me see it here it is returned jack producing a small picture in a case set with brilliants thames took it and beheld the portrait of a young man apparentlyjudging from his attireof high rank whose proud and patrician features certainly presented a very striking resemblance to his own youre right jack he said after a pause during which he contemplated the picture with the most fixed attention this must have been my father no doubt of it answered sheppard only compare it with winnys drawing and youll find theyre as like as two peas in a pod where did you get it inquired thames from lady traffords where i took the box surely you havent stolen it stolens an awkward word but as you perceive i brought it away with me it must be restored instantlybe the consequences what they may youre not going to betray me cried jack in alarm i am not replied thames but i insist upon your taking it back at once take it back yourself retorted jack sullenly i shall do no such thing very well replied thames about to depart stop exclaimed jack planting himself before the door do you want to get me sent across the water i want to save you from disgrace and ruin returned thames bah cried jack contemptuously nobodys disgraced and ruined unless hes found out im safe enough if you hold your tongue give me that picture or ill make you hear me said thames calmly you well know youre no match for me not at fisticuffs perhaps interrupted jack fiercely but ive my knife you darent use it try to leave the room and see whether i darent returned jack opening the blade i didnt expect this from you rejoined thames resolutely but your threats wont prevent my leaving the room when i please and as i please now will you stand aside i wont answered jack obstinately thames said not another word but marched boldly towards him and seized him by the collar leave go cried jack struggling violently and raising his hand or ill maul you for life but thames was not to be deterred from his purpose and the strife might have terminated seriously if a peacemaker had not appeared in the shape of little winifred who alarmed by the noise rushed suddenly into the room ah she screamed seeing the uplifted weapon in sheppards hand dont hurt thamesdont dear jack if you want to kill somebody kill me not him and she flung herself between them jack dropped the knife and walked sullenly aside what has caused this quarrel thames asked the little girl anxiously you answered jack abruptly no such thing rejoined thames ill tell you all about it presently but you must leave us now dear winny jack and i have something to settle between ourselves dont be afraid our quarrels quite over are you sure of that returned winifred looking uneasily at jack ay ay rejoined sheppard he may do what he pleaseshang me if he thinks properif you wish it with this assurance and at the reiterated request of thames the little girl reluctantly withdrew come come jack said thames walking up to sheppard and taking his hand have done with this i tell you once more ill say and do nothing to get you into trouble best assured of that but im resolved to see lady trafford perhaps she may tell me whose picture this is so she may returned jack brightening up its a good idea ill go with you but you must see her alone and thatll be no easy matter to manage for shes a great invalid and has generally somebody with her above all beware of sir rowland trenchard hes as savage and suspicious as the devil himself i should never have noticed the miniature at all if it hadnt been for him he was standing by rating her ladyshipwho can scarcely stir from the sofawhile i was packing up her jewels in the case and i observed that she tried to hide a small casket from him his back was no sooner turned than she slipped this casket into the box the next minute i contrived without either of em perceiving me to convey it into my own pocket i was sorry for what i did afterwards for i dont know why but poor lady with her pale face and black eyes she reminded me of my mother that alone ought to have prevented you from acting as you did jack returned thames gravely i should never have acted as i did rejoined sheppard bitterly if mrs wood hadnt struck me that blow made me a thief and if ever im brought to the gallows i shall lay my death at her door well think no more about it returned thames do better in future i will when ive had my revenge muttered jack but take my advice and keep out of sir rowlands way or youll get the poor lady into trouble as well as me never fear replied thames taking up his hat come lets be off the two boys then emerged upon the landing and were about to descend the stairs when the voices of mr and mrs wood resounded from below the storm appeared to have blown over for they were conversing in a very amicable manner with mr kneebone who was on the point of departing quite sorry my good friend there should have been any misunderstanding between us observed the woollendraper dont mention it returned wood in the conciliatory tone of one who admits he has been in the wrong your explanation is perfectly satisfactory we shall expect you tomorrow insinuated mrs wood and pray dont bring anybody with youespecially jonathan wild no fear of that laughed kneeboneoh about that boy thames darrell his safety must be looked to jonathans threats are not to be sneezed at the rascal will be at work before the morning keep your eye upon the lad and mind he doesnt stir out of your sight on any pretence whatever till i call you hear that whispered jack i do replied thames in the same tone we havent a moment to lose take care of yourself said mr wood and ill take care of thames its never a bad day that has a good ending good night god bless you upon this there was a great shaking of hands with renewed apologies and protestations of friendship on both sides after which mr kneebone took his leave and so you really suspected me murmured mrs wood reproachfully as they returned to the parlour oh you men you men once get a thing into your head and nothing will beat it out why my love rejoined her husband appearances you must allow were a little against you but since you assure me you didnt write the letters and mr kneebone assures me he didnt receive them i cant do otherwise than believe you and ive made up my mind that a husband ought to believe only half that he hears and nothing that he sees an excellent maxim replied his wife approvingly the best i ever heard you utter i must now go and look after thames observed the carpenter oh never mind him hell take no harm come with me into the parlour i cant spare you at present heigho now for it cried jack as the couple entered the room the coasts clear thames was about to follow when he felt a gentle grasp upon his arm he turned and beheld winifred where are you going she asked i shall be back presently replied thames evasively dont go i beg of you she implored youre in danger i overheard what mr kneebone said just now death and the devil what a cursed interruption cried jack impatiently if you loiter in this way old wood will catch us if you stir ill call him rejoined winifred its you jack who are persuading my brother to do wrong thames she urged the errand on which youre going cant be for any good or you wouldnt be afraid of mentioning it to my father hes coming cried jack stamping his foot with vexation another moment and itll be too late winny i must go said thames breaking from her stay dear thamesstay cried the little girl he hears me not hes gone she added as the door was opened and shut with violence something tells me i shall never see him again when her father a moment afterwards issued from the parlour to ascertain the cause of the noise he found her seated on the stairs in an agony of grief wheres thames he hastily inquired winifred pointed to the door she could not speak and jack gone too sobbed his daughter mr wood uttered something like an imprecation god forgive me for using such a word he cried in a troubled tone if i hadnt yielded to my wifes silly request this wouldnt have happened chapter vii brother and sister on the same evening in a stately chamber of a noble old mansion of elizabeths time situated in southampton fields two persons were seated one of these a lady evidently a confirmed invalid and attired in deep mourning reclined upon a sort of couch or easy chair set on wheels with her head supported by cushions and her feet resting upon a velvet footstool a crutch with a silver handle stood by her side proving the state of extreme debility to which she was reduced it was no easy matter to determine her age for though she still retained a certain youthfulness of appearance she had many marks in her countenance usually indicating the decline of life but which in her case were no doubt the result of constant and severe indisposition her complexion was wan and faded except where it was tinged by a slight hectic flush that made the want of colour more palpable her eyes were large and black but heavy and lustreless her cheeks sunken her frame emaciated her dark hair thickly scattered with gray when younger and in better health she must have been eminently lovely and there were still the remains of great beauty about her the expression however which would chiefly have interested a beholder was that of settled and profound melancholy her companion was a person of no inferior condition indeed it was apparent from the likeness between them that they were nearly related he had the same dark eyes though lighted by a fierce flame the same sallow complexion the same tall thin figure and majestic demeanour the same proud cast of features but here the resemblance stopped the expression was wholly different he looked melancholy enough it is true but his gloom appeared to be occasioned by remorse rather than sorrow no sterner head was ever beheld beneath the cowl of a monk or the bonnet of an inquisitor he seemed inexorable and inscrutable as fate itself well lady trafford he said fixing a severe look upon her you depart for lancashire tomorrow have i your final answer you have sir rowland she answered in a feeble tone but firmly you shall have the sum you require but but what madam do not misunderstand me she proceeded i give it to king jamesnot so you for the furtherance of a great and holy cause not for the prosecution of wild and unprofitable schemes sir rowland bit his lips to repress the answer that rose to them and the will he said with forced calmness do you still refuse to make one i have made one replied lady trafford how cried her brother starting rowland she rejoined you strive in vain to terrify me into compliance with your wishes nothing shall induce me to act contrary to the dictates of my conscience my will is executed and placed in safe custody in whose favour is it made he inquired sternly in favour of my son you have no son rejoined sir rowland moodily i had one answered his sister in a mournful voice and perhaps i have one still if i thought so cried the knight fiercely but this is idle he added suddenly checking himself aliva your child perished with its father and by whom were they both destroyed demanded his sister raising herself by a painful effort and regarding him with a searching glance by the avenger of his familys dishonourby your brother he replied coolly brother cried lady trafford her eye blazing with unnatural light and her cheek suffused with a crimson stain brother she cried lifting her thin fingers towards heaven as god shall judge me i was wedded to that murdered man a lie ejaculated sir rowland furiously a black and damning lie it is the truth replied his sister falling backwards upon the couch i will swear it upon the cross his name then demanded the knight tell me that and i will believe you not nownot now she returned with a shudder when i am dead you will learn it do not disquiet yourself you will not have to wait long for the information rowland she added in an altered tone i am certain i shall not live many days and if you treat me in this way you will have my death to answer for as well as the deaths of my husband and child let us part in peace we shall take an eternal farewell of each other be it so rejoined sir rowland with concentrated fury but before we do part i am resolved to know the name of your pretended husband torture shall not wrest it from me answered his sister firmly what motive have you for concealment he demanded a vow she answereda vow to my dead husband sir rowland looked at her for a moment as if he meditated some terrible reply he then arose and taking a few turns in the chamber stopped suddenly before her what has put it into your head that your son yet lives he asked i have dreamed that i shall see him before i die she rejoined dreamed echoed the knight with a ghastly smile is that all then learn from me that your hopes are visionary as their foundation unless he can arise from the bottom of the thames where he and his abhorred father lie buried you will never behold him again in this world heaven have compassion on you rowland murmured his sister crossing her hands and looking upwards you have none on me i will have none till i have forced the villains name from you he cried stamping the floor with rage rowland your violence is killing me she returned in a plaintive tone his name i sayhis name thundered the knight and he unsheathed his sword lady trafford uttered a prolonged scream and fainted when she came to herself she found that her brother had quitted the room leaving her to the care of a female attendant her first orders were to summon the rest of her servants to make immediate preparations for her departure for lancashire tonight your ladyship ventured an elderly domestic instantly hobson returned lady trafford as soon as the carriage can be brought round it shall be at the door in ten minutes has your ladyship any further commands none whatever yet stay there is one thing i wish you to do take that box and put it into the carriage yourself where is sir rowland in the library your ladyship he has given orders that no one is to disturb him but theres a person in the halla very odd sort of manwaiting to see him who wont be sent away very well lose not a moment hobson the elderly domestic bowed took up the case and retired your ladyship is far too unwell to travel remarked the female attendant assisting her to rise youll never be able to reach manchester it matters not norris replied lady trafford i would rather die on the road than be exposed to another such scene as i have just encountered dear me sympathised mrs norris i was afraid from the scream i heard that something dreadful had happened sir rowland has a terrible temper indeeda shocking temper i declare he frightens me out of my senses sir rowland is my brother resumed lady trafford coldly well thats no reason why he should treat your ladyship so shamefully im sure ah how i wish poor dear sir cecil were alive hed keep him in order lady trafford sighed deeply your ladyship has never been well since you married sir cecil rejoined mrs norris for my part i dont think you ever quite got over the accident you met with on the night of the great storm norris gasped lady trafford trembling violently mercy on us what have i said cried the attendant greatly alarmed by the agitation of her mistress do sit down your ladyship while i run for the ratifia and rosa solis it is past rejoined lady trafford recovering herself by a powerful effort but never allude to the circumstance again go and prepare for our departure in less time than hobson had mentioned the carriage was announced and lady trafford having been carried down stairs and placed within it the postboy drove off at a rapid pace for barnet chapter viii miching mallecho sir rowland meantime paced his chamber with a quick and agitated step he was ill at ease though he would not have confessed his disquietude even to himself not conceiving that his sisterfeeble as she was and yielding as she had ever shown herself to his wishes whether expressed or impliedwould depart without consulting him he was equally surprised and enraged to hear the servants busied in transporting her to the carriage his pride however would not suffer him to interfere with their proceedings much less could he bring himself to acknowledge that he had been in the wrong and entreat lady trafford to remain though he was well aware that her life might be endangered if she travelled by night but when the sound of the carriagewheels died away and he felt that she was actually gone his resolution failed him and he rang the bell violently my horses charcam he said as a servant appeared the man lingered sdeath why am i not obeyed exclaimed the knight angrily i wish to overtake lady trafford use despatch her ladyship will not travel beyond saint albans tonight sir rowland so mrs norris informed me returned charcam respectfully and theres a person without anxious for an audience whom with submission i think your honour would desire to see ah exclaimed sir rowland glancing significantly at charcam who was a confidant in his jacobite schemes is it the messenger from orchardwindham from sir william no sir rowland from mr corbet kynaston then sir john packingtons courier was here yesterday no sir rowland perhaps he is from lord derwentwater or mr forster news is expected from northumberland i cant exactly say sir rowland the gentleman didnt communicate his business to me but im sure its important charcam said this not because he knew anything about the matter but having received a couple of guineas to deliver the message he naturally enough estimated its importance by the amount of the gratuity well i will see him replied the knight after a moments pause he may be from the earl of mar but let the horses be in readiness i shall ride to st albans tonight so saying he threw himself into a chair and charcam fearful of another charge in his masters present uncertain mood disappeared the person shortly afterwards ushered into the room seemed by the imperfect lightfor the evening was advancing and the chamber darkened by heavy draperyto be a middlesized middleaged man of rather vulgar appearance but with a very shrewd aspect he was plainly attired in a ridingdress and boots of the period and wore a hanger by his side your servant sir rowland said the stranger ducking his head as he advanced your business sir returned the other stiffly the newcomer looked at charcam sir rowland waved his hand and the attendant withdrew you dont recollect me i presume premised the stranger taking a seat the knight who could ill brook this familiarity instantly arose dont disturb yourself continued the other nowise disconcerted by the rebuke i never stand upon ceremony where i know i shall be welcome we have met before indeed rejoined sir rowland haughtily perhaps you will refresh my memory as to the time and place let me see the time was the th of november the place the mint in southwark i have a good memory you perceive sir rowland the knight staggered as if struck by a mortal wound speedily recovering himself however he rejoined with forced calmness you are mistaken sir i was in lancashire at our family seat at the time you mention the stranger smiled incredulously well sir rowland he said after a brief pause during which the knight regarded him with a searching glance as if endeavouring to recall his features i will not gainsay your words you are in the right to be cautious till you know with whom you have to deal and even then you cant be too wary avow nothing believe nothing give nothing for nothing is my own motto and its a maxim of universal application or at least of universal practice i am not come here to play the part of your fatherconfessor i am come to serve you in what way sir demanded trenchard in astonishment you will learn anon you refuse me your confidence i applaud your prudence it is however needless your history your actions nay your very thoughts are better known to me than to your spiritual adviser make good your assertions cried trenchard furiously or to the proof interrupted the stranger calmly you are the son of sir montacute trenchard of ashtonhall near manchester sir montacute had three childrentwo daughters and yourself the eldest constance was lost by the carelessness of a servant during her infancy and has never since been heard of the youngest aliva is the present lady trafford i merely mention these circumstances to show the accuracy of my information if this is the extent of it sir returned the knight ironically you may spare yourself further trouble these particulars are familiar to all who have any title to the knowledge perhaps so rejoined the stranger but i have others in reserve not so generally known with your permission i will go on in my own way where i am in error you can set me rightyour father sir montacute trenchard who had been a loyal subject of king james the second and borne arms in his service on the abdication of that monarch turned his back upon the stuarts and would never afterwards recognise their claims to the crown it was said that he received an affront from james in the shape of a public reprimand which his pride could not forgive be this as it may though a catholic he died a friend to the protestant succession so far you are correct observed trenchard still this is no secret suffer me to proceed replied the stranger the opinions entertained by the old knight naturally induced him to view with displeasure the conduct of his son who warmly espoused the cause he had deserted finding remonstrances of no avail he had recourse to threats and when threats failed he adopted more decided measures ha ejaculated trenchard as yet pursued the stranger sir montacute had placed no limit to his sons expenditure he did not quarrel with rowlands profusion for his own revenues were ample but he did object to the large sums lavished by him in the service of a faction he was resolved not to support accordingly the old knight reduced his sons allowance to a third of its previous amount and upon further provocation he even went so far as to alter his will in favour of his daughter aliva who was then betrothed to her cousin sir cecil trafford proceed sir said trenchard breathing hard under these circumstances rowland did what any other sensible person would do aware of his fathers inflexibility of purpose he set his wits to work to defeat the design he contrived to break off his sisters match and this he accomplished so cleverly that he maintained the strictest friendship with sir cecil for two years he thought himself secure and secretly engaged in the jacobite schemes of the time in which also sir cecil was deeply involved he began to relax in his watchfulness over aliva about this timenamely in november while young trenchard was in lancashire and his sister in london on a visit he received a certain communication from his confidential servant davies which at once destroyed his hopes he learnt that his sister was privately marriedthe name or rank of her husband could not be ascertainedand living in retirement in an obscure dwelling in the borough where she had given birth to a son rowlands plans were quickly formed and as quickly executed accompanied by sir cecil who still continued passionately enamoured of his sister and to whom he represented that she had fallen a victim to the arts of a seducer he set off at fiery speed for the metropolis arrived there their first object was to seek out davies by whom they were conducted to the ladys retreata lone habitation situated on the outskirts of saint georges fields in southwark refused admittance they broke open the door alivas husband who passed by the name of darrell confronted them sword in hand for a few minutes he kept them at bay but urged by his wifes cries who was more anxious for the preservation of her childs life than her own he snatched up the infant and made his escape from the back of the premises rowland and his companions instantly started in pursuit leaving the lady to recover as she might they tracked the fugitive to the mint but like hounds at fault they here lost all scent of their prey meantime the lady had overtaken them but terrified by the menaces of her vindictive kinsmen she did not dare to reveal herself to her husband of whose concealment on the roof of the very house the party were searching she was aware aided by an individual who was acquainted with a secret outlet from the tenement darrell escaped before his departure he gave his assistant a glove that glove is still preserved in her endeavour to follow him aliva met with a severe fall and was conveyed away in a state of insensibility by sir cecil she was supposed to be lifeless but she survived the accident though she never regained her strength directed by the same individual who had helped darrell to steal a march upon him rowland with davies and another attendant continued the pursuit both the fugitive and his chasers embarked on the thames the elements were wrathful as their passions the storm burst upon them in its fury unmindful of the terrors of the night unscared by the danger that threatened him rowland consigned his sisters husband and his sisters child to the waves bring your story to an end sir said trenchard who had listened to the recital with mingled emotions of rage and fear i have nearly done replied the strangeras rowlands whole crew perished in the tempest and he only escaped by miracle he fancied himself free from detection and for twelve years he has been so until his long security wellnigh obliterating remembrance of the deed has bred almost a sense of innocence within his breast during this period sir montacute has been gathered to his fathers his title has descended to rowland his estates to aliva the latter has since been induced to unite herself to sir cecil on terms originating with her brother and which however strange and unprecedented were acquiesced in by the suitor sir rowland looked bewildered with surprise the marriage was never consummated continued the imperturbable stranger sir cecil is no more lady trafford supposed to be childless broken in health and spirits frail both in mind and body is not likely to make another marriage the estates must ere long revert to sir rowland are you man or fiend exclaimed trenchard staring at the stranger as he concluded his narration you are complimentary sir rowland returned the other with a grim smile if you are human rejoined trenchard with stern emphasis i insist upon knowing whence you derived your information i might refuse to answer the question sir rowland but i am not indisposed to gratify you partly from your confessor partly from other sources my confessor ejaculated the knight in the extremity of surprise has he betrayed his sacred trust he has replied the other grinning and this will be a caution to you in future how you confide a secret of consequence to a priest i should as soon think of trusting a woman tickle the ears of their reverences with any idle nonsense you please but tell them nothing you care to have repeated i was once a disciple of saint peter myself and speak from experience who are you ejaculated trenchard scarcely able to credit his senses im surprised youve not asked that question before sir rowland it would have saved me much circumlocution and you some suspense my name is wildjonathan wild and the great thieftaker indulged himself in a chuckle at the effect produced by this announcement he was accustomed to such surprises and enjoyed them sir rowland laid his hand upon his sword mr wild he said in a sarcastic tone but with great firmness a person of your wellknown sagacity must be aware that some secrets are dangerous to the possessor i am fully aware of it sir rowland replied jonathan coolly but i have nothing to fear because in the first place it will be to your advantage not to molest me and in the second i am provided against all contingencies i never hunt the human tiger without being armed my janizaries are without one of them is furnished with a packet containing the heads of the statement i have just related which if i dont return at a certain time will be laid before the proper authorities i have calculated my chances you perceive you have forgotten that you are in my power returned the knight sternly and that all your allies cannot save you from my resentment i can at least protect myself replied wild with provoking calmness i am accounted a fair shot as well as a tolerable swordsman and i will give proof of my skill in both lines should occasion require it i have had a good many desperate engagements in my time and have generally come off victorious i bear the marks of some of them about me still he continued taking off his wig and laying bare a bald skull covered with cicatrices and plates of silver this gash he added pointing to one of the larger scars was a wipe from the hanger of tom thurland whom i apprehended for the murder of mrs knap this wedge of silver pointing to another which would mend a coffeepot serves to stop up a breach made by will colthurst who robbed mr hearl on hounslowheath i secured the dog after he had wounded me this fracture was the handiwork of jack parrot otherwise called jack the grinder who broke into the palace of the bishop of norwich jack was a comical scoundrel and made a little too free with his graces best burgundy as well as his graces favourite housekeeper the bishop however to show him the danger of meddling with the church gave him a dance at tyburn for his pains not a scar but has its history the only inconvenience i feel from my shattered noddle is an incapacity to drink but thats an infirmity shared by a great many sounder heads than mine the hardest bout i ever had was with a womansally wells who was afterwards lagged for shoplifting she attacked me with a carvingknife and when i had disarmed her the jade bit off a couple of fingers from my left hand thus you see ive never hesitated and never shall hesitate to expose my life where anything is to be gained my profession has hardened me and with this he coolly readjusted his peruke what do you expect to gain from this interview mr wild demanded trenchard as if he had formed a sudden resolution ah now we come to business returned jonathan rubbing his hands gleefully these are my terms sir rowland he added taking a sheet of paper from his pocket and pushing it towards the knight trenchard glanced at the document a thousand pounds he observed gloomily is a heavy price to pay for doubtful secrecy when certain silence might be so cheaply procured you would purchase it at the price of your head replied jonathan knitting his brows sir rowland he added savagely and with somewhat of the look of a bulldog before he flies at his foe if it were my pleasure to do so i could crush you with a breath you are wholly in my power your name with the fatal epithet of dangerous attached to it stands foremost on the list of disaffected now before the secret committee i hold a warrant from mr walpole for your apprehension arrested exclaimed trenchard drawing his sword put up your blade sir rowland rejoined jonathan resuming his former calm demeanour king james the third will need it i have no intention of arresting you i have a different game to play and itll be your own fault if you dont come off the winner i offer you my assistance on certain terms the proposal is so far from being exorbitant that it should be trebled if i had not a fellowfeeling in the cause to be frank with you i have an affront to requite which can be settled at the same time and in the same way with your affair thats worth something to me for i dont mind paying for revenge after all a thousand pounds is a trifle to rid you of an upstart who may chance to deprive you of tens of thousands did i hear you aright asked trenchard with startling eagerness certainly replied jonathan with the most perfect sangfroid ill undertake to free you from the boy thats part of the bargain is he alive vociferated trenchard to be sure returned wild hes not only alive but likely for life if we dont clip the thread sir rowland caught at a chair for support and passed his hand across his brow on which the damp had gathered thickly the intelligence seems new to you i thought id been sufficiently explicit continued jonathan most persons would have guessed my meaning then it was not a dream ejaculated sir rowland in a hollow voice and as if speaking to himself i did see them on the platform of the bridgethe child and his preserver they were not struck by the fallen ruin nor whelmed in the roaring floodor if they were they escaped as i escaped god i have cheated myself into a belief that the boy perished and now my worst fears are realizedhe lives as yet returned jonathan with fearful emphasis i cannotdare not injure him rejoined trenchard with a haggard look and sinking as if paralysed into a chair jonathan laughed scornfully leave him to me he said he shant trouble you further no replied sir rowland who appeared completely prostrated i will struggle no longer with destiny too much blood has been shed already this comes of fine feelings muttered jonathan contemptuously give me your thoroughpaced villain but i shant let him off thus ill try a strong doseam i to understand that you intend to plead guilty sir rowland he added if so i may as well execute my warrant stand off sir exclaimed trenchard starting suddenly backwards i knew that would bring him to thought wild where is the boy demanded sir rowland at present under the care of his preserverone owen wood a carpenter by whom he was brought up wood exclaimed trenchardof wych street the same a boy from his shop was here a short time ago could it be him you mean no that boy was the carpenters apprentice jack sheppard ive just left your nephew at this moment charcam entered the room beg pardon sir rowland said the attendant but theres a boy from mr wood with a message for lady trafford from whom vociferated trenchard from mr wood the carpenter the same who was here just now no sir rowland a much finer boy tis he by heaven cried jonathan this is lucky sir rowland he added in a deep whisper do you agree to my terms i do answered trenchard in the same tone enough rejoined wild he shall not return have you acquainted him with lady traffords departure said the knight addressing charcam with as much composure as he could assume no sir rowland replied the attendant as you proposed to ride to saint albans tonight i thought you might choose to see him yourself besides theres something odd about the boy for though i questioned him pretty closely concerning his business he declined answering my questions and said he could only deliver his message to her ladyship i thought it better not to send him away till id mentioned the circumstance to you you did right returned trenchard where is he asked jonathan in the hall replied charcam alone not exactly sir theres another lad at the gate waiting for himthe same who was here just now that sir rowland was speaking of who fastened up the jewelcase for her ladyship a jewelcase exclaimed jonathan ah i see it all he cried with a quick glance jack sheppards fingers are limetwigs was anything missed after the lads departure sir rowland not that im aware of said the knightstay something occurs to me and he conferred apart with jonathan thats it cried wild when trenchard concluded this young fool is come to restore the articlewhatever it may bewhich lady trafford was anxious to conceal and which his companion purloined its precisely what such a simpleton would do we have him as safe as a linnet in a cage and could wring his neck round as easily oblige me by acting under my guidance in the matter sir rowland im an old hand at such things harkee he added mr whatsyourname charcam replied the attendant bowing very well mr charcoal you may bring in the boy but not a word to him of lady traffords absencemind that a robbery has been committed and your master suspects this lad as an accessory to the offence he therefore desires to interrogate him it will be necessary to secure his companion and as you say he is not in the house some caution must be used in approaching him or he may chance to take to his heels for hes a slippery little rascal when youve seized him cough thrice thusand two roughlooking gentlemen will make their appearance dont be alarmed by their manners mr charcoal theyre apt to be surly to strangers but it soon wears off the gentleman with the red beard will relieve you of your prisoner the other must call a coach as quickly as he can for whom sir inquired charcam for mehis master mr jonathan wild are you mr jonathan wild asked the attendant in great trepidation i am charcoal but dont let my name frighten you though said the thieftaker with a complacent smile all the world seems to tremble at it obey my orders and youve nothing to fear about them quickly lead the lad to suppose that hell be introduced to lady trafford you understand me charcoal the attendant did not understand him he was confounded by the presence in which he found himself but not daring to confess his want of comprehension he made a profound reverence and retired chapter ix consequences of the theft how do you mean to act sir inquired trenchard as soon as they were left alone as circumstances shall dictate sir rowland returned jonathan something is sure to arise in the course of the investigation of which i can take advantage if not ill convey him to st giless roundhouse on my own responsibility is this your notable scheme asked the knight scornfully once there proceeded wild without noticing the interruption hes as good as in his grave the constable sharples is in my pay i can remove the prisoner at any hour of the night i think fit and i will remove him you must know sir rowlandfor ive no secrets from youthat in the course of my business ive found it convenient to become the owner of a small dutch sloop by means of which i can transmit any light waresuch as gold watches rings and plate as well as occasionally a bank or goldsmiths note which has been spoken with by way of the mailyou understand meto holland or flanders and obtain a secure and ready market for them this vessel is now in the river off wapping her cargo is nearly shipped she will sail at early dawn tomorrow for rotterdam her commander rykhart van galgebrok is devoted to my interests as soon as he gets into blue water hell think no more of pitching the boy overboard than of lighting his pipe this will be safer than cutting his throat on shore ive tried the plan and found it answer the northern ocean keeps a secret better than the thames sir rowland before midnight your nephew shall be safe beneath the hatches of the zeeslang poor child muttered trenchard abstractedly the whole scene upon the river is passing before me i hear the splash in the wateri see the white object floating like a seabird on the tideit will not sink sblood exclaimed jonathan in a tone of illdisguised contempt it wont do to indulge those fancies now be seated and calm yourself i have often conjured up some frightful vision of the dead murmured the knight but i never dreamed of an interview with the living itll be over in a few minutes rejoined jonathan impatiently in fact itll be over too soon for me i like such interviews but we waste time have the goodness to affix your name to that memorandum sir rowland i require nothing you see till my share of the contract is fulfilled trenchard took up a pen its the boys deathwarrant observed jonathan with a sinister smile i cannot sign it returned trenchard damnation exclaimed wild with a snarl that displayed his glistening fangs to the farthest extremity of his mouth im not to be trifled with thus that paper must be signed or i take my departure go sir rejoined the knight haughtily ay ay ill go fast enough returned jonathan putting his hands into his pockets but not alone sir rowland at this juncture the door was flung open and charcam entered dragging in thames whom he held by the collar and who struggled in vain to free himself from the grasp imposed upon him heres one of the thieves sir rowland cried the attendant i was only just in time the young rascal had learnt from some of the womenservants that lady trafford was from home and was in the very act of making off when i got down stairs come along my newgate bird he continued shaking him with great violence jonathan gave utterance to a low whistle if things had gone smoothly he thought i should have cursed the fellows stupidity as it is im not sorry for the blunder trenchard meanwhile whose gaze was fixed upon the boy became livid as death but he moved not a muscle t is he he mentally ejaculated what do you think of your nephew sir rowland whispered jonathan who sat with his back towards thames so that his features were concealed from the youths view it would be a thousand pities wouldnt it to put so promising a lad out of the way devil exclaimed the knight fiercely give me the paper jonathan hastily picked up the pen and presented it to trenchard who attached his signature to the document if i am the devil observed wild as some folks assert and i myself am not unwilling to believe youll find that i differ from the generallyreceived notions of the archfiend and faithfully execute the commands of those who confide their souls to my custody take hence this boy then rejoined trenchard his looks unman me of what am i accused asked thames who though a good deal alarmed at first had now regained his courage of robbery replied jonathan in a thundering voice and suddenly confronting him youve charged with assisting your comrade jack sheppard to purloin certain articles of value from a jewelcase belonging to lady trafford aha he continued producing a short silver staff which he carried constantly about with him and uttering a terrible imprecation i see youre confounded down on your marrowbones sirrah confess your guilt and sir rowland may yet save you from the gallows ive nothing to confess replied thames boldly ive done no wrong are you my accuser i am replied wild have you anything to allege to the contrary only this returned thames that the charge is false and malicious and that you know it to be so is that all retorted jonathan come i must search you my youngster you shant touch me rejoined thames and suddenly bursting from charcam he threw himself at the feet of trenchard hear me sir rowland he cried i am innocent f have stolen nothing this personthis jonathan wild whom i beheld for the first time scarcely an hour ago in wych street isi know not whymy enemy he has sworn that hell take away my life bah interrupted jonathan you wont listen to this nonsense sir rowland if you are innocent boy said the knight controlling his emotion you have nothing to apprehend but what brought you here excuse me sir rowland i cannot answer that question my business is with lady trafford are you aware that i am her ladyships brother returned the knight she has no secrets from me possibly not replied thames in some confusion but i am not at liberty to speak your hesitation is not in your favour observed trenchard sternly will he consent to be searched inquired jonathan no rejoined thames i wont be treated like a common felon if i can help it you shall be treated according to your deserts then said jonathan maliciously and in spite of the boys resistance he plunged his hands into his pockets and drew forth the miniature where did you get this from asked wild greatly surprised at the result of his investigation thames returned no answer i thought as much continued jonathan but well find a way to make you open your lips presently bring in his comrade he added in a whisper to charcam ill take care of him and dont neglect my instructions this time upon which with an assurance that he would not do so the attendant departed you can of course identify this picture as lady traffords property pursued jonathan with a meaning glance as he handed it to the knight i can replied trenchard ha he exclaimed with a sudden start as his glance fell upon the portrait how came this into your possession boy why dont you answer sirrah cried wild in a savage tone and striking him with the silver staff cant you speak i dont choose replied thames sturdily and your brutality shant make me well see that replied jonathan dealing him another and more violent blow let him alone said trenchard authoritatively i have another question to propose do you know whoso portrait this is i do not replied thames repressing his tears but i believe it to be the portrait of my father indeed exclaimed the knight in astonishment is your father alive no returned thames he was assassinated while i was an infant who told you this is his portrait demanded trenchard my heart rejoined thames firmly which now tells me i am in the presence of his murderer thats me interposed jonathan a thieftaker is always a murderer in the eyes of a thief im almost sorry your suspicions are unfounded if your father in any way resembled you my youngster but i can tell you wholl have the pleasure of hanging your fathers son and thats a person not a hundred miles distant from you at this momentha ha as he said this the door was opened and charcam entered accompanied by a dwarfish shabbylooking man in a brown serge frock with coarse jewish features and a long red beard between the jew and the attendant came jack sheppard while a crowd of servants attracted by the news that the investigation of a robbery was going forward lingered at the doorway in hopes of catching something of the proceedings when jack was brought in he cast a rapid glance around him and perceiving thames in the custody of jonathan instantly divined how matters stood as he looked in this direction wild gave him a significant wink the meaning of which he was not slow to comprehend get it over quickly said trenchard in a whisper to the thieftaker jonathan nodded assent whats your name he said addressing the audacious lad who was looking about him as coolly as if nothing material was going on jack sheppard returned the boy fixing his eyes upon a portrait of the earl of mar whos that queer cove in the fullbottomed wig attend to me sirrah rejoined wild sternly do you know this picture he added with another significant look and pointing to the miniature i do replied jack carelessly thats well can you inform us whence it came i should think so state the facts then it came from lady traffords jewelbox here a murmur of amazement arose from the assemblage outside close the door commanded trenchard impatiently in my opinion sir rowland suggested jonathan youd better allow the court to remain open be it so replied the knight who saw the force of this reasoning continue the proceedings you say that the miniature was abstracted from lady traffords jewelbox said jonathan in a loud voice who took it thence thames darrell the boy at your side jack cried thames in indignant surprise but sheppard took no notice of the exclamation a loud buzz of curiosity circulated among the domestics some of whomespecially the femalesleaned forward to obtain a peep at the culprit silence vociferated charcam laying great emphasis on the last syllable were you present at the time of the robbery pursued jonathan i was answered sheppard and will swear to it i will liar ejaculated thames enough exclaimed wild triumphantly close the court mr charcoal theyve heard quite enough for my purpose he muttered as his orders were obeyed and the domestics excluded its too late to carry em before a magistrate now sir rowland so with your permission ill give em a nights lodging in saint giless roundhouse you jack sheppard have nothing to fear as youve become evidence against your accomplice tomorrow i shall carry you before justice walters wholl take your information and ive no doubt but thames darrell will be fully committed now for the cage my pretty canarybird before we start ill accommodate you with a pair of ruffles and he proceeded to handcuff his captive hear me cried thames bursting into tears i am innocent i could not have committed this robbery i have only just left wych street send for mr wood and youll find that ive spoken the truth youd better hold your peace my lad observed jonathan in a menacing tone lady trafford would not have thus condemned me cried thames away with him exclaimed sir rowland impatiently take the prisoners below nab said jonathan addressing the dwarfish jew ill join you in an instant the bearded miscreant seized jack by the waist and thames by the nape of the neck and marched off like the ogre in the fairy tale with a boy under each arm while charcam brought upt the rear chapter x mother and son they had scarcely been gone a moment when a confused noise was heard without and charcam reentered the room with a countenance of the utmost bewilderment and alarm whats the matter with the man demanded wild her ladyship faltered the attendant what of her cried the knight is she returned yes sir rowland stammered charcam the devil ejaculated jonathan heres a crossbite but thats not all your honour continued charcam mrs norris says shes dying dying echoed the knight dying sir rowland she was taken dreadfully ill on the road with spasms and short breath and swooningsworse than ever she was before and mrs norris was so frightened that she ordered the postboys to drive back as fast as they could she never expected to get her ladyship home alive my god cried trenchard stunned by the intelligence i have killed her no doubt rejoined wild with a sneer but dont let all the world know it theyre lifting her out of the carriage interposed charcam will it please your honour to send for some advice and the chaplain fly for both returned sir rowland in a tone of bitter anguish stay interposed jonathan where are the boys in the hall her ladyship will pass through it of course theres no other way then bring them into this room the first thingquick they must not meet sir rowland he added as charcam hastened to obey his instructions heaven has decreed it otherwise replied the knight dejectedly i yield to fate yield to nothing returned wild trying to reassure him above all when your designs prosper mans fate is in his own hands you are your nephews executioner or he is yours cast off this weakness the next hour makes or mars you for ever go to your sister and do not quit her till all is over leave the rest to me sir rowland moved irresolutely towards the door but recoiled before a sad spectacle this was his sister evidently in the last extremity borne in the arms of a couple of assistants and preceded by mrs norris wringing her hands and wepping the unfortunate lady was placed upon a couch at the same time charcam who seemed perfectly distracted by the recent occurrences dragged in thames leaving jack sheppard outside in the custody of the dwarfish jew hells curses muttered jonathan between his teeth that fool will ruin all take him away he added striding up to charcam let him remain interposed trenchard as you please sir rowland returned jonathan with affected indifference but im not going to hunt the deer for another to eat the venson depend on t but seeing that no notice was taken of the retort he drew a little aside and folded his arms muttering this whim will soon be over she cant last long i can pull the strings of this stiffnecked puppet as i please sir rowland meantime throw himself on his knees beside his sister and clasping her chilly fingers within his own besought her forgiveness in the most passionate terms for a few minutes she appeared scarcely sensible of his presence but after some restoratives had been administered by mrs norris she revived a little rowland she said in a faint voice i have not many minutes to live where is father spencer i must have absolution i have something that weighs heavily upon my mind sir rowlands brow darkened i have sent for him aliva he answered he will be here directly with your medical advisers they are useless she returned medicine cannot save mo now dear sister i should die happy if i could behold my child comfort yourself then aliva you shall behold him you are mocking me rowland jests are not for seasons like this i am not by heaven returned the knight solemnly leave us mrs norris and do not return till father spencer arrives your ladyship hesitated norris go said lady trafford it is my last request and her faithful attendant drowned in tears withdrew followed by the two assistants jonathan stepped behind a curtain rowland said lady trafford regarding him with a look of indescribable anxiety you have assured me that i shall behold my son where is he within this room replied the knight here shrieked lady trafford here repeated her brother but calm yourself dear sister or the interview will be too much for you i am calmquite calm rowland she answered with lips whose agitation belied her words then the story of his death was false i knew it i was sure you could not have the heart to slay a childan innocent child god forgive you may he indeed forgive me returned trenchard crossing himself devoutly but my guilt is not the less heavy because your child escaped this hand consigned him to destruction but another was stretched forth to save him the infant was rescued from a waterygrave by an honest mechanic who has since brought him up as his own son blessings upon him cried lady trafford fervently but trifle with mo no longer moments are ages now let me see my child if he is really here behold him returned trenchard taking thames who had been a mute but deeplyinterested witness of the scene by the hand and leading him towards her ah exclaimed lady trafford exerting all her strength my sight is failing me let me have more light that i may behold him yes she screamed these are his fathers features it isit is my son mother cried thames are you indeed my mother i am indeedmy own sweet boy she sobbed pressing him tenderly to her breast ohto see you thus cried thames in an agony of affliction dont weep my love replied the lady straining him still more closely to her i am happyquite happy now during this touching interview a change had come over sir rowland and he half repented of what he had done you can no longer refuse to tell me the name of this youths father aliva he said i dare not rowland she answered i cannot break my vow i will confide it to father spencer who will acquaint you with it when i am no more undraw the curtain love she added to thames that i may look at you ha exclaimed her son starting back as he obeyed her and disclosed jonathan wild be silent said jonathan in a menacing whisper what have you seen inquired lady trafford my enemy replied her son your enemy she returned imperfectly comprehending him sir rowland is your unclehe will be your guardianhe will protect you will you not brother promise said a deep voice in trenchards ear he will kill me cried thames there is a man in

moment is to be lost whispered jonathan to trenchard his lifeor yours no one shall harm you more my dear cried lady trafford your uncle must protect you it will be his interest to do so he will be dependent on you do what you please with him muttered trenchard to wild take off these chains rowland said lady trafford instantly i command you i will replied jonathan advancing and rudely seizing thames mother cried the son help what is this shrieked lady trafford raising herself on the couch and extending her hands towards him oh god would you take him from mewould you murder him his fathers nameand he is free rejoined rowland holding her arms release him firstand i will disclose it cried lady trafford on my soul i will speak then returned rowland too late shrieked the lady falling heavily backwardstoo lateoh heedless of her cries jonathan passed a handkerchief tightly over her sons mouth and forced him out of the room when he returned a moment or so afterwards he found sir rowland standing by the lifeless body of his sister his countenance was almost as white and rigid as that of the corpse by his side this is your work said the knight sternly not entirely replied jonathan calmly though i shouldnt be ashamed of it if it were after all you failed in obtaining the secret from her sir rowland women are hypocrites to the lasttrue only to themselves peace cried the knight fiercely no offence returned jonathan i was merely about to observe that i am in possession of her secret you didnt i tell you that the fugitive darrell gave me a glove but well speak of this hereafter you can purchase the information from me whenever youre so disposed i shant drive a hard bargain to the point however i came back to say that ive placed your nephew in a coach and if youll be at my lock in the old bailey an hour after midnight you shall hear the last tidings of him i will be there answered trenchard gloomily youll not forget the thousand sir rowlandshort accounts you know fear nothing you shall have your reward thankeethankee my house is the next door to the coopers arms in the old bailey opposite newgate youll find me at supper so saying he bowed and departed that man should have been an italian bravo murmured the knight sinking into a chair he has neither fear nor compunction would i could purchase his apathy as easily as i can procure his assistance soon after this mrs norris entered the room followed by father spencer on approaching the couch they found sir rowland senseless and extended over the dead body of his unfortunate sister chapter xi the mohocks jonathan wild meanwhile had quitted the house he found a coach at the door with the blinds carefully drawn up and ascertained from a tall illlooking though tawdrilydressed fellow who held his horse by the bridle and whom he addressed as quilt arnold that the two boys were safe inside in the custody of abraham mendez the dwarfish jew as soon as he had delivered his instructions to quilt who with abraham constituted his bodyguard or janizaries as he termed them jonathan mounted his steed and rode off at a gallop quilt was not long in following his example springing upon the box he told the coachman to make the best of his way to saint giless stimulated by the promise of something handsome to drink the man acquitted himself to admiration in the management of his lazy cattle crack went the whip and away floundered the heavy vehicle through the deep ruts of the illkept road or rather lane for it was little better which then led across southampton fields skirting the noble gardens of montague house now we need scarcely say the british museum the party speedily reached great russell streeta quarter described by strype in his edition of old stows famous survey as being graced with the best buildings in all bloomsbury and the best inhabited by the nobility and gentry especially the north side as having gardens behind the houses and the prospect of the pleasant fields up to hampstead and highgate insomuch that this place by physicians is esteemed the most healthful of any in london neither of the parties outside bestowed much attention upon these stately and salubriouslysituated mansions indeed as it was now not far from ten oclock and quite dark they could scarcely discern them but in spite of his general insensibility to such matters quilt could not help commenting upon the delicious perfume wafted from the numerous flowerbeds past which they were driving the coachman answered by a surly grunt and plying his whip with redoubled zeal shaped his course down dyot street traversed that part of holborn which is now called broad street and where two ancient almshouses were then standing in the middle of that great thoroughfare exactly opposite the opening of compston street and diving under a wide gateway on the left soon reached a more open space surrounded by mean habitations coachhouses and stables called kendrick yard at the further end of which saint giless roundhouse was situated no sooner did the vehicle turn the corner of this yard than quilt became aware from the tumultuous sounds that reached his ears as well as from the flashing of various lanterns at the door of the roundhouse that some disturbance was going on and apprehensive of a rescue if he drew up in the midst of the mob he thought it prudent to come to a halt accordingly he stopped the coach dismounted and hastened towards the assemblage which he was glad to find consisted chiefly of a posse of watchmen and other guardians of the night quilt who was an ardent lover of mischief could not help laughing most heartily at the rueful appearance of these personages not one of them but bore the marks of having been engaged in a recent and severe conflict quarterstaves bludgeons brownbills lanterns swords and sconces were alike shivered and to judge from the sullied state of their habiliments the claret must have been tapped pretty freely never was heard such a bawling as these unfortunate wights kept up oaths exploded like shells from a battery in full fire accompanied by threats of direst vengeance against the individuals who had maltreated them here might be seen a poor fellow whose teeth were knocked down his throat spluttering out the most tremendous menaces and gesticulating like a madman there another whose nose was partially slit vented imprecations and lamentations in the same breath on the right stood a bulky figure with a broken rattle hanging out of his greatcoat pocket who held up a lantern to his battered countenance to prove to the spectators that both his orbs of vision were darkened on the left a meagre constable had divested himself of his shirt to bind up with greater convenience a gaping cut in the arm so the mohocks have been at work i perceive remarked quilt as he drew near the group faith an you may say that returned a watchman who was wiping a ruddy stream from his brow theyve broken the paice and our pates into the bargain but shurely id know that vice he added turning his lantern towards the janizary ah quilt arnold my man is it you by the powers im glad to see you the sight o your andsome phiz

said the watchman flourishing an immense bludgeon the knob of which appeared to be loaded with lead and by saint patrick down he cumd like a bullock zounds exclaimed quilt did you kill him not quite replied terence laughing but i brought him to his senses by depriving him of em eh but im sorry you hurt his lordship terry young noblemen ought to be indulged in their frolics if they do now and then run away with a knocker paint a sign beat the watch or huff a magistrate they pay for their pastime and thats sufficient what more could any reasonable manespecially a watchmandesire besides the

he spoke the door of the roundhouse was opened and a stout man with a lantern in his hand presented himself at the threshold theres sharples cried quilt whist exclaimed terence he elevates his glim by jasus hes about to spake to us gemmen o the votch cried sharples as loudly as a wheezy cough would permit him my noble prisnerough oughthe markis o slaughterford further speech was cut short by a volley of execrations from the angry guardians of the night no mohocks no scourers cried the mob hear hear vociferated quilt his lordship desires me to sayough ough fresh groans and hisses vont you hear meough ough demanded sharples after a pause by all means rejoined quilt raise your vice and lave off coughin added terence the long and the short o the matters this then returned sharples with dignity the markis begs your acceptance o ten guineas to drink his health the hooting was instantaneously changed to cheers and his lordship furthermore requests me to state proceeded sharples in a hoarse tone that hell be responsible for the doctors bill of all such gemmen as have received broken pates or been otherwise damaged in the frayough ough hurrah shouted the mob were all damagedweve all got broken pates cried a dozen voices ay good luck to him so we have rejoined terence but weve no objection to take out the dochters bill in drink none whatever replied the mob your answer gemmen demanded sharples long life to the markis and we accept his honourable proposal responded the mob long life to the marquis reiterated terence hes an honour to ould ireland didnt i tell you how it

this way ive a couple of kinchens in yonder rattler whom i wish to place under old sharpless care be handy then rejoined terence or ill lose my share of the smart money with the assistance of terence and a linkboy who volunteered his services quilt soon removed the prisoners from the coach and leaving sheppard to the custody of abraham proceeded to drag thames towards the roundhouse not a word had been exchanged between the two boys on the road whenever jack attempted to speak he was checked by an angry growl from abraham and thames though his heart was full almost to bursting felt no inclination to break the silence his thoughts indeed were too painful for utterance and so acute were his feelings that for some time they quite overcame him but his grief was of short duration the elastic spirits of youth resumed their sway and before the coach stopped his tears had ceased to flow as to jack sheppard he appeared utterly reckless and insensible and did nothing but whistle and sing the whole way while he was dragged along in the manner just described thames looked around to ascertain if possible where he was for he did not put entire faith in jonathans threat of sending him to the roundhouse and apprehensive of something even worse than imprisonment the aspect of the place so far as he could discern through the gloom was strange to him but chancing to raise his eyes above the level of the surrounding habitations he beheld relieved against the sombre sky the tall steeple of saint giless church the precursor of the present structure which was not erected till some fifteen years later he recognised this object at once jonathan had not deceived him whats this here kinchen in for asked terence as he and quilt strode along with thames between them what for rejoined quilt evasively oh nothin particklermere curossity replied terence by the powers he added turning his lantern full upon the face of the captive hes a nice gennteellookin kiddy i must say pity hes taen to bad ways so airly you may spare me your compassion friend observed thames i am falsely detained of course rejoined quilt maliciously every thief is so if we were to wait till a prig was rightfully nabbed we might tarry till doomsday we never supposed you helped yourself to a picture set with diamondsnot we is the guvner consarned in this job asked terence in a whisper he is returned quilt significantly zounds whats that he cried as the noise of a scuffle was heard behind them the other kids given my partner the slip here take this youngster terry my legs are lighter than old nabs and committing thames to the care of the watchman he darted after the fugitive do you wish to earn a rich reward my good friend said thames to the watchman as soon as they were left alone is it by lettin you go my darlin that im to airn it inquired terence if so it wont pay youre mister wilds prisner and worse luck to it i dont ask you to liberate me urged thames but will you convey a message for me

dittonis that your name no replied the boy impatiently darrellthames darrell ill not forget it its a mighty quare un though i never yet heard of a christians as was named after the shannon or the

names are you quite shure you havent another alyas masther thames ditton darrell i tell you will you go youll be paid handsomely for your trouble i dont mind the throuble hesitated terence who was really a goodhearted fellow at the bottom and id like to sarve you if i could for you look like a gentlemans son and that goes a great way wi me but if misther wild were to find out that i thwarted his schames id not be in your skin for a trifle interrupted quilt who having secured sheppard and delivered him to abraham now approached them unawares and it shant be my fault if he dont hear of it ouns ejaculated terence in alarm would you turn snitch on your old pal quilt ay if he plays across returned quilt come along my sly shaver with all your cunning were more than a match for you but not

beggarly thieftaker and his myrmidons not i master thames ditton ill do your biddin and you misther quilt arnold may do your worst i defy you dog exclaimed quilt turning fiercely upon him do you threaten but the watchman eluded his grasp and mingling with the crowd disappeared chapter xii saint giless roundhouse saint giless roundhouse was an old detached fabric standing in an angle of kendrick yard originally built as its name imports in a cylindrical form like a modern martello tower it had undergone from time to time so many alterations that its symmetry was in a great measure destroyed bulging out more in the middle than at the two extremities it resembled an enormous cask set on its enda sort of heidelberg tun on a large scaleand this resemblance was increased by the small circular apertureit hardly deserved to be called a doorpierced like the bunghole of a barrell through the side of the structure at some distance from the ground and approached by a flight of wooden steps the prison was two stories high with a flat roof surmounted by a gilt vane fashioned like a key and possessing considerable internal accommodation it had in its day lodged some thousands of disorderly personages the windows were small and strongly grated looking in front on kendrick yard and at the back upon the spacious burialground of saint giless church lights gleamed from the lower rooms and on a nearer approach to the building the sound of revelry might be heard from within warned of the approach of the prisoners by the increased clamour sharples who was busied in distributing the marquiss donation affected to throw the remainder of the money among the crowd though in reality he kept back a couple of guineas which he slipped into his sleeve and running hastily up the steps unlocked the door he was followed more leisurely by the prisoners and during their ascent jack sheppard made a second attempt to escape by ducking suddenly down and endeavouring to pass under his conductors legs the dress of the dwarfish jew was not however favourable to this expedient jack was caught as in a trap by the pendant tails of abrahams long frock and instead of obtaining his release by his ingenuity he only got a sound thrashing sharples received them at the threshold and holding his lantern towards the prisoners to acquaint himself with their features nodded to quilt between whom and himself some secret understanding seemed to subsist and then closed and barred the door vell he growled addressing quilt you know whos here i suppose to be sure i do replied quilt my noble friend the marquis of slaughterford what of that vot o that echoed sharples peevishly everythin vot am i to do vith these young imps eh what you generally do with your prisoners mr sharples replied quilt lock em up thats easily said but suppose ive no place to lock em up in how then quilt looked a little perplexed he passed his arm under that of the constable and drew him aside vell vell growled sharples after he had listened to the others remonstrances it shall be done but its confounded inconvenient one dont often get sich a vindfal as the markis or such a customer as mr wild edged in quilt now then saint giles interposed sheppard are we to be kept here all night eh day exclaimed sharples wot newfledged bantams this one that wants to go to roost replied sheppard so stir your stumps saint giles and if you mean to lock us up use despatch comin comin returned the constable shuffling towards him comingso is midnightso is jonathan wild retorted jack with a significant look at thames have you never an outothevay corner into vich you could shtow these troublesome warmint observed abraham the guvnerll be here afore midnight darrells attention was drawn to the latter part of this speech by a slight pressure on his foot and turning at the touch he perceived sheppards glance fixed meaningly upon him stow it nab exclaimed quilt angrily the kinchens awake awaketo be sure i am my flash cove replied sheppard im down as a hammer ive just bethought me of a crib asll serve their turn interposed sharples at any rate theyll be out o the vay and as safe as two chicks in a coop lead the way to it then saint giles said jack in a tone of mock authority the place in which they stood was a small entrancechamber cut off like the segment of a circle from the main apartment of which it is needless to say it originally constituted a portion by a stout wooden partition a door led to the inner room and it was evident from the peals of merriment and other noises that ever and anon resounded from within that this chamber was occupied by the marquis and his friends against the walls hung an assortment of staves brownbills weapons then borne by the watch muskets handcuffs greatcoats and lanterns in one angle of the room stood a disused fireplace with a rusty grate and broken chimneypiece in the other there was a sort of box contrived between the wall and the boards that looked like an apology for a cupboard towards this box sharples directed his steps and unlocking a hatch in the door disclosed a recess scarcely as large and certainly not as clean as a dogkennel vill this do demanded the constable taking the candle from the lantern the better to display the narrow limits of the hole i call this ere crib the littleease arter the runaway prentices cells in guildhall i have squeezed three kids into it afore now to be sure he added lowering his tone they wos little uns and one on em was smotheredough oughhow this cough chokes me sheppard meanwhile whose hands were at liberty managed to possess himself unperceived of the spike of a halbert which was lying apart from the pole upon a bench near him having secured this implement he burst from his conductor and leaping into the hatch as clowns generally spring into the clockfaces when in pursuit of harlequin in the pantomimethat is back foremostbroke into a fit of loud and derisive laughter kicking his heels merrily all the time against the boards his mirth however received an unpleasant check for abraham greatly incensed by his previous conduct caught him by the legs and pushed him with such violence into the hole that the point of the spike which he had placed in his pocket found its way through his clothes to the flesh inflicting a slight but painful wound jack who had something of the spartan in his composition endured his martyrdom without flinching and carried his stoical indifference so far as even to make a mocking grimace in sharpless face while that amiable functionary thrust thames into the recess beside him how go you like your quarters saucebox asked sharples in a jeering tone better than your company saint giles replied sheppard so shut the door and make yourself scarce that boyll never rest till he finds his vay to bridewell observed sharples or the street returned jack mind my words the prisons not built that can keep me well see that young hempseed replied sharples shutting the hatch furiously in his face and locking it if you get out o that cage ill forgive you now come along gemmen and ill show you some precious sport the two janizaries followed him as far as the entrance to the inner room when abraham raising his finger to his lips and glancing significantly in the direction of the boys to explain his intention to his companions closed the door after them and stole softly back again planting himself near the recess for a few minutes all was silent at length jack sheppard observedthe coasts clear theyre gone into the next room darrell returned no answer dont be angry with me thames continued sheppard in a tone calculated as he thought to appease his companions indignation i did all for the best as ill explain i wont reproach you jack said the other sternly ive done with you not quite i hope rejoined sheppard at all events ive not done with you if you owe your confinement to me you shall owe your liberation to me also id rather lie here for ever than be indebted to you for my freedom returned thames ive done nothing to offend you persisted jack nothing echoed the other scornfully youve perjured yourself thats my own concern rejoined sheppard an oath weighs little with me compared with your safety no more of this interrupted thames you make the matter worse by these excuses quarrel with me as much as you please thames but hear me returned sheppard i took the course i pursued to serve you tush cried thames you accused me to skreen yourself on my soul thames you wrong me replied jack passionately id lay down my life for yours and you expect me to believe you after what has passed i do and more than that i expect you to thank me for procuring my imprisonment for saving your life how listen to me thames youre in a more serious scrape than you imagine i overheard jonathan wilds instructions to quilt arnold and though he spoke in slang and in an under tone my quick ears and acquaintance with the thieves lingo enabled me to make out every word he uttered jonathan is in league with sir rowland to make away with you you are brought here that their designs may be carried into effect with greater security before morning unless we can effect an escape youll be kidnapped or murdered and your disappearance attributed to the negligence of the constable are you sure of this asked thames who though as brave a lad as need be could not repress a shudder at the intelligence certain the moment i entered the room and found you a prisoner in the hands of jonathan wild i guessed how matters stood and acted accordingly things havent gone quite as smoothly as i anticipated but they might have been worse i can save you and will but say were friends youre not deceiving me said thames doubtfully i am not by heaven replied sheppard firmly dont swear jack or i shall distrust you i cant give you my hand but you may take it thank you thank you faltered jack in a voice full of emotion ill soon free you from these bracelets you neednt trouble yourself replied thames mr wood will be here presently mr wood exclaimed jack in surprise how have you managed to communicate with him abraham who had listened attentively to the foregoing conversationnot a word of which escaped himnow drew in his breath and brought his ear closer to the boards by means of the watchman who had the charge of me replied thames curse him muttered abraham hist exclaimed jack i thought i heard a noise speak lower somebody may be on the watchperhaps that old gingerhackled jew i dont care if he is rejoined thames boldly hell learn that his plans will be defeated he may learn how to defeat yours replied jack so he may rejoined abraham aloud so he may death and fiends exclaimed jack the old thief is there i knew it youve betrayed yourself thames vot o that chuckled abraham you can shave him you know i can rejoined jack and you too old aaron if id a razor how soon do you expect mishter vudd inquired the janizary tauntingly whats that to you retorted jack surlily because i shouldnt like to be out o the vay ven he arrives returned abraham in a jeering tone it vouldnt be vell bred vouldnt it replied jack mimicking his snuffling voice then shtay vere you are and be cursed to you its all up muttered thames mr wood will be intercepted ive destroyed my only chance not your only chance thames returned jack in the same undertone but your best never mind well turn the tables upon em yet do you think we could manage that old clothesman between us if we got out of this box id manage him myself if my arms were free replied thames boldly shpeak up vill you cried abraham rapping his knuckles against the hatch i likes to hear vot you says you can have no shecrets from me vy dont you talk to your partner or saint giles if you vant conversation aaron asked jack slyly because theyre in the next room and the doors shut thats vy my jackadandy replied abraham unsuspiciously oh they areare they muttered jack triumphantly thatll do now for it thames make as great a row as you can to divert his attention with this he drew the spike from his pocket and drowning the sound of the operation by whistling singing shuffling and other noises contrived in a few minutes to liberate his companion from the handcuffs now jack cried thames warmly grasping sheppards hand you are my friend again i freely forgive you sheppard cordially returned the pressure and cautioning thames not to let the ruffles drop or they might tell a tale began to warble the following fragment of a robber melody oh give me a chisel a knife or a file and the dubsmen shall find that ill do it in style tolderol vot the devil are you about noisy inquired abraham practising singing aaron replied jack vot are you practising patience growled abraham not before its needed returned jack aloud adding in a whisper get upon my shoulders thames now youre up take this spike feel for the lock and prize it openyou dont need to be told how when its done ill push you through take care of the old clothesman and leave the rest to me when the turnkey next morning steppd into his room the sight of the hole in the wall struck him dumb the sheriffs black bracelets lay strewn on the ground but the lad that had worn em could nowhere be found tolderol as jack concluded his ditty the door flew open with a crash and thames sprang through the aperture this manoeuvre was so suddenly executed that it took abraham completely by surprise he was standing at the moment close to the hatch with his ear at the keyhole and received a severe blow in the face he staggered back a few paces and before he could recover himself thames tripped up his heels and placing the point of the spike at his throat threatened to stab him if he attempted to stir or cry out nor had jack been idle all this time clearing the recess the instant after his companion he flew to the door of the inner room and locking it took out the key the policy of this step was immediately apparent alarmed by the noise of the scuffle quilt and sharples rushed to the assistance of their comrade but they were too late the entrance was barred against them and they had the additional mortification of hearing sheppards loud laughter at their discomfiture i told you the prison wasnt built that could hold me cried jack youre not out yet you young hound rejoined quilt striving ineffectually to burst open the door but i soon shall be returned jack take these he added flinging the handcuffs against the wooden partition and wear em yourself halloo nab vociferated quilt what the devil are you about will you allow yourself to be beaten by a couple of kids not if i can help it returned abraham making a desperate effort to regain his feet by my shalvation boy he added fiercely if you dont take your hande off my peard ill sthrangle you help me jack shouted thames or i shant be able to keep the villain down stick the spike into him then returned sheppard coolly while i unbar the outlet but thames had no intention of following his friends advice contenting himself with brandishing the weapon in the jews eyes he exerted all his force to prevent him from rising while this took place while quilt thundered at the inner door and jack drew back the bolts of the outer a deep manly voice was heard chantingas if in contempt of the general uproarthe following strain with pipe and punch upon the board and smiling nymphs around us no tavern could more mirth afford than old saint giless roundhouse the roundhouse the roundhouse the jollyjolly roundhouse the jolly jolly roundhouse chorussed sheppard as the last bar yielded to his efforts hurrah come along thames were free not sho fashtnot sho fasht cried abraham struggling with thames and detaining him if you go you musht take me along vid you save yourself jack shouted thames sinking beneath the superior weight and strength of his opponent leave me to my fate never replied jack hurrying towards him and snatching the spike from thames he struck the janizary a severe blow on the head ill make sure work this time he added about to repeat the blow hold interposed thames he can do no more mischief let us be gone as you please returned jack leaping up but i feel devilishly inclined to finish him however it would only be robbing the hangman of his dues with this he was preparing to follow his friend when their egress was prevented by the sudden appearance of jonathan wild and blueskin chapter xiii the magdalene the household of the worthy carpenter it may be conceived was thrown into the utmost confusion and distress by the unaccountable disappearance of the two boys as time wore on and they did not return mr woods anxiety grew so insupportable that he seized his hat with the intention of sallying forth in search of them though he did not know whither to bend his steps when his departure was arrested by a gentle knock at the door there he is cried winifred starting up joyfully and proving by the exclamation that her thoughts were dwelling upon one subject only there he is i fear not said her father with a doubtful shake of the head thames would let himself in and jack generally finds an entrance through the backdoor or the shopwindow when he has been out at untimely hours but go and see who it is love stay ill go myself his daughter however anticipated him she flew to the door but returned the next minute looking deeply disappointed and bringing the intelligence that it was only mrs sheppard who almost screamed mrs wood jack sheppards mother answered the little girl dejectedly she has brought a basket of eggs from willesden and some flowers for you for me vociferated mrs wood in indignant surprise eggs for me you mistake child they must be for your father no im quite sure she said theyre for you replied winifred but she does want to see father i thought as much sneered mrs wood ill go to her directly said wood bustling towards the door i dare say she has called to inquire about jack i dare say no such thing interposed his better half authoritatively remain where you are sir at all events let me send her away my dear supplicated the carpenter anxious to avert the impending storm do you hear me cried the lady with increasing vehemence stir a foot at your peril but my love still remonstrated wood you know im going to look after the boys after mrs sheppard you mean sir interrupted his wife ironically dont think to deceive me by your false pretences marry come up im not so easily deluded sit down i command you winny show the person into this room ill see her myself and thats more than she bargained for ill be sworn finding it useless to struggle further mr wood sank submissively into a chair while his daughter hastened to execute her arbitrary parents commission at length i have my wish continued mrs wood regarding her husband with a glance of vindictive triumph i shall behold the shameless hussy face to face and if i find her as goodlooking as shes represented i dont know what ill do in the end but ill begin by scratching her eyes out in this temper it will naturally be imagined that mrs woods reception of the widow who at that moment was ushered into the room by winifred was not particularly kind and encouraging as she approached the carpenters wife eyed her from head to foot in the hope of finding something in her person or apparel to quarrel with but she was disappointed mrs sheppards dressextremely neat and clean but simply fashioned and of the plainest and most unpretending materialoffered nothing assailable and her demeanour was so humble and her looks so modest thatif she had been illlookingshe might possibly have escaped the shafts of malice preparing to be levelled against her but alas she was beautifuland beauty is a crime not to be forgiven by a jealous woman as the lapse of time and change of circumstances have wrought a remarkable alteration in the appearance of the poor widow it may not be improper to notice it here when first brought under consideration she was a miserable and forlorn object squalid in attire haggard in looks and emaciated in frame now she was the very reverse of all this her dress it has just been said was neatness and simplicity itself her figure though slight had all the fulness of health and her complexionstill pale but without its former sickly castcontrasted agreeably by its extreme fairness with the dark brows and darker lashes that shaded eyes which if they had lost some of their original brilliancy had gained infinitely more in the soft and chastened lustre that replaced it one marked difference between the poor outcast who oppressed by poverty and stung by shame had sought temporary relief in the stupifying draughtthat worst medicine of a mind diseasedand those of the same being freed from her vices and restored to comfort and contentment if not to happiness by a more prosperous course of events was exhibited in the mouth for the fresh and feverish hue of lip which years ago characterised this feature was now substituted a pure and wholesome bloom evincing a total change of habits and though the coarse character of the mouth remained in some degree unaltered it was so modified in expression that it could no longer be accounted a blemish in fact the whole face had undergone a transformation all its better points were improved while the less attractive ones and they were few in comparison were subdued or removed what was yet more worthy of note was that the widows countenance had an air of refinement about it of which it was utterly destitute before and which seemed to intimate that her true position in society was far above that wherein accident had placed her well mrs sheppard said the carpenter advancing to meet her and trying to look as cheerful and composed as he could what brings you to town ehnothing amiss i trust nothing whatever sir answered the widow a neighbour offered me a drive to paddington and as i havent heard of my son for some time i couldnt resist the temptation of stepping on to inquire after him and to thank you for your great goodness to us both ive brought a little gardenstuff and a few newlaid eggs for you maam she added turning to mrs wood who appeared to be collecting her energies for a terrible explosion in the hope that they may prove acceptable heres a nosegay for you my love she continued opening her basket and presenting a fragrant bunch of flowers to winifred if your mother will allow me to give it you dont touch it winny screamed mrs wood it may be poisoned im not afraid mother said the little girl smelling at the bouquet how sweet these roses are shall i put them into water put them where they came from replied mrs wood severely and go to bed but mother maynt i sit up to see whether thames returns implored winifred what can it matter to you whether he returns or not child rejoined mrs wood sharply ive spoken and my words lawwith you at least she added bestowing a cutting glance upon her husband the little girl uttered no remonstrance but replacing the flowers in the basket burst into tears and withdrew mrs sheppard who witnessed this occurrence with dismay looked timorously at wood in expectation of some hint being given as to the course she had better pursue but receiving none for the carpenter was too much agitated to attend to her she ventured to express a fear that she was intruding intruding echoed mrs wood to be sure you are i wonder how you dare show your face in this house hussy i thought you sent for me maam replied the widow humbly so i did retorted mrs wood and i did so to see how far your effrontery would carry you im sure im very sorry i hope i havent given any unintentional offence said the widow again meekly appealing to wood dont exchange glances with him under my very nose woman shrieked mrs wood ill not bear it look at me and answer me one question and mind no prevaricatingnothing but the truth will satisfy me mrs sheppard raised her eyes and fixed them upon her interrogator are you not that mans mistress demanded mrs wood with a look meant to reduce her supposed rival to the dust i am no mans mistress answered the widow crimsoning to her temples but preserving her meek deportment and humble tone thats false cried mrs wood im too well acquainted with your proceedings madam to believe that profligate women are never reclaimed he has told me sufficient of you my dear interposed wood for goodness sake i will speak screamed his wife totally disregarding the interruption i will tell this worthless creature what i know about herand what i think of her not now my lovenot now entreated wood yes now rejoined the infuriated dame perhaps i may never have another opportunity she has contrived to keep out of my sight up to this time and ive no doubt shell keep out of it altogether for the future that was my doing dearest urged the carpenter i was afraid if you saw her that some such scene as this might occur hear me madam i beseech you interposed mrs sheppard and if it please you to visit your indignation on any one let it be upon me and not on your excellent husband whose only fault is in having bestowed his charity upon so unworthy an object as myself unworthy indeed sneered mrs wood to him i owe everything continued the widow life itselfnay more than lifefor without his assistance i should have perished body and soul he has been a father to me and my child i never doubted the latter point i assure you madam observed mrs wood you have said pursued the widow that she who has once erred is irreclaimable do not believe it madam it is not so the poor wretch driven by desperation to the commission of a crime which her soul abhors is no more beyond the hope of reformation than she is without the pale of mercy i have sufferedi have sinnedi have repented and though neither peace nor innocence can be restored to my bosom though tears cannot blot out my offences nor sorrow drown my shame yet knowing that my penitence is sincere i do not despair that my transgressions may be forgiven mighty fine ejaculated mrs wood contemptuously you cannot understand me madam and it is well you cannot blest with a fond husband surrounded by every comfort you have never been assailed by the horrible temptations to which misery has exposed me you have never known what it is to want food raiment shelter you have never seen the child within your arms perishing from hunger and no relief to be obtained you have never felt the hearts of all hardened against you have never heard the jeer or curse from every lip nor endured the insult and the blow from every hand i have suffered all this i could resist the tempter now i am strong in healthin mind but thenoh madam there are momentsmoments of darkness which overshadow a whole existencein the lives of the poor houseless wretches who traverse the streets when reason is wellnigh benighted when the horrible promptings of despair can alone be listened to and when vice itself assumes the aspect of virtue pardon what i have said madam i do not desire to extenuate my guiltfar less to defend it but i would show you and such as youwho happily are exempted from trials like minehow much misery has to do with crime and i affirm to you on my own conviction that she who falls because she has not strength granted her to struggle with affliction may be reclaimedmay repent and be forgiveneven as she whose sins though many were forgiven her it gladdens me to hear you talk thus joan said wood in a voice of much emotion while his eyes filled with tears and more than repays me for all i have done for you if professions of repentance constitute a magdalene mrs sheppard is one no doubt observed mrs wood ironically but i used to think it required something more than mere words to prove that a persons character was abused very right my love said wood very sensibly remarked so it does bu i can speak to that point mrs sheppards conduct from my own personal knowledge has been unexceptionable for the last twelve years during that period she has been a model of propriety oh of course rejoined mrs wood i cant for an instant question such distinterested testimony mrs sheppard im sure will say as much for you hes a model of conjugal attachment and fidelity a pattern to his family and an example to his neighbours aint he madam he is indeed replied the widow fervently moremuch more than that hes no such thing cried mrs wood furiously hes a base deceitful tyrannical hoaryheaded libertinethats what he is but ill expose him ill proclaim his misdoings to the world and then we shall see where hell stand marry come up ill show him what an injured wife can do if all wives were of my mind and my spirit husbands would soon be taught their own insignificance but a time will come and that before long when our sex will assert its superiority and when we have got the upper hand let em try to subdue us if they can but dont suppose madam that anything i say has reference to you im speaking of virtuous womenof wives madam mistresses neither deserve consideration nor commiseration i expect no commiseration returned mrs sheppard gently nor do i need any but rather than be the cause of any further misunderstanding between you and my benefactor i will leave london and its neighbourhood for ever pray do so madam retorted mrs wood and take your son with you my son echoed the widow trembling yes your son madam if you can do any good with him its more than we can the house will be well rid of him for a more idle goodfornothing reprobate never crossed its threshold is this true sir cried mrs sheppard with an agonized look at wood i know youll not deceive me is jack what mrs wood represents him hes not exactly what i could desire him to be joan replied the carpenter reluctantly but a ragged colt sometimes makes the best horse hell mend i hope never said mrs woodhell never mend he has taken more than one step towards the gallows already thieves and pickpockets are his constant companions thieves exclaimed mrs sheppard horrorstricken jonathan wild and blueskin have got him into their hands continued mrs wood impossible exclaimed the widow wildly if you doubt my word woman replied the carpenters wife coldly ask mr wood i know youll contradict it sir said the widow looking at wood as if she dreaded to have her fears confirmedi know you will i wish i could joan returned the carpenter sadly mrs sheppard let fall her basket my son she murmured wringing her hands piteously my son the companion of thieves my son in jonathan wilds power it cannot be why not rejoined mrs wood in a taunting tone your sons father was a thief and jonathan wild unless im misinformed was his friendso its not unnatural he should show some partiality towards jack jonathan wild was my husbands bitterest enemy said mrs sheppard he first seduced him from the paths of honesty and then betrayed him to a shameful death and he has sworn to do the same thing by my son oh heavens that i should have ever indulged a hope of happiness while that terrible man lives compose yourself joan said wood all will yet be well oh nono replied mrs sheppard distractedly all cannot be well if this is true tell me sir she added with forced calmness and grasping woods arm what has jack done tell me in a word that i may know the worst i can bear anything but suspense youre agitating yourself unnecessarily joan returned wood in a soothing voice jack has been keeping bad company thats the only fault i know of thank god for that ejaculated mrs sheppard fervently then it is not too late to save him where is he sir can i see him no that you cant answered mrs wood he has gone out without leave and has taken thames darrell with him if i were mr wood when he does return id send him about his business i wouldnt keep an apprentice to set my authority at defiance mr woods reply if he intended any was cut short by a loud knocking at the door oddsmylifewhats that he cried greatly alarmed its jonathan wild come back with a troop of constables at his heels to search the house rejoined mrs wood in equal trepidation we shall all be murdered oh that mr kneebone were here to protect me if it is jonathan rejoined wood it is very well for mr kneebone hes not here hed have enough to do to protect himself without attending to you i declare im almost afraid to go to the door something im convinced has happened to the boys has jonathan wild been here today asked mrs sheppard anxiously to be sure he has returned mrs wood and blueskin too theyre only just gone mercy on us what a clatter she added as the knocking was repeated more violently than before while the carpenter irresolutely quitted the room with a strong presentiment of ill upon his mind a light quick step was heard descending the stairs and before he could call out to prevent it a man was admitted into the passage is this misther wudds my pretty miss demanded the rough voice of the irish watchman it is seplied winifred have you brought any tidings of thames darrell troth have i replied terence but bless your angilic face how did you contrive to guess that is he wellis he safeis he coming back cried the little girl disregarding the question hes in st giless roundhouse answered terence but tell mr wudd im here and have brought him a message from his unlawful son and dont be detainin me my darlin for theres not a minute to lose if the poor lads to be recused from the clutches of that thief and thieftaker o the wurld jonathan wild the carpenter upon whom no part of this hurried dialogue had been lost now made his appearance and having obtained from terence all the information which that personage could impart respecting the perilous situation of thames he declared himself ready to start to saint giless at once and ran back to the room for his hat and stick expressing his firm determination as he pocketed his constables staff with which he thought it expedient to arm himself of being direfully revenged upon the thieftaker a determination in which he was strongly encouraged by his wife terence meanwhile who had followed him did not remain silent but recapitulated his story for the benefit of mrs sheppard the poor widow was thrown into an agony of distress on learning that a robbery had been committed in which her son for she could not doubt that jack was one of the boys was implicated nor was her anxiety alleviated by mrs wood who maintained stoutly that if thames had been led to do wrong it must be through the instrumentality of his worthless companion and there youre right you may dipind marm observed terence master thames dittwhats his blessed namehas honesty written in his handsome phiz but as to his companion jack sheppard i think you call him hes a born and bred thief lord bless you marm we sees plenty on em in our purfession them young prigs is all alike i seed he was oneand a sharp un tooat a glance oh exclaimed the widow covering her face with her hands take a drop of brandy before we start watchman said wood pouring out a glass of spirit and presenting it to terence who smacked his lips as he disposed of it wont you be persuaded joan he added making a similar offer to mrs sheppard which she gratefully declined if you mean to accompany us you may need it you are very kind sir returned the widow but i require no support nothing stronger than water has passed my lips for years we may believe as much of that as we please i suppose observed the carpenters wife with a sneer mr wood she continued in an authoritative tone seeing her husband ready to depart one word before you set out if jack sheppard or his mother ever enter this house again i leave itthats all now do what you please you know my fixed determination mr wood made no reply but hastily kissing his weeping daughter and bidding her be of good cheer hurried off he was followed with equal celerity by terence and the widow traversing what remained of wych street at a rapid pace and speeding along drury lane the trio soon found themselves in kendrick yard when they came to the roundhouse terrys courage failed him such was the terror inspired by wilds vindictive character that few durst face him who had given him cause for displeasure aware that he should incur the thieftakers bitterest animosity by what he had done the watchman whose wrath against quilt arnold had evaporated during the walk thought it more prudent not to hazard a meeting with his master till the storm had in some measure blown over accordingly having given wood such directions as he thought necessary for his guidance and received a handsome gratuity in return for his services he departed it was not without considerable demur and delay on the part of sharples that the carpenter and his companion could gain admittance to the roundhouse reconnoitring them through a small grated loophole he refused to open the door till they had explained their business this wood acting upon terrys caution was most unwilling to do but finding he had no alternative he reluctantly made known his errand and the bolts were undrawn once in the constables manner appeared totally changed he was now as civil as he had just been insolent apologizing for their detention he answered the questions put to him respecting the boys by positively denying that any such prisoners had been entrusted to his charge but offered to conduct him to every cell in the building to prove the truth of his assertion he then barred and doublelocked the door took out the key a precautionary measure which with a grim smile he said he never omitted thrust it into his vest and motioning the couple to follow him led the way to the inner room as wood obeyed his foot slipped and casting his eyes upon the floor he perceived it splashed in several places with blood from the freshness of the stains which grew more frequent as they approached the adjoining chamber it was evident some violence had been recently perpetrated and the carpenters own blood froze within his veins as he thought with a thrill of horror that perhaps on this very spot not many minutes before his arrival his adopted son might have been inhumanly butchered nor was this impression removed as he stole a glance at mrs sheppard and saw from her terrified look that she had made the same alarming discovery as himself but it was now too late to turn back and nerving himself for the shock he expected to encounter he ventured after his conductor no sooner had they entered the room than sharples who waited to usher them in hastily retreated closed the door and turning the key laughed loudly at the success of his stratagem vexation at his folly in suffering himself to be thus entrapped kept wood for a short time silent when he could find words he tried by the most urgent solicitations to prevail upon the constable to let him out but threats and entreatieseven promises were ineffectual and the unlucky captive after exhausting his powers of persuasion was compelled to give up the point the room in which he was detainedthat lately occupied by the mohocks who it appeared had been allowed to departwas calculated to inspire additional apprehension and disgust strongly impregnated with the mingled odours of tobacco ale brandy and other liquors the atmosphere was almost stifling the benches running round the room though fastened to the walls by iron clamps had been forcibly wrenched off while the table which was similarly secured to the boards was upset and its contentsbottles jugs glasses and bowls were broken and scattered about in all directions everything proclaimed the mischievous propensities of the recent occupants of the chamber here lay a heap of knockers of all sizes from the huge lions head to the small brass rapper there a collection of signboards with the names and calling of the owners utterly obliterated on this side stood the instruments with which the latter piece of pleasantry had been effectednamely a bucket filled with paint and a brush on that was erected a trophy consisting of a watchmans rattle a laced hat with the crown knocked out and its place supplied by a lantern a campaign wig saturated with punch a torn steenkirk and ruffles some halfdozen staves and a broken sword as the carpenters gaze wandered over this scene of devastation his attention was drawn by mrs sheppard towards an appalling object in one corner this was the body of a man apparently lifeless and stretched upon a mattress with his head bound up in a linen cloth through which the blood had oosed near the body which it will be surmised was that of abraham mendez two ruffianly personages were seated quietly smoking and bestowing no sort of attention upon the newcomers their conversation was conducted in the flash language and though unintelligible to wood was easily comprehended by this companion who learnt to her dismay that the wounded man had received his hurt from her son whose courage and dexterity formed the present subject of their discourse from other obscure hints dropped by the speakers mrs sheppard ascertained that thames darrell had been carried offwhere she could not make outby jonathan wild and quilt arnold and that jack had been induced to accompany blueskin to the mint this intelligence which she instantly communicated to the carpenter drove him almost frantic he renewed his supplications to sharples but with no better success than heretofore and the greater part of the night was passed by him and the poor widow whose anxiety if possible exceeded his own in the most miserable state imaginable at length about three oclock as the first glimmer of dawn became visible through the barred casements of the roundhouse the rattling of bolts and chains at the outer door told that some one was admitted whoever this might be the visit seemed to have some reference to the carpenter for shortly afterwards sharples made his appearance and informed the captives they were free without waiting to have the information repeated wood rushed forth determined as soon as he could procure assistance to proceed to jonathan wilds house in the old bailey while mrs sheppard whose maternal fears drew her in another direction hurried off to the mint chapter xiv the flash ken in an incredibly short space of timefor her anxiety lent wings to her feetmrs sheppard reached the debtors garrison from a scout stationed at the northern entrance whom she addressed in the jargon of the place with which long usage had formerly rendered her familiar she ascertained that blueskin accompanied by a youth whom she knew by the description must be her son had arrived there about three hours before and had proceeded to the cross shovels this was enough for the poor widow she felt she was now near her boy and nothing doubting her ability to rescue him from his perilous situation she breathed a fervent prayer for his deliverance and bending her steps towards the tavern in question revolved within her mind as she walked along the best means of accomplishing her purpose aware of the cunning and desperate characters of the persons with whom she would have to dealaware also that she was in a quarter where no laws could be appealed to nor assistance obtained she felt the absolute necessity of caution accordingly when she arrived at the shovels with which as an old haunt in her bygone days of wretchedness she was well acquainted instead of entering the principal apartment which she saw at a glance was crowded with company of both sexes she turned into a small room on the left of the bar and as an excuse for so doing called for something to drink the drawers at the moment were too busy to attend to her and she would have seized the opportunity of examining unperceived the assemblage within through a little curtained window that overlooked the adjoining chamber if an impediment had not existed in the shape of baptist kettleby whose portly person entirely obscured the view the master of the mint in the exercise of his twofold office of governor and publican was mounted upon a chair and holding forth to his guests in a speech to which mrs sheppard was unwillingly compelled to listen gentlemen of the mint said the orator when i was first called some fifty years ago to the important office i hold there existed across the water three places of refuge for the oppressed and persecuted debtor we know it cried several voices it happened gentlemen pursued the master on a particular occasion about the time ive mentioned that the archduke of alsatia the sovereign of the savoy and the satrap of salisbury court met by accident at the cross shovels a jolly night we made of it as you may suppose for four such monarchs dont often come together well while we were smoking our pipes and quaffing our punch alsatia turns to me and says mint says he youre well off herepretty well says i youre not badly off at the friars for that matteroh yes we are says hehow so says iits all up with us says he theyve taken away our charterthey cant says ithey have says hethey cant i tell you says i in a bit of a passion its unconstitutionalunconstitutional or not says salisbury court and savoy speaking together its true we shall become a prey to the philistines and must turn honest in selfdefenceno fear o that thought ii see how itll be observed alsatia everybodyll pay his debts and only think of such a state of things as thatits not to be thought of says i thumping the table till every glass on it jingled and i know a way asll prevent itwhat is it mint asked all threewhy hang every bailiff that sets a foot in your territories and youre safe says iwell do it said they filling their glasses and looking as fierce as king georges grenadier guards heres your health mint but gentlemen though they talked so largely and looked so fiercely they did not do it they did not hang the bailiffs and where are they ay where are they echoed the company with indignant derision gentlemen returned the master solemnly it is a question easily answeredthey are nowhere had they hanged the bailiffs the bailiffs would not have hanged them we ourselves have been similarly circumstanced attacked by an infamous and unconstitutional statute passed in the reign of the late usurper william of orange for i may remark that if the right king had been upon the throne that illegal enactment would never have received the royal assentthe stuartsheaven preserve emalways siding with the debtors attacked in this outrageous manner i repeat it has been all but up with us but the vigorous resistance offered on that memorable occasion by the patriotic inhabitants of bermuda to the aggressions of arbitrary power secured and established their privileges on a firmer basis than heretofore and while their pusillanimous allies were crushed and annihilated they became more prosperous than ever gentlemen i am proud to say that i originatedthat i directed those measures i hope to see the day when not southwark alone but london itself shall become one mintwhen all men shall be debtors and none creditorswhen imprisonment for debt shall be utterly abolishedwhen highwayrobbery shall be accounted a pleasant pastime and forgery an accomplishmentwhen tyburn and its gibbets shall be overthrowncapital punishments discontinuednewgate ludgate the gatehouse and the compters razed to the groundbridewell and clerkenwell destroyedthe fleet the kings bench and the marshalsea remembered only by name but in the mean time as that day may possibly be farther off than i anticipate we are bound to make the most of the present take care of yourselves gentlemen and your governor will take care of you before i sit down i have a toast to propose which i am sure will be received as it deserves to be with enthusiasm it is the health of a strangerof mr john sheppard his father was one of my old customers and i am happy to find his son treading in his steps he couldnt be in better hands than those in which he has placed himself gentlemenmr sheppards good health and success to him baptists toast was received with loud applause and as he sat down amid the cheers of the company and a universal clatter of mugs and glasses the widows view was no longer obstructed her eye wandered quickly over that riotous and disorderly assemblage until it settled upon one group more riotous and disorderly than the rest of which her son formed the principal figure the agonized mother could scarcely repress a scream at the spectacle that met her gaze there sat jack evidently in the last stage of intoxication with his collar opened his dress disarranged a pipe in his mouth a bowl of punch and a halfemptied rummer before himthere he sat receiving and returning or rather attempting to returnfor he was almost past consciousnessthe blandishments of a couple of females one of whom had passed her arm round his neck while the other leaned over the back of his chair and appeared from her gestures to be whispering soft nonsense into his ear both these ladies possessed considerable personal attractions the younger of the two who was seated next to jack and seemed to monopolize his attention could not be more than seventeen though her person had all the maturity of twenty she had delicate oval features light laughing blue eyes a pretty nez retrousse why have we not the term since we have the best specimens of the feature teeth of pearly whiteness and a brilliant complexion set off by rich auburn hair a very white neck and shouldersthe latter perhaps a trifle too much exposed the name of this damsel was edgeworth bess and as her fascinations will not perhaps be found to be without some influence upon the future fortunes of her boyish admirer we have thought it worth while to be thus particular in describing them the other bona roba known amongst her companions as mistress poll maggot was a beauty on a much larger scalein fact a perfect amazon nevertheless though nearly six feet high and correspondingly proportioned she was a model of symmetry and boasted with the frame of a thalestris or a trulla the regular lineaments of the medicean venus a mans laced hatwhether adopted from the caprice of the moment or habitually worn we are unable to statecocked knowingly on her head harmonized with her masculine appearance mrs maggot as well as her companion edgeworth bess was showily dressed nor did either of them disdain the aid supposed to be lent to a fair skin by the contents of the patchbox on an empty cask which served him for a chair and opposite jack sheppard whose rapid progress in depravity afforded him the highest satisfaction sat blueskin encouraging the two women in their odious task and plying his victim with the glass as often as he deemed it expedient to do so by this time he had apparently accomplished all he desired for moving the bottle out of jacks reach he appropriated it entirely to his own use leaving the devoted lad to the care of the females some few of the individuals seated at the other tables seemed to take an interest in the proceedings of blueskin and his party just as a bystander watches any other game but generally speaking the company were too much occupied with their own concerns to pay attention to anything else the assemblage was for the most part if not altogether composed of persons to whom vice in all its aspects was too familiar to present much of novelty in whatever form it was exhibited nor was jack by any means the only stripling in the room not far from him was a knot of lads drinking swearing and playing at dice as eagerly and as skilfully as any of the older hands near to these hopeful youths sat a fence or receiver bargaining with a clouter or pickpocket for a suitor to speak in more intelligible language a watch and seals two cloaks commonly called watchcases and a wedgelobb otherwise known as a silver snuffbox next to the receiver was a gang of housebreakers laughing over their exploits and planning fresh depredations and next to the housebreakers came two gallantlooking gentlemen in long periwigs and ridingdresses and equipped in all other respects for the road with a roast fowl and a bottle of wine before them amid this varied throngvaried in appearance but alike in characterone object alone we have said rivetted mrs sheppards attention and no sooner did she in some degree recover from the shock occasioned by the sight of her sons debased condition than regardless of any other consideration except his instant removal from the contaminating society by which he was surrounded and utterly forgetting the more cautious plan she meant to have adopted she rushed into the room and summoned him to follow her halloa cried jack looking round and trying to fix his inebriate gaze upon the speakerwhos that your mother replied mrs sheppard come home directly sir mother be returned jack who is it bess how should i know replied edgeworth bess but if it is your mother send her about her business that i will replied jack in the twinkling of a bedpost glad to see you once more in the mint mrs sheppard roared blueskin who anticipated some fun come and sit down by me take a glass of gin maam cried poll maggot holding up a bottle of spirit it used to be your favourite liquor ive heard jack my love cried mrs sheppard disregarding the taunt come away not i replied jack im too comfortable where i am be off jack exclaimed his unhappy parent mr sheppard if you please maam interrupted the lad i allow nobody to call me jack do i bess eh nobody whatever love replied edgeworth bess nobody but me dear and me insinuated mrs maggot my little fancy mans quite as fond of me as of you bess aint you jacky darling not quite poll returned mr sheppard but i love you next to her and both of you better than her pointing with the pipe to his mother oh heavens cried mrs sheppard bravo shouted blueskin tom sheppard never said a better thing than thatho ho jack cried his mother wringing her hands in distraction youll break my heart poh poh returned her son women dont so easily break their hearts do they bess certainly not replied the young lady appealed to especially about their sons wretch cried mrs sheppard bitterly i say retorted edgeworth bess with a very unfeminine imprecation i shant stand any more of that nonsense what do you mean by calling me wretch madam she added marching up to mrs sheppard and regarding her with an insolent and threatening glance yeswhat do you mean maam added jack staggering after her come with me my love comecome cried his mother seizing his hand and endeavouring to force him away he shant go cried edgeworth bess holding him by the other hand here poll help me thus exhorted mrs maggot lent her powerful aid and between the two jack was speedily relieved from all fears of being carried off against his will not content with this exhibition of her prowess the amazon lifted him up as easily as if he had been an infant and placed him upon her shoulders to the infinite delight of the company and the increased distress of his mother now lets see wholl dare to take him down she cried nobody shall cried mr sheppard from his elevated position im my own master now and ill do as i please ill turn cracksman like my fatherrob old woodhe has chests full of money and i know where theyre keptill rob him and give the swag to you pollill jack would have said more but losing his balance he fell to the ground and when taken up he was perfectly insensible in this state he was laid upon a bench to sleep off his drunken fit while his wretched mother in spite of her passionate supplications and resistance was by blueskins command forcibly ejected from the house and driven out of the mint chapter xv the robbery in willesden church during the whole of the next day and night the poor widow hovered like a ghost about the precincts of the debtors garrisonfor admission by the masters express orders was denied her she could learn nothing of her son and only obtained one solitary piece of information which added to rather than alleviated her miserynamely that jonathan wild had paid a secret visit to the cross shovels at one time she determined to go to wych street and ask mr woods advice and assistance but the thought of the reception she was likely to meet with from his wife deterred her from executing this resolution many other expedients occurred to her but after making several ineffectual attempts to get into the mint unobserved they were all abandoned at length about an hour before dawn on the second daysundayhaving spent the early part of the night in watching at the gates of the robbers sanctuary and being almost exhausted from want of rest she set out homewards it was a long walk she had to undertake even if she had endured no previous fatigue but feeble as she was it was almost more than she could accomplish daybreak found her winding her painful way along the harrow road and in order to shorten the distance as much as possible she took the nearest cut and struck into the meadows on the right crossing several fields newly mown or filled with lines of tedded hay she arrived not without great exertion at the summit of a hill here her strength completely failed her and she was compelled to seek some repose making her couch upon a heap of hay she sank at once into a deep and refreshing slumber when she awoke the sun was high in heaven it was a bright and beautiful day so bright so beautiful that even her sad heart was cheered by it the air perfumed with the delicious fragrance of the newmown grass was vocal with the melodies of the birds the thick foliage of the trees was glistening in the sunshine all nature seemed happy and rejoicing but above all the serene sabbath stillness reigning around communicated a calm to her wounded spirit what a contrast did the lovely scene she now gazed upon present to the squalid neighbourhood she had recently quitted on all sides expanded prospects of country the most exquisite and most varied immediately beneath her lay willesdenthe most charming and secluded village in the neighbourhood of the metropoliswith its scattered farmhouses its noble granges and its old grey churchtower just peeping above a grove of rookhaunted trees towards this spot mrs sheppard now directed her steps she speedily reached her own abodea little cottage standing in the outskirts of the village the first circumstance that struck her on her arrival seemed ominous her clock had stoppedstopped at the very hour on which she had quitted the mint she had not the heart to wind it up again after partaking of some little refreshment and changing her attire mrs sheppard prepared for church by this time she had so far succeeded in calming herself that she answered the greetings of the neighbours whom she encountered on her way to the sacred edificeif sorrowfully still composedly every old country church is beautiful but willesden is the most beautiful country church we know and in mrs sheppards time it was even more beautiful than at present when the hand of improvement has proceeded a little too rashly with alterations and repairs with one or two exceptions there were no pews and as the intercourse with london was then but slight the seats were occupied almost exclusively by the villagers in one of these seats at the end of the aisle farthest removed from the chancel the widow took her place and addressed herself fervently to her devotions the service had not proceeded far when she was greatly disturbed by the entrance of a person who placed himself opposite her and sought to attract her attention by a number of little arts surveying her as he did so with a very impudent and offensive stare with this personwho was no other than mr kneeboneshe was too well acquainted having more than once been obliged to repel his advances and though his impertinence would have given her little concern at another season it now added considerably to her distraction but a far greater affliction was in store for her just as the clergyman approached the altar she perceived a boy steal quickly into the church and ensconce himself behind the woollendraper who in order to carry on his amatory pursuits with greater convenience and at the same time display his figure of which he was not a little vain to the utmost advantage preferred a standing to a sitting posture of this boy she had only caught a glimpsebut that glimpse was sufficient to satisfy her it was her sonand if she could have questioned her own instinctive love she could not question her antipathy when she beheld partly concealed by a pillar immediately in the rear of the woollendraper the dark figure and truculent features of jonathan wild as she looked in this direction the thieftaker raised his eyesthose gray bloodthirsty eyestheir glare froze the lifeblood in her veins as she averted her gaze a terrible idea crossed her why was he there why did the tempter dare to invade that sacred spot she could not answer her own questions but vague fearful suspicions passed through her mind meanwhile the service proceeded and the awful command thou shalt not steal was solemnly uttered by the preacher when mrs sheppard who had again looked round towards her son beheld a hand glance along the side of the woollendraper she could not see what occurred though she guessed it but she saw jonathans devilish triumphing glance and read in ityour son has committed a robberyherein these holy wallshe is minemine for ever she uttered a loud scream and fainted chapter xvi jonathan wilds house in the old bailey just as st sepulchres church struck one on the eventful night of the th of june to which it will not be necessary to recur a horseman mounted on a powerful charger and followed at a respectful distance by an attendant galloped into the open space fronting newgate and directed his course towards a house in the old bailey before he could draw in the rein his steedstartled apparently by some object undistinguishable by the riderswerved with such suddenness as to unseat him and precipitate him on the ground the next moment however he was picked up and set upon his feet by a person who having witnessed the accident flew across the road to his assistance youre not hurt i hope sir rowland inquired this individual not materially mr wild replied the other a little shaken thats all curses light on the horse he added seizing the bridle of his steed who continued snorting and shivering as if still under the influence of some unaccountable alarm what can ail him i know what ails him your honour rejoined the groom riding up as he spoke hes seen somethin not o this world most likely observed jonathan with a slight sneer the ghost of some highwayman who has just breathed his last in newgate no doubt may be returned the man gravely take him home saunders said sir rowland resigning his faulty steed to the attendants care i shall not require you further strange he added as the groom departed bay stuart has carried me through a hundred dangers but never played me such a trick before and never should again were he mine rejoined jonathan if the best nag ever foaled were to throw me in this unlucky spot id blow his brains out what do you mean sir asked trenchard a fall against newgate is accounted a sign of death by the halter replied wild with illdisguised malignity tush exclaimed sir rowland angrily from that door continued the thieftaker pointing to the gloomy portal of the prison opposite which they were standing the condemned are taken to tyburn its a bad omen to be thrown near that door i didnt suspect you of so much superstition mr wild observed the knight contemptuously facts convince the most incredulous answered jonathan drily ive known several cases where the ignominious doom ive mentioned has been foretold by such an accident as has just befallen you there was major priceyou must recollect him sir rowlandhe stumbled as he was getting out of his chair at that very gate well he was executed for murder then there was tom jarrot the hackneycoachman who was pitched off the box against yonder curbstone and broke his leg it was a pity he didnt break his neck for he was hanged within the year another instance was that of toby tanner no more of this interrupted trenchard where is the boy not far hence replied wild after all our pains we were near losing him sir rowland how so asked the other distrustfully you shall hear returned jonathan with the help of his comrade jack sheppard the young rascal made a bold push to get out of the roundhouse where my janizaries had lodged him and would have succeeded too if by good luckfor the devil never deserts so useful an agent as i am sir rowlandi hadnt arrived in time to prevent him as it was my oldest and trustiest setter abraham mendez received a blow on the head from one of the lads that will deprive me of his services for a week to comeif indeed it does not disable him altogether however if ive lost one servant ive gained another thats one comfort jack sheppard is now wholly in my hands what is this to me sir said trenchard cutting him short nothing whatever rejoined the thieftaker coldly but it is much to me jack sheppard is to me what thames darrell is to youan object of hatred i owed his father a grudge that i settled long ago i owe his mother one and will repay the debt with interest to her son i could make away with him at once as you are about to make away with your nephew sir rowlandbut that wouldnt serve my turn to be complete my vengeance must be tardy certain of my prey i can afford to wait for it besides revenge is sweetened by delay and i indulge too freely in the passion to rob it of any of its zest ive watched this ladthis sheppardfrom infancy and though i have apparently concerned myself little about him i have never lost sight of my purpose i have suffered him to be brought up decentlyhonestly because i would make his fall the greater and deepen the wound i meant to inflict upon his mother from this night i shall pursue a different course from this night his ruin may be dated he is in the care of those who will not leave the task assigned to themthe utter perversion of his principleshalffinished and when i have steeped him to the lips in vice and depravity when i have led him to the commission of every crime when there is neither retreat nor advance for him when he has plundered his benefactor and broken the heart of his motherthenbut not till then i will consign him to the fate to which i consigned his father this i have sworn to dothis i will do not unless your skulls bulletproof cried a voice at his elbow and as the words were uttered a pistol was snapped at his head whichfortunately or unfortunately as the reader pleasesonly burnt the priming the blaze however was sufficient to reveal to the thieftaker the features of his intended assassin they were those of the irish watchman ah terry oflaherty vociferated jonathan in a tone that betrayed hot the slightest discomposure ah terry oflaherty he cried shouting after the irishman who took to his heels as soon as he found his murderous attempt unsuccessful you may run but youll not get out of my reach ill put a brace of dogs on your track wholl soon hunt you down you shall swing for this after next sessions or my names not jonathan wild i told you sir rowland he added turning to the knight and chuckling the devil never deserts me conduct me to your dwelling sir without further delay said trenchard sternlyto the boy the boys not at my house replied wild where is he then demanded the other hastily at a place we call the dark house at queenhithe answered jonathan a sort of underground tavern or nightcellar close to the riverside and frequented by the crew of the dutch skipper to whose care hes to be committed you need have no apprehensions about him sir rowland hes safe enough now i left him in charge of quilt arnold and rykhart van galgebrokthe skipper i spoke ofwith strict orders to shoot him if he made any further attempt at escape and theyre not ladsthe latter especiallyto be trifled with i deemed it more prudent to send him to the dark house than to bring him here in case of any search after him by his adoptive fatherthe carpenter wood if you choose you can see him put on board the zeeslang yourself sir rowland but perhaps youll first accompany me to my dwelling for a moment that we may arrange our accounts before we start ive a few necessary directions to leave with my people to put em on their guard against the chance of a surprise suffer me to precede you this way sir rowland the thieftakers residence was a large dismallooking habitation separated from the street by a flagged courtyard and defended from general approach by an iron railing even in the daylight it had a sombre and suspicious air and seemed to slink back from the adjoining houses as if afraid of their society in the obscurity in which it was now seen it looked like a prison and indeed it was jonathans fancy to make it resemble one as much as possible the windows were grated the doors barred each room had the name as well as the appearance of a cell and the very porter who stood at the gate habited like a jailer with his huge bunch of keys at his girdle his forbidding countenance and surly demeanour seemed to be borrowed from newgate the clanking of chains the grating of locks and the rumbling of bolts must have been music in jonathans ears so much pains did he take to subject himself to such sounds the scanty furniture of the rooms corresponded with their dungeonlike aspect the walls were bare and painted in stonecolour the floors devoid of carpet the beds of hangings the windows of blinds and excepting in the thieftakers own audiencechamber there was not a chair or a table about the premises the place of these conveniences being elsewhere supplied by benches and dealboards laid across jointstools great stone staircases leading no one knew whither and long gloomy passages impressed the occasional visitor with the idea that he was traversing a building of vast extent and though this was not the case in reality the deception was so cleverly contrived that it seldom failed of producing the intended effect scarcely any one entered mr wilds dwelling without apprehension or quitted it without satisfaction more strange stories were told of it than of any other house in london the garrets were said to be tenanted by coiners and artists employed in altering watches and jewelry the cellars to be used as a magazine for stolen goods by some it was affirmed that a subterranean communication existed between the thieftakers abode and newgate by means of which he was enabled to maintain a secret correspondence with the imprisoned felons by others that an underground passage led to extensive vaults where such malefactors as he chose to screen from justice might lie concealed till the danger was blown over nothing in short was too extravagant to be related of it and jonathan who delighted in investing himself and his residence with mystery encouraged and perhaps originated these marvellous tales however this may be such was the ill report of the place that few passed along the old bailey without bestowing a glance of fearful curiosity at its dingy walls and wondering what was going on inside them while fewer still of those who paused at the door read without some internal trepidation the formidable nameinscribed in large letters on its bright brassplateof jonathan wild arrived at his habitation jonathan knocked in a peculiar manner at the door which was instantly opened by the grimvisaged porter just alluded to no sooner had trenchard crossed the threshold than a fierce barking was heard at the farther extremity of the passage and the next moment a couple of mastiffs of the largest size rushed furiously towards him the knight stood upon his defence but he would unquestionably have been torn in pieces by the savage hounds if a shower of oaths seconded by a vigorous application of kicks and blows from their master had not driven them growling off apologizing to sir rowland for this unpleasant reception and swearing lustily at his servant for occasioning it by leaving the dogs at liberty jonathan ordered the man to light them to the audienceroom the command was sullenly obeyed for the fellow did not appear to relish the rating ascending the stairs and conducting them along a sombre gallery in which trenchard noticed that every door was painted black and numbered he stopped at the entrance of a chamber and selecting a key from the bunch at his girdle unlocked it following his guide sir rowland found himself in a large and lofty apartment the extent of which he could not entirely discern until lights were set upon the table he then looked around him with some curiosity and as the thieftaker was occupied in giving directions to his attendant in an undertone ample leisure was allowed him for investigation at the first glance he imagined he must have stumbled upon a museum of rarities there were so many glasscases so many open cabinets ranged against the walls but the next convinced him that if jonathan was a virtuoso his tastes did not run in the ordinary channels trenchard was tempted to examine the contents of some of these cases but a closer inspection made him recoil from them in disgust in the one he approached was gathered together a vast assortment of weapons each of which as appeared from the ticket attached to it had been used as an instrument of destruction on this side was a razor with which a son had murdered his father the blade notched the haft crusted with blood on that a bar of iron bent and partly broken with which a husband had beaten out his wifes brains as it is not however our intention to furnish a complete catalogue of these curiosities we shall merely mention that in front of them lay a large and sharp knife once the property of the public executioner and used by him to dissever the limbs of those condemned to death for hightreason together with an immense twopronged fleshfork likewise employed by the same terrible functionary to plunge the quarters of his victims in the caldrons of boiling tar and oil every gibbet at tyburn and hounslow appeared to have been plundered of its charnel spoil to enrich the adjoining cabinet so well was it stored with skulls and bones all purporting to be the relics of highwaymen famous in their day halters each of which had fulfilled its destiny formed the attraction of the next compartment while a fourth was occupied by an array of implements of housebreaking almost innumerable and utterly indescribable all these interesting objects were carefully arranged classed and as we have said labelled by the thieftaker from this singular collection trenchard turned to regard its possessor who was standing at a little distance from him still engaged in earnest discourse with his attendant and as he contemplated his ruthless countenance on which duplicity and malignity had set their strongest seals he could not help calling to mind all he had heard of jonathans perfidiousness to his employers and deeply regretting that he had placed himself in the power of so unscrupulous a miscreant jonathan wild at this time was on the highroad to the greatness which he subsequently and not long afterwards obtained he was fast rising to an eminence that no one of his nefarious profession ever reached before him nor it is to be hoped will ever reach again he was the napoleon of knavery and established an uncontrolled empire over all the practitioners of crime this was no light conquest nor was it a government easily maintained resolution severity subtlety were required for it and these were qualities which jonathan possessed in an extraordinary degree the danger or difficulty of an exploit never appalled him what his head conceived his hand executed professing to stand between the robber and the robbed he himself plundered both he it was who formed the grand design of a robber corporation of which he should be the sole head and director with the right of delivering those who concealed their booty or refused to share it with him to the gallows he divided london into districts appointed a gang to each district and a leader to each gang whom he held responsible to himself the country was partitioned in a similar manner those whom he retained about his person or placed in offices of trust were for the most part convicted felons who having returned from transportation before their term had expired constituted in his opinion the safest agents inasmuch as they could neither be legal evidences against him nor withhold any portion of the spoil of which he chose to deprive them but the crowning glory of jonathan that which raised him above all his predecessors in iniquity and clothed this name with undying notorietywas to come when in the plenitude of his power he commenced a terrible trade till then unknownnamely a traffic in human blood this he carried on by procuring witnesses to swear away the lives of those persons who had incurred his displeasure or whom it might be necessary to remove no wonder that trenchard as he gazed at this fearful being should have some misgivings cross him apparently jonathan perceived he was an object of scrutiny for hastily dismissing his attendant he walked towards the knight so youre admiring my cabinet sir rowland he remarked with a sinister smile it is generally admired and sometimes by parties who afterwards contribute to the collection themselvesha ha this skull he added pointing to a fragment of mortality in the case beside them once belonged to tom sheppard the father of the lad i spoke of just now in the next box hangs the rope by which he suffered when ive placed another skull and another halter beside them i shall be contented to business sir said the knight with a look of abhorrence ay to business returned jonathan grinning the sooner the better here is the sum you bargained for rejoined trenchard flinging a pocketbook on the table count it jonathans eyes glistened as he told over the notes youve given me more than the amount sir rowland he said after he had twice counted them or ive missed my reckoning theres a hundred pounds too much keep it said trenchard haughtily ill place it to your account sir rowland answered the thieftaker smiling significantly and now shall we proceed to queenhithe stay cried the other taking a chair a word with you mr wild as many as you please sir rowland replied jonathan resuming his seat im quite at your disposal i have a question to propose to you said trenchard relating to and he hesitated relating to the father of the boythames darrell supplied jonathan i guessed what was coming you desire to know who he was sir rowland well you shall know without further fee inquired the knight not exactly answered jonathan drily a secret is too valuable a commodity to be thrown away but i said i wouldnt drive a hard bargain with you and i wont we are alone sir rowland he added snuffing the candles glancing cautiously around and lowering his tone and what you confide to me shall never transpireat least to your disadvantage i am at a loss to understand you sir said trenchard ill make myself intelligible before ive done rejoined wild i need not remind you sir rowland that i am aware you are deeply implicated in the jacobite plot which is now known to be hatching ha ejaculated the other of course therefore pursued jonathan you are acquainted with all the leaders of the proposed insurrectionnay must be in correspondence with them what right have you to suppose this sir demanded trenchard sternly have a moments patience sir rowland returned wild and you shall hear if you will furnish me with a list of these rebels and with proofs of their treason i will not only insure your safety but will acquaint you with the real name and rank of your sister alivas husband as well as with some particulars which will never otherwise reach your ears concerning your lost sister constance my sister constance echoed the knight what of her you agree to my proposal then said jonathan do you take me for as great a villain as yourself sir said the knight rising i took you for one who wouldnt hesitate to avail himself of any advantage chance might throw in his way returned the thieftaker coldly i find i was in error no matter a time may comeand that ere longwhen you will be glad to purchase my secrets and your own safety at a dearer price than the heads of your companions are you ready said trenchard striding towards the door i am replied jonathan following him and so he added in an undertone are your captors a moment afterwards they quitted the house chapter xvii the nightcellar after a few minutes rapid walking during which neither party uttered a word jonathan wild and his companion had passed saint pauls dived down a thoroughfare on the right and reached thames street at the period of this history the main streets of the metropolis were but imperfectly lighted while the lessfrequented avenues were left in total obscurity but even at the present time the maze of courts and alleys into which wild now plunged would have perplexed any one not familiar with their intricacies to thread them on a dark night jonathan however was well acquainted with the road indeed it was his boast that he could find his way through any part of london blindfolded and by this time it would seem he had nearly arrived at his destination for grasping his companions arm he led him along a narrow entry which did not appear to have an outlet and came to a halt cautioning the knight if he valued his neck to tread carefully jonathan then descended a steep flight of steps and having reached the bottom in safety he pushed open a door that swung back on its hinges as soon as it had admitted him and followed by trenchard entered the nightcellar the vault in which sir rowland found himself resembled in some measure the cabin of a ship it was long and narrow with a ceiling supported by huge uncovered rafters and so low as scarcely to allow a tall man like himself to stand erect beneath it notwithstanding the heat of the seasonwhich was not however found particularly inconvenient in this subterranean regiona large heapedup fire blazed ruddily in one corner and lighted up a circle of as villanous countenances as ever flame shone upon the guests congregated within the nightcellar were in fact little better than thieves but thieves who confined their depredations almost exclusively to the vessels lying in the pool and docks of the river they had as many designations as grades there were game watermen and game lightermen heavy horsemen and light horsemen scufflehunters and longapron men lumpers journeymen coopers mudlarks badgers and ratcatchersa race of dangerous vermin recently in a great measure extirpated by the vigilance of the thames police but at this period flourishing in vast numbers besides these plunderers there were others with whom the disposal of their pillage necessarily brought them into contact and who seldom failed to attend them during their hours of relaxation and festivityto wit dealers in junk old rags and marine stores purchasers of prizemoney crimps and jew receivers the latter formed by far the most knavishlooking and unprepossessing portion of the assemblage one or two of the tables were occupied by groups of fat frowzy women in flat caps with rings on their thumbs and baskets by their sides and no one who had listened for a single moment to their coarse language and violent abuse of each other would require to be told they were fishwives from billingsgate the present divinity of the cellar was a comely middleaged dame almost as stout and quite as shrillvoiced as the billingsgate fishwives abovementioned mrs spurling for so was she named had a warm nutbrown complexion almost as dark as a creole and a moustache on her upper lip that would have done no discredit to the oldest dragoon in the kings service this lady was singularly lucky in her matrimonial connections she had been married four times three of her husbands died of hempen fevers and the fourth having been twice condemned was saved from the noose by jonathan wild who not only managed to bring him off but to obtain for him the situation of underturnkey in newgate on the appearance of the thieftaker mrs spurling was standing near the fire superintending some culinary preparation but she no sooner perceived him than hastily quitting her occupation she elbowed a way for him and the knight through the crowd and ushered them with much ceremony into an inner room where they found the objects of their search quilt arnold and rykhart van galgebrok seated at a small table quietly smoking this service rendered without waiting for any farther order she withdrew both the janizary and the skipper arose as the others entered the room this is the gentleman observed jonathan introducing trenchard to the hollander who is about to intrust his young relation to your care de gentleman may rely on my showing his relation all de attention in my power replied van galgebrok bowing profoundly to the knight but if any unforseen accidentsuch as a slip overboardshould befal de jonker on de voyage he mushnt lay de fault entirely on my shouldershaw haw where is he asked sir rowland glancing uneasily around i do not see him de jonker hes here returned the skipper pointing significantly downwards bring him out quilt so saying he pushed aside the table and the janizary stooping down undrew a bolt and opened a trapdoor come out roared quilt looking into the aperture youre wanted but as no answer was returned he trust his arm up to the shoulder into the hole and with some little difficulty and exertion of strength drew forth thames darrell the poor boy whose hands were pinioned behind him looked very pale but neither trembled nor exhibited any other symptom of alarm why didnt you come out when i called you you young dog cried quilt in a savage tone because i knew what you wanted me for answered thames firmly oh you did did you said the janizary and what do you suppose we mean to do with you eh you mean to kill me replied thames by my cruel uncles command ah there he stands he exclaimed as his eye fell for the first time upon sir rowland where is my mother he added regarding the knight with a searching glance your mother is dead interposed wild scowling dead echoed the boy oh nono you say this to terrify meto try me but i will not believe you inhuman as he is he would not kill her tell me sir he added advancing towards the knight tell me has this man spoken falselytell me my mother is alive and do what you please with me tell him so and have done with him sir rowland observed jonathan coldly tell me the truth i implore you cried thames is she alive she is not replied trenchard overcome by conflicting emotions and unable to endure the boys agonized look are you answered said jonathan with a grin worthy of a demon my mothermy poor mother ejaculated thames falling on his knees and bursting into tears shall i never see that sweet face againnever feel the pressure of those kind hands morenor listen to that gentle voice ah yes we shall meet again in heaven where i shall speedily join you now then he added more calmly i am ready to die the only mercy you can show me is to kill me then we wont even show you that mercy retorted the thieftaker brutally so get up and leave off whimpering your time isnt come yet mr wild said trenchard i shall proceed no further in this business set the boy free if i disobey you sir rowland replied the thieftaker youll thank me for it hereafter gag him he added pushing thames rudely toward quilt arnold and convey him to the boat a word cried the boy as the janizary was preparing to obey his masters orders what has become of jack sheppard devil knows answered quilt but i believe hes in the hands of blueskin so theres no doubt hell soon be on the highroad to tyburn poor jack sighed thames you neednt gag me he added ill not cry out we wont trust you my youngster answered the janizary and thrusting a piece of iron into his mouth he forced him out of the room sir rowland witnessed these proceedings like one stupified he neither attempted to prevent his nephews departure nor to follow him jonathan kept his keen eye fixed upon him as he addressed himself for a moment to the hollander is the case of watches on board he asked in an under tone ja replied the skipper and the rings ja thats well you must dispose of the goldsmiths note i gave you yesterday as soon as you arrive at rotterdam itll be advertised tomorrow de duivel exclaimed van galgebrok very well it shall be done as you direct but about dat jonker he continued lowering his voice have you anything to add consarnin him its almosht a pity to put him onder de water is the sloop ready to sail asked wild without noticing the skippers remark ja answered van at a minuts nodish here are your despatches said jonathan with a significant look and giving him a sealed packet open them when you get on boardnot before and act as they direct you i ondershtand replied the skipper putting his finger to his nose it shall be done sir rowland said jonathan turning to the knight will it please you to remain here till i return or will you accompany us i will go with you answered trenchard who by this time had regained his composure and with it all his relentlessness of purpose come then said wild marching towards the door weve no time to lose quitting the nightcellar the trio soon arrived at the riverside quilt arnold was stationed at the stairhead near which the boat containing the captive boy was moored a few words passed between him and the thieftaker as the latter came up after which all the partywith the exception of quilt who was left on shoreembarked within the wherry which was pushed from the strand and rowed swiftly along the streamfor the tide was in its favourby a couple of watermen though scarcely two hours past midnight it was perfectly light the moon had arisen and everything could be as plainly distinguished as during the day a thin mist lay on the river giving the few craft moving about in it a ghostly look as they approached london bridge the thieftaker whispered van galgebrok who acted as steersman to make for a particular archnear the surrey shore the skipper obeyed and in another moment they swept through the narrow lock while the watermen were contending with the eddies occasioned by the fall below the bridge jonathan observed a perceptible shudder run through trenchards frame you remember that starling sir rowland he said maliciously and what occurred on it twelve years ago too well answered the knight frowning ah what is that he cried pointing to a dark object floating near them amid the boiling waves and which presented a frightful resemblance to a human face well see returned the thieftaker and stretching out his hand he lifted the dark object from the flood it proved to be a human head though with scarcely a vestige of the features remaining here and there patches of flesh adhered to the bones and the dank dripping hair hanging about what had once been the face gave it a ghastly appearance its the skull of a rebel said jonathan with marked emphasis on the word blown by the wind from a spike on the bridge above us i dont know whose brainless head it may be but itll do for my collection and he tossed it carelessly into the bottom of the boat after this occurence not a word was exchanged between them until they came in sight of the sloop which was lying at anchor off wapping arrived at her side it was soon evident from the throng of seamen in dutch dresses that displayed themselves that her crew were on the alert and a rope having been thrown down to the skipper he speedily hoisted himself on deck preparations were next made for taking thames on board raising him in his arms jonathan passed the rope round his body and in this way the poor boy was drawn up without difficulty while he was swinging in mid air thames regarded his uncle with a stern look and cried in a menacing voice we shall meet again not in this world returned jonathan weigh anchor van he shouted to the skipper and consult your despatches jaja returned the hollander and catching hold of thames he quitted the deck shortly afterwards he reappeared with the information that the captive was safe below and giving the necessary directions to his crew before many minutes had elapsed the zeeslang spread her canvass to the first breeze of morning by the thieftakers command the boat was then rowed toward a muddy inlet which has received in more recent times the name of execution dock as soon as she reached this spot wild sprang ashore and was joined by several personsamong whom was quilt arnold leading a horse by the bridlehe hastened down the stairs to meet him a coach was also in attendance at a little distance sir rowland who had continued absorbed in thought with his eyes fixed upon the sloop as she made her way slowly down the river disembarked more leisurely at length i am my own master murmured the knight as his foot touched the strand not so sir rowland returned jonathan you are my prisoner how ejaculated trenchard starting back and drawing his sword you are arrested for high treason rejoined wild presenting a pistol at his head while he drew forth a parchmenthere is my warrant traitor cried sir rowlanddamneddoubledyed traitor away with him vociferated jonathan to his myrmidons who having surrounded trenchard hurried him off to the coach before he could utter another wordfirst to mr walpole and then to newgate and now quilt he continued addressing the janizary who approached him with the horse fly to st giless roundhouse and if through the agency of that treacherous scoundrel terry oflaherty whom ive put in my black list old wood should have found his way there and have been detained by sharpies as i directed you may release him i dont care how soon he learns that he has lost his adopted son when ive escorted you proud fool to his new quarters ill proceed to the mint and look after jack sheppard with this he mounted his steed and rode off chapter xviii how jack sheppard broke out of the cage at willesden the heartpiercing scream uttered by mrs sheppard after the commission of the robbery in willesden church was productive of unfortunate consequences to her son luckily she was bereft of consciousness and was thus spared the additional misery of witnessing what afterwards befell him startled by the cry as may be supposed the attention of the whole congregation was drawn towards the quarter whence it proceeded amongst others a person near the door roused by the shriek observed a man make his exit with the utmost precipitation a boy attempted to follow but as the suspicions of the lookerson were roused by the previous circumstances the younger fugitive was seized and detained meanwhile mr kneebone having been alarmed by something in the widows look before her feelings found vent in the manner above described thrust his hand instinctively into his coat in search of his pocketbookabout the security of which as it contained several letters and documents implicating himself and others in the jacobite plot he was not unnaturally solicitousand finding it gone he felt certain he had been robbed turning quickly round in the hope of discovering the thief he was no less surprised than distressedfor in spite of his faults the woollendraper was a goodnatured fellowto perceive jack sheppard in custody the truth at once flashed across his mind this then was the cause of the widows wild inexplicable lookof her sudden shriek explaining his suspicious in a whisper to jacks captor who proved to be a churchwarden and a constable by name john dumpmr kneebone begged him to take the prisoner into the churchyard dump instantly complied and as soon as jack was removed from the sacred edifice his person was searched from head to footbut without success jack submitted to this scrutiny with a very bad grace and vehemently protested his innocence in vain did the woollendraper offer to set him free if he would restore the stolen article or give up his associate to whom it was supposed he might have handed it he answered with the greatest assurance that he knew nothing whatever of the matterhad seen no pocketbook and no associate to give up nor did he content himself with declaring his guiltlessness of the crime imputed to him but began in his turn to menace his captor and accuser loading the latter with the bitterest upbraidings by this time the churchyard was crowded with spectators some of whom dispersed in different directions in quest of the other robber but all that could be ascertained in the village was that a man had ridden off a short time before in the direction of london of this man kneebone resolved to go in pursuit and leaving jack in charge of the constable he proceeded to the small innwhich bore then as it bears now the name of the six bellswhere summoning the hostler his steed was instantly brought him and springing on its back he rode away at full speed meanwhile after a consultation between mr dump and the village authorities it was agreed to lock up the prisoner in the cage as he was conveyed thither an incident occurred that produced a considerable impression on the feelings of the youthful offender just as they reached the eastern outlet of the churchyardwhere the tall elms cast a pleasant shade over the rustic gravesa momentary stoppage took place at this gate two paths meet down that on the right the young culprit was draggedalong that on the left a fainting woman was borne in the arms of several females it was his mother and as he gazed on her pallid features and motionless frame jacks heart severely smote him he urged his conductors to a quicker pace to get out of sight of the distressing spectacle and even felt relieved when he was shut out from it and the execrations of the mob by the walls of the little prison the cage at willesden was and isfor it is still standinga small round building about eight feet high with a pointed tiled roof to which a number of boards inscribed with the names of the parish officers and charged with a multitude of admonitory notices to vagrants and other disorderly persons are attached over these boards the two arms of a guidepost serve to direct the wayfareron the right hand to the neighbouring villages of neasdon and kingsbury and on the left to the edgeware road and the healthy heights of hampstead the cage has a strong door with an iron grating at the top and further secured by a stout bolt and padlock it is picturesquely situated beneath a tree on the high road not far from the little hostel before mentioned and at no great distance from the church for some time after he was locked up in this prison jack continued in a very dejected state deserted by his older companion in iniquity and instigator to crime he did not know what might become of him nor as we have observed was the sad spectacle he had just witnessed without effect though within the last two days he had committed several heinous offences and one of a darker dye than any with which the reader has been made acquainted his breast was not yet so callous as to be wholly insensible to the stings of conscience wearied at length with thinking on the past and terrified by the prospect of the future he threw himself on the straw with which the cage was littered and endeavoured to compose himself to slumber when he awoke it was late in the day but though he heard voices outside and now and then caught a glimpse of a face peeping at him through the iron grating over the door no one entered the prison or held any communication with him feeling rather exhausted it occurred to him that possibly some provisions might have been left by the constable and looking about he perceived a pitcher of water and a small brown loaf on the floor he ate of the bread with great appetite and having drunk as much as he chose of the water poured the rest on the floor his hunger satisfied his spirits began to revive and with this change of mood all his natural audacity returned and here he was first visited by that genius which in his subsequent career prompted him to so many bold and successful attempts glancing around his prison he began to think it possible he might effect an escape from it the door was too strong and too well secured to break openthe walls too thick but the ceilingif he could reach itthere he doubted not he could make an outlet while he was meditating flight in this way and tossing about on the straw he chanced upon an old broken and rusty fork here was an instrument which might be of the greatest service to him in accomplishing his design he put it carefully aside resolved to defer the attempt till night time wore on somewhat slowly with the prisoner who had to control his impatience in the best way he could but as the shades of evening were darkening the door was unlocked and mr dump popped his head into the cage he brought another small loaf and a can with which he replenished the pitcher recommending jack to be careful as he would get nothing further till morning to this jack replied that he should be perfectly contented provided he might have a small allowance of gin the latter request though treated with supreme contempt by mr dump made an impression on some one outside for not long after the constable departed jack heard a tap at the door and getting up at the summons he perceived the tube of a pipe inserted between the bars at once divining the meaning of this ingenious device he applied his mouth to the tube and sucked away while the person outside poured spirit into the bowl having drunk as much as he thought prudent and thanked his unknown friend for his attention jack again lay down on the straw and indulged himself with another nap intending to get up as soon as it was perfectly dark the strong potation he had taken combined with fatigue and anxiety he had previously undergone made him oversleep himself and when he awoke it was just beginning to grow light cursing himself for his inertness jack soon shook off this drowsiness and set to work in earnest availing himself of certain inequalities in the door he soon managed to climb up to the roof and securing his feet against a slight projection in the wall began to use the fork with great effect before many minutes elapsed he had picked a large hole in the plaster which showered down in a cloud of dust and breaking off several laths caught hold of a beam by which he held with one hand until with the other he succeeded not without some difficulty in forcing out one of the tiles the rest was easy in a few minutes more he had made a breach in the roof wide enough to allow him to pass through emerging from this aperture he was about to descend when he was alarmed by hearing the tramp of horses feet swiftly approaching and had only time to hide himself behind one of the largest signboards before alluded to when two horsemen rode up instead of passing on as jack expected these persons stopped opposite the cage when one of them as he judged from the sound for he did not dare to look out of his hiding place dismounted a noise was next heard as if some instrument were applied to the door with the intent to force it open and jacks fears were at once dispelled at first he had imagined they were officers of justice come to convey him to a stronger prison but the voice of one of the parties which he recognised convinced him they were his friends look quick blueskin and be cursed to you was growled in the deep tones of jonathan wild we shall have the whole village upon us while youre striking the jigger use the gilt man theres no need of picklock or crowbar here mr wild cried jack placing his hat on the right arm of the guidepost and leaning over the board ive done the trick myself why what the devils this vociferated jonathan looking up have you broken out of the cage jack something like it replied the lad carelessly bravo cried the thieftaker approvingly well that beats all i ever heard of roared blueskin but are you really there no im here answered jack leaping down i tell you what mr wild he added laughing it must be a stronger prison than willesden cage that can hold me ay ay observed jonathan youll give the keepers of his majestys jails some trouble before youre many years older ill warrant you but get up behind blueskin some one may observe us come jump up cried blueskin mounting his steed and ill soon wisk you to town edgeworth bess and poll maggot are dying to see you i thought bess would have cried her pretty eyes out when she heard you was nabbed you need give yourself no more concern about kneebone mr wild has done his business ayay laughed jonathan the pocketbook you prigged contained the letters i wanted hes now in springankle warehouse with sir rowland trenchard so get up and lets be off before i leave this place i must see my mother nonsense returned jonathan gruffly would you expose yourself to fresh risk if it hadnt been for her you wouldnt have been placed in your late jeopardy i dont care for that replied jack see her i will leave me behind im not afraid ill be at the cross shovels in the course of the day nay if youre bent upon this folly observed wild who appeared to have his own reasons for humouring the lad i shant hinder you blueskin will take care of the horses and ill go with you so saying he dismounted and flinging his bridle to his companion and ordering him to ride off to a little distance he followed jack who had quitted the main road and struck into a narrow path opposite the cage this path bordered on each side by high privet hedges of the most beautiful green soon brought them to a stile theres the house said jack pointing to a pretty cottage the small wooden porch of which was covered with roses and creepers with a little trim garden in front of it ill be back in a minute dont hurry yourself said jonathan ill wait for you here chapter xix good and evil as jack opened the gate and crossed the little garden which exhibited in every part the neatness and attention of its owner he almost trembled at the idea of further disturbing her peace of mind pausing with the intention of turning back he glanced in the direction of the village church the tower of which could just be seen through the trees the rooks were cawing amid the boughs and all nature appeared awaking to happiness from this peaceful scene jacks eye fell upon jonathan who seated upon the stile under the shade of an elder tree was evidently watching him a sarcastic smile seemed to play upon the chieftakers lips and abashed at his own irresolution the lad went on after knocking for some time at the door without effect he tried the latch and to his surprise found it open he stepped in with a heavy foreboding of calamity a cat came and rubbed herself against him as he entered the house and seemed by her mewing to ask him for food that was the only sound he heard jack was almost afraid of speaking but at length he summoned courage to call out mother whos there asked a faint voice from the bed your son answered the boy jack exclaimed the widow starting up and drawing back the curtain is it indeed you or am i dreaming youre not dreaming mother he answered im come to say good bye to you and to assure you of my safety before i leave this place where are you going asked his mother i hardly know returned jack but its not safe for me to remain much longer here true replied the widow upon whom all the terrible recollections of the day before crowded i know it isnt i wont keep you long but tell me how have you escaped from the confinement in which you were placedcome and sit by mehereupon the bedgive me your handand tell me all about it her son complied and sat down upon the patchwork coverlet beside her jack said mrs sheppard clasping him with a hand that burnt with fever i have been illdreadfully illi believe deliriousi thought i should have died last nighti wont tell you what agony you have caused mei wont reproach you only promise me to amendto quit your vile companionsand i will forgive youwill bless you oh my dear dear son be warned in time you are in the hands of a wicked a terrible man who will not stop till he has completed your destruction listen to your mothers prayers and do not let her die brokenhearted it is too late returned jack sullenly i cant be honest if i would oh do not say so replied his wretched parent it is never too late i know you are in jonathan wilds power for i saw him near you in the church and if ever the enemy of mankind was permitted to take human form i beheld him then beware of him my son beware of him you know not what villany he is capable of be honest and you will be happy you are yet a child and though you have strayed from the right path a stronger hand than your own has led you thence return i implore of you to your masterto mr wood acknowledge your faults he is all kindness and will overlook them for your poor fathers sakefor mine return to him i say i cant replied jack doggedly cant repeated his mother why not ill tell you cried a deep voice from the back of the bed and immediately afterwards the curtain was drawn aside and disclosed the satanic countenance of jonathan wild who had crept into the house unperceived ill tell you why he cant go back to his master cried the thieftaker with a malignant grin he has robbed him robbed him screamed the widow jack her son averted his gaze ay robbed him reiterated jonathan the night before last mr woods house was broken into and plundered your son was seen by the carpenters wife in company with the robbers here he added throwing a handbill on the bed are the particulars of the burglary with the reward for jacks apprehension ah ejaculated the widow hiding her face come said wild turning authoritatively to jackyou have overstayed your time do not go with him jack shrieked his mother do notdo not he must thundered jonathan or he goes to jail if you must go to prison i will go with you cried mrs sheppard but avoid that man as you would a serpent come along thundered jonathan hear me jack shrieked his mother you know not what you do the wretch you confide in has sworn to hang you as i hope for mercy i speak the truthlet him deny it if he can pshaw said wild i could hang him now if i liked but he may remain with you if he pleases i shant hinder him you hear my son said the widow eagerly choose between good and evilbetween him and me and mind your lifemore than your lifehangs upon your choice it does so said wild choose jack the lad made no answer but left the room he is gone cried mrs sheppard despairingly for ever said the thieftaker preparing to follow devil cried the widow catching his arm and gazing with frantic eagerness in his face how many years will you give my son before you execute your terrible threat nine answered jonathan sternly end of the second epoch epoch the third the prisonbreaker chapter i the return nearly nine years after the events last recorded and about the middle of may a young man of remarkably prepossessing appearance took his way one afternoon along wych street and from the curiosity with which he regarded the houses on the left of the road seemed to be in search of some particular habitation the age of this individual could not be more than twentyone his figure was tall robust and gracefully proportioned and his clear gray eye and open countenance bespoke a frank generous and resolute nature his features were regular and finelyformed his complexion bright and bloominga little shaded however by travel and exposure to the sun and with a praiseworthy contempt for the universal and preposterous fashion then prevailing of substituting a peruke for the natural covering of the head he allowed his own darkbrown hair to fall over his shoulders in ringlets as luxuriant as those that distinguished the court gallant in charles the seconds daysa fashion which we do not despair of seeing revived in our own days he wore a french military undress of the period with high jackboots and a laced hat and though his attire indicated no particular rank he had completely the air of a person of distinction such was the effect produced upon the passengers by his good looks and manly deportment that fewespecially of the gentler and more susceptible sexfailed to turn round and bestow a second glance upon the handsome stranger unconscious of the interest he excited and entirely occupied by his own thoughtswhich if his bosom could have been examined would have been found composed of mingled hopes and fearsthe young man walked on till he came to an old house with great projecting bay windows on the first floor and situated as nearly as possible at the back of st clements church here he halted and looking upwards read at the foot of an immense signboard displaying a gaudilypainted angel with expanded pinions and an olivebranch not the name he expected to find but that of william kneebone woollendraper tears started to the young mans eyes on beholding the change and it was with difficulty he could command himself sufficiently to make the inquiries he desired to do respecting the former owner of the house as he entered the shop a tall portly personage advanced to meet him whom he at once recognised as the present proprietor mr kneebone was attired in the extremity of the mode a fullcurled wig descended halfway down his back and shoulders a neckcloth of right mechlin was twisted round his throat so tightly as almost to deprive him of breath and threaten him with apoplexy he had lace also at his wrists and bosom gold clocks to his hose and red heels to his shoes a stiff formallycut coat of cinnamoncoloured cloth with rows of plate buttons each of the size of a crown piece on the sleeves pockets and skirts reached the middle of his legs and his costume was completed by the silverhilted sword at his side and the laced hat under his left arm bowing to the stranger the woollendraper very politely requested to know his business im almost afraid to state it faltered the other but may i ask whether mr wood the carpenter who formerly resided here is still living if you feel any anxiety on his account sir im happy to be able to relieve it answered kneebone readily my good friend owen woodheaven preserve himis still living and for a man wholl never see sixty again hes in excellent preservation i assure you you delight me with the intelligence said the stranger entirely recovering his cheerfulness of look i began to fear from his having quitted the old place that some misfortune must have befallen him quite the contrary rejoined the woollendraper laughing goodhumouredly everything has prospered with him in an extraordinary manner his business has thriven legacies have unexpectedly dropped into his lap and to crown all he has made a large fortune by a lucky speculation in southsea stockmade it too where so many others have lost fortunes your humble servant amongst the numberha ha in a word sir mr wood is now in very affluent circumstances he stuck to the shop as long as it was necessary and longer in my opinion when he left these premises three years ago i took them from him or ratherto deal frankly with youhe placed me in them rentfree for im not ashamed to confess it ive had losses and heavy ones and if it hadnt been for him i dont know where i should have been mr wood sir he added with much emotion is one of the best of men and would be the happiest were it not that and he hesitated well sir cried the other eagerly his wife is still living returned kneebone drily i understand replied the stranger unable to repress a smile but it strikes me ive heard that mrs wood was once a favourite of yours so she was replied the woollendraper helping himself to an enormous pinch of snuff with the air of a man who does not dislike to be rallied about his gallantryso she was but those days are overquite over since her husband has laid me under such a weight of obligation i couldnt in honour continuehem and he took another explanatory pinch added to which she is neither so young as she was nor is her temper by any means improvedhem say no more on the subject sir observed the stranger gravely but let us turn to a more agreeable oneher daughter that is a far more agreeable one i must confess returned kneebone with a selfsufficient smirk the stranger looked at him as if strongly disposed to chastise his impertinence is she married he asked after a brief pause marriednono replied the woollendraper winifred wood will never marry unless the grave can give up its dead when a mere child she fixed her affections upon a youth named thames darrell whom her father brought up and who perished it is supposed about nine years ago and she has determined to remain faithful to his memory you astonish me said the stranger in a voice full of emotion why it is astonishing certainly remarked kneebone to find any woman constantespecially to a girlish attachment but such is the case she has had offers innumerable for where wealth and beauty are combined as in her instance suitors are seldom wanting but she was not to be tempted she is a matchless creature exclaimed the young man so i think replied kneebone again applying to the snuffbox and by that means escaping the angry glance levelled at him by his companion i have one inquiry more to make of you sir said the stranger as soon as he had conquered his displeasure and i will then trouble you no further you spoke just now of a youth whom mr wood brought up as far as i recollect there were two what has become of the other why surely you dont mean jack sheppard cried the woollendraper in surprise that was the lads name returned the stranger i guessed from your dress and manner sir that you must have been long absent from your own country said kneebone and now im convinced of it or you wouldnt have asked that question jack sheppard is the talk and terror of the whole town the ladies cant sleep in their beds for him and as to the men they darent go to bed at all hes the most daring and expert housebreaker that ever used a crowbar he laughs at locks and bolts and the more carefully you guard your premises from him the more likely are you to insure an attack his exploits and escapes are in every bodys mouth he has been lodged in every roundhouse in the metropolis and has broken out of them all and boasts that no prison can hold him we shall see his skill has not been tried at present he is under the protection of jonathan wild does that villain still maintain his power asked the stranger sternly he does replied kneebone and what is more surprising it seems to increase jonathan completely baffles and derides the ends of justice it is useless to contend with him even with right on your side some years ago in just before the rebellion i was rash enough to league myself with the jacobite party and by wilds machinations got clapped into newgate whence i was glad to escape with my head upon my shoulders i charged the thieftaker as was the fact with having robbed me by means of the lad sheppard whom he instigated to deed of the very pocketbook he produced in evidence against me but it was of no availi couldnt obtain a hearing mr wood fared still worse bribed by a certain sir rowland trenchard jonathan kidnapped the carpenters adopted son thames darrell and placed him in the hands of a dutch skipper with orders to throw him overboard when he got out to sea and though this was proved as clear as day the rascal managed matters so adroitly and gave such a different complexion to the whole affair that he came off with flying colours one reason perhaps of his success in this case might be that having arrested his associate in the dark transaction sir rowland trenchard on a charge of high treason he was favoured by walpole who found his account in retaining such an agent be this as it may jonathan remained the victor and shortly afterwardsat the price of a third of his estate it was whisperedhe procured trenchards liberation from confinement at the mention of the latter occurrence a dark cloud gathered upon the strangers brow do you know anything further of sir rowland he asked nothing more than this answered kneebonethat after the failure of his projects and the downfall of his party he retired to his seat ashton hall near manchester and has remained there ever since entirely secluded from the world the stranger was for a moment lost in reflection and now sir he said preparing to take his departure will you add to the obligation already conferred by informing me where i can meet with mr wood with pleasure replied the woollendraper he lives at dollis hill a beautiful spot near willesden about four or five miles from town where he has taken a farm if you ride out there and the place is well worth a visit for the magnificent view it commands of some of the finest country in the neighbourhood of londonyou are certain to meet with him i saw him yesterday and he told me he shouldnt stir from home for a week to come he called here on his way back after he had been to bedlam to visit poor mrs sheppard jacks mother exclaimed the young man gracious heavenis she the inmate of a madhouse she is sir answered the woollendraper sadly driven there by her sons misconduct alas that the punishment of his offences should fall on her head poor soul she nearly died when she heard he had robbed his master and it might have been well if she had done so for she never afterwards recovered her reason she rambles continually about jack and her husband and that wretch jonathan to whom as far as can be gathered from her wild ravings she attributes all her misery i pity her from the bottom of my heart but in the midst of all her affliction she has found a steady friend in mr wood who looks after her comforts and visits her constantly indeed ive heard him say that but for his wife he would shelter her under his own roof that sir is what i call being a good samaritan the stranger said nothing but hastily brushed away a tear perceiving he was about to take leave kneebone ventured to ask whom he had had the honour of addressing before the question could be answered a sidedoor was opened and a very handsome woman of amazonian proportions presented herself and marched familiarly up to mr kneebone she was extremely showily dressed and her large hooped petticoat gave additional effect to her lofty stature as soon as she noticed the stranger she honoured him with an extremely impudent stare and scarcely endeavoured to disguise the admiration with which his good looks impressed her dont you perceive my dear mrs maggot that im engaged said kneebone a little disconcerted whove you got with you demanded the amazon boldly the gentleman is a stranger to me poll replied the woollendraper with increased embarrassment i dont know his name and he looked at the moment as if he had lost all desire to know it well hes a pretty fellow at all events observed mrs maggot eyeing him from head to heel with evident satisfactiona devilish pretty fellow upon my word poll said kneebone becoming very red you might have a little more delicacy than to tell him so before my face what exclaimed mrs maggot drawing up her fine figure to its full height because i condescend to live with you am i never to look at another manespecially at one so much to my taste as this dont think it you had better retire madam said the woollendraper sharply if you cant conduct yourself with more propriety order those who choose to obey you rejoined the lady scornfully though you lorded it over that fond fool mrs wood you shant lord it over me i can promise you that for you and she snapped her fingers in his face zounds cried kneebone furiously go to your own room woman directly or ill make you make me echoed mrs maggot bursting into a loud contemptuous laugh try enraged at the assurance of his mistress the woollendraper endeavoured to carry his threat into execution but all his efforts to remove her were unavailing at length after he had given up the point from sheer exhaustion the amazon seized him by the throat and pushed him backwards with such force that he rolled over the counter there she cried laughing thatll teach you to lay hands upon me again you should remember before you try your strength against mine that when i rescued you from the watch and you induced me to come and live with you i beat off four men any of whom was a match for youha ha my dear poll said kneebone picking himself up i entreat you to moderate yourself entreat a fiddlestick retorted mrs maggot im tired of you and will go back to my old lover jack sheppard hes worth a dozen of you or if this goodlooking young fellow will only say the word ill go with him you may go and welcome madam rejoined kneebone spitefully but i should think after the specimen youve just given of your amiable disposition no person would be likely to saddle himself with such an incumbrance what say you sir said the amazon with an engaging leer at the stranger you will find me tractable enough and with me by your side you need fear neither constable nor watchman ive delivered jack sheppard from many an assault i can wield a quarterstaff as well as a prizefighter and have beaten figg himself at the broadsword will you take me however tempting mrs maggots offer may appear the young man thought fit to decline it and after a few words of wellmerited compliment on her extraordinary prowess and renewed thanks to mr kneebone he took his departure good bye cried mrs maggot kissing her hand to him ill find you out and now she added glancing contemptuously at the woollendraper ill go to jack sheppard you shall first go to bridewell you jade rejoined kneebone here tom he added calling to a shopboy run and fetch a constable he had better bring halfadozen said the amazon taking up a clothyard wand and quietly seating herself one wont do on leaving mr kneebones house the young man hastened to a hotel in the neighbourhood of covent garden where having procured a horse he shaped his course towards the west end of the town urging his steed along oxford roadas that great approach to the metropolis was then termedhe soon passed marylebone lane beyond which with the exception of a few scattered houses the country was completely open on the right and laid out in pleasant fields and gardens nor did he draw in the rein until he arrived at tyburngate where before he turned off upon the edgeware road he halted for a moment to glance at the place of execution this fatal retreat for the unfortunate brave was marked by a low wooden railing within which stood the triple tree opposite the gallows was an open gallery or scaffolding like the stand at a racecourse which on state occasions was crowded with spectators without the inclosure were reared several lofty gibbets with their ghastly burthens altogether it was a hideous and revolting sight influenced probably by what he had heard from mr kneebone respecting the lawless career of jack sheppard and struck with the probable fate that awaited him the young man as he contemplated this scene fell into a gloomy reverie while he was thus musing two horsemen rode past him and proceeding to a little distance stopped likewise one of them was a stout squarebuilt man with a singularly swarthy complexion and harsh forbidding features he was well mounted as was his companion and had pistols in his holsters and a hanger at his girdle the other individual who was a little in advance was concealed from the strangers view presently however a sudden movement occurred and disclosed his features which were those of a young man of nearly his own age the dress of this person was excessively showy and consisted of a scarlet ridinghabit lined and faced with blue and bedizened with broad gold lace a green silkknit waistcoat embroidered with silver and decorated with a deep fringe together with a hat tricked out in the same gaudy style his figure was slight but wellbuilt and in stature he did not exceed five feet four his complexion was pale and there was something sinister in the expression of his large black eyes his head was small and bulletshaped and he did not wear a wig but had his sleek black hair cut off closely round his temples a mutual recognition took place at the same instant between the stranger and this individual both started the latter seemed inclined to advance and address the former but suddenly changing his mind he shouted to his companion in tones familiar to the strangers ear and striking spurs into his steed dashed off at full speed along the edgeware road impelled by a feeling into which we shall not pause to inquire the stranger started after them but they were better mounted and soon distanced him remarking that they struck off at a turning on the left he took the same road and soon found himself on paddingtongreen a row of magnificent and even then venerable elms threw their broad arms over this pleasant spot from a man who was standing beneath the shade of one these noble trees information was obtained that the horsemen had ridden along the harrow road with a faint view of overtaking them the pursuer urged his steed to a quicker pace arrived at westbournegreenthen nothing more than a common covered with gorse and furzebushes and boasting only a couple of cottages and an alehousehe perceived through the hedges the objects of his search slowly ascending the gentle hill that rises from kensallgreen by the time he had reached the summit of this hill he had lost all trace of them and the ardour of the chase having in some measure subsided he began to reproach himself for his folly in having wanderedas he conceivedso far out of his course before retracing his steps however he allowed his gaze to range over the vast and beautiful prospect spread out beneath him which is now hidden from the travellers view by the high walls of the general cemetery and can consequently only be commanded from the interior of that attractive place of burialand which before it was intersected by canals and railroads and portioned out into hippodromes was exquisite indeed after feasting his eye upon this superb panorama he was about to return when he ascertained from a farmer that his nearest road to willesden would be down a lane a little further on to the right following this direction he opened a gate and struck into one of the most beautiful green lanes imaginable which after various windings conducted him into a more frequented road and eventually brought him to the place he sought glancing at the fingerpost over the cage which has been described as situated at the outskirts of the village and seeing no directions to dollis hill he made fresh inquiries as to where it lay from an elderly man who was standing with another countryman near the little prison whose house do you want master said the man touching his hat mr woods was the reply there is dollis hill said the man pointing to a wellwooded eminence about a mile distant and there he added indicating the roof of a house just visible above a grove of trees is mr woods if you ride past the church and mount the hill youll come to neasdon and then youll not have above half a mile to go the young man thanked his informant and was about to follow his instructions when the other called after him i say master did you ever hear tell of mr woods famous prentice what apprentice asked the stranger in surprise why jack sheppard the notorious housebreakerhim as has robbed half lunnun to be sure you must know sir when he was a lad the day after he broke into his masters house in wych street he picked a gentlemans pocket in our church during sarvice timethat he did the heathen the gentleman catched him i th fact and we shut him up for safety i that prisn but said the fellow with a laugh he soon contrived to make his way out on it though ever since hes become so famous the folks about here ha christened it jack sheppards cage his mother used to live i this village just down yonder but when her son took to bad ways she went distractedand now shes i bedlam ive heerd i tell ee what john dump said the other fellow who had hitherto preserved silence i dont know whether you talkin o jack sheppard has put him into my head or not but i once had him pointed out to me and if that were him as i seed then hes just now ridden past us and put up at the six bells the deuce he has cried dump if you were sure o that we might seize him and get the reward for his apprehension that ud be no such easy matter replied the countryman jacks a desperate fellow and is always well armed besides he has a comrade with him but ill tell ee what we might do the young man heard no more taking the direction pointed out he rode off as he passed the six bells he noticed the steeds of the two horsemen at the door and glancing into the house perceived the younger of the two in the passage the latter no sooner beheld him than he dashed hastily into an adjoining room after debating with himself whether he should further seek an interview which though now in his power was so sedulously shunned by the other party he decided in the negative and contenting himself with writing upon a slip of paper the hasty wordsyou are known by the villagersbe upon your guardhe gave it to the ostler with instructions to deliver it instantly to the owner of the horse he pointed out and pursued his course passing the old rectory and still older church with its reverend screen of trees and slowly ascending a hill side from whence he obtained enchanting peeps of the spire and college of harrow he reached the cluster of wellbuilt houses which constitute the village of neasdon from this spot a road more resembling the drive through a park than a public thoroughfare led him gradually to the brow of dollis hill it was a serene and charming evening and twilight was gently stealing over the face of the country bordered by fine timber the road occasionally offered glimpses of a lovely valley until a wider opening gave a full view of a delightful and varied prospect on the left lay the heights of hampstead studded with villas while farther off a hazy cloud marked the position of the metropolis the stranger concluded he could not be far from his destination and a turn in the road showed him the house beneath two tall elms whose boughs completely overshadowed the roof stood mr woods dwellinga plain substantial commodious farmhouse on a bench at the foot of the trees with a pipe in his mouth and a tankard by his side sat the worthy carpenter looking the picture of goodheartedness and benevolence the progress of time was marked in mr wood by increased corpulence and decreased powers of visionby deeper wrinkles and higher shoulders by scantier breath and a fuller habit still he looked hale and hearty and the country life he led had imparted a ruddier glow to his cheek around him were all the evidences of plenty a world of haystacks beanstacks and strawricks flanked the granges adjoining his habitation the yard was crowded with poultry pigeons were feeding at his feet cattle were being driven towards the stall horses led to the stable a large mastiff was rattling his chain and stalking majestically in front of his kennel while a number of farmingmen were passing and repassing about their various occupations at the back of the house on a bank rose an oldfashioned terracegarden full of appletrees and other fruittrees in blossom and lively with the delicious verdure of early spring hearing the approach of the rider mr wood turned to look at him it was now getting dusk and he could only imperfectly distinguish the features and figure of the stranger i need not ask whether this is mr woods said the latter since i find him at his own gate you are right sir said the worthy carpenter rising i am owen wood at your service you do not remember me i dare say observed the stranger i cant say i do replied wood your voice seems familiar to meandbut im getting a little deafand my eyes dont serve me quite so well as they used to do especially by this light never mind returned the stranger dismounting youll recollect me by and by ive no doubt i bring you tidings of an old friend then youre heartily welcome sir whoever you are pray walk in here jem take the gentlemans horse to the stablesee him dressed and fed directly now sir will you please to follow me mr wood then led the way up a rather high and according to modern notions incommodious flight of steps and introduced his guest to a neat parlour the windows of which were darkened by pots of flowers and creepers there was no light in the room but notwithstanding this the young man did not fail to detect the buxom figure of mrs wood now more buxom and more gorgeously arrayed than everas well as a young and beautiful female in whom he was at no loss to recognise the carpenters daughter winifred wood was now in her twentieth year her features were still slightly marked by the disorder alluded to in the description of her as a childbut that was the only drawback to her beauty their expression was so amiable that it would have redeemed a countenance a thousand times plainer than hers her figure was perfecttall graceful roundedand then she had deep liquid blue eyes that rivalled the stars in lustre on the strangers appearance she was seated near the window busily occupied with her needle my wife and daughter sir said the carpenter introducing them to his guest mrs wood whose admiration for masculine beauty was by no means abated glanced at the wellproportioned figure of the young man and made him a very civil salutation winifreds reception was kind but more distant and after the slight ceremonial she resumed her occupation this gentleman brings us tidings of an old friend my dear said the carpenter ay indeed and who may that be inquired his wife one whom you may perhaps have forgotten replied the stranger but who can never forget the kindness he experienced at your hands or at those of your excellent husband at the sound of his voice every vestige of colour fled from winifreds cheeks and the work upon which she was engaged fell from her hand i have a token to deliver to you continued the stranger addressing her to me gasped winifred this locket he said taking a little ornament attached to a black ribband from his breast and giving it herdo you remember it i doi do cried winifred whats all this exclaimed wood in amazement do you not know me father said the young man advancing towards him and warmly grasping his hand have nine years so changed me that there is no trace left of your adopted son god bless me ejaculated the carpenter rubbing his eyes cancan it be surely screamed mrs wood joining the group it isnt thames darrell come to life again it isit is cried winifred rushing towards him and flinging her arms round his neckit is my deardear brother well this is what i never expected to see said the carpenter wiping his eyes i hope im not dreaming thames my dear boy as soon as winny has done with you let me embrace you my turn comes before yours sir interposed his better half come to my arms thames oh dear oh dear to repeat the questions and congratulations which now ensued or describe the extravagant joy of the carpenter who after he had hugged his adopted son to his breast with such warmth as almost to squeeze the breath from his body capered around the room threw his wig into the empty firegrate and committed various other fantastic actions in order to get rid of his superfluous satisfactionto describe the scarcely less extravagant raptures of his spouse or the more subdued but not less heartfelt delight of winifred would be a needless task as it must occur to every ones imagination supper was quickly served the oldest bottle of wine was brought from the cellar the strongest barrel of ale was tapped but not one of the party could eat or drinktheir hearts were too full thames sat with winifreds hand clasped in his own and commenced a recital of his adventures which may be briefly told carried out to sea by van galgebrok and thrown overboard while struggling with the waves he had been picked up by a french fishingboat and carried to ostend after encountering various hardships and privations for a long time during which he had no means of communicating with england he at length found his way to paris where he was taken notice of by cardinal dubois who employed him as one of his secretaries and subsequently advanced to the service of philip of orleans from whom he received a commission on the death of his royal patron he resolved to return to his own country and after various delays which had postponed it to the present time he had succeeded in accomplishing his object winifred listened to his narration with the profoundest attention and when it concluded her tearful eye and throbbing bosom told how deeply her feelings had been interested the discourse then turned to darrells old playmate jack sheppard and mr wood in deploring his wild career adverted to the melancholy condition to which it had reduced his mother for my part its only what i expected of him observed mrs wood and im sorry and surprised he hasnt swung for his crimes before this the gallows has groaned for him for years as to his mother ive no pity for her she deserves what has befallen her dear mother dont say so returned winifred one of the consequences of criminal conduct is the shame and disgrace whichworse than any punishment the evildoer can sufferis brought by it upon the innocent relatives and if jack had considered this perhaps he would not have acted as he has done and have entailed so much misery on his unhappy parent i always detested mrs sheppard cried the carpenters wife bitterly and i repeat bedlams too good for her my dear observed wood you should be more charitable charitable repeated his wife thats your constant cry marry come up ive been a great deal too charitable heres winny always urging you to go and visit mrs sheppard in the asylum and take her this and send her thatand ive never prevented you though such mistaken liberalitys enough to provoke a saint and then forsooth she must needs prevent your hanging jack sheppard after the robbery in wych street when you might have done so perhaps youll call that charity i call it defeating the ends of justice see what a horrible rascal youve let loose upon the world im sure mother rejoined winifred if any one was likely to feel resentment i was for no one could be more frightened but i was sorry for poor jackas i am still and hoped he would mend mend echoed mrs wood contemptuously hell never mend till he comes to tyburn at least i will hope so returned winifred but as i was saying i was most dreadfully frightened on the night of the robbery though so young at the time i remember every circumstance distinctly i was sitting up lamenting your departure dear thames when hearing an odd noise i went to the landing and by the light of a dark lantern saw jack sheppard stealing up stairs followed by two men with crape on their faces im ashamed to say that i was too much terrified to scream outbut ran and hid myself hold your tongue cried mrs wood i declare you throw me into an ague do you think i forget it didnt they help themselves to all the plate and the moneyto several of my best dresses and amongst others to my favourite kincob gown and ive never been able to get another like it marry come up id hang em all if i could were such a thing to happen again id never let mr wood rest till he brought the villains to justice i hope such a thing never will happen again my dear observed wood mildly but when it does it will be time to consider what course we ought to pursue let them attempt it if they dare cried mrs wood who had worked herself into a passion and ill warrant em the boldest robber among em shall repent it if he comes across me no doubt my dear acquiesced the carpenter no doubt thames who had been more than once on the point of mentioning his accidental rencounter with jack sheppard not being altogether without apprehension from the fact of his being in the neighbourhoodnow judged it more prudent to say nothing on the subject from a fear of increasing mrs woods displeasure and he was the more readily induced to do this as the conversation began to turn upon his own affairs mr wood could give him no further information respecting sir rowland trenchard than what he had obtained from kneebone but begged him to defer the further consideration of the line of conduct he meant to pursue until the morrow when he hoped to have a plan to lay before him of which he would approve the night was now advancing and the party began to think of separating as mrs wood who had recovered her good humour quitted the room she bestowed a hearty embrace on thames and she told him laughingly that she would defer all she had to propose to him until tomorrow tomorrow she never beheld it after an affectionate parting with winifred thames was conducted by the carpenter to his sleeping apartmenta comfortable cosy chamber such a one in short as can only be met with in the country with its dimitycurtained bed its sheets fragrant of lavender its clean white furniture and an atmosphere breathing of freshness left to himself he took a survey of the room and his heart leaped as he beheld over the chimneypiece a portrait of himself it was a copy of the pencil sketch taken of him nine years ago by winifred and awakened a thousand tender recollections when about to retire to rest the rencounter with jack sheppard again recurred to him and he half blamed himself for not acquainting mr wood with the circumstances and putting him upon his guard against the possibility of an attack on weighing the matter over he grew so uneasy that he resolved to descend and inform him of his misgivings but when he got to the door with this intention he became ashamed of his fears and feeling convinced that jackbad as he might bewas not capable of such atrocious conduct as to plunder his benefactor twice he contented himself with looking to the priming of his pistols and placing them near him to be ready in case of need he threw himself on the bed and speedily fell asleep chapter ii the burglary at dollis hill thames darrells fears were not however groundless danger in the form he apprehended was lurking outside nor was he destined to enjoy long repose on receiving the warning note from the ostler jack sheppard and his companion left willesden and takingas a blindthe direction of harrow returned at nightfall by a bylane to neasdon and put up at a little publichouse called the spotted dog here they remained till midnight when calling for their reckoning and their steeds they left the house it was a night wellfitted to their enterprise calm still and profoundly dark as they passed beneath the thick trees that shade the road to dollis hill the gloom was almost impenetrable the robbers proceeded singly and kept on the grass skirting the road so that no noise was made by their horses feet as they neared the house jack sheppard who led the way halted and addressed his companion in a low voice i dont half like this job blueskin he said it always went against the grain but since ive seen the friend and companion of my childhood thames darrell ive no heart for it shall we turn back and disappoint mr wild captain remonstrated the other in a deferential tone you know this is a pet project it might be dangerous to thwart him pish cried jack i dont value his anger a straw all our fraternity are afraid of him but i laugh at his threats he darent quarrel with me and if he does let him look to himself ive my own reasons for disliking this job well you know i always act under your orders captain returned blueskin and if you give the word to retreat i shall obey of course but i know what edgeworth bess will say when we go home emptyhanded why what will she say inquired sheppard that we were afraid replied the other but never mind her ay but i do mind her cried jack upon whom his comrades observation had produced the desired effect well do it thats right captain rejoined blueskin you pledged yourself to mr wild i did interrupted jack and i never yet broke an engagement though a thief jack sheppard is a man of his word to be sure he is acquiesced blueskin i should like to meet the man who would dare to gainsay it one word before we begin blueskin said jack authoritatively in case the family should be alarmedmind no violence theres one person in the house whom i wouldnt frighten for the world woods daughter i suppose observed the other youve hit it answered sheppard what say you to carrying her off captain suggested blueskin if youve a fancy for the girl we might do it nono laughed jack bess wouldnt bear a rival but if you wish to do old wood a friendly turn you may bring his wife i shouldnt mind ridding him of her said blueskin gruffly and if she comes in my way may the devil seize me if i dont make short work with her you forget rejoined jack sternly ive just said ill have no violencemind that with this they dismounted and fastening their horses to a tree proceeded towards the house it was still so dark that nothing could be distinguished except the heavy masses of timber by which the premises were surrounded but as they advanced lights were visible in some of the windows presently they came to a wall on the other side of which the dog began to bark violently but blueskin tossed him a piece of prepared meat and uttering a low growl he became silent they then clambered over a hedge and scaling another wall got into the garden at the back of the house treading with noiseless step over the soft mould they soon reached the building arrived there jack felt about for a particular window and having discovered the object of his search and received the necessary implements from his companion he instantly commenced operations in a few seconds the shutter flew openthen the windowand they were in the room jack now carefully closed the shutters while blueskin struck a light with which he set fire to a candle the room they were in was a sort of closet with the door locked outside but this was only a moments obstacle to jack who with a chisel forced back the bolt the operation was effected with so much rapidity and so little noise that even if any one had been on the alert he could scarcely have detected it they then took off their boots and crept stealthily up stairs treading upon the point of their toes so cautiously that not a board creaked beneath their weight pausing at each door on the landing jack placed his ear to the keyhole and listened intently having ascertained by the breathing which room thames occupied he speedily contrived to fasten him in he then tried the door of mr woods bedchamberit was locked with the key left in it this occasioned a little delay but jack whose skill as a workman in the particular line he had chosen was unequalled and who laughed at difficulties speedily cut out a panel by means of a centrebit and knife took the key from the other side and unlocked the door covering his face with a crape mask and taking the candle from his associate jack entered the room and pistol in hand stepped up to the bed and approached the light to the eyes of the sleepers the loud noise proceeding from the couch proved that their slumbers were deep and real and unconscious of the danger in which she stood mrs wood turned over to obtain a more comfortable position during this movement jack grasped the barrel of his pistol held in his breath and motioned to blueskin who bared a long knife to keep still the momentary alarm over he threw a piece ofwash leather over a bureau so as to deaden the sound and instantly broke it open with a small crowbar while he was filling his pockets with golden coin from this store blueskin had pulled the platechest from under the bed and having forced it open began filling a canvass bag with its contentssilver coffeepots chocolatedishes waiters trays tankards goblets and candlesticks it might be supposed that these articles when thrust together into the bag would have jingled but these skilful practitioners managed matters so well that no noise was made after rifling the room of everything portable including some of mrs woods ornaments and wearing apparel they prepared to depart jack then intimated his intention of visiting winifreds chamber in which several articles of value were known to be kept but as notwithstanding his reckless character he still retained a feeling of respect for the object of his boyish affections he would not suffer blueskin to accompany him so he commanded him to keep watch over the sleepersstrictly enjoining him however to do them no injury again having recourse to the centrebitfor winifreds door was lockedjack had nearly cut out a panel when a sudden outcry was raised in the carpenters chamber the next moment a struggle was heard and blueskin appeared at the door followed by mrs wood jack instandly extinguished the light and called to his comrade to come after him but blueskin found it impossible to make offat least with the spoilmrs wood having laid hold of the canvassbag give back the things cried the lady helphelp mr wood leave go thundered blueskinleave goyoud betterand he held the sack as firmly as he could with one hand while with the other he searched for his knife no i wont leave go screamed mrs wood firemurderthievesive got one of em come along cried jack i cant answered blueskin this shedevil has got hold of the sack leave go i tell you and he forced open the knife with his teeth helpmurderthieves screamed mrs woodowenowenthames help coming cried mr wood leaping from the bed where are you here replied mrs wood helpill hold him leave her cried jack darting down stairs amid a furious ringing of bellsthe house is alarmedfollow me curses light on you cried blueskin savagely since you wont be advised take your fate and seizing her by the hair he pulled back her head and drew the knife with all his force across her throat there was a dreadful stifled groan and she fell heavily upon the landing the screams of the unfortunate woman had aroused thames from his slumbers snatchingup his pistols he rushed to the door but to his horror found it fastened he heard the struggle on the landing the fall of the heavy body the groanand excited almost to frenzy by his fears he succeeded in forcing open the door by this time several of the terrified domestics appeared with lights a terrible spectacle was presented to the young mans gazethe floor deluged with bloodthe mangled and lifeless body of mrs woodwinifred fainted in the arms of a female attendantand wood standing beside them almost in a state of distraction thus in a few minutes had this happy family been plunged into the depths of misery at this juncture a cry was raised by a servant from below that the robbers were flying through the garden darting to a window looking in that direction thames threw it up and discharged both his pistols but without effect in another minute the tramp of horses feet told that the perpetrators of the outrage had effected their escape chapter iii jack sheppards quarrel with jonathan wild scarcely an hour after the horrible occurrence just related as jonathan wild was seated in the audiencechamber of his residence at the old bailey occupied like peachum for whose portrait he sat with his accountbooks and registers he was interrupted by the sudden entrance of quilt arnold who announced jack sheppard and blueskin ah cried wild laying down his pen and looking up with a smile of satisfaction i was just thinking of you jack what news have you done the trick at dollis hillbrought off the swageh no answered jack flinging himself sullenly into a chair ive not why hows this exclaimed jonathan jack sheppard failed id not believe it if any one but himself told me so iv not failed returned jack angrily but weve done too much im no reader of riddles said jonathan speak plainly let this speak for me said sheppard tossing a heavy bag of money towards him you can generally understand that language theres more than i undertook to bring it has been purchased by blood what have you cut old woods throat asked wild with great unconcern as he took up the bag if i had youd not have seen me here replied jack sullenly the blood that has been spilt is that of his wife it was her own fault observed blueskin moodily she wouldnt let me go i did it in selfdefence i care not why you did it said jack sternly we work together no more come come captain remonstrated blueskin i thought youd have got rid of your illhumour by this time you know as well as i do that it was accident accident or not rejoined sheppard youre no longer pall of mine and so this is my reward for having made you the tiptop cracksman you are muttered blueskinto be turned off at a moments notice because i silenced a noisy woman its too hard think better of it my minds made up rejoined jack coldlywe part tonight ill not go answered the other i love you like a son and will follow you like a dog youd not know what to do without me and shant drive me off well remarked jonathan who had paid little attention to the latter part of the conversation this is an awkward business certainly but we must do the best we can in it you must keep out of the way till its blown over i can accommodate you below i dont require it returned sheppard im tired of the life im leading i shall quit it and go abroad ill go with you said blueskin before either of you go you will ask my permission said jonathan coolly how exclaimed sheppard do you mean to say you will interfere i mean to say this interrupted wild with contemptuous calmness that ill neither allow you to leave england nor the profession youve engaged in i wouldnt allow you to be honest even if you could be sowhich i doubt you are my slaveand such you shall continue slave echoed jack dare to disobey continued jonathan neglect my orders and i will hang you sheppard started to his feet hear me he cried restraining himself with difficulty it is time you should know whom you have to deal with henceforth i utterly throw off the yoke you have laid upon me i will neither stir hand nor foot for you more attempt to molest me and i split you are more in my power than i am in yours jack sheppard is a match for jonathan wild any day that he is added blueskin approvingly jonathan smiled contemptuously one motive alone shall induce me to go on with you said jack whats that asked wild the youth whom you delivered to van galgebrokthames darrell is returned impossible cried jonathan he was thrown overboard and perished at sea he is alive replied jack i have seen him and might have conversed with him if i had chosen now i know you can restore him to his rights if you choose do so and i am yours as heretofore humph exclaimed jonathan your answer cried sheppard yes or no i will make no terms with you rejoined wild sternly you have defied me and shall feel my power you have been useful to me or i would not have spared you thus long i swore to hang you two years ago but i deferred my purpose deferred echoed sheppard hear me out said jonathan you came hither under my protection and you shall depart freelynay more you shall have an hours grace after that time i shall place my setters on your heels you cannot prevent my departure replied jack dauntlessly and therefore your offer is no favour but i tell you in return i shall take no pains to hide myself if you want me you know where to find me an hour said jonathan looking at his watchremember if you send for me to the cross shovels in the mint where im going with blueskin i will surrender myself without resistance returned jack you will spare the officers a labour then rejoined jonathan cant i settle this business captain muttered blueskin drawing a pistol dont harm him said jack carelessly he dares not do it so saying he left the room blueskin said jonathan as that worthy was about to follow i advise you to remain with me no answered the ruffian moodily if you arrest him you must arrest me also as you will said jonathan seating himself jack and his comrade went to the mint where he was joined by edgeworth bess with whom he sat down most unconcernedly to supper his revelry however was put an end at the expiration of the time mentioned by jonathan by the entrance of a posse of constables with quilt arnold and abraham mendez at their head jack to the surprise of all his companions at once surrendered himself but blueskin would have made a fierce resistance and attempted a rescue if he had not been ordered by his leader to desist he then made off edgeworth bess who passed for sheppards wife was secured they were hurried before a magistrate and charged by jonathan wild with various robberies but as jack sheppard stated that he had most important disclosures to make as well as charges to bring forward against his accuser he was committed with his female companion to the new prison in clerkenwell for further examination chapter iv jack sheppards escape from the new prison in consequence of jack sheppards desperate character it was judged expedient by the keeper of the new prison to load him with fetters of unusual weight and to place him in a cell which from its strength and security was called the newgate ward the ward in which he was confined was about six yards in length and three in width and in height might be about twelve feet the windows which were about nine feet from the floor had no glass but were secured by thick iron bars and an oaken beam along the floor ran an iron bar to which jacks chain was attached so that he could move along it from one end of the chamber to the other no prisoner except edgeworth bess was placed in the same cell with him jack was in excellent spirits and by his wit drollery and agreeable demeanour speedily became a great favourite with the turnkey who allowed him every indulgence consistent with his situation the report of his detention caused an immense sensation numberless charges were preferred against him amongst others information was lodged of the robbery at dollis hill and murder of mrs wood and a large reward offered for the apprehension of blueskin and as in addition to this jack had threatened to impeach wild his next examination was looked forward to with the greatest interest the day before this examination was appointed to take placethe third of the prisoners detentionan old man respectably dressed requested permission to see him jacks friends were allowed to visit him but as he had openly avowed his intention of attempting an escape their proceedings were narrowly watched the old man was conducted to jacks cell by the turnkey who remained near him during their interview he appeared to be a stranger to the prisoner and the sole motive of his visit curiosity after a brief conversation which sheppard sustained with his accustomed liveliness the old man turned to bess and addressed a few words of commonplace gallantry to her while this was going on jack suddenly made a movement which attracted the turnkeys attention and during that interval the old man slipped some articles wrapped in a handkerchief into besss hands who instantly secreted them in her bosom the turnkey looked round the next moment but the manoeuvre escaped his observation after a little further discourse the old man took his departure left alone with edgeworth bess jack burst into a loud laugh of exultation blueskins a friend in need he said his disguise was capital but i detected it in a moment has he given you the tools he has replied bess producing the handkerchief bravo cried sheppard examining its contents which proved to be a file a chisel two or three gimblets and a piercer jonathan wild shall find its not easy to detain me as sure as he is now living ill pay him a visit in the old bailey before morning and then ill pay off old scores its almost worth while being sent to prison to have the pleasure of escaping i shall now be able to test my skill and running on in this way he carefully concealed the tools whether the turnkey entertained any suspicion of the old man jack could not tell but that night he was more than usually rigorous in his search and having carefully examined the prisoners and finding nothing to excite his suspicions he departed tolerably satisfied as soon as he was certain he should be disturbed no more jack set to work and with the aid of the file in less than an hour had freed himself from his fetters with besss assistance he then climbed up to the window which as has just been stated was secured by iron bars of great thickness crossed by a stout beam of oak the very sight of these impediments would have appalled a less courageous spirit than sheppardsbut nothing could daunt him to work then he went and with wonderful industry filed off two of the iron bars just as he completed this operation the file broke the oaken beam nine inches in thickness was now the sole but most formidable obstacle to his flight with his gimblet he contrived to bore a number of holes so close together that at last one end of the bar being completely pierced through yielded and pursuing the same with the other extremity it fell out altogether this last operation was so fatiguing that for a short time he was obliged to pause to recover the use of his fingers he then descended and having induced bess to take off some part of her clothing he tore the gown and petticoat into shreds and twisted them into a sort of rope which he fastened to the lower bars of the window with some difficulty he contrived to raise her to the window and with still greater difficulty to squeeze her through ither bulk being much greater than his own he then made a sort of running noose passed it over her body and taking firmly hold of the bars prepared to guide her descent but bess could scarcely summon resolution enough to hazard the experiment and it was only on jacks urgent intreaties and even threats that she could be prevailed on to trust herself to the frail tenure of the rope he had prepared at length however she threw herself off and jack carefully guiding the rope she landed in safety the next moment he was by her side but the great point was still unaccomplished they had escaped from the new prison it is true but the wall of clerkenwell bridewell by which that jail was formerly surrounded and which was more than twenty feet high and protected by formidable and bristling chevaux de frise remained to be scaled jack however had an expedient for mastering this difficulty he ventured to the great gates and by inserting his gimblets into the wood at intervals so as to form points upon which he could rest his foot he contrived to ascend them and when at the top having fastened a portion of his dress to the spikes he managed not without considerable risk to draw up his female companion once over the iron spikes bess exhibited no reluctance to be let down on the other side of the wall having seen his mistress safe down jack instantly descended leaving the best part of his clothes as a memorial of his flight to the jailor and thus he effected his escape from the new prison chapter v the disguise in a hollow in the meadows behind the prison whence jack sheppard had escapedfor at this time the whole of the now thicklypeopled district north of clerkenwell bridewell was open country stretching out in fertile fields in the direction of islingtonand about a quarter of a mile off stood a solitary hovel known as black marys hole this spot which still retains its name acquired the appellation from an old crone who lived there and who in addition to a very equivocal character for honesty enjoyed the reputation of being a witch without inquiring into the correctness of the latter part of the story it may be sufficient to state that black mary was a person in whom jack sheppard thought he could confide and as edgeworth bess was incapable of much further exertion he determined to leave her in the old womans care till the following night while he shifted for himself and fulfilled his designfor however rash or hazardous a project might be if once conceived jack always executed itof visiting jonathan wild at his house in the old bailey it was precisely two oclock on the morning of whitmonday the th of may when the remarkable escape before detailed was completed and though it wanted full two hours to daybreak the glimmer of a waning moon prevented it from being totally dark casting a hasty glance as he was about to turn an angle of the wall at the great gates and upper windows of the prison and perceiving no symptoms of pursuit jack proceeded towards the hovel at a very deliberate pace carefully assisting his female companion over every obstacle in the road and bearing her in his arms when as was more than once the case she sank from fright and exhaustion in this way he crossed one or two public gardens and a bowlinggreenthe neighbourhood of clerkenwell then abounded in such places of amusementpassed the noted ducking pond where black mary had been frequently immersed and striking off to the left across the fields arrived in a few minutes at his destination descending the hollow or rather excavationfor it was an old disused claypit at the bottom of which the cottage was situatedhe speedily succeeded in arousing the ancient sibyl and having committed edgeworth bess to her care with a promise of an abundant reward in case she watched diligently over her safety and attended to her comforts till his returnto all which black mary readily agreedhe departed with a heart lightened of half its load jacks first object was to seek out blueskin whom he had no doubt he should find at the new mint at wapping for the old mint no longer afforded a secure retreat to the robber and with this view he made the best of his way along a byelane leading towards hockleyinthehole he had not proceeded far when he was alarmed by the tramp of a horse which seemed to be rapidly approaching and he had scarcely time to leap the hedge and conceal himself behind a tree when a tall man enveloped in an ample cloak with his hat pulled over his brows rode by at full speed another horseman followed quickly at the heels of the first but just as he passed the spot where jack stood his steed missed its footing and fell either ignorant of the accident or heedless of it the foremost horseman pursued his way without even turning his head conceiving the opportunity too favourable to be lost jack sprang suddenly over the hedge and before the man who was floundering on the ground with one foot in the stirrup could extricate himself from his embarrassing position secured his pistols which he drew from the holsters and held them to his head the fellow swore lustily in a voice which jack instantly recognised as that of quilt arnold and vainly attempted to rise and draw his sword dog thundered sheppard putting the muzzle of the pistol so close to the janizarys ear that the touch of the cold iron made him start dont you know me blood and thunder exclaimed quilt opening his eyes with astonishment it cant be captain sheppard it is replied jack and you had better have met the devil on your road than me do you remember what i said when you took me at the mint four days ago i told you my turn would come it has comeand sooner than you expected so i find captain rejoined quilt submissively but youre too noblehearted to take advantage of my situation besides i acted for others and not for myself i know it replied sheppard and therefore i spare your life i was sure you wouldnt injure me captain remarked quilt in a wheedling tone while he felt about for his sword youre far too brave to strike a fallen man ah traitor cried jack who had noticed the movement make such another attempt and it shall cost you your life so saying he unbuckled the belt to which the janizarys hanger was attached and fastened it to his own girdle and now he continued sternly was it your master who has just ridden by no answered quilt sullenly who then demanded jack speak or i fire well if you will have it its sir rowland trenchard sir rowland trenchard echoed jack in amazement what are you doing with him its a long story captain and ive no breath to tell itunless you choose to release me rejoined quilt get up then said jack freeing his foot from the stirrup nowbegin quilt however seemed unwilling to speak i should be sorry to proceed to extremities continued sheppard again raising the pistol well since you force me to betray my masters secrets replied quilt sullenly ive ridden express to manchester to deliver a message to sir rowland respecting thames darrell observed jack why how the devil did you happen to guess that cried the janizary no matter replied sheppard im glad to find im right you informed sir rowland that thames darrell was returned exactly so replied quilt and he instantly decided upon returning to london with me weve ridden post all the way and im horribly tired or you wouldnt have mastered me so easily perhaps not replied jack to whom an idea had suddenly occurred now sir ill trouble you for your coat ive left mine on the spikes of the new prison and must borrow yours why surely you cant be in earnest captain you wouldnt rob mr wilds chief janizary id rob mr wild himself if i met him retorted jack come off with it sirrah or ill blow out your brains in the first place and strip you afterwards well rather than you should commit so great a crime captain here it is replied quilt handing him the garment in question anything else your waistcoat zounds captain i shall get my death of cold i was in hopes youd be content with my hat and wig i shall require them as well rejoined sheppard and your boots my boots fire and fury they wont fit you they are too large besides how am i to ride home without them dont distress yourself returned jack you shall walk now he added as his commands were reluctantly obeyed help me on with them quilt knelt down as if he meant to comply but watching his opportunity he made a sudden grasp at sheppards leg with the intention of overthrowing him but jack was too nimble for him striking out his foot he knocked half a dozen teeth down the janizarys throat and seconding the kick with a blow on the head from the buttend of the pistol stretched him senseless and bleeding on the ground like master like man observed jack as he rolled the inanimate body to the side of the road from jonathan wilds confidential servant what could be expected but treachery with this he proceeded to dress himself in quilt arnolds clothes pulled the wig over his face and eyes so as completely to conceal his features slouched the hat over his brows drew the huge boots above his knees and muffled himself up in the best way he could on searching the coat he found amongst other matters a mask a key and a pocketbook the latter appeared to contain several papers which jack carefully put by in the hope that they might turn out of importance in a scheme of vengeance which he meditated against the thieftaker he then mounted the jaded hack which had long since regained its legs and was quietly browsing the grass at the roadside and striking spurs into its side rode off he had not proceeded far when he encountered sir rowland who having missed his attendant had returned to look after him what has delayed you demanded the knight impatiently my horse has had a fall replied jack assuming to perfectionfor he was a capital mimicthe tones of quilt arnold it was some time before i could get him to move i fancied i heard voices rejoined sir rowland so did i answered jack we had better move on this is a noted place for highwaymen i thought you told me that the rascal who has so long been the terror of the townjack sheppardwas in custody so he is returned jack but theres no saying how long he may remain so besides there are greater rascals than jack sheppard at liberty sir rowland sir rowland made no reply but angrily quickened his pace the pair then descended saffronhill threaded fieldlane and entering holborn passed over the little bridge which then crossed the muddy waters of fleetditch mounted snowhill and soon drew in the bridle before jonathan wilds door aware of quilt arnolds mode of proceeding jack instantly dismounted and instead of knocking opened the door with the passkey the porter instantly made his appearance and sheppard ordered him to take care of the horses well what sort of journey have you had quilt asked the man as he hastened to assist sir rowland to dismount oh weve lost no time as you perceive replied jack is the governor within yes youll find him in the audiencechamber he has got blueskin with him ah indeed whats he doing here inquired jack come to buy off jack sheppard i suppose replied the fellow but it wont do mr wild has made up his mind and when thats the case all the persuasion on earth wont turn him jack will be tried tomorrow and as sure as my names obadiah lemon hell take up his quarters at the kingshead pointing to newgate over the way well we shall see replied jack look to the horses obadiah this way sir rowland as familiar as quilt arnold himself with every part of wilds mysterious abode as well as with the ways of its inmates jack without a moments hesitation took up a lamp which was burning in the hall and led his companion up the great stone stairs arrived at the audiencechamber he set down the light upon a stand threw open the door and announced in a loud voice but with the perfect intonation of the person he representedsir rowland trenchard jonathan who was engaged in conversation with blueskin instantly arose and bowed with cringing ceremoniousness to the knight the latter haughtily returned his salutation and flung himself as if exhausted into a chair youve arrived sooner than i expected sir rowland observed the thieftaker lost no time on the roadehi didnt expect you till tomorrow at the earliest excuse me an instant while i dismiss this personyouve your answer blueskin he added pushing that individual who seemed unwilling to depart towards the door its useless to urge the matter further jack is registered in the black book one word before i go urged blueskin not a syllable replied wild if you talk as long as an old bailey counsel youll not alter my determination wont my life do as well as his supplicated the other humph exclaimed jonathan doubtfully and you would surrender yourselfeh ill surrender myself at once if youll engage to bring him off and youll get the reward from old wood its two hundred pounds recollect that faithful fellow murmured jack i forgive him his disobedience will you do it persisted blueskin no replied wild and ive only listened to your absurd proposal to see how far your insane attachment to this lad would carry you i do love him cried blueskin and thats the long and short of it ive taught him all he can do and there isnt his fellow and never will be again ive seen many a clever cracksman but never one like him if you hang jack sheppard youll cut off the flower o the purfession but ill not believe it of you its all very well to read him a lesson and teach him obedience but youve gone far enough for that not quite rejoined the thieftaker significantly well growled blueskin youve had my offer and you my warning retorted wild good night blueskin whispered jack in his natural tones as the other passed him wait without power o mercy cried blueskin starting whats the matter demanded jonathan harshly nothinnothin returned blueskin only i thought you saw the hangman no doubt said jack take courage man it is only quilt arnold come make yourself scarce dont you see mr wilds busy and then he added in an under tone conceal yourself outside and be within call blueskin nodded and left the room jack affected to close the door but left it slightly ajar what did you say to him inquired jonathan suspiciously i advised him not to trouble you farther about jack sheppard answered the supposed janizary he seems infatuated about the lad observed wild i shall be obliged to hang him to keep him company and now sir rowland he continued turning to the knight to our own concerns its a long time since we met eight years and more i hope youve enjoyed your health slife you are wonderfully altered i should scarcely have known you the knight was indeed greatly changed though not much passed the middle term of life he seemed prematurely stricken with old age his frame was wasted and slightly bent his eyes were hollow his complexion haggard and his beard which had remained unshorn during his hasty journey was perfectly white his manner however was as stern and haughty as ever and his glances retained their accustomed fire i did not come hither to consult you as to the state of my health sir he observed displeased by jonathans allusion to the alteration in his appearance true replied wild you were no doubt surprised by the unlookedfor intelligence i sent you of your nephews return was it unlookedfor on your part demanded the knight distrustfully on my soul yes rejoined jonathan i should as soon have expected the bones of tom sheppard to reunite themselves and walk out of that case as thames darrell to return the skipper van galgebrok affirmed to menay gave me the additional testimony of two of his crewthat he was thrown overboard but it appears he was picked up by fishermen and carried to france where he has remained ever since and where it would have been well for him if he had remained altogether have you seen him asked trenchard i have replied wild and nothing but the evidence of my senses would have made me believe he was living after the positive assurance i received to the contrary he is at present with mr woodthe person whom you may remember adopted himat dollis hill near willesden and its a singular but fortunate circumstance so far as we are concerned that mrs wood chanced to be murdered by blueskin the fellow who just left the room on the very night of his return as it has thrown the house into such confusion and so distracted them that he has had no time as yet for hostile movements and what course do you propose to pursue in reference to him asked sir rowland my plan is a very simple one rejoined the thieftaker smiling bitterly i would treat him as you treated his father sir rowland murder him cried trenchard shuddering ay murder him if you like the term returned wild i should call it putting him out of the way but no matter how you phrase it the end is the same i cannot consent to it replied sir rowland firmly since the sea has spared him i will spare him it is in vain to struggle against the arm of fate i will shed no more blood and perish upon the gibbet rejoined jonathan contemptuously flight is still left me replied trenchard i can escape to france and do you think ill allow you to depart cried jonathan in a menacing tone and compromise my safety no no we are linked together in this matter and must go through with it you cannotshall not retreat death and hell cried sir rowland rising and drawing his sword do you think you can shackle my free will villain in this particular instance i do sir rowland replied jonathan calmly because you are wholly in my power but be patient i am your fast friend thames darrell must die our mutual safety requires it leave the means to me more blood more blood cried trenchard passing his hand with agony across his brow shall i never banish those horrible phantoms from my couchthe father with his bleeding breast and dripping hairthe mother with her wringing hands and looks of vengeance and reproachand must another be added to their numbertheir son horrorlet me be spared this new crime and yet the gibbetmy name tarnishedmy escutcheon blotted by the hangmanno i cannot submit to that i should think not observed jonathan who had some practice in the knights moods and knew how to humour him its a miserable weakness to be afraid of bloodshedthe general who gives an order for wholesale carnage never sleeps a wink the less soundly for the midnight groans of his victims and we should deride him as a coward if he did and life is much the same whether taken in battle on the couch or by the roadside besides those whom ive slain with my own hands ive brought upwards of thirty persons to the gallows most of their relics are in yonder cases but i dont remember that any of them have disturbed my rest the mode of destruction makes no difference its precisely the same thing to me to bid my janizaries cut thames darrells throat as to order jack sheppards execution as jonathan said this jacks hand involuntarily sought a pistol but to the point continued wild unconscious of the peril in which the remark had placed himto the point on the terms that procured your liberation from newgate i will free you from this new danger those terms were a third of my estate observed trenchard bitterly what of that rejoined jonathan any price was better than your head if thames darrell escapes you will lose both life and property true true replied the knight with an agonized look there is no alternative none whatever rejoined wild is it a bargain take half of my estatetake allmy life if you willi am weary of it cried trenchard passionately no replied jonathan ill not take you at your word as regards the latter proposition we shall both i hope live to enjoy our shareslong after thames darrell is forgottenha ha a third of your estate i accept and as these things should always be treated as matters of business ill just draw up a memorandum of our arrangement and as he spoke he took up a sheet of paper and hastily traced a few lines upon it sign this he said pushing the document towards sir rowland the knight mechanically complied with his request enough cried jonathan eagerly pocketing the memorandum and now in return for your liberality ill inform you of a secret with which it is important you should be acquainted a secret exclaimed trenchard concerning whom mrs sheppard replied jonathan mysteriously mrs sheppard echoed jack surprised out of his caution ah exclaimed wild looking angrily towards his supposed attendant i beg pardon sir replied jack with the accent and manner of the janizary i was betrayed into the exclamation by my surprise that anything in which sir rowland trenchard was interested could have reference to so humble a person as mrs sheppard be pleased then in future not to let your surprise find vent in words rejoined jonathan sternly my servants like eastern mutes must have eyes and earsand hands if need bebut no tongues you understand me sirrah perfectly replied jack im dumb your secret demanded trenchard impatiently i need not remind you sir rowland replied wild that you had two sistersaliva and constance both are dead observed the knight gloomily not so answered wild constance is yet living constance alive impossible ejaculated trenchard ive proofs to the contrary replied jonathan if this is the case where is she in bedlam replied the thieftaker with a satanic grin gracious heaven exclaimed the knight upon whom a light seemed suddenly to break you mentioned mrs sheppard what has she to with constance trenchard mrs sheppard is constance trenchard replied jonathan maliciously here jack sheppard was unable to repress an exclamation of astonishment again cried jonathan sternly beware what vociferated trenchard my sister the wife of one condemned felon the parent of another it cannot be it is so nevertheless replied wild stolen by a gipsy when scarcely five years old constance trenchard after various vicissitudes was carried to london where she lived in great poverty with the dregs of society it is useless to trace out her miserable career though i can easily do so if you require it to preserve herself however from destitution or what she considered worse she wedded a journeyman carpenter named sheppard alas that one so highly born should submit to such a degradation groaned the knight i see nothing surprising in it rejoined jonathan in the first place she had no knowledge of her birth and consequently no false pride to get rid of in the second she was wretchedly poor and assailed by temptations of which you can form no idea distress like hers might palliate far greater offences than she ever committed with the same inducements we should all do the same thing poor girl she was beautiful once so beautiful as to make me who care little for the allurements of women fancy myself enamoured of her jack sheppard again sought his pistol and was only withheld from levelling it at the thieftakers head by the hope that he might gather some further information respecting his mother and he had good reason before long to congratulate himself on his forbearance what proof have you of the truth of this story inquired trenchard this replied jonathan taking a paper from a portfolio and handing it to the knight this written evidence signed by martha cooper the gipsy by whom the girl was stolen and who was afterwards executed for a similar crime it is attested you will observe by the reverend mr purney the present ordinary of newgate i am acquainted with mr purneys handwriting said jack advancing and can at once decide whether this is a forgery or not look at it then said wild giving him the portfolio its the ordinarys signature undoubtedly replied jack and as he gave back the portfolio to sir rowland he contrived unobserved to slip the precious document into his sleeve and from thence into his pocket and does any of our bright blood flow in the veins of a ruffianly housebreaker cried trenchard with a look of bewilderment ill not believe it others may if you wont muttered jack retiring thank heaven im not basely born now mark me said jonathan and youll find i dont do things by halves by your father sir montacute trenchards will you are awareand therefore i need not repeat it except for the special purpose i have in viewyou are aware i say that by this will in case your sister aliva died without issue or on the death of such issue the property reverts to constance and her issue i hear said sir rowland moodily and i muttered jack thames darrell once destroyed pursued jonathan constanceor rather mrs sheppardbecomes entitled to the estates which eventuallyprovided he escaped the gallowswould descend to her son ha exclaimed jack drawing in his breath and leaning forward with intense curiosity well sir gasped sir rowland but this need give you no uneasiness pursued jonathan mrs sheppard as i told you is in bedlam an incurable maniac while her son is in the new prison whence he will only be removed to newgate and tyburn so you think muttered jack between his ground teeth to make your mind perfectly easy on the score of mrs sheppard continued jonathan after weve disposed of thames darrell ill visit her in bedlam and as i understand i form one of her chief terrors ill give her such a fright that ill engage she shant long survive it devil muttered jack again grasping his pistol but feeling secure of vengeance he determined to abide his time and now having got rid of the minor obstacles said jonathan ill submit a plan for the removal of the main difficulty thames darrell ive said is at mr woods at dollis hill wholly unsuspicious of any designs against him and in fact entirely ignorant of your being acquainted with his return or even of his existence in this state it will be easy to draw him into a snare tomorrow nightor rather tonight for we are fast verging on another dayi propose to lure him out of the house by a stratagem which i am sure will prove infallible and then what so easy as to knock him on the head to make sure work of it ill superintend the job myself before midnight ill answer for it it shall be done my janizaries shall go with me you hear what i say quilt he added looking at jack i do replied sheppard abraham mendez will like the taskfor he has entertained a hatred to the memory of thames darrell ever since he received the wound in the head when the two lads attempted to break out of st giless roundhouse ive despatched him to the new prison but i expect him back every minute the new prison exclaimed sheppard what is he gone there for with a message to the turnkey to look after his prisoner replied wild with a cunning smile jack sheppard had a visitor i understand yesterday and may make an attempt to escape its as well to be on the safe side it is replied jack at this moment his quick ears detected the sound of footsteps on the stairs he drew both his pistols and prepared for a desperate encounter there is another mystery i would have solved said trenchard addressing wild you have told me much but not enough what do you require further asked jonathan the name and rank of thames darrells father said the knight another time replied the thieftaker evasively i will have it now rejoined trenchard or our agreement is void you cannot help yourself sir rowland replied jonathan contemptuously indeed replied the knight drawing his sword the secret villain or i will force it from you before wild could make any reply the door was thrown violently open and abraham mendez rushed into the room with a face of the utmost consternation he hash eshcaped cried the jew who jack exclaimed jonathan yesh replied abraham i vent to de new prishn and on wishitin his shel vid de turnkey vot should ve find but de shains on de ground de vinder broken and jack and agevorth besh gone damnation cried jonathan stamping his foot with uncontrollable rage id rather have given a thousand pounds than this had happened but he might have broken out of prison and yet not got over the wall of clerkenwell bridewell did you search the yard fool ve did replied abraham and found his fine goat and ruffles torn to shtrips on de shpikes near de creat cate it vosh plain he vent dat vay jonathan gave utterance to a torrent of imprecations while he thus vented his rage the door again opened and quilt arnold rushed into the room bleeding and halfdressed sblood whats this cried jonathan in the utmost surprise quilt arnold is that you it is sir sputtered the janizary ive been robbed maltreated and nearly murdered by jack sheppard by jack sheppard exclaimed the thieftaker yes and i hope youll take ample vengeance upon him said quilt i will when i catch him rely on it rejoined wild you neednt go far to do that returned quilt there he stands ay here i am said jack throwing off his hat and wig and marching towards the group amongst whom there was a general movement of surprise at his audacity sir rowland i salute you as your nephew back villain said the knight haughtily i disown you the whole story of your relationship is a fabrication time will show replied jack with equal haughtiness but however it may turn out i disown you well jack said jonathan who had looked at him with surprise not unmixed with admiration you are a bold and clever fellow i must allow were i not jonathan wild id be jack sheppard im almost sorry ive sworn to hang you but it cant be helped im a slave to my word were i to let you go youd say i feared you besides youve secrets which must not be disclosed nab and quilt to the door jack you are my prisoner and you flatter yourself you can detain me laughed jack at least ill try replied jonathan sarcastically you must be a cleverer lad than even i take you for if you get out of this place what ho blueskin shouted jack here i am captain cried a voice from without and the door was suddenly thrown open and the two janizaries felled to the ground by the strong arm of the stalwart robber your boast you see was a little premature mr wild said sheppard adieu my worthy uncle fortunately ive secured the proof of my birth confusion thundered wild close the doors below loose the dogs curses they dont hear me ill ring the alarmbell and he raised his arm with the intention of executing his purpose when a ball from jacks pistol passed through the back of his hand shattering the limb aha my lad he cried without appearing to regard the pain of the wound now ill show you no quarter and with the uninjured hand he drew a pistol which he fired but without effect at jack fly captain fly vociferated blueskin i shant be able to keep these devils down fly they shall knock me on the headcurse embefore they shall touch you come along cried jack darting through the door the keys on the outsidequick quick instantly alive to this chance blueskin broke away two shots were fired at him by jonathan one of which passed through his hat and the other through the fleshy part of his arm but he made good his retreat the door was closedlockedand the pair were heard descending the stairs hells curses roared jonathan theyll escape not a moment is to be lost so saying he took hold of a ring in the floor and disclosed a flight of steps down which he hurried followed by the janizaries this means of communication instantly brought them to the lobby but jack and his companion were already gone jonathan threw open the streetdoor upon the pavement near the court lay the porter who had been prostrated by a blow from the buttend of a pistol the man who was just able to move pointed towards giltspurstreet jonathan looked in that direction and beheld the fugitives riding off in triumph tonight it is their turn said jonathan binding up his wounded fingers with a handkerchief tomorrow it will be mine chapter vi winifred receives two proposals the tragical affair at dollis hill it need scarcely be said was a dreadful blow to the family mr wood bore up with great fortitude against the shock attended the inquest delivered his evidence with composure and gave directions afterwards for the funeral which took place on the day but one followingsunday as soon however as the last solemn rites were over and the remains of the unfortunate woman committed to their final restingplace in willesden churchyard his firmness completely deserted him and he sank beneath the weight of his affliction it was fortunate that by this time winifred had so far recovered as to be able to afford her father the best and only solace that under the circumstances he could have receivedher personal attentions the necessity which had previously existed of leaving the ghastly evidence of the murderous deed undisturbedthe presence of the mangled corpsethe bustle of the inquest at which her attendance was requiredall these circumstances produced a harrowing effect upon the young girls imagination but when all was over a sorrowful calm succeeded and if not free from grief she was tranquil as to thames though deeply and painfully affected by the horrible occurrence that had marked his return to his old friends he was yet able to control his feelings and devote himself to the alleviation of the distress of the more immediate sufferers by the calamity it was sunday eveninga soft delicious evening and from the happy cheerful look of the house none would have dreamed of the dismal tragedy so lately acted within its walls the birds were singing blithely amid the treesthe lowing of the cows resounded from the yarda delicious perfume from the garden was wafted through the open windowat a distance the churchbells of willesden were heard tolling for evening service all these things spoke of peacebut there are seasons when the pleasantest external influences have a depressing effect on the mind by painfully recalling past happiness so at least thought one of two persons who were seated together in a small backparlour of the house at dollis hill she was a lovely girl attired in deep mourning and having an expression of profound sorrow on her charming features her companion was a portly handsome man also dressed in a full suit of the deepest mourning with the finest of lace at his bosom and wrists and a sword in a black sheath by his side these persons were mr kneebone and winifred the funeral it has just been said took place on that day amongst others who attended the sad ceremony was mr kneebone conceiving himself called upon as the intimate friend of the deceased to pay this last tribute of respect to her memory he appeared as one of the chief mourners overcome by his affliction mr wood had retired to his own room where he had just summoned thames much to her annoyance therefore winifred was left alone with the woollendraper who following up a maxim of his own that nothing was gained by too much bashfulness determined to profit by the opportunity he had only been prevented indeed by a fear of mrs wood from pressing his suit long ago this obstacle removed he thought he might now make the attempt happen what might he could not be in a worse position we have had a sad loss my dear winifred he beganfor i must use the privilege of an old friend and address you by that familiar namewe have had a sad loss in the death of your lamented parent whose memory i shall for ever revere winifreds eyes filled with tears this was not exactly what the woollendraper desired so he resolved to try another tack what a very remarkable thing it is he observed applying to his snuffbox that thames darrell whom we all supposed deadkneebone in his heart sincerely wished he had been soshould turn out to be alive after all strange i shouldnt know him when he called on me it is strange replied winifred artlessly i knew him at once of course rejoined kneebone a little maliciously but thats easily accounted for may i be permitted as a very old and very dear friend of your lamented parent whose loss i shall ever deplore to ask you one question undoubtedly replied winifred and you will answer it frankly certainly now for it thought the woollendraper i shall at least ascertain how the land lieswell then my dear he added aloud do you still entertain the strong attachment you did to captain darrell winifreds cheeks glowed with blushes and fixing her eyes which flashed with resentment upon the questioner she said i have promised to answer your question and i will do so i love him as a brother only as a brother persisted kneebone if winifred remained silent her looks would have disarmed a person of less assurance than the woollendraper if you knew how much importance i attach to your answer he continued passionately you would not refuse me one were captain darrell to offer you his hand would you accept it your impertinence deserves very different treatment sir said winifred but to put an end to this annoyance i will tell youi would not and why not asked kneebone eagerly i will not submit to be thus interrogated said winifred angrily in the name of your lamented parent whose memory i shall for ever revere i implore you to answer me urged kneebone whywhy would you not accept him because our positions are different replied winifred who could not resist this appeal to her feelings you are a paragon of prudence and discretion rejoined the woollendraper drawing his chair closer to hers disparity of rank is ever productive of unhappiness in the married state when captain darrells birth is ascertained ive no doubt hell turn out a noblemans son at least i hope so for his sake as well as my own he added mentally he has quite the air of one and now my angel that i am acquainted with your sentiments on this subject i shall readily fulfil a promise which i made to your lamented parent whose loss i shall ever deplore a promise to my mother said winifred unsuspiciously yes my angel to herrest her soul she extorted it from me and bound me by a solemn oath to fulfil it oh name it you are a party concerned promise me that you will not disobey the injunctions of her whose memory we must both of us ever revere promise me if in my powercertainly but what is it what did you promise to offer you my heart my hand my life replied kneebone falling at her feet sir exclaimed winifred rising inequality of rank can be no bar to our union continued kneebone heaven be praised i am not the son of a nobleman in spite of her displeasure winifred could not help smiling at the absurdity of this address taking this for encouragement her suitor proceeded still more extravagantly seizing her hand he covered it with kisses adorable girl he cried in the most impassioned tone and with the most impassioned look he could command adorable girl i have long loved you to desperation your lamented mother whose loss i shall ever deplore perceived my passion and encouraged it would she were alive to back my suit this is beyond all endurance said winifred striving to withdraw her hand leave me sir i insist never rejoined kneebone with increased ardournever till i receive from your own lips the answer which is to make me the happiest or the most miserable of mankind hear me adorable girl you know not the extent of my devotion no mercenary consideration influences me loveadmiration for your matchless beauty alone sways me let your fatherif he chooses leave all his wealth to his adopted son i care not possessed of you i shall have a treasure such as kings could not boast pray cease this nonsense said winifred and quit the room or i will call for assistance at this juncture the door opened and thames entered the room as the woollendrapers back was towards him he did not perceive him but continued his passionate addresses call as you please beloved girl he cried i will not stir till i am answered you say that you only love captain darrell as a brother mr kneebone that you would not accept him were he to offer be silent sir he then continued the woollendraper is no longer considered how sir cried thames advancing what is the meaning of your reference to my name have you dared to insult this lady if so insult her replied kneebone rising and endeavouring to hide his embarrassment under a look of defiance far from it sir i have made her an honourable proposal of marriage in compliance with the request of her lamented parent whose memory dare to utter that falsehood in my hearing again scoundrel interrupted thames fiercely and i will put it out of your power to repeat the offence leave the room leave the house sir and enter it again at your peril i shall do neither sir replied kneebone unless i am requested by this lady to withdrawin which case i shall comply with her request and you have to thank her presence hotheaded boy that i do not chastise your insolence as it deserves go mr kneebonepray go implored winifred thames i entreat your wishes are my laws beloved girl replied kneebone bowing profoundly captain darren he added sternly you shall hear from me when you please sir said thames coldly and the woollendraper departed what is all this dear winny inquired thames as soon as they were alone nothingnothing she answered bursting into tears dont ask me about it now winny said thames tenderly something which that selfsufficient fool has said has so far done me a service in enabling me to speak upon a subject which i have long had upon my lips but have not had courage to utter thames you seem to doubt my love he continuedyou seem to think that change of circumstances may produce some change in my affections hear me then now before i take one step to establish my origin or secure my rights whatever those rights may be whoever i am my heart is yours do you accept it dear thames forgive this illtimed avowal of my love but answer me am i mistaken is your heart mine it isit is and has ever been replied winifred falling upon his neck lovers confidences should be respected we close the chapter chapter vii jack sheppard warns thames darrell on the following nightnamely mondaythe family assembled together for the first time since the fatal event in the chamber to which thames had been introduced on his arrival at dollis hill as this had been mrs woods favourite sittingroom and her image was so intimately associated with it neither the carpenter nor his daughter could muster courage to enter it before determined however to conquer the feeling as soon as possible wood had given orders to have the evening meal served there but notwithstanding all his good resolutions upon his first entrance he had much ado to maintain his selfcommand his wifes portrait had been removed from the walls and the place it had occupied was only to be known by the cord by which it had been suspended the very blank however affected him more deeply than if it had been left then a handkerchief was thrown over the cage to prevent the bird from singing it was her favourite canary the flowers upon the mantelshelf were withered and droopingshe had gathered them all these circumstancesslight in themselves but powerful in their effecttouched the heart of the widowed carpenter and added to his depression supper was over it had been discussed in silence the cloth was removed and wood drawing the table as near the window as possiblefor it was getting duskput on his spectacles and opened that sacred volume from which the best consolation in affliction is derived and left the loversfor such they may now be fairly termedto their own conversation having already expressed our determination not to betray any confidences of this sort which however interesting to the parties concerned could not possibly be so to others we shall omit also the love passages and proceeding to such topics as may have general interest take up the discourse at the point when thames darrell expressed his determination of starting for manchester as soon as jack sheppards examination had taken place i am surprised we have received no summons for attendance today he remarked perhaps the other robber may be secured or jack have escaped remarked winny i dont think thats likely but this sad affair disposed of i will not rest till i have avenged my murdered parents the avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer said wood who was culling for himself certain texts from the scriptures it is the voice of inspiration said thames and i receive it as a solemn command the villain has enjoyed his security too long bloody and deceitful men shall not live half their days said wood reading aloud another passage and yet he has been spared thus long perhaps with a wise purpose rejoined thames but though the storm has spared him i will not no doubt said wood who had again turned over the leaves of the sacred volume no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he escaped the seas yet vengeance suffereth not to live no feelings of consanguinity shall stay my vengeance said thames sternly i will have no satisfaction but his life thou shalt take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer which is guilty of death but he shall surely be put to death said wood referring to another text do not steel your heart against him dear thames interposed winifred and thine eye shall not pity said her father in a tone of rebuke but life shall be for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot as these words were delivered by the carpenter with stern emphasis a female servant entered the room and stated that a gentleman was at the door who wished to speak with captain darell on business of urgent importance with me said thames who is it he didnt give his name sir replied the maid but hes a young gentleman dont go near him dear thames said winifred he may have some ill intention pshaw cried thames what refuse to see a person who desires to speak with me say i will come to him law miss observed the maid theres nothing mischievous in the persons appearance im sure hes as nice and civilspoken a gentleman as need be by the same token she added in an under tone that he gave me a span new crown piece the thief cometh in the night and the troop of robbers spoileth without said wood who had a text for every emergency lor ha mussy sirhow you do talk said the woman this is no robber im sure i should have known at a glance if it was hes more like a lord than as she spoke steps were heard approaching the door was thrown open and a young man marched boldly into the room the intruder was handsomely even richly attired in a scarlet ridingsuit embroidered with gold a broad belt to which a hanger was attached crossed his shoulders his boots rose above his knee and he carried a laced hat in his hand advancing to the middle of the chamber he halted drew himself up and fixed his dark expressive eyes on thames darrell his appearance excited the greatest astonishment and consternation amid the group winifred screamed thames sprang to his feet and half drew his sword while wood removing his spectacles to assure himself that his eyes did not deceive him exclaimed in a tone and with a look that betrayed the extremity of surprisejack sheppard jack sheppard echoed the maid is this jack sheppard oh la im undone we shall all have our throats cut oh oh and she rushed screaming into the passage where she fell down in a fit the occasion of all this confusion and dismay meanwhile remained perfectly motionless his figure erect and with somewhat of dignity in his demeanour he kept his keen eyes steadily fixed on thames as if awaiting to be addressed your audacity passes belief cried the latter as soon as his surprise would allow him utterance if you have contrived to break out of your confinement villain this is the last place where you ought to show yourself and therefore the first i would visit replied jack boldly but pardon my intrusion i was resolved to see you and fearing you might not come to me i forced my way hither even with certainty of discomposing your friends well villain replied thames i know not the motive of your visit but if you have come to surrender yourself to justice it is well you cannot depart hence cannot echoed jack a slight smile crossing his features but let that pass my motive in coming hither is to serve you and save your life if you choose to requite me by detaining me you are at liberty to do so i shall make no defence that i am not ignorant of the reward offered for my capture this will show he added taking a large placard headed murder from his pocket and throwing it on the floor my demeanour ought to convince you that i came with no hostile intention and to show you that i have no intention of flying i will myself close and lock the door there is the key are you now satisfied no interposed wood furiously i shall never be satisfied till i see you hanged on the highest gibbet at tyburn a time may come when you will be gratified mr wood replied jack calmly may comeit will comeit shall come cried the carpenter shaking his hand menacingly at him i have some difficulty in preventing myself from becoming your executioner oh that i should have nursed such a viper hear me sir said jack no i wont hear you murderer rejoined wood i am no murderer replied sheppard i had no thought of injuring your wife and would have died rather than commit so foul a crime think not to delude me audacious wretch cried the carpenter even if you are not a principal you are an accessory if you had not brought your companion here it would not have happened but you shall swing rascalyou shall swing my conscience acquits me of all share in the offence replied jack humbly but the past is irremediable and i did not come hither to exculpate myself i came to save your life he added turning to thames i was not aware it was in danger rejoined darrell then you ought to be thankful to me for the warning you are in danger from some of your associates from your uncle from my unclesir rowland trenchard what means this idle boasting villain said thames your uncle sir rowland it is no idle boasting replied the other you are cousin to the housebreaker jack sheppard if it were so he would have great reason to be proud of the relationship truly observed wood shrugging his shoulders it is easy to make an assertion like this said thames contemptuously and equally easy to prove it replied jack giving him the paper he had abstracted from wild read that thames hastily cast his eyes over it and transferred it with a look of incredulity to wood gracious heavens this is more wonderful than all the rest cried the carpenter rubbing his eyes thames this is no forgery you believe it father from the bottom of my heart i always thought mrs sheppard superior to her station so did i said winifred let me look at the paper poor soulpoor soul groaned wood brushing the tears from his vision well im glad shes spared this oh jack jack youve much to answer for i have indeed replied sheppard in a tone of contrition if this document is correct continued wood and i am persuaded it is soyou are as unfortunate as wicked see what your misconduct has deprived you ofsee what you might have been this is retribution i feel it replied jack in a tone of agony and i feel it more on my poor mothers account than my own she has suffered enough for you said wood she has she has said jack in a broken voice weep on reprobate cried the carpenter a little softened those tears will do you good do not distress him dear father said winifred he suffers deeply oh jack repent while it is yet time of your evil conduct i will pray for you i cannot repenti cannot pray replied jack recovering his hardened demeanour i should never have been what i am but for you how so inquired winifred i loved you replied jackdont startit is over nowi loved you i say as a boy hopelessly and it made me desperate and now i find when it is too late that i might have deserved youthat i am as well born as thames darrell but i mustnt think of these things or i shall grow mad i have said your life is in danger thames do not slight my warning sir rowland trenchard is aware of your return to england i saw him last night at jonathan wilds after my escape from the new prison he had just arrived from manchester whence he had been summoned by that treacherous thieftaker i overheard them planning your assassination it is to take place tonight o heavens screamed winifred while her father lifted up his hands in silent horror and when i further tell you continued jack that after yourself and my mother i am the next heir to the estates of my grandfather sir montacute trenchard you will perhaps own that my caution is sufficiently disinterested could i credit your wild story i might do so returned thames with a look of perplexity here are jonathan wilds written instructions to quilt arnold rejoined sheppard producing the pocketbook he had found in the janizarys clothes this letter will vouch for me that a communication has taken place between your enemies thames glanced at the despatch and after a moments reflection inquired in what way is the attempt upon my life to be made that i couldnt ascertain replied jack but i advise you to be upon your guard for aught i know they may be in the neighbourhood at this moment here ejaculated wood with a look of alarm oh lord i hope not this i do know continued jackjonathan wild superintends the attack jonathan wild repeated the carpenter trembling then its all over with us oh dearhow sorry i am i ever left wych street we may be all murdered in this unprotected place and nobody be the wiser theres some one in the garden at this moment cried jack i saw a face at the window wherewhere cried thames dont stir replied jack i will at once convince you of the truth of my assertions and ascertain whether the enemy really is at hand so saying he advanced towards the window threw open the sash and called out in the voice of thames darrell whos there he was answered by a shot from a pistol the ball passed over his head and lodged in the ceiling i was right replied jack returning as coolly as if nothing had happened it is jonathan your uncleour uncle is with him i saw them both may i trust you cried thames eagerly you may replied jack ill fight for you to the last gasp follow me then cried thames drawing his sword and springing through the window to the worlds end answered jack darting after him thamesthames cried winifred rushing to the window he will be murderedhelp my childmy love cried wood dragging her forcibly back two shots were fired and presently the clashing of swords was heard below after some time the scuffle grew more and more distant until nothing could be heard wood meanwhile had summoned his menservants and having armed them with such weapons as could be found they proceeded to the garden where the first object they encountered was thames darrell extended on the ground and weltering in his blood of jack sheppard or the assailants they could not discover a single trace as the body was borne to the house in the arms of the farmingmen mr wood fancied he heard the exulting laugh of jonathan wild chapter viii old bedlam when thames darrell and jack sheppard sprang through the window they were instantly assailed by wild trenchard and their attendants jack attacked jonathan with such fury that he drove him into a shrubbery and might perhaps have come off the victor if his foot had not slipped as he made a desperate lunge in this state it would have been all over with him as being stunned by the fall it was some moments before he could recover himself if another party had not unexpectedly come to his rescue this was blueskin who burst through the trees and sword in hand assaulted the thieftaker as soon as jack gained his legs he perceived blueskin lying as he thought dead in the plantation with a severe cut across his temples and while he was stooping to assist him he heard groans at a little distance hastening in the direction of the sound he discovered thames darrell stretched upon the ground are you hurt thames asked jack anxiously not dangerously i hope returned thames but flysave yourself where are the assassins cried sheppard gone replied the wounded man they imagine their work is done but i may yet live to thwart them i will carry you to the house or fetch mr wood urged jack no no rejoined thames flyor i will not answer for your safety if you desire to please me you will go and leave you thus rejoined jack i cannot do it go i insist cried thames or take the consequences upon yourself i cannot protect you thus urged jack reluctantly departed hastening to the spot where he had tied his horse to a tree he vaulted into the saddle and rode off across the fieldsfor he was fearful of encountering the hostile partytill he reached the edgeware road arrived at paddington he struck across marylebone fieldsfor as yet the new road was undreamed ofand never moderated his speed until he reached the city his destination was the new mint at this place of refuge situated in the heart of wapping near the riverside he arrived in less than an hour in a complete state of exhaustion in consequence of the infamous abuse of its liberties an act for the entire suppression of the old mint was passed in the ninth year of the reign of george the first not many months before the date of the present epoch of this history and as after the destruction of whitefriars which took place in the reign of charles the second owing to the protection afforded by its inmates to the levellers and fifthmonarchymen when the inhabitants of alsatia crossed the water and settled themselves in the borough of southwarkso now driven out of their fastnesses they again migrated and recrossing the thames settled in wapping in a miserable quarter between artichoke lane and nightingale lane which they termed the new mint ousted from his old retreat the cross shovels baptist kettleby opened another tavern conducted upon the same plan as the former which he denominated the seven cities of refuge his subjects however were no longer entirely under his control and though he managed to enforce some little attention to his commands it was evident his authority was waning fast aware that they would not be allowed to remain long unmolested the new minters conducted themselves so outrageously and with such extraordinary insolence that measures were at this time being taken for their effectual suppression to the seven cities of refuge jack proceeded having disposed of his steed and swallowed a glass of brandy without taking any other refreshment he threw himself on a couch where he sank at once into a heavy slumber when he awoke it was late in the day and he was surprised to find blueskin seated by his bedside watching over him with a drawn sword on his knee a pistol in each hand and a bloodstained cloth bound across his brow dont disturb yourself said his follower motioning him to keep still its all right what time is it inquired jack past noon replied blueskin i didnt awake you because you seemed tired how did you escape asked sheppard who as he shook off his slumber began to recall the events of the previous night oh easily enough rejoined the other i suppose i must have been senseless for some time for on coming to myself i found this gash in my head and the ground covered with blood however no one had discovered me so i contrived to drag myself to my horse i thought if you were living and not captured i should find you hereand i was right i kept watch over you for fear of a surprise on the part of jonathan but whats to be done the first thing i do replied jack will be to visit my poor mother in bedlam youd better take care of your mothers son instead rejoined blueskin its runnin a great risk risk or no risk i shall go replied jack jonathan has threatened to do her some mischief i am resolved to see her without delay and ascertain if its possible to remove her its a hopeless job grumbled blueskin and harm will come of it what are you to do with a mad mother at a time when you need all your wits to take care of yourself dont concern yourself further about me returned jack once for all i shall go wont you take me no you must await my return here then i must wait a long time grumbled blueskin youll never return we shall see replied jack but if i should not return take this purse to edgeworth bess youll find her at black marys hole and having partaken of a hasty breakfast he set out taking his way along east smithfield mounting little towerhill and threading the minories and hounsditch he arrived without accident or molestation at moorfields old bethlehem or bedlamevery trace of which has been swept away and the hospital for lunatics removed to saint georges fieldwas a vast and magnificent structure erected in moorfields in upon the model of the tuileries it is said that louis the fourteenth was so incensed at the insult offered to his palace that he had a counterpart of st jamess built for offices of the meanest description the size and grandeur of the edifice indeed drew down the ridicule of several of the wits of the age by one of whomthe facetious tom brownit was said bedlam is a pleasant place and abounds with amusementsthe first of which is the building so stately a fabric for persons wholly insensible of the beauty and use of it the outside being a perfect mockery of the inside and admitting of two amusing querieswhether the persons that ordered the building of it or those that inhabit it were the maddest and whether the name and thing be not as disagreeable as harp and harrow by anotherthe no less facetious ned wardit was termed a costly college for a crackbrained society raised in a mad age when the chiefs of the city were in a great danger of losing their senses and so contrived it the more noble for their own reception or they would never have flung away so much money to so foolish a purpose the cost of the building exceeded seventeen thousand pounds however the taste of the architecture may be questioned which was the formal french style of the period the general effect was imposing including the wings it presented a frontage of five hundred and forty feet each wing had a small cupola and in the centre of the pile rose a larger dome surmounted by a gilded ball and vane the asylum was approached by a broad gravel walk leading through a garden edged on either side by a stone balustrade and shaded by tufted trees a wide terrace then led to large iron gates over which were placed the two celebrated figures of raving and melancholy madness executed by the elder cibber and commemorated by pope in the dunciad in the wellknown lines close to those walls where folly holds her throne and laughs to think monroe would take her down where oer the gates by his famed fathers hand great cibbers brazen brainless brothers stand internally it was divided by two long galleries one over the other these galleries were separated in the middle by iron grates the wards on the right were occupied by male patients on the left by the female in the centre of the upper gallery was a spacious saloon appropriated to the governors of the asylum but the besetting evil of the place and that which drew down the severest censures of the writers abovementioned was that this spotwhich of all others should have been most free from such intrusionwas made a public exhibition there all the loose characters thronged assignations were openly made and the spectators diverted themselves with the vagaries of its miserable inhabitants entering the outer gate and traversing the broad gravel walk beforementioned jack ascended the steps and was admitted on feeing the porter by another iron gate into the hospital here he was almost stunned by the deafening clamour resounding on all sides some of the lunatics were rattling their chains some shrieking some singing some beating with frantic violence against the doors altogether it was the most dreadful noise he had ever heard amidst it all however there were several lighthearted and laughing groups walking from cell to cell to whom all this misery appeared matter of amusement the doors of several of the wards were thrown open for these parties and as jack passed he could not help glancing at the wretched inmates here was a poor halfnaked creature with a straw crown on his head and a wooden sceptre in his hand seated on the ground with all the dignity of a monarch on his throne there was a mad musician seemingly rapt in admiration of the notes he was extracting from a childs violin here was a terrific figure gnashing his teeth and howling like a wild beastthere a lover with hands clasped together and eyes turned passionately upward in this cell was a huntsman who had fractured his skull while hunting and was perpetually hallooing after the houndsin that the most melancholy of all the grinning gibbering lunatic the realization of moody madness laughing wild hastening from this heartrending spectacle jack soon reached the grating that divided the mens compartment from that appropriated to the women inquiring for mrs sheppard a matron offered to conduct him to her cell youll find her quiet enough today sir observed the woman as they walked along but she has been very outrageous latterly her nurse says she may live some time but she seems to me to be sinking fast heaven help her sighed jack i hope not her release would be a mercy pursued the matron oh sir if youd seen her as ive seen her youd not wish her a continuance of misery as jack made no reply the woman proceeded they say her sons taken at last and is to be hanged im glad of it im sure for its all owing to him his poor mothers here see what crime does sir those who act wickedly bring misery on all connected with them and so gentle as the poor creature is when shes not in her wild fitsit would melt a heart of stone to see her she will cry for days and nights together if jack sheppard could behold his mother in this state hed have a lesson hed never forgetay and a severer one than even the hangman could read him hardened as he may be that would touch him but he has never been near hernever rambling in this way the matron at length came to a halt and taking out a key pointed to a door and said this is mrs sheppards ward sir leave us together my good woman said jack putting a guinea into her hand as long as you please sir answered the matron dropping a curtsey there sir she added unlocking the door you can go in dont be frightened of her shes not mischievousand besides shes chained and cant reach you so saying she retired and jack entered the cell prepared as he was for a dreadful shock and with his nerves strung to endure it jack absolutely recoiled before the appalling object that met his gaze cowering in a corner upon a heap of straw sat his unfortunate mother the complete wreck of what she had been her eyes glistened in the darknessfor light was only admitted through a small grated windowlike flames and as she fixed them on him their glances seemed to penetrate his very soul a piece of old blanket was fastened across her shoulders and she had no other clothing except a petticoat her arms and feet were uncovered and of almost skeleton thinness her features were meagre and ghastly white and had the fixed and horrible stamp of insanity her head had been shaved and around it was swathed a piece of rag in which a few straws were stuck her thin fingers were armed with nails as long as the talons of a bird a chain riveted to an iron belt encircling her waist bound her to the wall the cell in which she was confined was about six feet long and four wide the walls were scored all over with fantastic designs snatches of poetry short sentences and namesthe work of its former occupants and of its present inmate when jack entered the cell she was talking to herself in the muttering unconnected way peculiar to her distracted condition but after her eye had rested on him some time the fixed expression of her features relaxed and a smile crossed them this smile was more harrowing even than her former rigid look you are an angel she cried with a look beaming with delight rather a devil groaned her son to have done this you are an angel i say continued the poor maniac and my jack would have been like you if he had lived but he died when he was a childlong agolong agolong ago would he had done so cried jack old van told me if he grew up he would be hanged he showed me a black mark under his ear where the noose would be tied and so ill tell you what i did and she burst into a laugh that froze jacks blood in his veins what did you do he asked in a broken voice i strangled himha ha hastrangled him while he was at my breastha haand then with a sudden and fearful change of look she added thats what has driven me mad i killed my child to save him from the gallowsoh oh one man hanged in a family is enough if id not gone mad they would have hanged me poor soul ejaculated her son ill tell you a dream i had last night continued the unfortunate being i was at tyburn there was a gallows erected and a great mob round itthousands of people and all with white faces like corpses in the midst of them there was a cart with a man in itand that man was jackmy son jackthey were going to hang him and opposite to him with a book in his handbut it couldnt be a prayerbooksat jonathan wild in a parsons cassock and band i knew him in spite of his dress and when they came to the gallows jack leaped out of the cart and the hangman tied up jonathan insteadha ha how the mob shouted and huzzaedand i shouted tooha ha ha mother cried jack unable to endure this agonizing scene longer dont you know me mother ah shrieked mrs sheppard whats thatjacks voice it is replied her son the ceiling is breaking the floor is opening he is coming to me cried the unhappy woman he stands before you rejoined her son where she cried i cant see him where is he here answered jack are you his ghost then nono answered jack i am your most unhappy son let me touch you then let me feel if you are really flesh and blood cried the poor maniac creeping towards him on all fours jack did not advance to meet her he could not move but stood like one stupified with his hands clasped together and eyes almost starting out of their sockets fixed upon his unfortunate parent come to me cried the poor maniac who had crawled as far as the chain would permit hercome to me she cried extending her thin arm towards him jack fell on his knees beside her who are you inquired mrs sheppard passing her hands over his face and gazing at him with a look that made him shudder your son replied jackyour miserable repentant son it is false cried mrs sheppard you are not jack was not half your age when he died they buried him in willesden churchyard after the robbery oh god cried jack she does not know me motherdear mother he added clasping her in his arms look at me again off she exclaimed breaking from his embrace with a scream dont touch me ill be quiet ill not speak of jack or jonathan i wont dig their graves with my nails dont strip me quite leave me my blanket im very cold at night or if you must take off my clothes dont dash cold water on my head it throbs cruelly horror cried jack dont scourge me she cried trying to hide herself in the farthest corner of the cell the lash cuts to the bone i cant bear it spare me and ill be quietquietquiet mother said jack advancing towards her off she cried with a prolonged and piercing shriek and she buried herself beneath the straw which she tossed above her head with the wildest gestures i shall kill her if i stay longer muttered her son completely terrified while he was considering what would be best to do the poor maniac over whose bewildered brain another change had come raised her head from under the straw and peeping round the room asked in a low voice if they were gone who inquired jack the nurses she answered do they treat you ill asked her son hush she said putting her lean fingers to her lips hushcome hither and ill tell you jack approached her sit beside me continued mrs sheppard and now ill tell you what they do stop we must shut the door or theyll catch us see she added tearing the rag from her headi had beautiful black hair once but they cut it all off i shall go mad myself if i listen to her longer said jack attempting to rise i must go dont stir or theyll chain you to the wall said his mother detaining him now tell me why they brought you here i came to see you dear mother answered jack mother she echoedmother why do you call me by that name because you are my mother what she exclaimed staring eagerly in his face are you my son are you jack i am replied jack heaven be praised she knows me at last oh jack cried his mother falling upon his neck and covering him with kisses motherdear mother said jack bursting into tears you will never leave me sobbed the poor woman straining him to her breast nevernever the words were scarcely pronounced when the door was violently thrown open and two men appeared at it they were jonathan wild and quilt arnold ah exclaimed jack starting to his feet just in time said the thieftaker you are my prisoner jack you shall take my life first rejoined sheppard and as he was about to put himself into a posture of defence his mother clasped him in her arms they shall not harm you my love she exclaimed the movement was fatal to her son taking advantage of his embarrassed position jonathan and his assistant rushed upon him and disarmed him thank you mrs sheppard cried the thieftaker as he slipped a pair of handcuffs over jacks wrists for the help you have given us in capturing your son without you we might have had some trouble aware apparently in some degree of the mistake she had committed the poor maniac sprang towards him with frantic violence and planted her long nails in his cheek keep off you accursed jade roared jonathan off i say or and he struck her a violent blow with his clenched hand the miserable woman staggered uttered a deep groan and fell senseless on the straw devil cried jack that blow shall cost you your life itll not need to be repeated at all events rejoined jonathan looking with a smile of malignant satisfaction at the body and nowto newgate chapter ix old newgate at the beginning of the twelfth centurywhether in the reign of henry the first or stephen is uncertaina fifth gate was added to the four principal entrances of the city of london then it is almost needless to say surrounded by ramparts moats and other defences this gate called newgate as being latelier builded than the rest continued for upwards of three hundred years to be used as a place of imprisonment for felons and trespassers at the end of which time having grown old ruinous and horribly loathsome it was rebuilt and enlarged by the executors of the renowned sir richard whittington the lord mayor of london whence it afterwards obtained amongst a certain class of students whose examinations were conducted with some strictness at the old bailey and their highest degrees taken at hydeparkcorner the appellation of whittingtons college or more briefly the whit it may here be mentioned that this gate destined to bequeath its namea name which has since acquired a terrible significanceto every successive structure erected upon its site was granted in by charter by henry the sixth to the citizens of london in return for their royal services and thenceforth became the common jail to that city and the county of middlesex nothing material occurred to newgate until the memorable year when it was utterly destroyed by the great fire it is with the building raised after this direful calamity that our history has to deal though by no means so extensive or commodious as the modern prison old newgate was a large and stronglybuilt pile the body of the edifice stood on the south side of newgate street and projected at the western extremity far into the area opposite saint sepulchres church one small wing lay at the north of the gate where giltspur street compter now stands and the press yard which was detached from the main building was situated at the back of phoenix court the south or principal front looking down the old bailey and not upon it as is the case of the present structure with its massive walls of roughened freestonein some places darkened by the smoke in others blanched by exposure to the weatherits heavy projecting cornice its unglazed doublygrated windows its gloomy porch decorated with fetters and defended by an enormous iron door had a stern and striking effect over the lodge upon a dial was inscribed the appropriate motto venio sicut fur the gate which crossed newgate street had a wide arch for carriages and a postern on the north side for footpassengers its architecture was richly ornamental and resembled the style of a triumphal entrance to a capital rather than a dungeon having battlements and hexagonal towers and being adorned on the western side with a triple range of pilasters of the tuscan order amid the intercolumniations of which were niches embellished with statues the chief of these was a figure of liberty with a cat at her feet in allusion to the supposed origin of the fortunes of its former founder sir richard whittington on the right of the postern against the wall was affixed a small grating sustaining the debtors box and any pleasure which the passerby might derive from contemplating the splendid structure above described was damped at beholding the pale faces and squalid figures of the captives across the bars of its stronglygrated windows some years after the date of this history an immense ventilator was placed at the top of the gate with the view of purifying the prison which owing to its insufficient space and constantlycrowded state was never free from that dreadful and contagious disorder now happily unknown the jailfever so frightful indeed were the ravages of this malady to which debtors and felons were alike exposed that its miserable victims were frequently carried out by cartloads and thrown into a pit in the burialground of christchurch without ceremony old newgate was divided into three separate prisonsthe masters side the common side and the press yard the first of these situated a the south of the building with the exception of one ward over the gateway was allotted to the better class of debtors whose funds enabled them to defray their chamberrent fees and garnish the second comprising the bulk of the jail and by many degrees worse in point of accommodation having several dismal and noisome wards under ground was common both to debtors and malefactorsan association little favourable to the morals or comforts of the former who if they were brought there with any notions of honesty seldom left with untainted principles the lastin all respects the best and airiest of the three standing as has been before observed in phoenix court at the rear of the main fabricwas reserved for stateoffenders and such persons as chose to submit to the extortionate demands of the keeper from twenty to five hundred pounds premium according to the rank and means of the applicant in addition to a high weekly rent being required for accommodation in this quarter some excuse for this rapacity may perhaps be found in the fact that five thousand pounds was paid for the purchase of the press yard by mr pitt the then governor of newgate this gentleman tried for high treason in on suspicion of aiding mr forster the rebel generals escape but acquitted reaped a golden harvest during the occupation of his premises by the preston rebels when a larger sum was obtained for a single chamber than in the words of a sufferer on the occasion would have paid the rent of the best house in saint jamess square or piccadilly for several years nor was this all other and more serious impositions inasmuch as they affected a poorer class of persons were practised by the underlings of the jail on his first entrance a prisoner if unable or unwilling to comply with the exactions of the turnkeys was thrust into the condemned hold with the worst description of criminals and terrified by threats into submission by the old regulations the free use of strong liquors not being interdicted a taphouse was kept in the lodge and also in a cellar on the common sideunder the superintendence of mrs spurling formerly it may be remembered the hostess of the dark house at queenhithewhence wine ale and brandy of inferior quality were dispensed in false measures and at high prices throughout the prison which in noise and debauchery rivalled if it did not surpass the lowest tavern the chief scene of these disgusting orgiesthe cellar just referred towas a large lowroofed vault about four feet below the level of the street perfectly dark unless when illumined by a roaring fire and candles stuck in pyramidal lumps of clay with a range of butts and barrels at one end and benches and tables at the other where the prisoners debtors and malefactors male and female assembled as long as their money lasted and consumed the time in drinking smoking and gaming with cards and dice above was a spacious hall connected with it by a flight of stone steps at the further end of which stood an immense grated door called in the slang of the place the jigger through the bars of which the felons in the upper wards were allowed to converse with their friends or if they wished to enter the room or join the revellers below they were at liberty to do so on payment of a small fine thus the same system of plunder was everywhere carried on the jailers robbed the prisoners the prisoners robbed one another two large wards were situated in the gate one of which the stone ward appropriated to the master debtors looked towards holborn the other called the stone hall from a huge stone standing in the middle of it upon which the irons of criminals under sentence of death were knocked off previously to their being taken to the place of execution faced newgate street here the prisoners took exercise and a quaint but striking picture has been left of their appearance when so engaged by the author of the english rogue at my first being acquainted with the place says this writer in the miseries of a prison the prisoners methought walking up and down the stone hall looked like so many wrecks upon the sea here the ribs of a thousand pounds beating against the needlesthose dangerous rocks credulity here floated to and fro silks stuffs camlets and velvet without giving place to each other according to their dignity here rolled so many pipes of canary whose bungholes lying open were so damaged that the merchant may go hoop for his money a less picturesque but more truthful and therefore more melancholy description of the same scene is furnished by the shrewd and satirical ned ward who informs us in the delectable history of whittingtons college that when the prisoners are disposed to recreate themselves with walking they go up into a spacious room called the stone hall where when you see them taking a turn together it would puzzle one to know which is the gentleman which the mechanic and which the beggar for they are all suited in the same garb of squalid poverty making a spectacle of more pity than executions only to be out at the elbows is in fashion here and a great indecorum not to be threadbare in an angle of the stone hall was the iron hold a chamber containing a vast assortment of fetters and handcuffs of all weights and sizes four prisoners termed the partners had charge of this hold their duty was to see who came in or went out to lock up and open the different wards to fetter such prisoners as were ordered to be placed in irons to distribute the allowances of provision and to maintain some show of decorum for which latter purpose they were allowed to carry whips and truncheons when any violent outrage was committedand such matters were of daily sometimes hourly occurrencea bell the rope of which descended into the hall brought the whole of the turnkeys to their assistance a narrow passage at the north of the stone hall led to the bluebeards room of this enchanted castle a place shunned even by the reckless crew who were compelled to pass it it was a sort of cookingroom with an immense fireplace flanked by a couple of cauldrons and was called jack ketchs kitchen because the quarters of persons executed for treason were there boiled by the hangman in oil pitch and tar before they were affixed on the city gates or on london bridge above this revolting spot was the female debtors ward below it a gloomy cell called tangier and lower still the stone hold a most terrible and noisome dungeon situated underground and unvisited by a single ray of daylight built and paved with stone without beds or any other sort of protection from the cold this dreadful hole accounted the most dark and dismal in the prison was made the receptacle of such miserable wretches as could not pay the customary fees adjoining it was the lower wardthough in what degree of latitude it was situated observes ned ward i cannot positively demonstrate unless it lay ninety degrees beyond the north pole for instead of being dark there but half a year it is dark all the year round it was only a shade better than the stone hold here were imprisoned the fines and perhaps adds the beforecited authority if he behaved himself an outlawed person might creep in among them ascending the gate once more on the way back we find over the stone hall another large room called debtors hall facing newgate street with very good air and light a little too much of the former perhaps as the windows being unglazed the prisoners were subjected to severe annoyance from the weather and easterly winds of the women felons rooms nothing has yet been said there were two one called watermans hall a horrible place adjoining the postern under the gate whence through a small barred aperture they solicited alms from the passengers the other a large chamber denominated my ladys hold was situated in the highest part of the jail at the northern extremity neither of these wards had beds and the unfortunate inmates were obliged to take their rest on the oaken floor the condition of the rooms was indescribably filthy and disgusting nor were the habits of the occupants much more cleanly in other respects they were equally indecorous and offensive it is with no small concern writes an anonymous historian of newgate that i am obliged to observe that the women in every ward of this prison are exceedingly worse than the worst of the men not only in respect to their mode of living but more especially as to their conversation which to their great shame is as profane and wicked as hell itself can possibly be there were two condemned holdsone for each sex that for the men lay near the lodge with which it was connected by a dark passage it was a large room about twenty feet long and fifteen broad and had an arched stone roof in fact it had been anciently the right hand postern under the gate leading towards the city the floor was planked with oak and covered with iron staples hooks and ringbolts with heavy chains attached to them there was only one small grated window in this hold which admitted but little light over the gateway towards snow hill were two strong wards called the castle and the red room they will claim particular attention hereafter many other wardsespecially on the master debtors sidehave been necessarily omitted in the foregoing hasty enumeration but there were two places of punishment which merit some notice from their peculiarity the first of these the press room a dark close chamber near watermans hall obtained its name from an immense wooden machine kept in it with which such prisoners as refused to plead to their indictments were pressed to deatha species of inquisitorial torture not discontinued until so lately as the early part of the reign of george the third when it was abolished by an express statute into the second denominated the bilbowesalso a dismal placerefractory prisoners were thrust and placed in a kind of stocks whence the name the chapel was situated in the southeast angle of the jail the ordinary at the time of this history being the reverend thomas purney the deputy chaplain mr wagstaff much has been advanced by modern writers respecting the demoralising effect of prison society and it has been asserted that a youth once confined in newgate is certain to come out a confirmed thief however this may be now it was unquestionably true of old newgate it was the grand nursery of vicea famous university observes ned ward in the london spy where if a man has a mind to educate a hopeful child in the daring science of padding the lightfingered subtlety of shoplifting the excellent use of jack and crow for the silently drawing bolts and forcing barricades with the knack of sweetening or the most ingenious dexterity of picking pockets let him but enter in this college on the common side and confine him close to his study but for three months and if he does not come out qualified to take any degree of villainy he must be the most honest dunce that ever had the advantage of such eminent tutors to bring down this imperfect sketch of newgate to the present time it may be mentioned that being found inadequate to the purpose required the old jail was pulled down in just at the completion of the new jail in it was assailed by the mob during the gordon riots fired and greatly damaged the devastations however were speedily made good and in two years more it was finished it is a cheering reflection that in the present prison with its clean wellwhitewashed and wellventilated wards its airy courts its infirmary its improved regulations and its humane and intelligent officers many of the miseries of the old jail are removed for these beneficial changes society is mainly indebted to the unremitting exertions of the philanthropic howard chapter x how jack sheppard got out of the condemned hold monday the st of august a day long afterwards remembered by the officers of newgatewas distinguished by an unusual influx of visitors to the lodge on that morning the death warrant had arrived from windsor ordering sheppard for execution since his capture by jonathan wild in bedlam as related in a former chapter jack had been tried convicted and sentenced to death together with three other malefactors on the following friday up to this moment hopes had been entertained of a respite strong representations in his favour having been made in the highest quarter but now that his fate seemed sealed the curiosity of the sightseeing public to behold him was redoubled the prison gates were besieged like the entrance of a booth at a fair and the condemned hold where he was confined and to which visitors were admitted at the moderate rate of a guinea ahead had quite the appearance of a showroom as the day wore on the crowds diminishedmany who would not submit to the turnkeys demands were sent away ungratifiedand at five oclock only two strangers mr shotbolt the head turnkey of clerkenwell prison and mr griffin who held the same office in westminster gatehouse were left in the lodge jack who had formerly been in the custody of both these gentlemen gave them a very cordial welcome apologized for the sorry room he was compelled to receive them in and when they took leave insisted on treating them to a double bowl of punch which they were now discussing with the upper jailer mr ireton and his two satellites austin and langley at a little distance from the party sat a tall sinisterlooking personage with harsh inflexible features a gaunt but muscular frame and large bony hands he was sipping a glass of cold gin and water and smoking a short black pipe his name was marvel and his avocation which was as repulsive as his looks was that of public executioner by his side sat a remarkably stout dame to whom he paid as much attention as it was in his iron nature to pay she had a nutbrown skin a swarthy upper lip a merry black eye a prominent bust and a tunlike circumference of waist a widow for the fourth time mrs spurling for she it was either by her attractions of purse or person had succeeded in moving the stony heart of mr marvel who as he had helped to deprive her of her former husbands thought himself in duty bound to offer to supply their place but the lady was not so easily won and though she did not absolutely reject him gave him very slight hopes mr marvel therefore remained on his probation behind mrs spurling stood her negro attendant caliban a hideous misshapen malicious monster with broad hunched shoulders a flat nose and ears like those of a wild beast a head too large for his body and a body too long for his legs this horrible piece of deformity who acted as drawer and cellarman and was a constant butt to the small wits of the jail was nicknamed the black dog of newgate in the general survey of the prison taken in the preceding chapter but little was said of the lodge it may be well therefore before proceeding farther to describe it more minutely it was approached from the street by a flight of broad stone steps leading to a ponderous door plated with iron and secured on the inner side by huge bolts and a lock with wards of a prodigious size a little within stood a second door or rather wicket lower than the first but of equal strength and surmounted by a row of sharp spikes as no apprehension was entertained of an escape by this outletnothing of the kind having been attempted by the boldest felon ever incarcerated in newgateboth doors were generally left open during the daytime at six oclock the wicket was shut and at nine the jail was altogether locked up not far from the entrance on the left was a sort of screen or partitionwall reaching from the floor to the ceiling formed of thick oaken planks riveted together by iron bolts and studded with broadheaded nails in this screen which masked the entrance of a dark passage communicating with the condemned hold about five feet from the ground was a hatch protected by long spikes set six inches apart and each of the thickness of an elephants tusk the spikes almost touched the upper part of the hatch scarcely space enough for the passage of a hand being left between their points and the beam here as has already been observed condemned malefactors were allowed to converse with such of their guests as had not interest or money enough to procure admission to them in the hold beyond the hatch an angle formed by a projection in the wall of some three or four feet served to hide a door conducting to the interior of the prison at the farther end of the lodge the floor was raised to the height of a couple of steps whence the whole place with the exception of the remotest corner of the angle beforementioned could be commanded at a single glance on this elevation a table was now placed around which sat the turnkeys and their guests regaling themselves on the fragrant beverage provided by the prisoner a brief description will suffice for them they were all stout illfavoured men attired in the regular jaillivery of scratch wig and snuffcoloured suit and had all a strong family likeness to each other the only difference between the officers of newgate and their brethren was that they had enormous bunches of keys at their girdles while the latter had left their keys at home well ive seen many a gallant fellow in my time mr ireton observed the chief turnkey of westminster gatehouse as he helped himself to his third glass of punch but i never saw one like jack sheppard nor i returned ireton following his example and ive had some experience too ever since he came here three months ago he has been the life and soul of the place and now the death warrant has arrived instead of being cast down as most men would be and as all others are hes gayer than ever well i shall be sorry to lose him mr griffin weve made a pretty penny by himsixty guineas this blessed day no more cried griffin incredulously i should have thought you must have made double that sum at least not a farthing more i assure you rejoined ireton pettishly were all on the square here i took the money myself and ought to know oh certainly answered griffin certainly i offered jack five guineas as his share continued ireton but he wouldnt take it himself and gave it to the poor debtors and felons who are now drinking it out in the cellar on the common side jacks a noble fellow exclaimed the headjailer of clerkenwell prison raising his glass and though he played me a scurvy trick ill drink to his speedy deliverance at tyburn eh mr shotbolt rejoined the executioner ill pledge you in that toast with all my heart well for my part observed mrs spurling i hope he may never see tyburn and if id my own way with the secretary of state he never should its a thousand pities to hang so pretty a fellow there havent been so many ladies in the lodge since the days of claude du val the gentleman highwayman and they all declare itll break their hearts if hes scragged bah ejaculated marvel gruffly you think our sex has no feeling i suppose sir cried mrs spurling indignantly but i can tell you we have and whats more i tell you if captain sheppard is hanged you need never hope to call me mrs marvel zounds cried the executioner in astonishment do you know what you are talking about mrs spurling why if captain sheppard should get off it ud be fifty guineas out of my way theres the grand laced coat he wore at his trial which i intend for my weddingdress dont mention such a thing sir interrupted the tapstress i couldnt bear to see you in it your speaking of the trial brings the whole scene to my mind ah i shall never forget the figure jack cut on that occasion what a buzz of admiration ran round the court as he appeared and how handsome and composed he looked everybody wondered that such a stripling could commit such desperate robberies his firmness never deserted him till his old master mr wood was examined then he did give way a bit and when mr woods daughterto whom ive heard tell he was attached years agowas brought up his courage forsook him altogether and he trembled and could scarcely stand poor young lady she trembled too and was unable to give her evidence when sentence was passed there wasnt a dry eye in the court yes there was one observed ireton i guess who you mean rejoined shotbolt mr wilds right answered ireton its strange the antipathy he bears to sheppard i was standing near jack at that awful moment and beheld the look wild fixed on him it was like the grin of a fiend and made my flesh creep on my bones when the prisoner was removed from the dock we met jonathan as we passed through the yard he stopped us and addressing jack in a taunting tone said well ive been as good as my wordtrue replied sheppard and ill be as good as mine and so they parted and i hope he will if its anything to jonathans disadvantage muttered mrs spurling half aside im surprised mr wild hasnt been to inquire after him today observed langley its the first time hes missed doing so since the trial hes gone to enfield after blueskin who has so long eluded his vigilance rejoined austin quilt arnold called this morning to say so certain information it seems has been received from a female that blueskin would be at a flashken near the chase at five oclock today and theyre all set out in the expectation of nabbing him mr wild had a narrow escape lately in that affair of captain darrell observed shotbolt i dont exactly know the rights of that affair rejoined griffin with some curiosity nor any one else i suspect answered ireton winking significantly its a mysterious transaction altogether but as much as is known is this captain darrell who resides with mr wood at dollis hill was assaulted and halfkilled by a party of ruffians headed he swore by mr wild and his uncle sir rowland trenchard mr wild however proved on the evidence of his own servants that he was at the old bailey at the time and sir rowland proved that he was in manchester so the charge was dismissed another charge was then brought against them by the captain who accused them of kidnapping him when a boy and placing him in the hands of a dutch skipper named van galgebrok with instructions to throw him overboard which was done though he afterwards escaped but this accusation for want of sufficient evidence met with the same fate as the first and jonathan came off victorious it was thought however if the skipper could have been found that the result of the case would have been materially different this was rather too much to expect for we all know if mr wild wishes to keep a man out of the way hell speedily find the means to do so ay ay cried the jailers laughing i could have given awkward evidence in that case if id been so inclined said mrs spurling ay and found van galgebrok too but i never betray an old customer mr wild is a great man said the hangman replenishing his pipe and we owe him much and ought to support him were any thing to happen to him newgate wouldnt be what it is nor tyburn either mr wild has given you some employment mr marvel remarked shotbolt a little sir replied the executioner with a grim smile out of the twelve hundred subjects ive tucked up i may safely place half to his account if ever he requires my services he shall find im not ungrateful and though i say it that shouldnt say it no man can tie a better knot mr wild gentlemen and the nubbin cheat fill your glasses gentlemen observed ireton and ill tell you a droll thing jack said this morning amongst others who came to see him was a mr kneebone a woollendraper in wych street with whose pockets it appears jack when a lad made a little too free as this gentleman was going away he said to jack in a jesting manner that he should be glad to see him tonight at supper upon which the other answered that he accepted his invitation with pleasure and would make a point of waiting upon him ha ha ha did he say so cried shotbolt then i advise you to look sharply after him mr ireton for may i be hanged myself if i dont believe hell be as good as his word at this juncture two women very smartly attired in silk hoods and cloaks appeared at the door of the lodge ah who have we here exclaimed griffin only jacks two wivesedgeworth bess and poll maggot replied austin laughing they cant go into the condemned hold said ireton consequentially its against mr wilds orders they must see the prisoner at the hatch very well sir replied austin rising and walking towards them well my pretty dears he added to see your husband eh you must make the most of your time you wont have him long youve heard the news i suppose that the death warrants arrived returned edgeworth bess bursting into a flood of tears oh yes weve heard it how does jack bear it inquired mrs maggot like a hero answered austin i knew he would replied the amazon come bessno whimpering dont unman him are we to see him here yes my love well then lose no time in bringing him to us said mrs maggot theres a guinea to drink our health she added slipping a piece of money into his hand here caliban shouted the underturnkey unlock captain sheppards padlock and tell him his wives are in the lodge waiting to see him iss massa austin replied the black and taking the keys he departed on the errand as soon as he was gone the two women divested themselves of their hoods and cloaks and threw them as if inadvertently into the farthest part of the angle in the wall their beautifully proportioned figures and rather overdisplayed shoulders attracted the notice of austin who inquired of the chief turnkey whether he should stand by them during the interview oh never mind them said mrs spurling who had been hastily compounding another bowl of punch sit down and enjoy yourself ill keep a look out that nothing happens by this time caliban had returned and jack appeared at the hatch he was wrapped in a loose dressinggown of light material and stood near the corner where the womens dresses had just been thrown down quite out of sight of all the party except mrs spurling who sat on the right of the table have you got jonathan out of the way he asked in an eager whisper yes yes replied edgeworth bess patience kite has lured him to enfield on a false scent after blueskin you need fear no interruption from him or any of his myrmidons thats well cried jack now stand before me poll ive got the watchspring saw in my sleeve pretend to weep both of you as loudly as you can this spike is more than half cut through i was at work at it yesterday and the day before keep up the clamour for five minutes and ill finish it thus urged the damsels began to raise their voices in loud lamentation what the devil are you howling about cried langley do you think we are to be disturbed in this way make less noise hussies or ill turn you out of the lodge for shame mr langley rejoined mrs spurling i blush for you sir to call yourself a man and interfere with the natural course of affection have you no feeling for the situation of those poor disconsolate creatures about to be bereaved of all they hold dear is it nothing to part with a husband to the gallows ive lost four in the same way and know what it is here she began to blubber loudly for sympathy comfort yourself my charmer said mr marvel in a tone intended to be consolatory ill be their substitute you cried the tapstress with a look of horror never confusion muttered jack suddenly pausing in his task the saw has broken just as i am through the spike cant we break it off replied mrs maggot i fear not replied jack despondingly lets try at all events returned the amazon and grasping the thick iron rod she pushed with all her force against it while jack seconded her efforts from within after great exertions on both parts the spike yielded to their combined strength and snapped suddenly off holloawhats that cried austin starting up only my darbies returned jack clinking his chains oh that was all was it said the turnkey quietly reseating himself now give me the woollen cloth to tie round my fetters whispered sheppard quick here it is replied edgeworth bess give me your hand poll to help me through cried jack as he accomplished the operation keep a sharp look out bess stop interposed edgeworth bess mr langley is getting up and coming this way were lost help me through at all hazards poll cried jack straining towards the opening the dangers past whispered bess mrs spurling has induced him to sit down again ah she looks this way and puts her finger to her lips she comprehends what were about were all safe dont lose a moment then cried jack forcing himself into the aperture while the amazon assisted by bess pulled him through it there cried mrs maggot as she placed him without noise upon the ground youre safe so far come my disconsolate darlings cried austin it only wants five minutes to six i expect mr wild here presently cut it as short as you can only two minutes more sir intreated edgeworth bess advancing towards him in such a manner as to screen jack who crept into the farthest part of the angleonly two minutes and weve done well well im not within a minute rejoined the turnkey we shall never be able to get you out unseen jack whispered poll maggot you must make a bold push impossible replied sheppard in the same tone that would be certain destruction i cant run in these heavy fetters no i must face it out tell bess to slip out and ill put on her cloak and hood meanwhile the party at the table continued drinking and chatting as merrily as before i cant help thinking of jack sheppards speech to mr kneebone observed shotbolt as he emptied his tenth tumbler im sure hes meditating an escape and hopes to accomplish it tonight poh poh rejoined ireton it was mere idle boasting i examined the condemned hold myself carefully this morning and didnt find a nail out of its place recollect hes chained to the ground by a great horsepadlock and is never unloosed except when he comes to that hatch if he escapes at all it must be before our faces it wouldnt surprise me if he did remarked griffin hes audacity enough for anything he got out in much the same way from the gatehousestole the keys and passed through a room where i was sitting halfasleep in a chair caught you napping eh rejoined ireton with a laugh well he wont do that here ill forgive him if he does and so will i said austin were too wide awake for that aint we partner he added appealing to langley whom punch had made rather dozy i should think so responded the lethargic turnkey with a yawn during this colloquy jack had contrived unobserved to put on the hood and cloak and being about the size of the rightful owner presented a very tolerable resemblance to her this done edgeworth bess who watched her opportunity slipped out of the lodge halloa exclaimed austin who had caught a glimpse of her departing figure one of the women is gone nono hastily interposed mrs spurling theyre both here dont you see theyre putting on their cloaks thats false rejoined marvel in a low tone i perceive what has taken place oh goodness ejaculated the tapstress in alarm you wont betray him say the word and im mum returned the executioner will you be mine its a very unfair advantage to takevery replied mrs spurling however i consent then ill lend a helping hand i shall lose my fees and the laced coat but its better to have the bride without the weddin dress than the weddin dress without the bride at this moment saint sepulchres clock struck six close the wicket austin vociferated ireton in an authoritative tone good bye cried jack as if taking leave of his mistresses tomorrow at the same time well be punctual replied mrs maggot good bye jack keep up your spirits now for itlife or death exclaimed jack assuming the gait of a female and stepping towards the door as austin rose to execute his principals commands and usher the women to the gate mrs spurling and marvel rose too the latter walked carelessly towards the hatch and leaning his back against the place whence the spike had been removed so as completely to hide it continued smoking his pipe as coolly as if nothing had happened just as jack gained the entrance he heard a mans footstep behind him and aware that the slightest indiscretion would betray him he halted uncertain what to do stop a minute my dear cried austin you forget that you promised me a kiss the last time you were here wont one from me do as well interposed mrs maggot much better said mrs spurling hastening to the rescue i want to speak to edgeworth bess myself so saying she planted herself between jack and the turnkey it was a moment of breathless interest to all engaged in the attempt comethe kiss cried austin endeavouring to pass his arm familiarly round the amazons waist hands off she exclaimed or youll repent it why whatll you do demanded the turnkey teach you to keep your distance retorted mrs maggot dealing him a buffet that sent him reeling several yards backwards there off with you whispered mrs spurling squeezing jacks arm and pushing him towards the door and dont come here again before austin could recover himself jack and mrs maggot had disappeared bolt the wicket shouted ireton who with the others had been not a little entertained by the gallant turnkeys discomfiture this was done and austin returned with a crestfallen look to the table upon which mrs spurling and her now accepted suitor resumed their seats youll be as good as your word my charmer whispered the executioner of course responded the widow heaving a deep sigh oh jack jackyou little know what a price ive paid for you well im glad those women are gone remarked shotbolt coupling their presence with jacks speech i couldnt help fearing some mischief might ensue that reminds me hes still at large returned ireton here caliban go and fasten his padlock iss massa ireton replied the black stop caliban interposed mrs spurling who wished to protract the discovery of the escape as long as possible before you go bring me the bottle of pineapple rum i opened yesterday i should like mr ireton and his friends to taste it it is in the lower cupboard oh you havent got the keythen i must have it i suppose how provoking she added pretending to rummage her pockets one never can find a thing when one wants it never mind it my dear mrs spurling rejoined ireton we can taste the rum when he returns we shall have mr wild here presently and i wouldnt for the worldzounds he exclaimed as the figure of the thieftaker appeared at the wicket here he is off with you caliban fly you rascal mr wild here exclaimed mrs spurling in alarm oh gracious hes lost whos lost demanded ireton the key replied the widow all the turnkeys rose to salute the thieftaker whose habituallysullen countenance looked gloomier than usual ireton rushed forward to open the wicket for him no blueskin i perceive sir he observed in a deferential tone as wild entered the lodge no replied jonathan moodily ive been deceived by false information but the wench who tricked me shall bitterly repent it i hope this is all i begin to fear i might be purposely go out of the way nothing has gone wrong here nothing whatever replied ireton jack is just gone back to the condemned hold his two wives have been here ha exclaimed jonathan with a sudden vehemence that electrified the chief turnkey whats this a spike gone sdeath the women you say have been here he has escaped impossible sir replied ireton greatly alarmed impossible echoed wild with a fearful imprecation no sir its quite possiblemore than possible its certain ill lay my life hes gone come with me to the condemned hold directly and if i find my fears confirmed ill he was here interrupted by the sudden entrance of the black who rushed precipitately into the room letting fall the heavy bunch of keys in his fright o massa ireton massa wild ejaculated caliban shack sheppart gone gone you black devilgone cried ireton iss massa caliban sarch ebery hole in de place but shack no dere only him big hoss padlocknoting else i knew it rejoined wild with concentrated rage and he escaped you all in broad day before your faces you may well say its impossible his majestys jail of newgate is admirably guarded i must say ireton you are in league with him sir said the chief turnkey indignantly you are sir thundered jonathan and unless you find him you shant hold your place a week i dont threaten idly as you know and you austin and you langley i say the same thing to you but mr wild implored the turnkeys ive said it rejoined jonathan peremptorily and you marvel you must have been a party i sir if hes not found ill get a new hangman zounds cried marvel i hush whispered the tapstress or i retract my promise mrs spurling said jonathan who overheard the whisper you owe your situation to me if you have aided jack sheppards escape you shall owe your discharge to me also as you please sir replied the tapstress coolly and the next time captain darrell wants a witness i promise you he shant look for one in vain ha hussy dare you threaten cried wild but checking himself he turned to ireton and asked how long have the women been gone scarcely five minutes replied the latter one of you fly to the market returned jonathan another to the river a third to the new mint disperse in every direction well have him yet a hundred pounds to the man who takes him so saying he rushed out followed by ireton and langley a hundred pounds exclaimed shotbolt thats a glorious reward do you think hell pay it im sure of it replied austin then ill have it before tomorrow morning said the keeper of the new prison to himself if jack sheppard sups with mr kneebone ill make one of the party chapter xi dollis hill revisited about an hour after the occurrences at newgate the door of the small backparlour already described at dollis hill was opened by winifred who gliding noiselessly across the room approached a couch on which was extended a sleeping female and gazing anxiously at her pale careworn countenance murmuredheaven be praised she still slumbersslumbers peacefully the opiate has done its duty poor thing how beautiful she looks but how like death deathlike indeed was the repose of the sleeperdeathlike and deep its very calmness was frightful her lips were apart but no breath seemed to issue from them and but for a slightvery slight palpitation of the bosom the vital principle might be supposed to be extinct this lifeless appearance was heightened by the extreme sharpness of her featuresespecially the nose and chinand by the emaciation of her limbs which was painfully distinct through her drapery her attenuated arms were crossed upon her breast and her black brows and eyelashes contrasted fearfully with the livid whiteness of her skin a few short dark locks escaping from beneath her headdress showed that her hair had been removed and had only been recently allowed to grow again poor mrs sheppard sighed winifred as she contemplated the beautiful wreck before herpoor mrs sheppard when i see her thus and think of all she has endured of all she may yet have to endure i could almost pray for her release from trouble i dare not reflect upon the effect that her sons fateif the efforts to save him are ineffectualmay have upon her enfeebled frame and still worse upon her mind what a mercy that the blow aimed at her by the ruffian wild though it brought her to the brink of the grave should have restored her to reason ah she stirs as she said this she drew a little aside while mrs sheppard heaved a deep sigh and opened her eyes which now looked larger blacker and more melancholy than ever where am i she cried passing her hand across her brow with your friends dear mrs sheppard replied winifred advancing ah you are there my dear young lady said the widow smiling faintly when i first waken im always in dread of finding myself again in that horrible asylum you need never be afraid of that returned winifred affectionately my father will take care you never leave him more oh how much i owe him said the widow with fervour for bringing me here and removing me from those dreadful sights and sounds that would have driven me distracted even if i had been in my right mind and how much i owe you too dearest winifred for your kindness and attention without you i should never have recovered either health or reason i can never be grateful enough but though i cannot reward you heaven will dont say anything about it dear mrs sheppard rejoined winifred controlling her emotion and speaking as cheerfully as she could i would do anything in the world for you and so would my father and so would thames but he ought for hes your nephew you know we all love you dearly bless you bless you cried mrs sheppard averting her face to hide her tears i mustnt tell you what thames means to do for you if ever he gains his rights continued winifred but i may tell you what my father means to do he has done too much already answered the widow i shall need little more but do hear what it is rejoined winifred you know im shortly to be united to your nephewthat is she added blushing when he can be married by his right name for my father wont consent to it before your father will never oppose your happiness my dear im sure said mrs sheppard but what has this to do with me you shall hear replied winifred when this marriage takes place you and i shall be closely allied but my father wishes for a still closer alliance i dont unterstand you returned mrs sheppard to be plain then said winifred he has asked me whether i have any objection to you as a mother and whatwhat was your answer demanded the widow eagerly cant you guess returned winifred throwing her arms about her neck that he couldnt choose any one so agreeable to me winifred said mrs sheppard after a brief pause during which she appeared overcome by her feelingsshe said gently disengaging herself from the young girls embrace and speaking in a firm voice you must dissuade your father from this step how exclaimed the other can you not love him love him echoed the widow the feeling is dead within my breast my only love is for my poor lost son i can esteem him regard him but love him as he ought to be lovedthat i cannot do your esteem is all he will require urged winifred he has it and will ever have it replied mrs sheppard passionatelyhe has my boundless gratitude and devotion but i am not worthy to be any mans wifefar less his wife winifred you are deceived in me you know not what a wretched guilty thing i am you know not in what dark places my life has been cast with what crimes it has been stained but the offences i have committed are venial in comparison with what i should commit were i to wed your father nono it must never be you paint yourself worse than you are dear mrs sheppard rejoined winifred kindly your faults were the faults of circumstances palliate them as you may replied the widow gravely they were faults and as such cannot be repaired by a greater wrong if you love me do not allude to this subject again im sorry i mentioned it at all since it distresses you returned winifred but as i knew my father intended to propose to you if poor jack should be respited if he should be respited repeated mrs sheppard with startling eagerness does your father doubt it speak tell me winifred made no answer your hesitation convinces me he does replied the widow is thames returned from london not yet replied the other but i expect him every minute my fathers chief fear i must tell you is from the baneful influence of jonathan wild that fiend is ever in my path exclaimed mrs sheppard with a look the wildness of which greatly alarmed her companion i cannot scare him thence hark cried winifred thames is arrived i hear the sound of his horses feet in the yard now you will learn the result heaven support me cried mrs sheppard faintly breathe at this phial said winifred shortly afterwardsit seemed an age to the anxious mothermr wood entered the room followed by thames the latter looked very pale either from the effect of his wound which was not yet entirely healed or from suppressed emotionpartly perhaps from both causesand wore his left arm in a sling well cried mrs sheppard raising herself and looking at him as if her life depended upon the answer he is respited alas no replied thames sadly the warrant for his execution is arrived there is no further hope my poor son groaned the widow sinking backwards heaven have mercy on his soul ejaculated wood poor jack cried winifred burying her face in her lovers bosom not a word was uttered for some time nor any sound heard except the stilled sobs of the unfortunate mother at length she suddenly started to her feet and before winifred could prevent her staggered up to thames when is he to suffer she demanded fixing her large black eyes which burnt with an insane gleam upon him on friday he replied friday echoed mrs sheppard and today is monday he has three days to live only three days three short days horrible poor soul her senses are going again said mr wood terrified by the wildness of her looks i was afraid it would be so only three days reiterated the widow three short short daysand then all is over jonathans wicked threat is fulfilled at last the gallows is in viewi see it with all its hideous apparatusough and shuddering violently she placed her hands before her as if to exclude some frightful vision from her sight do not despair my sweet soul said wood in a soothing tone do not despair echoed mrs sheppard with a laugh that cut the ears of those who listened to it like a razordo not despair and who or what shall give me comfort when my son is gone i have wept till my eyes are drysuffered till my heart is brokenprayed till the voice of prayer is dumband all of no avail he will be hangedhangedhanged ha ha what have i left but despair and madness promise me one thing mr wood she continued with a sudden change of tone and convulsively clutching the carpenters arm promise it me anything my dear replied wood what is it bury us together in one grave in willesden churchyard there is a small yewtree west of the church beneath that tree let us lie in one grave mind do you promise to do this solemnly rejoined the carpenter enough said the widow gratefully i must see him tonight impossible dear mrs sheppard said thames tomorrow i will take you to him tomorrow will be too late replied the widow in a hollow voice i feel it will i must go tonight or i shall never behold him again i must bless him before i die i have strength enough to drag myself there and i do not want to return be pacified sweet soul said wood looking meaningly at thames you shall go and i will accompany you a mothers blessing on you replied mrs sheppard fervently and now she added with somewhat more composure leave me dear friends i entreat for a few minutes to collect my scattered thoughtsto prepare myself for what i have to go throughto pray for my son shall we do so whispered winifred to her father by all means returned wood dont delay an instant and followed by the young couple who gazed wistfully at the poor sufferer he hastily quitted the room and locked the door after him mrs sheppard was no sooner alone than she fell upon her knees by the side of the couch and poured forth her heart in prayer so absorbed was she by her passionate supplications that she was insensible to anything passing around her until she felt a touch upon her shoulder and heard a wellknown voice breathe in her earmother she started at the sound as if an apparition had called her screamed and fell into her sons outstretched arms mother dear mother cried jack folding her to his breast my son my dear dear son returned mrs sheppard returning his embrace with all a parents tenderness jack was completely overcome his chest heaved violently and big tears coursed rapidly down his cheeks i dont deserve it he said at length but i would have risked a thousand deaths to enjoy this moments happiness and you must have risked much to obtain it my love i have scarcely recovered from the shock of hearing of your condemnation when i behold you free not two hours since rejoined jack i was chained down in the condemned hold in newgate with a small saw conveyed to me a few days since by thames darrell which i contrived to conceal upon my person i removed a spike in the hatch and with the aid of some other friends worked my way out having heard from thames that you were better and that your sole anxiety was about me i came to give you the first intelligence of my escape bless you for it but you will stay here i dare not i must provide for my safety mr wood will protect you urged mrs sheppard he has not the powerperhaps not the will to do so and if he would i would not subject him to the annoyance the moment my escape is known a large reward will be placed on my head my dress my person will be minutely described jonathan wild and his bloodhounds with a hundred others incited by the reward will be upon my track nay for aught i know some of them may even now have got scent of me you terrify me cried mrs sheppard oh if this is the case do not stay an instant fly fly as soon as i can do so with safety i will return or send to you said jack do not endanger yourself on my account rejoined his mother i am quite easy now receive my blessing my dear son and if we never meet again rest assured my last prayer shall be for you do not talk thus dear mother returned jack gazing anxiously at her pale countenance or i shall not be able to quit you you must live for me i will try to do so replied the widow forcing a smile one last embrace i need not counsel you to avoid those fatal courses which have placed you in such fearful jeopardy you need not replied jack in a tone of the deepest compunction and oh forgive me though i can never forgive myself for the misery i have caused you forgive you echoed his mother with a look radiant with delight i have nothing to forgive ah she screamed with a sudden change of manner and pointing to the window which jack had left open and at which a dark figure was standing there is jonathan wild betrayed exclaimed jack glancing in the same direction the doorthe doordeath he added as he tried the handle it is lockedand i am unarmed madman that i am to be so help shrieked mrs sheppard be silent said jonathan striding deliberately into the room these cries will avail you nothing whoever answers them must assist me to capture your son be silent i say if you value his safety awed by jonathans manner mrs sheppard repressed the scream that rose to her lips and both mother and son gazed with apprehension at the heavy figure of the thieftaker which viewed in the twilight seemed dilated to twice its natural size and appeared almost to block up the window in addition to his customary arms jonathan carried a bludgeon with a large heavy knob suspended from his wrist by a loop a favourite weapon which he always took with him on dangerous expeditions and which if any information had been requisite would have told sheppard that the present was one of them well jack he said after a pause are you disposed to go back quietly with me youll ascertain that when you attempt to touch me rejoined sheppard resolutely my janizaries are within call returned wild im armed you are not it matters not you shall not take me alive spare him spare him cried mrs sheppard falling on her knees get up mother cried jack do not kneel to him i wouldnt accept my life from him ive foiled him hitherto and will foil him yet and come what will ill balk him of the satisfaction of hanging me jonathan raised his bludgeon but controlled himself by a powerful effort fool he cried do you think i wouldnt have secured you before this if i hadnt some motive for my forbearance and that motive is fear replied jack contemptuously fear echoed wild in a terrible tonefear repeat that word again and nothing shall save you dont anger him my dear son implored the poor widow with a look of anguish at jack perhaps he means well mad as you are youre the more sensible of the two i must say rejoined jonathan spare him cried mrs sheppard who fancied she had made some impression on the obdurate breast of the thieftakerspare him and i will forgive you will thank you bless you spare him spare him on one condition i will spare him returned wild on one condition only what is it asked the poor woman either he or you must return with me answered jonathan take me then replied the widow and she would have rushed to him if she had not been forcibly withheld by her son do not go near him mother cried jack do not believe him there is some deep treachery hidden beneath his words i will go said mrs sheppard struggling to get free attend to me mrs sheppard said jonathan looking calmly on at this distressing scene attend to me and do not heed him i swear to you solemnly swear to you i will save your sons life nay more will befriend him will place him out of the reach of his enemies if you consent to become my wife execrable villain exclaimed jack you hear that cried mrs sheppard he swears to save you well replied her son and you spurn the proposal no she accepts it rejoined jonathan triumphantly come along mrs sheppard ive a carriage within call shall convey you swiftly to town come come hear me mother cried jack and i will explain to you why the villain makes this strange and revolting proposal he well knows that but two livesthose of thames darrell and sir rowland trenchardstand between you and the vast possessions of the family those lives removedand sir rowland is completely in his power the estates would be yourshis if he were your husband now do you see his motive i see nothing but your danger replied his mother tenderly granted it were as you say jack said wildand i shant take the trouble to contradict youthe estates would be yours hereafter liar cried jack do you affect ignorance that i am a condemned felon and can inherit nothing but do not imagine that under any circumstances i would accept your terms my mother shall never degrade herself by a connection with you degrade herself rejoined jonathan brutally do you think i would take a harlot to my bed if it didnt suit my purposes to do so he says right replied mrs sheppard distractedly i am only fit for such as him take me take me before an hour you shall be mine said jonathan advancing towards her back cried jack fiercely lay a finger on her and i will fell you to the ground mother do you know what you do would you sell yourself to this fiend i would sell myself body and soul to save you rejoined his mother bursting from his grasp jonathan caught her in his arms come away he cried with the roar of a demon this laugh and his looks alarmed her it is the fiend she exclaimed recoiling save mesave me damnation vociferated jonathan savagely weve no time for any bedlam scenes now come along you mad jade ill teach you submission in time with this he endeavoured to force her off but before he could accomplish his purpose he was arrested and his throat seized by jack in the struggle mrs sheppard broke from him and filled the room with her shrieks ill now pay the debt i owe you cried jack tightening his grip till the thieftaker blackened in the face dog cried wild freeing himself by a powerful effort and dealing jack a violent blow with the heavy bludgeon which knocked him backwards you are not yet a match for jonathan wild neither you nor your mother shall escape me but i must summon my janizaries so saying he raised a whistle to his lips and blew a loud call and as this was unanswered another still louder confusion he cried something has happened but i wont be cheated of my prize help help shrieked mrs sheppard fleeing from him to the farthest corner of the room but it was of no avail jonathan again seized her when the door was thrown open and thames darrell followed by mr wood and several servingmen all well armed rushed into the room a glance sufficed to show the young man how matters stood he flew to the window and would have passed his sword through the thieftakers body if the latter had not quickly interposed the person of mrs sheppard so that if the blow had been stricken she must have received it quiltmendezwhere are you vociferated wild sounding his whistle for the third time you call in vain rejoined thames your assistants are in my power yield villain never replied jonathan put down your burthen monster shouted wood pointing an immense blunderbuss at him take her cried jonathan and flinging the now inanimate body of the poor widow who had fainted in the struggle into the arms of thames he leapt through the window and by the time the latter could consign her to wood and dart after him he had disappeared pursue him cried thames to the attendants and see that he does not escape the order was promptly obeyed jack continued thames addressing sheppard who had only just recovered from the blow and regained his feet i dont ask how you came here nor do i blame your rashness in doing so fortunately ever since wilds late murderous attack the household has all been well armed a postchaise seen in the road first alarmed us on searching the grounds we found two suspiciouslooking fellows in the garden and had scarcely secured them when your mothers cries summoned us hither just in time to preserve her your arrival was most providential said jack you must not remain here another instant replied thames my horse is at the door saddled with pistols in the holstersmount him and fly thames i have much to say said jack much that concerns your safety not now returned thames impatiently i cannotwill not suffer you to remain here i will go if you will consent to meet me at midnight near the old house in wych street replied jack by that time i shall have fully considered a plan which occurs to me for defeating the schemes of your enemies before that time you will be captured if you expose yourself thus rejoined thames however i will be there farewell till midnight replied jack and imprinting a kiss upon his mothers cold lips he left the room he found the horse where thames told him he would find him mounted and rode off across the fields in the direction of town chapter xii the well hole jonathan wilds first object as soon as he had made good his retreat was to ascertain what had become of his janizaries and if possible to release them with this view he hurried to the spot where he had left the postchaise and found it drawn up at the roadside the postilion dismounted and in charge of a couple of farmingmen advancing towards them sword in hand jonathan so terrified the hinds by his fierce looks and determined manner that after a slight show of resistance they took to their heels leaving him master of the field he then threw open the door of the vehicle in which he found his janizaries with their arms pinioned and leaping into it ordered the man to drive off the postilion obeyed and dashed off as hard as his horses could gallop along the beautiful road leading to neasdon and willesden just as the servingmen made their appearance arrived at the latter place jonathan who meanwhile had contrived to liberate his attendants from their bonds drew up at the six bells and hiring a couple of horses despatched his attendants in search of jack sheppard while he proceeded to town dismissing the postchaise at the old bailey he walked to newgate to ascertain what had occurred since the escape it was just upon the stroke of nine as he entered the lodge and mr austin was dismissing a host of inquirers who had been attracted thither by the newsfor it had already been extensively noised abroad some of these persons were examining the spot where the spike had been cut off others the spike itself now considered a remarkable object and all were marvelling how jack could have possibly squeezed himself through such a narrow aperture until it was explained to them by mr austin that the renowned housebreaker was of slender bodily conformation and therefore able to achieve a feat which he mr austin or any man of similar dimensions would have found wholly impossible affixed to the wall in a conspicuous situation was a large placard which after minutely describing sheppards appearance and attire concluded thuswhoever will discover or apprehend the above john sheppard so that he be brought to justice shall receive one hundred guineas reward to be paid by mr pitt the keeper of newgate this placard attracted universal attention while jonathan was conversing with austin from whom he took care to conceal the fact of his having seen sheppard since his escape ireton entered the lodge altogether unsuccessful sir said the chief turnkey with a look of disappointment not unmixed with apprehension as he approached wild ive been to all the flash cases in town and can hear nothing of him or his wives first i went to country toms the goat in long lane tom swore he hadnt set eyes on him since the trial i next proceeded to jenny bunchs the ship in trig lanethere i got the same answer then to the feathers in drury lane then to the golden ball in the same street then to martins brandyshop in fleet street then to dan wares in hanging sword court then to the deans head in st martins le grand and lastly to the seven cities o refuge in the new mint and nowhere could i obtain the slightest information humph exclaimed wild have you been more successful sir ventured ireton jonathan shook his head mr shotbolt thinks he has a scheme that cant fail interposed austin but he wishes to know whether youll be as good as your word in respect to the great reward you offered for jacks capture have i ever broken my word in such matters that he dares put the question rejoined jonathan sternly tell mr shotbolt that if he or any other person takes jack sheppard before tomorrow morning ill double it do you hear i do sir replied austin respectfully two hundred pounds if hes lodged in newgate before tomorrow morning continued wild make it known among your friends and he strode out of the place two hundred pounds exclaimed ireton besides the governors offerthats three hundred i must go to work again keep a sharp look out austin and see that we lose no one else i should be sorry if shotbolt got the reward devilish hard im not allowed a chance grumbled austin as he was left alone however some one must look after the jail and theyre all gone but me its fortunate weve no more jack sheppards or i should stand but a poor chance well i dont think theyll any of em nab him thats one comfort on quitting the lodge wild repaired to his own habitation telling the porter that he would attend to the house himself he bade him go in search of jack sheppard there was something in jonathans manner as he issued this command that struck the man as singular and he afterwards recalled it he however made no remark at the time but instantly prepared to set out as soon as he was gone jonathan went up stairs to the audiencechamber and sitting down appeared for some time buried in reflection the dark and desperate thoughts that were passing through his mind at this time will presently be shown after a while he raised his eyes and if their glance could have been witnessed at the moment it could not have been easily forgotten muttering something to himself he appeared to be telling upon his fingers the advantages and disadvantages of some scheme he had in contemplation that he had resolved upon its execution whatever it might be was evident from his saying aloud i will do it so good an opportunity may never occur again upon this he arose and paced the room hastily backwards and forwards as if further arranging his plans he then unlocked a cabinet opened a secret drawer and lifter ransacking its contents discovered a paper he was in search of and a glove laying these carefully aside he restored the drawer to its place his next occupation was to take out his pistols examine the priming and rub the flints his sword then came in for his scrutiny he felt at and appeared satisfied with its edge this employment seemed to afford him the highest satisfaction for a diabolical grinit cannot be called a smileplayed upon his face all the time he was engaged in it his sword done with he took up the bludgeon balanced it in his hand upon the points of his fingers and let it fall with a smash intentionally upon the table after all he said this is the safest weapon no instrument ive ever used has done me such good service it shall be the bludgeon so saying he slung it upon his wrist taking up a link which was blazing beside him he walked across the room and touching a spring in the wall a secret door flew open beyond was a narrow bridge crossing a circular building at the bottom of which lay a deep well it was a dark mysterious place and what it was used for no one exactly knew but it was called by those who had seen it the well hole the bridge was protected on either side by a railing with bannisters placed at wide intervals steps to aid the descent which was too steep to be safe without them led to a door on the opposite side this door which was open jonathan locked and took out the key as he stood upon the bridge he held down the light and looked into the profound abyss the red glare fell upon the slimy brickwork and tinged the inky waters below a slight cough uttered by jonathan at the moment awakened the echoes of the place and was returned in hollow reverberations therell be a louder echo here presently thought jonathan before leaving the place he looked upwards and could just discern the blue vault and pale stars of heaven through an iron grating at the top on his return to the room jonathan purposely left the door of the well hole ajar unlocking a cupboard he then took out some cold meat and other viands with a flask of wine and a bottle of brandy and began to eat and drink voraciously he had very nearly cleared the board when a knock was heard below and descending at the summons he found his two janizaries they had both been unsuccessful as jonathan scarcely expected a more satisfactory result he made no comment but ordering quilt to continue his search and not to return until he had found the fugitive called abraham mendez into the house and shut the door i want you for the job i spoke of a short time ago nab he said i mean to have no one but yourself in it come up stairs and take a glass of brandy abraham grinned and silently followed his master who as soon as they reached the audiencechamber poured out a bumper of spirits and presented it to him the jew swallowed it at a draught by my shoul he exclaimed smacking his lips dat ish gootvery goot you shall finish the bottle when the jobs done replied jonathan vat ish it mishter vild inquired mendez shir rowland trenchards affaireh thats it rejoined jonathan i expect him here every minute when youve admitted him steal into the room hide yourself and dont move till i utter the words youve a long journey before you thats your signal and a famoush goot shignal it ish laughed abraham he hash a long journey before himha ha peace cried jonathan theres his knock go and let him in and mind you dont arouse his suspicions never fearnever fear rejoined abraham as he took up the link and left the room jonathan cast a hasty glance around to see that all was properly arranged for his purpose placed a chair with its back to the door disposed the lights on the table so as to throw the entrance of the room more into shadow and then flung himself into a seat to await sir rowlands arrival he had not to wait long enveloped in a large cloak sir rowland stalked into the room and took the seat assigned him while the jew who received a private signal from jonathan set down the link near the entrance of the well hole and having made fast the door crept behind one of the cases fancying they were alone sir rowland threw aside his cloak and produced a heavy bag of money which he flung upon the table and when wild had feasted his greedy eyes sufficiently upon its golden contents he handed him a pocketbook filled with notes you have behaved like a man of honour sir rowland said wild after he had twice told over the money right to a farthing give me an acquittance said trenchard its scarcely necessary replied wild however if you require it certainly there it is received from sir rowland trenchard ljonathan wild august st will that do it will replied trenchard this is our last transaction together i hope not replied wild it is the last continued the knight sternly and i trust we may never meet again i have paid you this large sumnot because you are entitled to it for you have failed in what you undertook to do but because i desire to be troubled with you no further i have now settled my affairs and made every preparation for my departure to france where i shall spend the remainder of my days and i have made such arrangements that at my decease tardy justice will be done my injured nephew you have made no such arrangements as will compromise me i hope sir rowland said wild hastily while i live you are safe rejoined trenchard after my death i can answer for nothing sblood exclaimed wild uneasily this alters the case materially when were you last confessed sir rowland he added abruptly why do you ask rejoined the other haughtily becausebecause im always distrustful of a priest rejoined jonathan i have just parted from one said trenchard so much the worse replied jonathan rising and taking a turn as if uncertain what to do so much the better rejoined sir rowland he who stands on the verge of the grave as i do should never be unprepared youre strangely superstitious sir rowland said jonathan halting and looking steadfastly at him if i were so i should not be here returned trenchard how so asked wild curiously i had a terrible dream last night i thought my sister and her murdered husband dragged me hither to this very room and commanded you to slay me a terrible dream indeed said jonathan thoughtfully but you mustnt indulge these gloomy thoughts let me recommend a glass of wine my penance forbids it said trenchard waving his hand i cannot remain here long you will remain longer than you anticipate muttered wild before i go continued sir rowland i must beg of you to disclose to me all you know relative to the parentage of thames darrell willingly replied wild thinking it likely you might desire to have this information i prepared accordingly first look at this glove it belonged to his father and was worn by him on the night he was murdered you will observe that a coronet is embroidered on it ha exclaimed trenchard starting is he so highly born this letter will inform you replied wild placing a document in his hand what is this cried sir rowland i know the handha my friend and i have murdered him and my sister was thus nobly thus illustriously wedded o god o god and he appeared convulsed with agony oh if i had known this he exclaimed what guilt what remorse might have been spared me repentance comes too late when the deeds done returned wild bitterly it is not too late to repair the wrong i have done my nephew cried trenchard i will set about it instantly he shall have the estates i will return to manchester at once you had better take some refreshment before you start rejoined wild youve a long journey before you as the signal was given the jew who had been some time in expectation of it darted swiftly and silently behind sir rowland and flung a cloth over his head while jonathan rushing upon him in front struck him several quick and violent blows in the face with the bludgeon the white cloth was instantly dyed with crimson but regardless of this jonathan continued his murderous assault the struggles of the wounded man were desperateso desperate that in his agony he overset the table and in the confusion tore off the cloth and disclosed a face horribly mutilated and streaming with blood so appalling was the sight that even the murderersfamiliar as they were with scenes of slaughterlooked aghast at it during this dreadful pause the wretched man felt for his sword it had been removed from the scabbard by the jew he uttered a deep groan but said nothing despatch him roared jonathan having no means of defence sir rowland cleared the blood from his vision and turning to see whether there was any means of escape he descried the open door behind him leading to the well hole and instantly darted through it as i could wish cried jonathan bring the light nab the jew snatched up the link and followed him a struggle of the most terrific kind now ensued the wounded man had descended the bridge and dashed himself against the door beyond it but finding it impossible to force his way further he turned to confront his assailants jonathan aimed a blow at him which if it had taken place must have instantly terminated the strife but avoiding this he sprang at the thieftaker and grappled with him firmly built as it was the bridge creaked in such a manner with their contending efforts that abraham durst not venture beyond the door where he stood holding the light a horrified spectator of the scene the contest however though desperate was brief disengaging his right arm jonathan struck his victim a tremendous blow on the head with the bludgeon that fractured his skull and exerting all his strength threw him over the rails to which he clung with the tenacity of despair spare me he groaned looking upwards spare me jonathan however instead of answering him searched for his knife with the intention of severing his wrist but not finding it he had again recourse to the bludgeon and began beating the hand fixed on the upper rail until by smashing the fingers he forced it to relinquish its hold he then stamped upon the hand on the lower bannister until that also relaxed its gripe sir rowland then fell a hollow plunge echoed and reechoed by the walls marked his descent into the water give me the link cried jonathan holding down the light he perceived that the wounded man had risen to the surface and was trying to clamber up the slippery sides of the well shoot him shoot him put him out of hish mishery cried the jew whats the use of wasting a shot rejoined jonathan savagely he cant get out after making several ineffectual attempts to keep himself above water sir rowland sunk and his groans which had become gradually fainter and fainter were heard no more alls over muttered jonathan shall ve go back to de other room asked the jew i shall breathe more freely dere oh christ de doors shut it musht have schwung to during de schuffle shut exclaimed wild then were imprisoned the spring cant be opened on this side deres de other door cried mendez in alarm it only leads to the fencing crib replied wild theres no outlet that way cant ve call for asshistanche and wholl find us if we do rejoined wild fiercely but they will find the evidences of slaughter in the other roomthe table upsetthe bloody cloththe dead mans swordthe moneyand my memorandum which i forgot to remove hells curses that after all my precautions i should be thus entrapped its all your fault you shaking coward and but that i feel sure youll swing for your carelessness id throw you into the well too chapter xiii the supper at mr kneebones persuaded that jack sheppard would keep his appointment with mr kneebone and feeling certain of capturing him if he did so shotbolt on quitting newgate hurried to the new prison to prepare for the enterprise after debating with himself for some time whether he should employ an assistant or make the attempt alone his love of gain overcame his fears and he decided upon the latter plan accordingly having armed himself with various weapons including a stout oaken staff then ordinarily borne by the watch and put a coil of rope and a gag in his pocket to be ready in case of need he set out about ten oclock on the expedition before proceeding to wych street he called at the lodge to see how matters were going on and found mrs spurling and austin at their evening meal with caliban in attendance well mr shotbolt cried the turnkey ive good news for you mr wild has doubled his offer and the governor has likewise proclaimed a reward of one hundred guineas for jacks apprehension you dont say so exclaimed shotbolt read that rejoined austin pointing to the placard i ought to tell you that mr wilds reward is conditional upon jacks being taken before tomorrow morning so i fear theres little chance of any one getting it you think so eh chuckled shotbolt who was eagerly perusing the reward and congratulating himself upon his caution you think soha ha well dont go to bed thats all what for demanded the turnkey because the prisoners arrival might disturb youha ha ill lay you twenty guineas you dont take him tonight rejoined austin done cried shotbolt mrs spurling youre a witness to the bet twenty guineas mind i shant let you off a farthing egad i shall make a good thing of it never count your chickens till theyre hatched observed mrs spurling drily my chickens are hatched or at least nearly so replied shotbolt with increased merriment get ready your heaviest irons austin ill send you word when i catch him youd better send him jeered the turnkey so i will rejoined shotbolt so i will if i dont you shall clap me in the condemned hold in his stead goodbye for the pressentha ha and laughing loudly at his own facetiousness he quitted the lodge ill lay my life hes gone on a foxandgoosechase to mr kneebones remarked austin rising to fasten the door i shouldnt wonder replied mrs spurling as if struck by a sudden idea and while the turnkey was busy with the keys she whispered to the black follow him caliban take care he dont see youand bring me word where he goes and what he does iss missis grinned the black be so good as to let caliban out mr austin continued the tapstress hes only going on an errand austin readily complied with her request as he returned to the table he put his finger to his nose and though he said nothing he thought he had a much better chance of winning his wager unconscious that his movements were watched shotbolt meanwhile hastened towards wych street on the way he hired a chair with a couple of stout porters and ordered them to follow him arrived within a short distance of his destination he came to a halt and pointing out a dark court nearly opposite the woollendrapers abode told the chairmen to wait there till they were summoned im a peaceofficer he added about to arrest a notorious criminal hell be brought out at this door and may probably make some resistance but you must get him into the chair as fast as you can and hurry off to newgate and whatll we get for the job yer honr asked the foremost chairman who like most of his tribe at the time was an irishman five guineas heres a couple in hand faix then well do it in style cried the fellow once in this chair yer honr and ill warrant hell not get out so aisily as jack sheppard did from the new prisn hold your tongue sirrah rejoined shotbolt not overpleased by the remark and mind what i tell you ah whats that he exclaimed as some one brushed hastily past him if i hadnt just left him i could have sworn it was mrs spurlings sooty imp caliban having seen the chairmen concealed in the entry shotbolt proceeded to mr kneebones habitation the shutters of which were closed and knocked at the door the summons was instantly answered by a shopboy is your master at home inquired the jailer he is replied a portly personage arrayed in a gorgeous yellow brocade dressinggown lined with cherrycoloured satin and having a crimson velvet cap surmounted by a gold tassel on his head my name is kneebone added the portly personage stepping forward what do you want with me a word in private replied the other stand aside tom commanded kneebone now sir he added glancing suspiciously at the applicant your business my business is to acquaint you that jack sheppard has escaped mr kneebone returned shotbolt the deuce he has why its only a few hours since i beheld him chained down with half a hundred weight of iron in the strongest ward at newgate its almost incredible are you sure youre not misinformed sir i was in the lodge at the time replied the jailer then of course you must know well its scarcely credible when i gave him an invitation to supper i little thought hed accept it but egad i believe he will im convinced of it replied shotbolt and it was on that very account i came here and he proceeded to unfold his scheme to the woollendraper well sir said kneebone when the other concluded i shall certainly not oppose his capture but at the same time ill lend you no assistance if he keeps his word ill keep mine you must wait till suppers over as you please sirprovided you dont let him off that ill engage not to do ive another reason for supposing hell pay me a visit i refused to sign a petition in his behalf to the recorder not from any illwill to him but because it was prepared by a person whom i particularly dislikecaptain darrell a very sufficient reason answered the jailer tom continued kneebone calling to the shopboy dont go home i may want you light the lantern and if you hear any odd noise in the parlour dont mind it not in the least sir replied tom in a drowsy tone and with a look seeming to imply that he was too much accustomed to odd noises at night to heed them now step this way mr whatsyourname shotbolt sir replied the jailer very well mr slipshod follow me and he led the way to an inner room in the middle of which stood a table covered with a large white cloth jack sheppard knows this house i believe sir observed shotbolt every inch of it replied the woollendraper he ought to do seeing that he served his apprenticeship in it to mr wood by whom it was formerly occupied his name is carved upon a beam up stairs indeed said shotbolt where can i hide myself he added glancing round the room in search of a closet under the table the cloth nearly touches the floor give me your staff itll be in your way suppose he brings blueskin or some other ruffian with him hesitated the jailer suppose he does in that case ill help you we shall be equally matched youre not afraid mr shoplatch not in the least replied shotbolt creeping beneath the table theres my staff am i quite hidden not quitekeep your feet in mind you dont stir till suppers over ill stamp twice when weve done i forgot to mention theres a trifling reward for his capture cried shotbolt popping his head from under the cloth if we take him i dont mind giving you a sharesay a fourthprovided you lend a helping hand curse your reward exclaimed kneebone angrily do you take me for a thiefcatcher like jonathan wild that you dare to affront me by such a proposal no offence sir rejoined the jailer humbly i didnt imagine for a moment that youd accept it but i thought it right to make you the offer be silent and conceal yourself im about to ring for supper the woollendrapers application to the bell was answered by a very pretty young woman with dark jewish features roguish black eyes sleek glossy hair a trim waist and a remarkably neat figure the very model in short of a bachelors housekeeper rachel said mr kneebone addressing his comely attendant put a few more plates on the table and bring up whatever there is in the larder i expect company company echoed rachel at this time of night company child repeated kneebone i shall want a bottle or two of sack and a flask of usquebaugh anything else sir nostay youd better not bring up any silver forks or spoons why surely you dont think your guests would steal them observed rachel archly they shant have the opportunity replied kneebone and by way of checking his housekeepers familiarity he pointed significantly to the table whos there cried rachel ill see and before she could be prevented she lifted up the cloth and disclosed shotbolt oh gemini she exclaimed a man at your service my dear replied the jailer now your curiositys satisfied child continued kneebone perhaps youll attend to my orders not a little perplexed by the mysterious object she had seen rachel left the room and shortly afterwards returned with the materials of a tolerably good supperto wit a couple of cold fowls a tongue the best part of a sirloin of beef a jar of pickles and two small dishes of pastry to these she added the wine and spirits directed and when all was arranged looked inquisitively at her master i expect a very extraordinary person to supper rachel he remarked the gentleman under the table she answered he does seem a very extraordinary person no another still more extraordinary indeedwho is it jack sheppard what the famous housebreaker i thought he was in newgate hes let out for a few hours laughed kneebone but hes going back again after supper oh dear how i should like to see him im told hes so handsome im sorry i cant indulge you replied her master a little piqued i shall want nothing more you had better go to bed its no use going to bed answered rachel i shant sleep a wink while jack sheppards in the house keep in your own room at all events rejoined kneebone very well said rachel with a toss of her pretty head very well ill have a peep at him if i die for it she muttered as she went out mr kneebone then sat down to await the arrival of his expected guest half an hour passed but jack did not make his appearance the woollendraper looked at his watch it was eleven oclock another long interval elapsed the watch was again consulted it was now a quarter past twelve mr kneebone who began to feel sleepy wound it up and snuffed the candles i suspect our friend has thought better of it and wont come he remarked have a little patience sir rejoined the jailer how are you off there shoplatch inquired kneebone rather cramped eh rather so sir replied the other altering his position i shall be able to stretch my limbs presentlyha ha hush cried kneebone i hear a noise without hes coming the caution was scarcely uttered when the door opened and jack sheppard presented himself he was wrapped in a laced roquelaure which he threw off on his entrance into the room it has been already intimated that jack had an excessive passion for finery and it might have been added that the chief part of his illgotten gains was devoted to the embellishment of his person on the present occasion he appeared to have bestowed more than ordinary attention on his toilette his apparel was sumptuous in the extreme and such as was only worn by persons of the highest distinction it consisted of a fulldress coat of brown flowered velvet laced with silver a waistcoat of white satin likewise richly embroidered shoes with red heels and large diamond buckles pearlcoloured silk stockings with gold clocks a muslin cravat or steenkirk as it was termed edged with the fine point lace ruffles of the same material and so ample as almost to hide the tips of his fingers and a silverhilted sword this costume though somewhat extravagant displayed his slight but perfectlyproportioned figure to the greatest advantage the only departure which he made from the fashion of the period was in respect to the perukean article he could never be induced to wear in lieu of it he still adhered to the sleek black crop which throughout life formed a distinguishing feature in his appearance ever since the discovery of his relationship to the trenchard family a marked change had taken place in jacks demeanour and looks which were so much refined and improved that he could scarcely be recognised as the same person having only seen him in the gloom of a dungeon and loaded with fetters kneebone had not noticed this alteration but he was now greatly struck by it advancing towards him he made him a formal salutation which was coldly returned i am expected i find observed jack glancing at the wellcovered board you are replied kneebone when i heard of your escape i felt sure i should see you you judged rightly rejoined jack i never yet broke an engagement with friend or foeand never will a bold resolution said the woollendraper you must have made some exertion to keep your present appointment few men could have done as much perhaps not replied jack carelessly i would have done more if necessary well take a chair rejoined kneebone ive waited supper you perceive first let me introduce my friends returned jack stepping to the door friends echoed kneebone with a look of dismay my invitation did not extend to them further remonstrance however was cut short by the sudden entrance of mrs maggot and edgeworth bess behind them stalked blueskin enveloped in a rough greatcoat calledappropriately enough in this instancea wraprascal folding his arms he placed his back against the door and burst into a loud laugh the ladies were as usual very gaily dressed and as usual also had resorted to art to heighten their attractions from patches justly placed they borrowd graces and with vermilion lacquerd oer their faces edgeworth bess wore a scarlet tabby negligeea sort of undress or sack then much in voguewhich suited her to admiration and upon her head had what was called a flycap with richlylaced lappets mrs maggot was equipped in a light blue ridinghabit trimmed with silver a huntingcap and a flaxen peruke and instead of a whip carried a stout cudgel for a moment kneebone had hesitated about giving the signal to shotbolt but thinking a more favourable opportunity might occur he determined not to hazard matters by undue precipitation placing chairs therefore he invited the ladies to be seated and paying a similar attention to jack began to help to the various dishes and otherwise fulfil the duties of a host while this was going on blueskin seeing no notice whatever taken of him coughed loudly and repeatedly but finding his hints totally disregarded he at length swaggered up to the table and thrust in a chair excuse me he said plunging his fork into a fowl and transferring it to his plate this tongue looks remarkably nice he added slicing off an immense wedge excuse meho ho you make yourself at home i perceive observed kneebone with a look of ineffable disgust i generally do replied blueskin pouring out a bumper of sack your health kneebone allow me to offer you a glass of usquebaugh my dear said kneebone turning from him and regarding edgeworth bess with a stare so impertinent that even that not overdelicate young lady summoned up a blush with pleasure sir replied edgeworth bess dear me she added as she pledged the amorous woollendraper what a beautiful ring that is do you think so replied kneebone taking it off and placing it on her finger which he took the opportunity of kissing at the same time wear it for my sake oh dear simpered edgeworth bess endeavouring to hide her confusion by looking steadfastly at her plate you dont eat continued kneebone addressing jack who had remained for some time thoughtful and preoccupied with his head upon his hand the captain has seldom much appetite replied blueskin who having disposed of the fowl was commencing a vigorous attack upon the sirloin i eat for both so it seems observed the woollendraper and for every one else too i say kneebone rejoined blueskin as he washed down an immense mouthful with another bumper do you recollect how nearly mr wild and i were nabbing you in this very room some nine years ago i do replied kneebone and now he added aside the case is altered im nearly nabbing you a good deal has occurred since then eh captain said blueskin nudging jack much that i would willingly forget nothing that i desire to remember replied sheppard sternly on that nightin this roomin your presence blueskinin yours mr kneebone mrs wood struck me a blow which made me a robber she has paid dearly for it muttered blueskin she has rejoined sheppard but i wish her hand had been as deadly as yours on that nightthat fatal nightwinifred crushed all the hopes that were rising in my heart on that night i surrendered myself to jonathan wild and becamewhat i am on that night you first met me love said edgeworth bess endeavouring to take his hand which he coldly withdrew and me added mrs maggot tenderly would i had never seen either of you cried jack rising and pacing the apartment with a hurried step well im sure winifred could never have loved you as well as i do said mrs maggot you cried jack scornfully do you compare your lovea love which all may purchasewith hers no one has ever loved me except me dear insinuated edgeworth bess ive been always true to you peace retorted jack with increased bitterness im your dupe no longer what the devils in the wind now captain cried blueskin in astonishment ill tell you replied jack with forced calmness within the last few minutes all my guilty life has passed before me nine years ago i was honestwas happy nine years ago i worked in this very househad a kind indulgent master whom i robbedtwice robbed at your instigation villain a mistress whom you have murdered a companion whose friendship i have for ever forfeited a mother whose heart i have wellnigh broken in this room was my ruin begun in this room it should be ended come come dont take on thus captain cried blueskin rising and walking towards him if any ones to blame its me im ready to bear it all can you make me honest cried jack can you make me other than a condemned felon can you make me not jack sheppard no replied blueskin and i wouldnt if i could curse you cried jack furiouslycurse youcurse you swear away captain rejoined blueskin coolly itll ease your mind do you mock me cried jack levelling a pistol at him not i replied blueskin take my life if youre so disposed youre welcome to it and lets see if either of these women who prate of their love for you will do as much this is folly cried jack controlling himself by a powerful effort the worst of folly replied blueskin returning to the table and taking up a glass and to put an end to it i shall drink the health of jack sheppard the housebreaker and success to him in all his enterprises and now lets see wholl refuse the pledge i will replied sheppard dashing the glass from his hand sit down fool jack said kneebone who had been considerably interested by the foregoing scene are these regrets for your past life sincere suppose them so rejoined jack what then nothingnothing stammered kneebone his prudence getting the better of his sympathy im glad to hear it thats all he added taking out his snuffbox his neverfailing resource in such emergencies it wont do to betray the officer he muttered o lud what an exquisite box cried edgeworth bess is it gold pure gold replied kneebone it was given me by poor dear mrs wood whose loss i shall ever deplore pray let me have a pinch said edgeworth bess with a captivating glance i am so excessively fond of snuff the woollendraper replied by gallantly handing her the box which was instantly snatched from her by blueskin who after helping himself to as much of its contents as he could conveniently squeeze between his thumb and finger put it very coolly in his pocket the action did not pass unnoticed by sheppard restore it he cried in an authoritative voice oons captain cried blueskin as he grumblingly obeyed the command if youve left off business yourself you neednt interfere with other people i should like a little of that plumtart said mrs maggot but i dont see a spoon ill ring for one replied kneebone rising accordingly but i fear my servants are gone to bed blueskin meanwhile having drained and replenished his glass commenced chaunting a snatch of a ballad once on a time as ive heard tell in wych street owen wood did dwell a carpenter he was by trade and money i believe he made with his foodle doo this carpenter he had a wife the plague and torment of his life who though she did her husband scold loved well a woollendraper bold with her foodle doo ive a toast to propose cried sheppard filling a bumper you wont refuse it mr kneebone hed better not muttered blueskin what is it demanded the woollendraper as he returned to the table and took up a glass the speedy union of thames darrell with winifred wood replied jack kneebones cheeks glowed with rage and he set down the wine untasted while blueskin resumed his song now owen wood had one fair child unlike her mother meek and mild her love the draper strove to gain but she repaid him with disdain with his foodle doo peace cried jack but blueskin was not to be silenced he continued his ditty in spite of the angry glances of his leader in vain he fondly urged his suit and all in vain the question put she answeredmr william kneebone of me sir you shall never be bone with your foodle doo thames darrell has my heart alone a noble youth een you must own and if from him my love could stir jack sheppard i should much prefer with his foodle doo do you refuse my toast cried jack impatiently i do replied kneebone drink this then roared blueskin and pouring the contents of a small powderflask into a bumper of brandy he tendered him the mixture at this juncture the door was opened by rachel what did you ring for sir she asked eyeing the group with astonishment your master wants a few tablespoons child said mrs maggot leave the room interposed kneebone angrily no i shant replied rachel saucily i came to see jack sheppard and i wont go till you point him out to me you told me he was going back to newgate after supper so i maynt have another opportunity oh he told you that did he said blueskin marching up to her and chucking her under the chin ill show you captain sheppard my dear there he stands im his lieutenantlieutenant blueskin were two goodlooking fellows aint we very goodlooking replied rachel but wheres the strange gentleman i saw under the table under the table echoed blueskin winking at jack when did you see him my love a short time ago replied the housekeeper unsuspiciously the plots out cried jack and without another word he seized the table with both hands and upset it scattering plates dishes bottles jugs and glasses far and wide the crash was tremendous the lights rolled over and were extinguished and if rachel had not carried a candle the room would have been plunged in total darkness amid the confusion shotbolt sprang to his feet and levelling a pistol at jacks head commanded him to surrender but before any reply could be made the jailers arm was struck up by blueskin who throwing himself upon him dragged him to the ground in the struggle the pistol went off but without damage to either party the conflict was of short duration for shotbolt was no match for his athletic antagonist he was speedily disarmed and the rope and gag being found upon him were exultingly turned against him by his conqueror who after pinioning his arms tightly behind his back forced open his mouth with the iron and effectually prevented the utterance of any further outcries while the strife was raging edgeworth bess walked up to rachel and advised her if she valued her life not to scream or stir from the spot a caution which the housekeeper whose curiosity far outweighed her fears received in very good part in the interim jack advanced to the woollendraper and regarding him sternly thus addressed him you have violated the laws of hospitality mr kneebone i came hither as your guest you have betrayed me what faith is to be kept with a felon replied the woollendraper disdainfully he who breaks faith with his benefactor may well justify himself thus answered jack i have not trusted you others who have done have found you false i dont understand you replied kneebone in some confusion you soon shall rejoined sheppard where are the packets committed to your charge by sir rowland trenchard the packets exclaimed kneebone in alarm it is useless to deny it replied jack you were watched tonight by blueskin you met sir rowland at the house of a romisch priest father spencer two packets were committed to your charge which you undertook to deliverone to another priest sir rowlands chaplain at manchester the other to mr wood produce them never replied kneebone then by heaven you are a dead man replied jack cocking a pistol and pointing it deliberately at his head i give you one minute for reflection after that time nothing shall save you there was a brief breathless pause even blueskin looked on with anxiety it is past said jack placing his finger on the trigger hold cried kneebone flinging down the packets they are nothing to me but they are everything to me cried jack stooping to pick them up these packets will establish thames darrells birth win him his inheritance and procure him the hand of winifred wood dont be too sure of that rejoined kneebone snatching up the staff and aiming a blow at his head which was fortunately warded off by mrs maggot who promptly interposed her cudgel defend yourself cried jack drawing his sword leave his punishment to me jack said mrs maggot ive the bridewell account to settle be it so replied jack putting up his blade ive a good deal to do show him no quarter poll he deserves none and shall find none replied the amazon now mr kneebone she added drawing up her magnificent figure to its full height and making the heavy cudgel whistle through the air look to yourself stand off poll rejoined the woollendraper i dont want to hurt you it shall never be said that i raised my arm willingly against a woman ill forgive you all the harm you do me rejoined the amazon what you still hesitate will that rouse you coward and she gave him a smart rap on the head coward cried kneebone neither man nor woman shall apply that term to me if you forget your sex jade i must forget mine with this he attacked her vigorously in his turn it was a curious sight to see how this extraordinary woman who it has been said was not less remarkable for the extreme delicacy of her features and the faultless symmetry of her figure than for her wonderful strength and agility conducted herself in the present encounter with what dexterity she parried every blow aimed against her by her adversary whose head and face already marked by various ruddy streams showed how successfully her own hits had been madehow she drew him hither and thither now leading him on now driving him suddenly back harassing and exhausting him in every possible way and making it apparent that she could at any moment put an end to the fight and only delayed the finishing stroke to make his punishment the more severe jack meanwhile with blueskins assistance had set the table once more upon its legs and placing writing materials which he took from a shelf upon it made shotbolt who was still gagged but whose arms were for the moment unbound sit down before them write as i dictate he cried placing a pen in the jailers hand and a pistol to his ear shotbolt nodded in token of acquiescence and emitted an odd guttural sound write as follows continued jack i have succeeded in capturing jack sheppard the reward is mine get all ready for his reception in a few minutes after the delivery of this note he will be in newgate sign it he added as after some further threats the letter was indited according to his dictation and direct it to mr austin thats well and now to find a messenger mr kneebones man is in the shop said rachel hell take it can i trust him mused jack yes hell suspect nothing give him this letter child and bid him take it to the lodge at newgate without loss of time blueskin will go with youfor fear of a mistake you might trust me said rachel in an offended tone but never mind and she left the room with blueskin who very politely offered her his arm meanwhile the combat between kneebone and mrs maggot had been brought to a termination when the woollendraper was nearly worn out the amazon watched her opportunity and hitting him on the arm disabled it thats for mrs wood she cried as the staff fell from his grasp im at your mercy poll rejoined kneebone abjectly thats for winifred vociferated the amazon bringing the cudgel heavily upon his shoulder damnation cried kneebone thats for myself rejoined mrs maggot dealing him a blow which stretched him senseless on the floor bravo poll cried jack who having again pinioned shotbolt was now tracing a few hasty lines on a sheet of paper youve given him a broken head i perceive hell scarcely need a plaister replied mrs maggot laughing here bess give me the cord and ill tie him to this chest of drawers i dont think hell come to himself too soon but its best to be on the safe side decidedly so replied edgeworth bess and ill take this opportunity while jacks back is turnedfor hes grown so strangely particularof easing him of his snuffbox perhaps she added in a whisper as she appropriated the beforenamed article he has a pocketbook hush replied mrs maggot jack will hear you well come back for that by and by and the dressinggown at this moment rachel and blueskin returned their momentary absence seemed to have worked wonders for now the most perfect understanding appeared to subsist between them have you sent off the note inquired jack we have captain replied blueskin i say we because miss rachel and i have struck up a match shall i bring off anything he added looking eagerly round no replied jack peremptorily having now sealed his letter sheppard took a handkerchief and tying it over shotbolts face so as completely to conceal the features clapped his hat upon his head and pushed it over his brows he next seized the unlucky jailer and forced him along while blueskin expedited his movements by administering a few kicks behind when they got to the door jack opened it and mimicking the voice of the jailer shouted now my lads alls ready here we are cried the chairmen hurrying out of the court with their swinging vehicle where is he here replied sheppard dragging out shotbolt by the collar while blueskin pushed him behind and mrs maggot held up a lantern which she found in the shop in with him ayay yer honr cried the foremost chairman lending a helping hand get in wid ye ye villin and despite his resistance shotbolt was thrust into the chair which was instantly fastened upon him there hes as safe as jack sheppard in the condemned hould laughed the man off with you to newgate cried jack and dont let him out till you get inside the lodge theres a letter for the head turnkey mr irreton dye hear yes yer honr replied the chairman taking the note what are you waiting for asked jack impatiently the genlman as hired us replied the chairman oh hell be after you directly hes settling an account in the house lose no time the letter will explain all the chair was then rapidly put in motion and speedily disappeared whats to be done next cried blueskin returning to rachel who was standing with edgeworth bess near the door i shall go back and finish my supper said mrs maggot and so shall i replied edgeworth bess stop a minute cried jack detaining his mistresses here we partperhaps for ever ive already told you im about to take a long journey and its more than probable i shall never return dont say so cried mrs maggot i should be perfectly miserable if i thought you in earnest the very idea is dreadful whimpered edgeworth bess farewell cried jack embracing them take this key to baptist kettleby on seeing it hell deliver you a box which it will unlock and in which youll find a matter of fifty guineas and a few trinkets divide the money between you and wear the ornaments for my sake but if youve a spark of love for me dont meddle with anything in that house not for worlds exclaimed both ladies together farewell cried jack breaking from them and rushing down the street what shall we do poll hesitated edgeworth bess go in to be sure simpleton replied mrs maggot and bring off all we can i know where everything valuable is kept since jack has left us what does it matter whether hes pleased or not at this moment a whistle was heard coming cried blueskin who was still lingering with rachel the captains in such a desperate hurry that theres no time for lovemaking adieu my charmer youll find those young ladies extremely agreeable acquaintances adieu and snatching a hasty kiss he darted after jack the chair meanwhile with its unhappy load was transported at a brisk pace to newgate arrived there the porter thundered at the massive door of the lodge which was instantly openedshotbolts note having been received just before all the turnkeys were assembled ireton and langley had returned from a second unsuccessful search marvel had come thither to bid goodnight to mrs spurling austin had never quitted his post the tapstress was full of curiosity but she appeared more easy than the others behind her stood caliban chuckling to himself and grinning from ear to ear well whod have thought of shotbolt beating us all in this way said ireton im sorry for old newgate that another jail should have it its infernally provoking infernally provoking echoed langley nobody has so much cause for complaint as me growled austin ive lost my wager twenty pounds rejoined mrs spurling i witnessed the bet here he is cried ireton as the knocking was heard without get ready the irons caliban wait a bit massa replied the grinning negrolilly bitsee all right fust by this time the chair had been brought into the lodge youve got him demanded ireton safe inside replied the chairman wiping the heat from his brow weve run all the way wheres mr shotbolt asked austin the genlmanll be here directly he was detained t other genlman said the letter ud explain all detained echoed marvel thats odd but lets see the prisoner the chair was then opened shotbolt by cried austin as the captive was dragged forth ive won after all exclamations of wonder burst from all mrs spurling bit her lips to conceal her mirth caliban absolutely crowed with delight hear the letter said ireton breaking the seal this is the way in which i will serve all who attempt to apprehend me it is signed jack sheppard and so jack sheppard has sent back shotbolt in this pickle said langley so it appears replied marvel untie his arms and take off that handkerchief the poor fellows half smothered i guess what share youve had in this whispered austin to mrs spurling never mind replied the tapstress youve won your wager half an hour after this occurrence when it had been sufficiently laughed at and discussed when the wager had been settled and the chairman dismissed with the remaining three guineas which shotbolt was compelled to pay ireton arose and signified his intention of stepping across the street to inform mr wild of the circumstance as its getting late and the porter may be gone to bed he observed ill take the passkey and let myself in mr wild is sure to be up he never retires to rest till daybreakif at all come with me langley and bring the lantern chapter xiv how jack sheppard was again captured jack sheppard after whistling to blueskin hurried down a short thoroughfare leading from wych street to the back of saint clements church where he found thames darrell who advanced to meet him i was just going said thames when i parted from you at mr kneebones door you begged me to await your return here assuring me you would not detain me five minutes instead of which more than half an hour has elapsed you wont complain of the delay when i tell you what ive done answered jack ive obtained two packets containing letters from sir rowland trenchard which ive no doubt will establish your title to the estates take them and may they prove as serviceable to you as i desire jack replied thames greatly moved i wish i could devise any means of brightening your own dark prospects thats impossible replied jack i am utterly lost not utterly rejoined the other utterly reiterated jack gloomilyas regards all i hold dear listen to me thames im about to leave this country for ever having ascertained that a vessel sails for france from the river at daybreak tomorrow morning i have secured a passage in her and have already had the few effects i possess conveyed on board blueskin goes with me the faithful fellow will never leave me never while ive breath in my body captain rejoined blueskin who had joined them england or france london or paris its all one to me so ive you to command me stand out of earshot rejoined his leader ill call you when youre wanted and blueskin withdrew i cannot but approve the course you are about to take jack said thames though on some accounts i regret it in after years you can return to your own countryto your friends never replied sheppard bitterly my friends need not fear my return they shall hear of me no more under another namenot my own hateful onei will strive to distinguish myself in some foreign service and win myself a reputation or perish honourably but i will nevernever return i will not attempt to combat your resolution jack returned thames after a pause but i dread the effect your departure may have upon your poor mother her life hangs upon a thread and this may snap it i wish you hadnt mentioned her said jack in a broken voice while his whole frame shook with emotion what i do is for the best and i can only hope she may have strength to bear the separation you must say farewell to her for i cannot i dont ask you to supply my placefor that is perhaps impossible but be like a son to her do not doubt me replied thames warmly pressing his hand and now ive one further request faltered jack though i scarcely know how to make it it is to set me right with winifred do not let her think worse of me than i deserveor even so ill tell her that more than once when about to commit some desperate offence i have been restrained by her gentle image if hopeless love for her made me a robber it has also saved me many a crime will you tell her that i will replied thames earnestly enough said jack recovering his composure and now to your own concerns blueskin who has been on the watch all night has dogged sir rowland trenchard to jonathan wilds house and from the mysterious manner in which he was admitted by the thieftakers confidential servant abraham mendez and not by the regular porter there is little doubt but they are alone and probably making some arrangements prior to our uncles departure from england is he leaving england demanded thames in astonishment he sails tomorrow morning in the very vessel by which i start replied jack now if as i suspectfrom the documents just placed in your possessionsir rowland meditates doing you justice after his departure it is possible his intentions may be frustrated by the machinations of wild whose interest is obviously to prevent such an occurrence unless we can surprise them together and by proving to sir rowland that we possess the power of compelling a restitution of your rights force the other treacherous villain into compliance jonathan in all probability knows nothing of these packets and their production may serve to intimidate him will you venture it is a hazardous experiment said thames after a moments reflection but i will make it you must not however accompany me jack the risk i run is nothing to yours i care for no risk provided i can serve you rejoined sheppard besides youll not be able to get in without me it wont do to knock at the door and jonathan wilds house is not quite so easy of entrance as mr woods i understand replied thames be it as you will then well lose no more time returned jack come along blueskin starting at a rapid pace in the direction of the old bailey and crossing fleet bridge for oyster tubs renowned the trio skirted the right bank of the muddy stream until they reached fleet lane up which they hurried turning off again on the left down seacoal lane they arrived at the mouth of a dark narrow alley into which they plunged and at the farther extremity found a small yard overlooked by the blank walls of a large gloomy habitation a door in this house opened upon the yard jack tried it and found it locked if i had my old tools with me wed soon master this obstacle he muttered we shall be obliged to force it try the cellar captain said blueskin stamping upon a large board in the ground heres the door this is the way the old thief brings in all his heavy plunder which he stows in outoftheway holes in his infernal dwelling ive seen him often do it while making these remarks blueskin contrived by means of a chisel which he chanced to have about him to lift up the board and introducing his fingers beneath it with jacks assistance speedily opened it altogether disclosing a dark hole into which he leapt follow me thames cried jack dropping into the chasm they were now in a sort of cellar at one end of which was a door it was fastened inside but taking the chisel from blueskin jack quickly forced back the bolt as they entered the room beyond a fierce growl was heard let me go first said blueskin the dogs know me soho boys and walking up to the animals which were chained to the wall they instantly recognised him and suffered the others to pass without barking groping their way through one or two dark and mouldysmelling vaults the party ascended a flight of steps which brought them to the hall as jack conjectured no one was there and though a lamp was burning on a stand they decided upon proceeding without it they then swiftly mounted the stairs and stopped before the audiencechamber applying his ear to the keyhole jack listened but could detect no sound he next cautiously tried the door but found it fastened inside i fear were too late he whispered to thames but well soon see give me the chisel blueskin and dexterously applying the implement he forced open the lock they then entered the room which was perfectly dark this is strange said jack under his breath sir rowland must be gone and yet i dont know the keys in the lock on the inner side be on your guard i am so replied thames who had followed him closely shall i fetch the light captain whispered blueskin yes replied jack i dont know how it is he added in a low voice to thames as they were left alone but ive a strange foreboding of ill my heart fails me i almost wish we hadnt come as he said this he moved forward a few paces when finding his feet glued to the ground by some adhesive substance he stooped to feel what it was but instantly withdrew his hand with an exclamation of horror god in heaven he cried the floor is covered with blood some foul murder has been committed the lightthe light astounded at his cries thames sprang towards him at this moment blueskin appeared with the lamp and revealed a horrible spectaclethe floor deluged with bloodvarious articles of furniture upsetpapers scattered aboutthe murdered mans cloak trampled upon and smeared with gorehis hat crushed and similarly stainedhis swordthe ensanguined clothwith several other ghastly evidences of the slaughterous deed further on there were impressions of bloody footsteps along the floor sir rowland is murdered cried jack as soon as he could find a tongue it is plain he has been destroyed by his perfidious accomplice rejoined thames oh god how fearfully my father is avenged true replied jack sternly but we have our uncle to avenge whats this he added stooping to pick up a piece of paper lying at his feetit was jonathans memorandum this is the explanation of the bloody deed heres a pocketbook full of notes and a heavy bag of gold said blueskin examining the articles on the floor the sum which incited the villain to the murder replied jack but he cant be far off he must be gone to dispose of the body we shall have him on his return ill see where these footsteps lead to said blueskin holding the light to the floor here are some more papers captain give them to me replied jack ah he exclaimed a letter beginning dearest alivathats your mothers name thames let me see it cried thames snatching it from him it is addressed to my mother he added as his eye glanced rapidly over it and by my father at length i shall ascertain my name bring the light this wayquick i cannot decipher the signature jack was about to comply with the request when an unlookedfor interruption occurred having traced the footsteps to the wall and perceiving no outlet blueskin elevated the lamp and discovered marks of bloody fingers on the boards he must have gone this way muttered blueskin ive often heard of a secret door in this room though i never saw it it must be somewhere hereabouts ah he exclaimed as his eye fell upon a small knob in the wall theres the spring he touched it and the door flew open the next moment he was felled to the ground by jonathan wild who sprang into the room followed by abraham bearing the link a single glance served to show the thieftaker how matters stood from the slight sounds that had reached him in his place of confinement he was aware that some persons had found their way to the scene of slaughter and in a state of the most intense anxiety awaited the result of their investigation prepared for the worst hearing the spring touched he dashed through on the instant and struck down the person who presented himself with his bludgeon on beholding the intruders his fears changed to exultation and he uttered a roar of satisfaction as he glared at them which could only be likened to the cry of some savage denizen of the plains on his appearance jack levelled a pistol at his head but his hand was withheld by thames dont fire cried the latter it is important not to slay him he shall expiate his offences on the gibbet you are my prisoner murderer your prisoner echoed jonathan derisively you mistakeyou are mine and so is your companionthe convict sheppard waste not another word with him thames cried jack upon him yield villain or die shouted thames drawing his sword and springing towards him theres my answer rejoined wild hurling the bludgeon at him with such fatal effect that striking him on the head it brought him instantly to the ground ah traitor cried jack pulling the trigger of his pistol anticipating this wild avoided the shot by suddenly ducking his head he had a narrow escape however for passing within an inch of him the bullet burried itself deeply in the wall before he could fire a second shot jack had to defend himself from the thieftaker who with his drawn hanger furiously assaulted him eluding the blow jack plucked his sword from the scabbard and a desperate conflict began pick up that blade nab vociferated wild finding himself hotly pressed and stab him i wont give him a chance cowardly villain cried jack as the jew obeying the orders of his principal snatched up the weapon of the murdered man and assailed him but ill yet disappoint you and springing backwards he darted suddenly through the door after him cried wild he mustnt escape dead or alive ill have him bring the link and followed by abraham he rushed out of the room just as jack got half way down the stairs and wild and the jew reached the upper landing the streetdoor was opened by langley and ireton the latter of whom carried a lantern stop him shouted jonathan from the stairhead stop him its jack sheppard give way cried jack fiercely ill cut down him who opposes me the head turnkey in all probability would have obeyed but being pushed forward by his subordinate officer he was compelled to make a stand youd better surrender quietly jack he cried youve no chance instead of regarding him jack glanced over the iron bannisters and measured the distance but the fall was too great and he abandoned the attempt we have him cried jonathan hurrying down the steps he cant escape as this was said jack turned with the swiftness of thought and shortening his sword prepared to plunge it into the thieftakers heart before he could make the thrust however he was seized behind by ireton who flung himself upon him caught shouted the headturnkey i give you joy of the capture mr wild he added as jonathan came up and assisted him to secure and disarm the prisoner i was coming to give you intelligence of a comical trick played by this rascal when i find him herethe last place i own where i should have expected to find him youve arrived in the very nick of time rejoined jonathan and ill take care your services are not overlooked mr ireton cried jack in accents of the most urgent entreaty before you take me hence i implore youif you would further the ends of justicesearch this house one of the most barbarous murders ever committed has just been perpetrated by the monster wild you will find proofs of the bloody deed in his room but go thither at once i beseech you before he has time to remove them mr ireton is welcome to search every room in my house if he pleases said jonathan in a tone of bravado as soon as weve conveyed you to newgate ill accompany him mr ireton will do no such thing replied the headturnkey bless your soul dye think im to be gammoned by such nonsense not i im not quite such a greenhorn as shotbolt jack whatever you may think for mercys sake go up stairs implored sheppard i have not told you half theres a man dyingcaptain darrell take me with you place a pistol at my ear and shoot me if ive told you false and what good would that do replied ireton sarcastically to shoot you would be to lose the reward you act your part capitally but it wont do wont you go cried jack passionately mr langley i appeal to you murder i say has been done another murder will be committed if you dont prevent it the blood will rest on your head do you hear me sir wont you stir not a step replied langley gruffly off with him to newgate cried jonathan ireton as you captured him the reward is yours but i request that a third may be given to langley it shall be sir replied ireton bowing now come along jack miscreants cried sheppard almost driven frantic by the violence of his emotions youre all in league with him away with him cried jonathan ill see him fettered myself remain at the door nab he added loitering for a moment behind the others and let no one in or out jack meanwhile was carried to newgate austin could scarcely credit his senses when he beheld him shotbolt who had in some degree recovered from the effects of his previous mortification was thrown into an ecstacy of delight and could not sufficiently exult over the prisoner mrs spurling had retired for the night jack appealed to the new auditors and again detailed his story but with no better success than heretofore his statement was treated with derision having seen him heavily ironed and placed in the condemned hold jonathan recrossed the street he found abraham on guard as he had left him has any one been here he asked no von replied the jew thats well replied wild entering the house and fastening the door and now to dispose of our dead why nab you shake as if youd got an ague he added turning to the jew whose teeth chattered audibly i havent quite recovered the fright i got in the vellhole replied abraham on returning to the audiencechamber jonathan found the inanimate body of thames darrell lying where he had left it but on examining it he remarked that the pockets were turned inside out and had evidently been rifled startled by this circumstance he looked around and perceived that the trapdoorwhich has been mentioned as communicating with a secret staircasewas open he next discovered that blueskin was gone and pursuing his scrutiny found that he had carried off all the banknotes gold and lettersincluding what jonathan himself was not aware ofthe two packets which he had abstracted from the person of thames uttering a terrible imprecation jonathan snatched up the link and hastily descended the stairs leaving the jew behind him after a careful search below he could detect no trace of blueskin but finding the cellardoor open concluded he had got out that way returning to the audiencechamber in a bynomeans enviable state of mind he commanded the jew to throw the body of thames into the well hole you musht do dat shob yourself mishter vild rejoined abraham shaking his head no prize shall indushe me to enter dat horrid plashe again fool cried wild taking up the body what are you afraid of after all he added pausing he may be of more use to me alive than dead adhering to this change of plan he ordered abraham to follow him and descending the secret stairs once more carried the wounded man into the lower part of the premises unlocking several doors he came to a dark vault that would have rivalled the gloomiest cell in newgate into which he thrust thames and fastened the door go to the pump nab he said when this was done and fill a pail with water we must wash out those stains up stairs and burn the cloth blood they say wont come out but i never found any truth in the saying when ive had an hours rest ill be after blueskin chapter xv how blueskin underwent the peine forte et dure as soon as it became known through the medium of the public prints on the following day that jack sheppard had broken out of prison and had been again captured during the night fresh curiosity was excited and larger crowds than ever flocked to newgate in the hope of obtaining admission to his cell but by the governors express commands wild having privately counselled the step no one was allowed to see him a question next arose whether the prisoner could be executed under the existing warrantsome inclining to one opinion some to another to settle the point the governor started to windsor delegating his trust in the interim to wild who took advantage of his brief rule to adopt the harshest measures towards the prisoner he had him removed from the condemned hold stripped of his fine apparel clothed in the most sordid rags loaded with additional fetters and thrust into the stone holdalready described as the most noisome cell in the whole prison here without a glimpse of daylight visited by no one except austin at stated intervals who neither answered a question nor addressed a word to him fed upon the worst diet literally mouldy bread and ditchwater surrounded by stone walls with a flagged floor for his pillow and without so much as a blanket to protect him from the deathlike cold that pierced his framejacks stout heart was subdued and he fell into the deepest dejection ardently longing for the time when even a violent death should terminate his sufferings but it was not so ordered mr pitt returned with intelligence that the warrant was delayed and on taking the opinion of two eminent lawyers of the day sir william thomson and mr serjeant raby it was decided that it must be proved in a regular and judicial manner that sheppard was the identical person who had been convicted and had escaped before a fresh order could be made for his execution and that the matter must therefore stand over until the next sessions to be held at the old bailey in october when it could be brought before the court the unfortunate prisoner meanwhile who was not informed of the respite languished in his horrible dungeon and at the expiration of three weeks became so seriously indisposed that it was feared he could not long survive he refused his foodand even when better provisions were offered him rejected them as his death was by no means what jonathan desired he resolved to remove him to a more airy ward and afford him such slight comforts as might tend to his restoration or at least keep him alive until the period of execution with this view jack was carriedfor he was no longer able to move without assistanceto a ward called the castle situated over the gateway on the western side in what was considered the strongest part of the jail the walls were of immense thickness the small windows doublegrated and unglazed the fireplace was without a grate and a barrackbed divided into two compartments occupied one corner it was about twelve feet high nine wide and fourteen long and was approached by double doors each six inches thick as jack appeared to be sinking fast his fetters were removed his own clothes were returned to him and he was allowed a mattress and a scanty supply of bedlinen mrs spurling attended him as his nurse and under her care he speedily revived as soon as he became convalescent and all fears of his premature dissolution were at an end wild recommenced his rigorous treatment the bedding was removed mrs spurling was no longer allowed to visit him he was again loaded with irons fastened by an enormous horsepadlock to a staple in the floor and only allowed to take repose in a chair a single blanket constituted his sole covering at night in spite of all this he grew daily better and stronger and his spirits revived hitherto no visiters had been permitted to see him as the time when his identity had to be proved approached this rigour was in a trifling degree relaxed and a few persons were occasionally admitted to the ward but only in the presence of austin from none of these could jack ascertain what had become of thames or learn any particulars concerning the family at dollis hill or of his mother austin who had been evidently schooled by wild maintained a profound silence on this head in this way more than a month passed over october arrived and in another week the court would be sitting at the old bailey one night about this time just as austin was about to lock the great gate jonathan wild and his two janizaries entered the lodge with a prisoner bound hand and foot it was blueskin on the cords being removed he made a desperate spring at wild bore him to the ground clutched at his throat and would infallibly have strangled him if the keepers had not all thrown themselves upon him and by main force torn him off his struggles were so violent that being a man of tremendous strength it was some time before they could master him and it required the combined efforts of all the four partners to put him into irons it appeared from what he said that he had been captured when asleepthat his liquor had been druggedotherwise he would never have allowed himself to be taken alive wild he asserted had robbed him of a large sum of money and till it was restored he would never plead well see that replied jonathan take him to the bilbowes put him in the stocks and there let him sleep off his drunken fit whether he pleads or not he shall swing with his confederate jack sheppard at this allusion to his leader a shudder passed through blueskins athletic frame where is he he cried let me see him let me have a word with him and you may take all the money jonathan made no answer but motioned the partners to take him away as soon as blueskin was removed wild intimated his intention of visiting the castle he was accompanied by ireton and austin the massive door was unlocked and they entered the cell what was their surprise to find it vacant and the prisoner gone jonathan could scarcely believe his eyes he looked fiercely and inquiringly from one to the other of his companions but though both of them were excessively frightened neither appeared guilty before a word could be said however a slight noise was heard in the chimney and jack with his irons on descended from it without betraying the slightest confusion or making a single remark he quietly resumed his seat amazement cried wild how has he unfastened his padlock austin it must be owing to your negligence my negligence mr wild said the turnkey trembling in every joint i assure you sir when i left him an hour ago it was locked i tried it myself sir im as much astonished as you but i cant account for it at all events you shall answer for it thundered wild with a bitter imprecation hes not to blame said jack rising i opened the padlock with this crooked nail which i found in the floor if you had arrived ten minutes later or if there hadnt been an iron bar in the chimney that hindered my progress i should have been beyond your reach you talk boldly replied wild go to the iron hold austin and tell two of the partners to bring another padlock of the largest size and the heaviest handcuffs they can find well try whether hell get loose again sheppard said nothing but a disdainful smile curled his lips austin departed and presently afterwards returned with the two subordinate officers each of whom wore a leathern apron round his waist and carried a large hammer as soon as the manacles were slipped over the prisoners wrists and the new padlock secured to the staple they withdrew leave me alone with him a moment said jonathan and the jailers also retired jack said wild with a glance of malignant triumph i will now tell you what i have done all my plans have succeeded before a month has elapsed your mother will be mine the trenchard estates will likewise be mine for sir rowland is no more and the youth thames will never again see daylight blueskin who had evaded me with the papers and the money is a prisoner here and will perish on the same gallows as yourself my vengeance is completely gratified without waiting for a reply but darting a malevolent look at the prisoner he quitted the cell the door of which was instantly doublelocked and bolted ive not quite done yet said jonathan as he joined the turnkeys i should like to see whether blueskin is a little more composed ive a question to ask him give me the keys and the light ill go alone so saying he descended a short spiral staircase and entering a long stone gallery from which several other passages branched took one of them and after various turningsfor he was familiar with all the intricacies of the prisonarrived at the cell of which he was in search selecting a key from the heavy bunch committed to him by austin he threw open the door and beheld blueskin seated at the back of the small chamber handcuffed and with his feet confined in a heavy pair of stocks he was asleep when jonathan entered and growled at being disturbed but as soon as he perceived who it was he roused himself and glared fiercely at the intruder from under his bent brows what do you want he asked in a gruff voice i want to know what youve done with the rest of the noteswith the goldand the papers you took away from my room rejoined wild then youll never know more than this retorted blueskin with a grin of satisfactiontheyre in a place of safety where youll never find em but where somebody else will and that before long hear me blueskin said jonathan restraining his choler if youll tell me where to look for these things and i do find them ill set you free and you shall have a share of the gold for yourself ill tell you what ill do rejoined the other set captain sheppard free and when i hear hes safenot beforeill put the money and papers into your possession and some other matters too that you know nothing about impracticable dolt exclaimed jonathan furiously do you think id part with the sweetest morsel of revenge on those terms no but ill have the secret out of you by other means so saying he violently shut and locked the door about ten days after this interview blueskin having been indicted by wild for several robberies and true bills found against him was placed at the bar of the old bailey to be arraigned when he declared that he would not plead to the indictment unless the sum of five hundred pounds taken from him by jonathan wild was first restored to him this sum claimed by wild under the statute th and th of william and mary entitled an act for encouraging the apprehending of highwaymen was granted to him by the court as blueskin still continued obstinate the judgment appointed to be executed upon such prisoners as stood mute was then read it was as follows and when uttered produced a strong effect upon all who heard it except the prisoner who in no respect altered his sullen and dogged demeanour prisoner at the bar thus ran the sentence you shall be taken to the prison from whence you came and put into a mean room stopped from the light and shall there be laid on the bare ground without any litter straw or other covering and without any garment you shall lie upon your back your head shall be covered and your feet shall be bare one of your arms shall be drawn to one side of the room and the other arm to the other side and your legs shall be served in the like manner then there shall be laid upon your body as much iron or stone as you can bear and more and the first day you shall have three morsels of barley bread without any drink and the second day you shall be allowed to drink as much as you can at three times of the water that is next to the prisondoor except runningwater without any bread and this shall be your diet till you die prisoner at the bar continued the clerk of the court he against whom this judgment is given forfeits his goods to the king an awful silence prevailed throughout the court every eye was fixed upon the prisoner but as he made no answer he was removed before the full sentence was carried into execution he was taken into a small room adjoining the court here marvel the executioner who was in attendance was commanded by wild to tie his thumbs together which he did with whipcord so tightly that the string cut to the bone but as this produced no effect and did not even elicit a groan the prisoner was carried back to newgate the press room to which blueskin was conveyed on his arrival at the jail was a small square chamber walled and paved with stone in each corner stood a stout square post reaching to the ceiling to these a heavy wooden apparatus was attached which could be raised or lowered at pleasure by pullies in the floor were set four ringbolts about nine feet apart when the prisoner was brought into this room he was again questioned but continuing contumacious preparations were made for inflicting the torture his great personal strength being so well known it was deemed prudent by marvel to have all the four partners together with caliban in attendance the prisoner however submitted more quietly than was anticipated he allowed his irons and clothes to be taken off without resistance but just as they were about to place him on the ground he burst from their hold and made a desperate spring at jonathan who was standing with his arms folded near the door watching the scene the attempt was unsuccessful he was instantly overpowered and stretched upon the ground the four men fell upon him holding his arms and legs while caliban forced back his head in this state he contrived to get the poor blacks hand into his mouth and nearly bit off one of his fingers before the sufferer could be rescued meanwhile the executioner had attached strong cords to his ankles and wrists and fastened them tightly to the iron rings this done he unloosed the pulley and the ponderous machine which resembled a trough slowly descended upon the prisoners breast marvel then took two iron weights each of a hundred pounds and placed them in the press as this seemed insufficient after a lapse of five minutes he added another hundred weight the prisoner breathed with difficulty still his robust frame enabled him to hold out after he had endured this torture for an hour at a sign from wild another hundred weight was added in a few minutes an appalling change was perceptible the veins in his throat and forehead swelled and blackened his eyes protruded from their sockets and stared wildly a thick damp gathered on his brow and blood gushed from his mouth nostrils and ears water he gasped the executioner shook his head do you submit interrogated wild blueskin answered by dashing his head violently against the flagged floor his efforts at selfdestruction were however prevented try fifty pounds more said jonathan stop groaned blueskin will you plead demanded wild harshly i will answered the prisoner release him said jonathan we have cured his obstinacy you perceive he added to marvel i will live cried blueskin with a look of the deadliest hatred at wild to be revenged on you and as the weights were removed he fainted chapter xvi how jack sheppards portrait was painted early in the morning of thursday the th of october the door of the castle was opened by austin who with a look of unusual importance announced to the prisoner that four gentlemen were shortly coming up with the governor to see himfour such gentlemen he added in a tone meant to impress his auditor with a due sense of the honour intended him as you dont meet every day is mr wood among them asked jack eagerly mr woodno replied the turnkey do you think id take the trouble to announce him these are persons of consequence i tell you who are they inquired sheppard why first rejoined austin theres sir james thornhill historical painter to his majesty and the greatest artist of the day those grand designs in the dome of st pauls are his work so is the roof of the stateroom at hampton court palace occupied by queen anne and the prince of denmark so is the chapel of all souls at oxford and the great hall at blenheim and i dont know how many halls and chapels besides hes now engaged on the hall at greenwich hospital ive heard of him replied jack impatiently who are the others let me see theres a friend of sir jamesa young man an engraver of masquerade tickets and caricatureshis name i believe is hogarth then theres mr gay the poet who wrote the captives which was lately acted at drury lane and was so much admired by the princess of wales and lastly theres mr figg the noted prizefighter from the new amphitheatre in marylebone fields figgs an old friend of mine rejoined jack he was my instructor in the small sword and back sword exercise im glad hes come to see me you dont inquire what brings sir james thornhill here said austin curiosity i suppose returned jack carelessly no such thing rejoined the jailer hes coming on business on what business in the name of wonder asked sheppard to paint your portrait answered the jailer my portrait echoed jack by desire of his majesty said the jailer consequentially he has heard of your wonderful escapes and wishes to see what youre like theres a feather in your cap no housebreaker was ever so highly honoured before and have my escapes really made so much noise as to reach the ear of royalty mused jack i have done nothingnothing to what i could doto what i will do youve done quite enough rejoined austin more than youll ever do again and then to be taken thus in these disgraceful bonds continued jack to be held up as a sight for ever why how else would you be taken exclaimed the jailer with a coarse laugh its very well mr wild allowed you to have your fine clothes again or you might have been taken in a still more disgraceful garb for my part i think those shackles extremely becoming but here they are voices being heard at the door austin flew to open it and admitted mr pitt the governor a tall pompous personage who in his turn ushered in four other individuals the first of these whom he addressed as mr gay was a stout goodlooking goodhumoured man about thirtysix with a dark complexion an oval face fine black eyes full of fire and sensibility and twinkling with roguish humouran expression fully borne out by the mouth which had a very shrewd and sarcastic curl the poets appearance altogether was highly prepossessing with a strong tendency to satire but without a particle of malice or illnature in its display gay by his strokes of pleasantry whether in his writings or conversation never lost a friend on the contrary he was a universal favourite and numbered amongst his intimate acquaintances the choicest spirits of the timepope swift arbuthnot and all the better brothers his demeanour was polished his manners singularly affable and gentle and he was remarkable for the generosity of his temper in worldly matters gay was not fortunate possessed at one time of a share in the south sea stock he conceived himself worth twenty thousand pounds but on the bursting of that bubble his hopes vanished with it neither did his interestwhich was by no means inconsiderablenor his general popularity procure him the preferment he desired a constant attendant at court he had the mortification to see every one promoted but himself and thus bewails his illluck places i found were daily given away and yet no friendly gazette mentioned gay the prodigious success of the beggars opera which was produced about four years after the date of this history rewarded him for all his previous disappointments though it did not fully justify the wellknown epigram alluding to himself and the manager and make gay rich and rich gay at the time of his present introduction his play of the captives had just been produced at drury lane and he was meditating his fables which were published two years afterwards behind the poet came sir james thornhill the eminent painter had handsome expressive features an aquiline nose and a good deal of dignity in his manner his age was not far from fifty he was accompanied by a young man of about sevenandtwenty who carried his easel set it in its place laid the canvass upon it opened the paint box took out the brushes and palette and in short paid him the most assiduous attention this young man whose features though rather plain and coarse bore the strongest impress of genius and who had a dark gray penetrating eye so quick in its glances that it seemed to survey twenty objects at once and yet only to fasten upon one bore the honoured name of william hogarth why he paid so much attention to sir james thornhill may be explained anon the rear of the party was brought up by a large powerfullybuilt man with a bluff honest but rugged countenance slashed with many a cut and scar and stamped with that surly sturdy bulldoglike look which an englishman always delights to contemplate because he conceives it to be characteristic of his countrymen this formidable person who was no other than the renowned figg the atlas of the sword as he is termed by captain godfrey had removed his hat and skull covering and was wiping the heat from his bepatched and closeshaven pate his shirt also was unbuttoned and disclosed a neck like that of an ox and a chest which might have served as a model for a hercules he had a flattish perhaps it should be called a flattened nose and a brown leathernlooking hide that seemed as if it had not unfrequently undergone the process of tanning under his arm he carried a thick knotted crabstick the above description of the great figg by the prizefighting swains sole monarch acknowledged of marybone plains may sound somewhat tame by the side of the glowing account given of him by his gallant biographer who asserts that there was a majesty shone in his countenance and blazed in his actions beyond all i ever saw but it may possibly convey a more accurate notion of his personal appearance james figg was the most perfect master of selfdefence of his day seconded by his strength and temper his skill rendered him invincible and he is reputed never to have lost a battle his imperturbable demeanour in the fight has been well portrayed by captain godfrey who here condescends to lay aside his stilts his right leg bold and firm and his left which could hardly ever be disturbed gave him a surprising advantage and struck his adversary with despair and panic he had a peculiar way of stepping in in a parry knew his arm and its just time of moving put a firm faith in that and never let his opponent escape he was just as much a greater master than any other i ever saw as he was a greater judge of time and measure figgs prowess in a combat with button has been celebrated by dr byroma poet of whom his native town manchester may be justly proud and his features and figure have been preserved by the most illustrious of his companions on the present occasionhogarthin the levee in the rakes progress and in southwark fair on the appearance of his visitors sheppard arosehis gyves clanking heavily as he made the movementand folding his arms so far as his manacles would permit him upon his breast steadily returned the glances fixed upon him this is the noted housebreaker and prisonbreaker gentlemen said mr pitt pointing to the prisoner odds life cried gay in astonishment is this slightmade stripling jack sheppard why i expected to see a man six foot high at the least and as broad across the shoulders as our friend figg this is a mere boy are you sure you havent mistaken the ward mr pitt there is no mistake sir rejoined the prisoner drawing himself up i am jack sheppard well i never was more surprised in my life said the poetnever hes just the man i expected to see observed hogarth who having arranged everything to thornhills satisfaction had turned to look at the prisoner and was now with his chin upon his wrist and his elbow supported by the other hand bending his keen gray eyes upon him just the man look at that light lithe figureall muscle and activity with not an ounce of superfluous flesh upon it in my search after strange characters mr gay ive been in many odd quarters of our cityhave visited haunts frequented only by thievesthe old mint the new mint the worst part of st giless and other placesbut ive nowhere seen any one who came up so completely to my notion of a firstrate housebreaker as the individual before us wherever i saw him i should pick him out as a man designed by nature to plan and accomplish the wonderful escapes he has effected as he spoke a smile crossed sheppards countenance he understands me you perceive said hogarth well i wont dispute your judgment in such matters mr hogarth replied gay but i appeal to you sir james whether it isnt extraordinary that so very slight a person should be such a desperate robber as he is representedso young too for such an old offender why he can scarcely be twenty i am oneandtwenty observed jack oneandtwenty ah repeated gay well im not far from the mark he is certainly extremely youthfullooking and very slightly made said thornhill who had been attentively studying sheppards countenance but i agree with hogarth that he is precisely the person to do what he has done like a thoroughbred racer he would sustain twice as much fatigue as a person of heavier mould can i be accommodated with a seat mr pitt certainly sir james certainly replied the governor get a chair austin while this order was obeyed figg who had been standing near the door made his way to the prisoner and offered him his huge hand which jack warmly grasped well jack said the prizefighter in a rough but friendly voice and with a cutandthrust abrupt manner peculiar to himself how are you lad eh sorry to see you here wouldnt take my advice told you how it would be one mistress enough to ruin a mantwo the devil laughed at me then laugh on the wrong side of your mouth now youre not come here to insult me mr figg said jack peevishly insult you not i returned figg heard of your escapes everybody talking of you wished to see you old pupil capital swordsman shortly to be executed come to take leave trifle useful he added slipping a few gold pieces into jacks hand you are very kind said jack returning the money but i dont require assistance too proud eh rejoined the prizefighter wont be under an obligation there youre wrong mr figg replied jack smiling for before im taken to tyburn i mean to borrow a shirt for the occasion from you have it and welcome rejoined figg always plenty to spare never bought a shirt in my life mr gay he added turning to the poet sold a good many though how do you manage that mr figg asked gay thus replied the prizefighter proclaim a public fight challenge accepted fifty pupils day before send round to each to borrow a shirt fifty sent home all superfine holland wear one on the stage on the following day cut to piecesslashedbloodied each of my scholars thinks it his own shirt offer to return it to each in private all make the same answerdn you keep it an ingenious device laughed gay sir james thornhills preparations being completed mr pitt desired to know if he wanted anything further and being answered in the negative he excused himself on the plea that his attendance was required in the court at the old bailey which was then sitting and withdrew do me the favour to seat yourself jack said sir james gentlemen a little further off if you please sheppard immediately complied with the painters request while gay and figg drew back on one side and hogarth on the other the latter took from his pocket a small notebook and pencil ill make a sketch too he said jack sheppards face is well worth preserving after narrowly examining the countenance of the sitter and motioning him with his pencil into a particular attitude sir james thornhill commenced operations and while he rapidly transferred his lineaments to the canvass engaged him in conversation in the course of which he artfully contrived to draw him into a recital of his adventures the ruse succeeded almost beyond his expectation during the narration jacks features lighted up and an expression which would have been in vain looked for in repose was instantly caught and depicted by the skilful artist all the party were greatly interested by sheppards historyespecially figg who laughed loud and long at the escape from the condemned hold when jack came to speak of jonathan wild his countenance fell we must change the subject remarked thornhill pausing in his task this will never do quite right sir james said austin we never suffer him to mention mr wilds name he never appears to so little advantage as when speaking of him i dont wonder at it rejoined gay here hogarth received a private signal from thornhill to attract sheppards attention and so youve given up all hope of escaping eh jack remarked hogarth thats scarcely a fair question mr hogarth before the jailer replied jack but i tell you frankly and mr austin may repeat it if he pleases to his master jonathan wildi have not well said jack cried figg never give in well observed hogarth if fettered as you are you contrive to break out of this dungeon youll do what no man ever did before a peculiar smile illuminated jacks features there it is cried sir james eagerly theres the exact expression i want for the love of heaven jack dont movedont alter a muscle if you can help it and with a few magical touches he stamped the fleeting expression on the canvass i have it too exclaimed hogarth busily plying his pencil gad its a devilish fine face when lit up as like as life sir observed austin peeping over thornhills shoulder at the portrait as like as life the very face exclaimed gay advancing to look at itwith all the escapes written in it you flatter me smiled sir james but i own i think it is like what do you think of my sketch jack said hogarth handing him the drawing its like enough i dare say rejoined sheppard but it wants something here and he pointed significantly to the hand i see rejoined hogarth rapidly sketching a file which he placed in the hands of the picture will that do he added returning it its better observed sheppard meaningly but youve given me what i dont possess hum said hogarth looking fixedly at him i dont see how i can improve it may i look at it sir said austin stepping towards him no replied hogarth hastily effacing the sketch im never satisfied with a first attempt egad jack said gay you should write your adventures they would be quite as entertaining as the histories of guzman dalfarache lazarillo de tormes estevanillo gonzalez meriton latroon or any of my favourite roguesand far more instructive you had better write them for me mr gay rejoined jack if youll write them ill illustrate them observed hogarth an idea has just occurred to me said gay which jacks narrative has suggested ill write an opera the scene of which shall be laid altogether in newgate and the principal character shall be a highmaywan ill not forget your two mistresses jack nor jonathan wild i hope interposed sheppard certainly not replied gay ill gibbet the rascal but i forget he added glancing at austin its high treason to speak disrespectfully of mr wild in his own domain i hear nothing sir laughed austin i was about to add continued gay that my opera shall have no music except the good old ballad tunes and well see whether it wont put the italian opera out of fashion with cutzoni senesino and the divine farinelli at its head youll do a national service then said hogarth the sums lavished upon those people are perfectly disgraceful and i should be enchanted to see them hooted from the stage but ive an idea as well as you grounded in some measure upon sheppards story ill take two apprentices and depict their career one by perseverance and industry shall obtain fortune credit and the highest honours while the other by an opposite course and dissolute habits shall eventually arrive at tyburn yours will be nearer the truth and have a deeper moral mr hogarth remarked jack dejectedly but if my career were truly exhibited it must be as one long struggle against destiny in the shape of jonathan wild interposed gay i knew it by the by mr hogarth didnt i see you last night at the ridotto with lady thornhill and her pretty daughter meno sir stammered hogarth colouring and he hazarded a wink at the poet over the paper on which he was sketching luckily sir james was so much engrossed by his own task that both the remark and gesture escaped him i suppose i was mistaken returned gay youve been quizzing my friend kent i perceive in your burlington gate a capital caricature that remarked thornhill laughing what does mr kent say to it he thinks so highly of it that he says if he had a daughter he would give her to the artist answered gay a little maliciously ah exclaimed sir james sdeath cried hogarth aside to the poet youve ruined my hopes advanced them rather replied gay in the same tone miss thornhills a charming girl i think a wife a needless incumbrance and mean to die a bachelor but if i were in your place i know what id do whatwhat would you do asked hogarth eagerly run away with her replied gay pish exclaimed hogarth but he afterwards acted upon the suggestion goodbye jack said figg putting on his hat rather in the way send you the shirt here turnkey couple of guineas to drink captain sheppards speedy escape thank him not me man give this fellow the slip if you can jack if not keep up your spirits die game never fear replied jack if i get free ill have a bout with you at all weapons if not ill take a cheerful glass with you at the city of oxford on my way to tyburn give you the best i have in either case replied figg goodbye and with a cordial shake of the hand he took his departure sir james thornhill then rose i wont trouble you further jack he remarked ive done all i can to the portrait here i must finish it at home permit me to see it sir james requested jack ah he exclaimed as the painting was turned towards him what would my poor mother say to it i was sorry to see that about your mother jack observed hogarth what of her exclaimed jack starting up is she dead nono answered hogarth dont alarm yourself i saw it this morning in the daily journalan advertisement offering a reward a reward echoed jack for what i had the paper with me sdeath what can i have done with it oh here it is cried hogarth picking it from the ground i must have dropped it when i took out my notebook theres the paragraph mrs sheppard left mr woods house at dollis hill on tuesdaythats two days agohasnt been heard of since let me see cried jack snatching the paper and eagerly perusing the advertisement ah he exclaimed in a tone of anguish she has fallen into the villains hands what villain cried hogarth jonathan wild ill be sworn said gay rightright cried jack striking his fettered hands against his breast she is in his power and i am here chained hand and foot unable to assist her i could make a fine sketch of him now whispered hogarth to gay i told you how it was sir james said austin addressing the knight who was preparing for his departure he attributes every misfortune that befals him to mr wild and with some justice replied thornhill drily allow me to assist you sir james said hogarth many thanks sir replied thornhill with freezing politeness but id not require assistance i tell you what jack said gay ive several urgent engagements this morning but ill return tomorrow and hear the rest of your story and if i can render you any service you may command me tomorrow will be too late said sheppard moodily the easel and palette having been packed up and the canvass carefully removed by austin the party took leave of the prisoner who was so much abstracted that he scarcely noticed their departure just as hogarth got to the door the turnkey stopped him you have forgotten your knife mr hogarth he observed significantly so i have replied hogarth glancing at sheppard i can do without it muttered jack the door was then locked and he was left alone at three oclock on the same day austin brought up jacks provisions and after carefully examining his fetters and finding all secure told him if he wanted anything further he must mention it as he should not be able to return in the evening his presence being required elsewhere jack replied in the negative and it required all his mastery over himself to prevent the satisfaction which this announcement afforded him from being noticed by the jailer with the usual precautions austin then departed and now cried jack leaping up for an achievement compared with which all i have yet done shall be as nothing chapter xvii the iron bar jack sheppards first object was to free himself from his handcuffs this he accomplished by holding the chain that connected them firmly between his teeth and squeezing his fingers as closely together as possible succeeded in drawing his wrists through the manacles he next twisted the heavy gyves round and round and partly by main strength partly by a dexterous and wellapplied jerk sapped asunder the central link by which they were attached to the padlock taking off his stockings he then drew up the basils as far as he was able and tied the fragments of the broken chain to his legs to prevent them from clanking and impeding his future exertions jacks former attempt to pass up the chimney it may be remembered was obstructed by an iron bar to remove this obstacle it was necessary make an extensive breach in the wall with the broken links of the chain which served him in lieu of more efficient implements he commenced operations just above the chimneypiece and soon contrived to pick a hole in the plaster he found the wall as he suspected solidly constructed of brick and stone and with the slight and inadequate tools which he possessed it was a work of infinite labour and skill to get out a single brick that done however he was well aware the rest would be comparatively easy and as he threw the brick to the ground he exclaimed triumphantly the first step is takenthe main difficulty is overcome animated by this trifling success he proceeded with fresh ardour and the rapidity of his progress was proclaimed by the heap of bricks stones and mortar which before long covered the floor at the expiration of an hour by dint of unremitting exertion he had made so large a breach in the chimney that he could stand upright in it he was now within a foot of the bar and introducing himself into the hole speedily worked his way to it regardless of the risk he incurred from some heavy stone dropping on his head or feetregardless also of the noise made by the falling rubbish and of the imminent danger which he consequently ran of being interrupted by some of the jailers should the sound reach their ears he continued to pull down large masses of the wall which he flung upon the floor of the cell having worked thus for another quarter of an hour without being sensible of fatigue though he was half stifled by the clouds of dust which his exertions raised he had made a hole about three feet wide and six high and uncovered the iron bar grasping it firmly with both hands he quickly wrenched if from the stones in which it was mortised and leapt to the ground on examination it proved to be a flat bar of iron nearly a yard in length and more than an inch square a capital instrument for my purpose thought jack shouldering it and worth all the trouble i have had in procuring it while he was thus musing he fancied he heard the lock tried a chill ran through his frame and grasping the heavy weapon with which chance had provided him prepared to strike down the first person who should enter the cell after listening attentively for a short time without drawing breath he became convinced that his apprehensions were groundless and greatly relieved sat down upon the chair to rest himself and prepare for further efforts acquainted with every part of the jail jack well knew that his only chance of effecting an escape must be by the roof to reach it would be a most difficult undertaking still it was possible and the difficulty was only a fresh incitement the mere enumeration of the obstacles that existed would have deterred any spirit less daring than sheppards from even hazarding the attempt independently of other risks and of the chance of breaking his neck in the descent he was aware that to reach the leads he should have to break open six of the strongest doors of the prison armed however with the implement he had so fortunately obtained he did not despair of success my name will only be remembered as that of a robber he mused but it shall be remembered as that of a bold one and this nights achievement if it does nothing else shall prevent me from being classed with the common herd of depredators roused by this reflection filled with the deepest anxiety for his mother and burning to be avenged upon jonathan wild he grasped the iron bar which when he sat down he had laid upon his knees and stepped quickly across the room in doing so he had to clamber up the immense heap of bricks and rubbish which now littered the floor amounting almost to a carload and reaching up nearly to the top of the chimneypiece austin will stare thought jack when he comes here in the morning it will cost them something to repair their stronghold and take them more time to build it up again than i have taken to pull it down before proceeding with his task he considered whether it would be possible to barricade the door but reflecting that the bar would be an indispensable assistant in his further efforts he abandoned the idea and determined to rely implicitly on that good fortune which had hitherto attended him on similar occasions having once more got into the chimney he climbed to a level with the ward above and recommenced operations as vigorously as before he was now aided with a powerful implement with which he soon contrived to make a hole in the wall every brick i take out cried jack as fresh rubbish clattered down the chimney brings me nearer my mother chapter xviii the red room the ward into which jack was endeavouring to break was called the red room from the circumstance of its walls having once been painted in that colour all traces of which had however long since disappeared like the castle which it resembled in all respects except that it was destitute even of a barrackbedstead the red room was reserved for stateprisoners and had not been occupied since the year when the jail as has before been mentioned was crowded by the preston rebels having made a hole in the wall sufficiently large to pass through jack first tossed the bar into the room and then crept after it as soon as he had gained his feet he glanced round the bare blank walls of the cell and oppressed by the musty close atmosphere exclaimed ill let a little fresh air into this dungeon they say it hasnt been opened for eight yearsbut i wont be eight years in getting out of it in stepping across the room some sharp point in the floor pierced his foot and stooping to examine it he found that the wound had been inflicted by a long rusty nail which projected from the boards totally disregarding the pain he picked up the nail and reserved it for future use nor was he long in making it available on examining the door he found it secured by a large rusty lock which he endeavoured to pick with the nail he had just acquired but all his efforts proving ineffectual he removed the plate that covered it with the bar and with his fingers contrived to draw back the bolt opening the door he then stepped into a dark narrow passage leading as he was well aware to the chapel on the left there were doors communicating with the kings bench ward and the stone ward two large holds on the master debtors side but jack was too well versed in the geography of the place to attempt either of them indeed if he had been ignorant of it the sound of voices which he could faintly distinguish would have served as a caution to him hurrying on his progress was soon checked by a strong door several inches in thickness and nearly as wide as the passage running his hand carefully over it in search of the lock he perceived to his dismay that it was fastened on the other side after several vain attempts to burst it open he resolved as a last alternative to break through the wall in the part nearest to the lock this was a much more serious task than he anticipated the wall was of considerable thickness and built altogether of stone and the noise he was compelled to make in using the heavy bar which brought sparks with every splinter he struck off was so great that he feared it must be heard by the prisoners on the debtors side heedless however of the consequences he pursued his task half an hours labour during which he was obliged more than once to pause to regain breath sufficed to make a hole wide enough to allow a passage for his arm up to the elbow in this way he was able to force back a ponderous bolt from its socket and to his unspeakable joy found that the door instantly yielded once more cheered by daylight he hastened forward and entered the chapel chapter xix the chapel situated at the upper part of the southeast angle of the jail the chapel of old newgate was divided on the north side into three grated compartments or pens as they were termed allotted to the common debtors and felons in the northwest angle there was a small pen for female offenders and on the south a more commodious enclosure appropriated to the masterdebtors and strangers immediately beneath the pulpit stood a large circular pew where malefactors under sentence of death sat to hear the condemned sermon delivered to them and where they formed a public spectacle to the crowds which curiosity generally attracted on those occasions to return jack had got into one of the pens at the north side of the chapel the enclosure by which it was surrounded was about twelve feet high the under part being composed of taken planks the upper of a strong iron grating surmounted by sharp iron spikes in the middle there was a gate it was locked but jack speedily burst it open with the iron bar clearing the few impediments in his way he soon reached the condemned pew where it had once been his fate to sit and extending himself on the seat endeavoured to snatch a moments repose it was denied him for as he closed his eyesthough but for an instantthe whole scene of his former visit to the place rose before him there he sat as before with the heavy fetters on his limbs and beside him sat his three companions who had since expiated their offences on the gibbet the chapel was again crowded with visitors and every eyeeven that of jonathan wild who had come thither to deride himwas fixed upon him so perfect was the illusion that he could almost fancy he heard the solemn voice of the ordinary warning him that his race was nearly run and imploring him to prepare for eternity from this perturbed state he was roused by thoughts of his mother and fancying he heard her gentle voice urging him on to fresh exertion he started up on one side of the chapel there was a large grated window but as it looked upon the interior of the jail jack preferred following the course he had originally decided upon to making any attempt in this quarter accordingly he proceeded to a gate which stood upon the south and guarded the passage communicating with the leads it was grated and crested with spikes like that he had just burst open and thinking it a needless waste of time to force it he broke off one of the spikes which he carried with him for further purposes and then climbed over it a short flight of steps brought him to a dark passage into which he plunged here he found another strong door making the fifth he had encountered well aware that the doors in this passage were much stronger than those in the entry he had just quitted he was neither surprised nor dismayed to find it fastened by a lock of unusual size after repeatedly trying to remove the plate which was so firmly screwed down that it resisted all his efforts and vainly attempting to pick it with the spike and nail he at length after half an hours ineffectual labour wrenched off the box by means of the iron bar and the door as he laughingly expressed it became his humble servant but this difficulty was only overcome to be succeeded by one still greater hastening along the passage he came to the sixth door for this he was prepared but he was not prepared for the almost insurmountable obstacles which it presented running his hand hastily over it he was startled to find it one complicated mass of bolts and bars it seemed as if all the precautions previously taken were here accumulated any one less courageous than himself would have abandoned the attempt from a conviction of its utter hopelessness but though it might for a moment damp his ardour it could not deter him once again he passed his hand over the surface and carefully noted all the obstacles there was a lock apparently more than a foot wide strongly plated and girded to the door with thick iron hoops below it a prodigiously large bolt was shot into the socket and in order to keep it there was fastened by a hasp and further protected by an immense padlock besides this the door was crossed and recrossed by iron bars clenched by broadheaded nails an iron fillet secured the socket of the bolt and the box of the lock to the main post of the doorway nothing disheartened by this survey jack set to work upon the lock which he attacked with all his implementsnow attempting to pick it with the nailnow to wrench it off with the bar but all without effect he not only failed in making any impression but seemed to increase the difficulties for after an hours toil he had broken the nail and slightly bent the iron bar completely overcome by fatigue with strained muscles and bruised hands streaming with perspiration and with lips so parched that he would gladly have parted with a treasure if he had possessed it for a draught of water he sank against the wall and while in this state was seized with a sudden and strange alarm he fancied that the turnkeys had discovered his flight and were in pursuit of himthat they had climbed up the chimneyentered the red roomtracked him from door to door and were now only detained by the gate which he had left unbroken in the chapel he even thought he could detect the voice of jonathan urging and directing them so strongly was he impressed with this idea that grasping the iron bar with both hands he dashed it furiously against the door making the passage echo with the blows by degrees his fears vanished and hearing nothing he grew calmer his spirits revived and encouraging himself with the idea that the present impediment though the greatest was the last he set himself seriously to consider how it might best be overcome on reflection it occurred to him that he might perhaps be able to loosen the iron fillet a notion no sooner conceived than executed with incredible labour and by the aid of both spike and nail he succeeded in getting the point of the bar beneath the fillet exerting all his energies and using the bar as a lever he forced off the iron band which was full seven feet high seven inches wide and two thick and which brought with it in its fall the box of the lock and the socket of the bolt leaving no further hinderance overjoyed beyond measure at having vanquished this apparentlyinsurmountable obstacle jack darted through the door chapter xx the leads ascending a short flight of steps jack found at the summit a door which being bolted in the inside he speedily opened the fresh air which blew in his face greatly revived him he had now reached what was called the lower leadsa flat covering a part of the prison contiguous to the gateway and surrounded on all sides by walls about fourteen feet high on the north stood the battlements of one of the towers of the gate on this side a flight of wooden steps protected by a handrail led to a door opening upon the summit of the prison this door was crested with spikes and guarded on the right by a bristling semicircle of spikes hastily ascending these steps jack found the door as he anticipated locked he could have easily forced it but preferred a more expeditious mode of reaching the roof which suggested itself to him mounting the door he had last opened he placed his hands on the wall above and quickly drew himself up just as he got on the roof of the prison st sepulchres clock struck eight it was instantly answered by the deep note of st pauls and the concert was prolonged by other neighbouring churches jack had thus been six hours in accomplishing his arduous task though nearly dark there was still light enough left to enable him to discern surrounding objects through the gloom he distinctly perceived the dome of st pauls hanging like a black cloud in the air and nearer to him he remarked the golden ball on the summit of the college of physicians compared by garth to a gilded pill other towers and spiresst martins on ludgatehill and christchurch in newgate street were also distinguishable as he gazed down into the courts of the prison he could not help shuddering lest a false step might precipitate him below to prevent the recurrence of any such escape as that just described it was deemed expedient in more recent times to keep a watchman at the top of newgate not many years ago two men employed on this duty quarrelled during the night and in the morning their bodies were found stretched upon the pavement of the yard beneath proceeding along the wall jack reached the southern tower over the battlements of which he clambered and crossing it dropped upon the roof of the gate he then scaled the northern tower and made his way to the summit of that part of the prison which fronted giltspur street arrived at the extremity of the building he found that it overlooked the flatroof of a house which as far as he could judge in the darkness lay at a depth of about twenty feet below not choosing to hazard so great a fall jack turned to examine the building to see whether any more favourable point of descent presented itself but could discover nothing but steep walls without a single available projection as he looked around he beheld an incessant stream of passengers hurrying on below lights glimmered in the windows of the different houses and a lamplighter was running from post to post on his way to snow hill finding it impossible to descend on any side without incurring serious risk jack resolved to return for his blanket by the help of which he felt certain of accomplishing a safe landing on the roof of the house in giltspur street accordingly he began to retrace his steps and pursuing the course he had recently taken scaling the two towers and passing along the wall of the prison he descended by means of the door upon the lower leads before he reentered the prison he hesitated from a doubt whether he was not fearfully increasing his risk of capture but convinced that he had no other alternative he went on during all this time he had never quitted the iron bar and he now grasped it with the firm determination of selling his life dearly if he met with any opposition a few seconds sufficed to clear the passage through which it had previously cost him more than two hours to force his way the floor was strewn with screws nails fragments of wood and stone and across the passage lay the heavy iron fillet he did not disturb any of this litter but left it as a mark of his prowess he was now at the entrance of the chapel and striking the door over which he had previously climbed a violent blow with the bar it flew open to vault over the pews was the work of a moment and having gained the entry leading to the red room he passed through the first door his progress being only impeded by the pile of broken stones which he himself had raised listening at one of the doors leading to the master debtors side he heard a loud voice chanting a bacchanalian melody and the boisterous laughter that accompanied the song convinced him that no suspicion was entertained in this quarter entering the red room he crept through the hole in the wall descended the chimney and arrived once more in his old place of captivity how different were his present feelings compared with those he had experienced on quitting it then though full of confidence he half doubted his power of accomplishing his designs now he had achieved them and felt assured of success the vast heap of rubbish on the floor had been so materially increased by the bricks and plaster thrown down in his attack upon the wall of the red room that it was with some difficulty he could find the blanket which was almost buried beneath the pile he next searched for his stockings and shoes and when found put them on while he was thus employed his nerves underwent a severe shock a few bricks dislodged probably by his last descent came clattering down the chimney and as it was perfectly dark gave him the notion that some one was endeavouring to force an entrance into the room but these fears like those he had recently experienced speedily vanished and he prepared to return to the roof congratulating himself that owing to the opportune falling of the bricks he had in all probability escaped serious injury throwing the blanket over his left arm and shouldering the iron bar he again clambered up the chimney regained the red room hurried along the first passage crossed the chapel threaded the entry to the lower leads and in less than ten minutes after quitting the castle had reached the northern extremity of the prison previously to his descent he had left the nail and spike on the wall and with these he fastened the blanket to the stone coping this done he let himself carefully down by it and having only a few feet to drop alighted in safety having now fairly got out of newgate for the second time with a heart throbbing with exultation he hastened to make good his escape to his great joy he found a small garretdoor in the roof of the opposite house open he entered it crossed the room in which there was only a small trucklebed over which he stumbled opened another door and gained the stairhead as he was about to descend his chains slightly rattled oh lud whats that exclaimed a female voice from an adjoining room only the dog replied the rough tones of a man securing the chain in the best way he could jack then hurried down two pair of stairs and had nearly reached the lobby when a door suddenly opened and two persons appeared one of whom held a light retreating as quickly as he could jack opened the first door he came to entered a room and searching in the dark for some place of concealment fortunately discovered a skreen behind which he crept chapter xxi what befell jack sheppard in the turners house jack was scarcely concealed when the door opened and the two persons of whom he had caught a glimpse below entered the room what was his astonishment to recognise in the few words they uttered the voices of kneebone and winifred the latter was apparently in great distress and the former seemed to be using his best efforts to relieve her anxiety how very fortunate it is he observed that i happened to call upon mr bird the turner to give him an order this evening it was quite an unexpected pleasure to meet you and your worthy father pray cease these compliments returned winifred and if you have any communication to make do not delay it you told me just now that you wished to speak a few words to me in private concerning thames darrell and for that purpose i have left my father below with mr bird and have come hither what have you got to say too much replied kneebone shaking his head sadly too much do not needlessly alarm me i beseech you replied winifred whatever your intelligence may be i will strive to bear it but do not awaken my apprehension unless you have good cause for so doingwhat do you know of thameswhere is he dont agitate yourself dearest girl rejoined the woollendraper or i shall never be able to commence my relation i am calmperfectly calm replied winifred pray make no further mystery but tell me all without reserve since you require it i must obey replied kneebone but prepare yourself for a terrible shock for mercys sake go on cried winifred at all hazards then then you shall know the truth replied the woollendraper in a tone of affected solicitudebut are you really prepared quitequite replied winifred this suspense is worse than torture i am almost afraid to utter it said kneebone but thames darrell is murdered murdered ejaculated winifred basely and inhumanly murdered by jack sheppard and blueskin continued kneebone oh nonono cried winifred i cannot believe it you must be misinformed mr kneebone jack may be capable of much that is wicked but he would never lift his hand against his friendof that i am assured generous girl cried jack from behind the skreen i have proofs to the contrary replied kneebone the murder was committed after the robbery of my house by sheppard and his accomplices i did not choose to mention my knowledge of this fact to your worthy father but you may rely on its correctness you were right not to mention it to him rejoined winifred for he is in such a state of distress at the mysterious disappearance of mrs sheppard that i fear any further anxiety might prove fatal to him and yet i know notfor the object of his visit here tonight was to serve jack who if your statement is correct which i cannot however for a moment believe does not deserve his assistance you may rest assured he does not rejoined kneebone emphatically but i am at a loss to understand in what way your father proposes to assist him mr bird the turner who is an old friend of ours has some acquaintance with the turnkeys of newgate replied winifred and by his means my father hoped to convey some implements to jack by which he might effect another escape i see remarked kneebone this must be prevented he added to himself heaven grant you may have been wrongly informed with respect to thames exclaimed winifred but i beseech you on no account to mention what you have told me to my poor father he is not in a state of mind to bear it rely on me rejoined kneebone one word before we part adorable girlonly one he continued detaining her i would not venture to renew my suit while thames lived because i well knew your affections were fixed upon him but now that this bar is removed i trust i may without impropriety urge it no more of this said winifred angrily is this a season to speak on such a subject perhaps not rejoined the woollendraper but the uncontrollable violence of my passion must plead my excuse my whole life shall be devoted to you beloved girl and when you reflect how much at heart your poor mother whose loss we must ever deplore had our union you will i am persuaded no longer refuse me sir exclaimed winifred you will make me the happiest of mankind cried the woollendraper falling on his knees and seizing her hand which he devoured with kisses let me go cried winifred i disbelieve the whole story you have told me by heaven cried kneebone with increasing fervour it is trueas true as my affection for you i do not doubt it retorted winifred scornfully because i attach credit neither to one nor the other if thames is murdered you are his assassin let me go sir the woollendraper made no answer but hastily starting up bolted the door what do you mean cried winifred in alarm nothing more than to obtain a favourable answer to my suit replied kneebone this is not the way to obtain it said winifred endeavouring to reach the door you shall not go adorable girl cried kneebone catching her in his arms till you have answered me you mustyou shall be mine never replied winifred release me instantly or i will call my father do so replied kneebone but remember the door is locked monster cried winifred help help you call in vain returned kneebone not so replied jack throwing down the skreen release her instantly villain both winifred and her suitor started at this sudden apparition jack whose clothes were covered with dust and whose face was deathly pale from his recent exertion looked more like a phantom than a living person in the devils name is that you jack ejaculated kneebone it is replied sheppard you have uttered a wilful and deliberate falsehood in asserting that i have murdered thames for whom you well know i would lay down my life retract your words instantly or take the consequences what should i retract villain cried the woollendraper who at the sound of jacks voice had regained his confidence to the best of my belief thames darrell has been murdered by you a lie exclaimed jack in a terrible tone and before kneebone could draw his sword he felled him to the ground with the iron bar you have killed him cried winifred in alarm no answered jack approaching her though if i had done so he would have merited his fate you do not believe his statement i do not replied winifred i could not believe you capable of so foul a deed but oh by what wonderful chance have you come hither so seasonably i have just escaped from newgate replied jack and am more than repaid for the severe toil i have undergone in being able to save you but tell me he added with much anxiety has nothing been heard of thames since the night of my former escape nothing whatever answered winifred he left dollis hill at ten oclock on that night and has not since returned my father has made every possible inquiry and offered large rewards but has not been able to discover the slightest trace of him his suspicions at first fell upon you but he has since acquitted you of any share in it oh heaven exclaimed jack he has been indefatigable in his search continued winifred and has even journeyed to manchester but though he visited sir rowland trenchards seat ashton hall he could gain no tidings of him or of his uncle sir rowland who it seems has left the country never to return remarked jack gloomily before tomorrow morning i will ascertain what has become of thames or perish in the attempt and now tell me what has happened to my poor mother ever since your last capture and thamess mysterious disappearance she has been dreadfully ill replied winifred so ill that each day was expected to be her last she has also been afflicted with occasional returns of her terrible malady on tuesday night she was rather better and i had left her for a short time as i thought asleep on the sofa in the little parlour of which she is so fond well exclaimed jack on my return i found the window open and the room vacant she was gone did you discover any trace of footsteps inquired jack eagerly there were some marks near the window but whether recently made or not could not be ascertained replied winifred oh god exclaimed jack in a tone of the bitterest anguish my worst fears are realized she is in wilds power i ought to add continued winifred that one of her shoes was picked up in the garden and that prints of her feet were discovered along the soft mould whether made in flying from any one or from rushing forth in distracted terror it is impossible to say my father thought the latter he has had the whole country searched but hitherto without success i know where she will be found and how rejoined jack with a shudder i have something further to tell you pursued winifred shortly after your last visit to dollis hill my father was one evening waylaid by a man who informed him that he had something to communicate respecting thames and had a large sum of money and some important documents to deliver to him which would be given up provided he would undertake to procure your liberation it was blueskin observed jack so my father thought replied winifred and he therefore instantly fired upon him but though the shot took effect as was evident from the stains on the ground the villain escaped your father did right replied jack with some bitterness but if he had not fired that shot he might have saved thames and possessed himself of papers which would have established his birth and his right to the estates of the trenchard family would you have had him spare my mothers murderer cried winifred ho no replied jack and yetbut it is only part of the chain of illluck that seems wound around me listen to me winifred and he hastily related the occurrences in jonathan wilds house the account of the discovery of sir rowlands murder filled winifred with alarm but when she learnt what had befallen thameshow he had been stricken down by the thieftakers bludgeon and left for dead she uttered a piercing scream fainted and would have fallen if jack had not caught her in his arms jack had wellnigh fallen too the idea that he held in his arms the girl whom he had once so passionately loved and for whom he still retained an ardent but hopeless attachment almost overcame him gazing at her with eyes blinded with tears he imprinted one brotherly kiss upon her lips it was the firstand the last at this juncture the handle of the door was tried and the voice of mr wood was heard without angrily demanding admittance whats the matter he cried i thought i heard a scream why is the door fastened open it directly are you alone asked jack mimicking the voice of kneebone what for demanded wood open the door i say or ill burst it open carefully depositing winifred on a sofa jack then extinguished the light and as he unfastened the door crept behind it in rushed mr wood with a candle in his hand which jack instantly blew out and darted down stairs he upset some oneprobably mr birdwho was rushing up stairs alarmed by mr woods cries but regardless of this he darted along a passage gained the shop and passed through an open door into the street and thus he was once more free having effected one of the most wonderful escapes ever planned or accomplished chapter xxii fast and loose about seven oclock on the same night jonathan wilds two janizaries who had been for some time in attendance in the hall of his dwelling at the old bailey were summoned to the audiencechamber a long and secret conference then took place between the thieftaker and his myrmidons after which they were severally dismissed left alone jonathan lighted a lamp and opening the trapdoor descended the secret stairs taking the opposite course from that which he had hitherto pursued when it has been necessary to attend him in his visits to the lower part of his premises he struck into a narrow passage on the right which he tracked till he came to a small door like the approach to a vault unlocking it he entered the chamber which by no means belied its external appearance on a pallet in one corner lay a pale emaciated female holding the lamp over her rigid but beautiful features jonathan with some anxiety placed his hand upon her breast to ascertain whether the heart still beat satisfied with his scrutiny he produced a pocketflask and taking off the silver cup with which it was mounted filled it with the contents of the flask and then seizing the thin arm of the sleeper rudely shook it opening her large black eyes she fixed them upon him for a moment with a mixture of terror and loathing and then averted her gaze drink this cried jonathan handing her the cup youll feel better after it mechanically raising the potion to her lips the poor creature swallowed it without hesitation is it poison she asked no replied jonathan with a brutal laugh im not going to get rid of you just yet its gina liquor you used to like youll find the benefit of it by and by youve a good deal to go through tonight ah exclaimed mrs sheppard are you come to renew your terrible proposals im come to execute my threats replied wild tonight you shall be my wedded wife i will die first replied mrs sheppard you may die afterwards as soon as you please retorted jonathan but live till then you shall ive sent for the priest mercy cried mrs sheppard vainly trying to discover a gleam of compassion in the thieftakers inexorable countenancemercy mercy pshaw rejoined jonathan you should be glad to be made an honest woman oh let me die groaned the widow i have not many daysperhaps not many hours to live but kill me rather than commit this outrage that wouldnt answer my purpose replied jonathan savagely i didnt carry you off from old wood to kill you but to wed you what motive can you have for so vile a deed asked mrs sheppard you know my motive well enough answered jonathan however ill refresh your memory i once might have married you for your beautynow i marry you for your wealth my wealth replied mrs sheppard i have nothing you are heiress to the trenchard property rejoined jonathan one of the largest estates in lancashire not while thames darrell and sir rowland live sir rowland is dead replied jonathan gloomily thames darrell only waits my mandate to follow him before our marriage there will be no life between you and the estates ah exclaimed mrs sheppard look here cried jonathan stooping down and taking hold of a ring in the floor with which by a great effort he raised up a flag in this pit he added pointing to the chasm below your brother is buried here your nephew will speedily be thrown horrible cried mrs sheppard shuddering violently but your dreadful projects will recoil on your own head heaven will not permit the continuance of such wickedness as you practise ill take my chance replied jonathan with a sinister smile my schemes have succeeded tolerably well hitherto a day of retribution will assuredly arrive rejoined mrs sheppard till then i shall remain content returned wild and now mrs sheppard attend to what im about to say to you years ago when you were a girl and in the bloom of your beauty i loved you loved me you i loved you continued jonathan and struck by your appearance which seemed above your station inquired your history and found you had been stolen by a gipsy in lancashire i proceeded to manchester to investigate the matter further and when there ascertained beyond a doubt that you were the eldest daughter of sir montacute trenchard this discovery made i hastened back to london to offer you my hand but found you had married in the mean time a smockfaced smoothtongued carpenter named sheppard the important secret remained locked in my breast but i resolved to be avenged i swore i would bring your husband to the gallowswould plunge you in such want such distress that you should have no alternative but the last frightful resource of miseryand i also swore that if you had a son he should share the same fate as his father and terribly you have kept your vow replied mrs sheppard i have replied jonathan but i am now coming to the point which most concerns you consent to become my wife and do not compel me to have recourse to violence to effect my purpose and i will spare your son mrs sheppard looked fixedly at him as if she would penetrate the gloomy depth of his soul swear that you will do this she cried i swear it rejoined jonathan readily but what is an oath to you cried the widow distrustfully you will not hesitate to break it if it suits your purpose i have suffered too much from your treachery i will not trust you as you please replied jonathan sternly recollect you are in my power jacks life hangs on your determination what shall i do cried mrs sheppard in a voice of agony save him replied jonathan you can do so bring him herelet me see himlet me embrace himlet me be assured that he is safe and i am yours i swear it hum exclaimed jonathan you hesitateyou are deceiving me by my soul no replied jonathan with affected sincerity you shall see him tomorrow delay the marriage till then i will never consent till i see him yon ask impossibilities replied jonathan sullenly all is prepared the marriage cannotshall not be delayed yon must be mine tonight force shall not make me yours till jack is free replied the widow resolutely an hour hence i shall return with the priest replied jonathan striding towards the door and with a glance of malignant exultation he quitted the vault and locked the door an hour hence i shall be beyond your malice said mrs sheppard sinking backwards upon the pallet chapter xxiii the last meeting between jack sheppard and his mother after escaping from the turners house jack sheppard skirted st sepulchres church and hurrying down snow hill darted into the first turning on the left traversing angel court and green arbour courtcelebrated as one of goldsmiths retreatshe speedily reached seacoal lane and pursuing the same course which he and thames had formerly taken arrived at the yard at the back of jonathans habitation a door it may be remembered opened from wilds dwelling into this yard before he forced an entrance jack tried it and to his great surprise and delight found it unfastened entering the house he found himself in a narrow passage leading to the back stairs he had not taken many steps when he perceived quilt arnold in the upper gallery with a lamp in his hand hearing a noise below quilt called out supposing it occasioned by the jew jack hastily retreated and taking the first means of concealment that occurred to him descended the cellar steps quilt meanwhile came down examined the door and finding it unfastened locked it with a bitter imprecation on his brotherjanizarys carelessness this done he followed the course which jack had just taken as he crossed the cellar he passed so near to jack who had concealed himself behind a piece of furniture that he almost touched him it was jacks intention to have knocked him down with the iron bar but he was so struck with the janizarys looks that he determined to spare him till he had ascertained his purpose with this view he suffered him to pass on quilts manner indeed was that of a man endeavouring to muster up sufficient resolution for the commission of some desperate crime he haltedlooked fearfully aroundstopped again and exclaimed aloud i dont like the job and yet it must be done or mr wild will hang me with this he appeared to pluck up his courage and stepped forward more boldly some dreadful deed is about to be committed which i may perhaps prevent muttered jack to himself heaven grant i may not be too late followed by jack sheppard who kept sufficiently near him to watch his proceedings and yet not expose himself quilt unlocked one or two doors which he left open and after winding his way along a gloomy passage arrived at the door of a vault here he set down the lamp and took out a key and as he did so the expression of his countenance was so atrocious that jack felt assured he was not wrong in his suspicions by this time the door was unlocked and drawing his sword quilt entered the cell the next moment an exclamation was heard in the voice of thames darting forward at this sound jack threw open the door and beheld quilt kneeling over thames whose hands and feet were bound with cords and about to plunge his sword into his breast a blow from the iron bar instantly stretched the ruffian on the floor jack then proceeded to liberate the captive from his bondage jack exclaimed thames is it you it is replied sheppard as he untied the cords i might return the question were it not for your voice i dont think i should know you you are greatly altered captivity had indeed produced a striking alteration in thames he looked like the shadow of himselfthin feeble holloweyedhis beard unshornnothing could be more miserable i have never been out of this horrible dungeon since we last met he said though how long ago that is i scarcely know night and day have been alike to me six weeks have elapsed since that fatal night replied jack during the whole of that time i have been a close prisoner in newgate whence i have only just escaped six weeks exclaimed thames in a melancholy tone it seems like six long months to me i do not doubt it returned jack none but those who have experienced it can understand the miseries of imprisonment do not speak of it rejoined thames with a look of horror let us fly from this frightful place i will conduct you to the outlet replied jack but i cannot leave it till i have ascertained whether my mother also is a prisoner here i can answer that replied thames she is the monster wild when he visited my dungeon last night told me to add to my misery that she occupied a cell near me arm yourself with that ruffians weapons replied jack and let us search for her thames complied but he was so feeble that it seemed scarcely possible he could offer any effectual resistance in case of an attack lean on me said jack taking the light they then proceeded along the passage there was no other door in it and jack therefore struck into another entry which branched off to the right they had not proceeded far when a low moan was heard she is here cried jack darting forward a few steps brought him to the door of the vault in which his mother was immured it was locked jack had brought away the bunch of keys which he had taken from quilt arnold but none of them would open it he was therefore obliged to use the iron bar which he did with as much caution as circumstances would permit at the first blow mrs sheppard uttered a piercing scream wretch she cried you shall not force me to your hateful purpose i will never wed you i have a weapona knifeand if you attempt to open the door will plunge it to my heart oh god exclaimed jack paralysed by her cries what shall i do if i persist i shall destroy her get hence continued mrs sheppard with a frenzied laugh you shall never behold me alive mother cried jack in a broken voice it is your son it is false cried mrs sheppard think not to deceive me monster i know my sons voice too well he is in newgate hence mother dear mother cried jack in a voice the tones of which were altered by his very anxiety to make them distinct listen to me i have broken from prison and am come to save you it is not jacks voice rejoined mrs sheppard i am not to be deceived the knife is at my breast stir a foot and i strike oh heavens cried jack driven to his wits end motherdear mother once again i beseech you to listen to me i am come to rescue you from wilds violence i must break open the door hold your hand for a moment you have heard my fixed determination villain cried mrs sheppard i know my life is valuable to you or you would not spare it but i will disappoint you get you gone your purposes are defeated footsteps are approaching cried thames heed her not it is but a wild threat i know not how to act exclaimed jack almost driven to desperation i hear you plotting with your wicked associates cried mrs sheppard i have baffled you force the door said thames or you will be too late better she die by her own hand than by that monsters cried jack brandishing the bar mother i come to you with this he struck the door a heavy blow he listened there was a deep groan and the sound of a fall within i have killed her exclaimed jack dropping the barby your advice thames oh god pardon me do not delay cried thames she may yet be saved i am too weak to aid you jack again seized the bar and dashing it furiously against the door speedily burst it open the unfortunate woman was stretched upon the floor with a bloody knife in her hand mother cried jack springing towards her jack she cried raising her head is it you it is replied her son oh why would you not listen to me i was distracted replied mrs sheppard faintly i have killed you cried jack endeavouring to staunch the effusion of blood from her breast forgiveforgive me i have nothing to forgive replied mrs sheppard i alone am to blame can i not carry you where you can obtain help cried jack in a agony of distress it is useless replied mrs sheppard nothing can save me i die happyquite happy in beholding you do not remain with me you may fall into the hands of your enemy fly fly do not think of me mother but of yourself cried jack in an agony of tears you have always been far dearer to me than myself replied mrs sheppard but i have one last request to make let me lie in willesden churchyard you shallyou shall answered jack we shall meet again ere long my son cried mrs sheppard fixing her glazing eyes upon him oh god she is dying exclaimed jack in a voice suffocated by emotion forgive meoh forgive me forgive youbless you she gasped a cold shiver ran through her frame and her gentle spirit passed away for ever oh god that i might die too cried jack falling on his knees beside her after the first violent outbreak of grief had in some degree subsided thames addressed him you must not remain here he said you can render no further service to your poor mother i can avenge her cried jack in a terrible tone be ruled by me returned thames you will act most in accordance with her wishes could she dictate them by compliance do not waste time in vain regrets but let us remove the body that we may fulfil her last injunctions after some further arguments jack assented to this proposal go on first with the light he said i will bear the body and he raised it in his arms just as they reached the end of the passage they heard the voices of jonathan and the jew in thamess late place of confinement wild had evidently discovered the body of quilt arnold and was loudly expressing his anger and astonishment extinguish the light cried jack turn to the left quick quick the order was only just given in time they had scarcely gained the adjoining cellar when jonathan and the jew rushed past in the direction of the vault not a moment is to be lost cried jack follow me so saying he hurried up stairs opened the back door and was quickly in the yard having ascertained that thames was at his heels he hurried with his ghastly burthen down seacoal lane where are you going cried thames who though wholly disencumbered was scarcely able to keep up with him i know notand care not replied jack at this moment a coach passed them and was instantly hailed by thames you had better let me convey her to dollis hill he said be it so replied jack luckily it was so dark and there was no lamp near that the man did not notice the condition of the body which was placed in the vehicle by the two young men what will you do asked thames leave me to my fate rejoined jack take care of your charge doubt me not replied thames bury her in willesden churchyard as she requested on sunday said jack i will be there at the time so saying he closed the door the coachman having received his order and being offered an extra fare if he drove quickly set off at full speed as jack departed a dark figure emerging from behind a wall rushed after him chapter xxiv the pursuit after running to some distance down seacoal lane jack stopped to give a last look at the vehicle which was bearing away the remains of his beloved and illfated mother it was scarcely out of sight when two persons whom he instantly recognised as jonathan and abraham mendez turned the corner of the street and made it evident from their shouts that they likewise perceived him starting off at a rapid pace jack dashed down turnagainlane skirted the eastern bank of fleetditch crossed holborn bridge and began to ascend the neighbouring hill by the time he had reached st andrews church his pursuers had gained the bridge and the attention of such passengers as crowded the streets was attracted towards him by their vociferations amongst others the watchman whose box was placed against the churchyard wall near the entrance to shoelane rushed out and sprung his rattle which was immediately answered by another rattle from holbornbars darting down fieldlane jack struck into a labyrinth of streets on the left but though he ran as swiftly as he could he was not unperceived his course had been observed by the watchman who directed wild which way to take it is jack sheppard the noted housebreaker cried jonathan at the top of his sonorous voice he has just broken out of newgate after him a hundred pounds to the man who takes him sheppards name operated like magic on the crowd the cry was echoed by twenty different voices people ran out of their shops to join the pursuit and by the time wild had got into fieldlane he had a troop of fifty persons at his heelsall eager to assist in the capture stop thief roared jonathan who perceived the fugitive hurrying along a street towards hatton garden it is sheppardjack sheppardstop him and his shouts were reiterated by the pack of bloodhounds at his heels jack meanwhile heard the shouts and though alarmed by them held on a steady course by various twistings and turnings during all which time his pursuers who were greatly increased in numbers kept him in view he reached graysinnlane here he was hotly pursued fatigued by his previous exertions and incumbered by his fetters he was by no meansthough ordinarily remarkably swift of foota match for his foes who were fast gaining upon him at the corner of liquorpond street stood the old hampstead coachoffice and on the night in question a knot of hostlers waggoners drivers and stableboys was collected in the yard hearing the distant shouts these fellows rushed down to the entrance of the court and arrived there just as jack passed it stop thief roared jonathan stop thief clamoured the rabble behind at no loss to comprehend that jack was the individual pointed out by these outcries two of the nearest of the group made a dash at him but jack eluded their grasp a large dog was then set at him by a stableboy but striking the animal with his faithful ironbar he speedily sent him yelping back the two hostlers however kept close at his heels and jack whose strength began to flag feared he could not hold much longer determined however not be taken with life he held on still keeping ahead of his pursuers he ran along the direct road till the houses disappeared and he got into the open country here he was preparing to leap over the hedge into the fields on the left when he was intercepted by two horsemen who hearing the shouts rode up and struck at him with the buttends of their heavy ridingwhips warding off the blows as well as he could with the bar jack struck both the horses on the head and the animals plunged so violently that they not only prevented their riders from assailing him but also kept off the hostlers and in the confusion that ensued jack managed to spring over the fence and shaped his course across the field in the direction of sir john oldcastles the stoppage had materially lessened the distance between him and his pursuers who now amounted to more than a hundred persons many of whom carried lanterns and links ascertaining that it was sheppard of whom this concourse was in pursuit the two horsemen leapt the hedge and were presently close upon him like a hare closely pressed jack attempted to double but the device only brought him nearer his foes who were crossing the field in every direction and rending the air with their shouts the uproar was tremendousmen yellingdogs barkingbut above all was heard the stentorian voice of jonathan urging them on jack was so harrassed that he felt half inclined to stand at bay while he was straining every sinew his foot slipped and he fell head foremost into a deep trench which he had not observed in the dark this fall saved him for the horsemen passed over him creeping along quickly on his hands and knees he found the entrance to a covered drain into which he crept he was scarcely concealed when he heard the horsemen who perceived they had overshot their mark ride back by this time jonathan and the vast mob attending him had come up and the place was rendered almost as light as day by the links he must be somewhere hereabouts cried one of the horsemen dismounting we were close upon him when he suddenly disappeared jonathan made no answer but snatching a torch from a bystander jumped into the trench and commenced a diligent search just as he had arrived at the mouth of the drain and jack felt certain he must be discovered a loud shout was raised from the further end of the field that the fugitive was caught all the assemblage accompanied by jonathan set off in this direction when it turned out that the supposed housebreaker was a harmless beggar who had been found asleep under a hedge jonathans vexation at the disappointment was expressed in the bitterest imprecations and he returned as speedily as he could to the trench but he had now lost the precise spot and thinking he had examined the drain turned his attention to another quarter meanwhile the excitement of the chase had in some degree subsided the crowd dispersed in different directions and most fortunately a heavy shower coming on put them altogether to flight jonathan however still lingered he seemed wholly insensible to the rain though it presently descended in torrents and continued his search as ardently as before after occupying himself thus for the best part of an hour he thought jack must have given him the slip still his suspicions were so strong that he ordered mendez to remain on guard near the spot all night and by the promise of a large reward induced two other men to keep him company as he took his departure he whispered to the jew take him dead or alive but if we fail now and you heard him aright in seacoal lane we are sure of him at his mothers funeral on sunday chapter xxv how jack sheppard got rid of his irons about an hour after this jack ventured to emerge from his place of concealment it was still raining heavily and profoundly dark drenched to the skinin fact he had been lying in a bed of muddy waterand chilled to the very bone he felt so stiff that he could scarcely move listening attentively he fancied he heard the breathing of some one near him and moved cautiously in the opposite direction in spite of his care he came in contact with a man who endeavouring to grasp him cried in the voice of mendez who goes dere shpeak or i fire no answer being returned the jew instantly discharged his pistol and though the shot did no damage the flash discovered sheppard but as the next moment all was profound darkness jack easily managed to break away from them without an idea where he was going jack pursued his way through the fields and as he proceeded the numbness of his limbs in some degree wore off and his confidence returned he had need of all the inexhaustible energy of his character to support him through his toilsome walk over the wet grass or along the slippery ploughed land at last he got into a lane but had not proceeded far when he was again alarmed by the sound of a horses tread once more breaking through the hedge he took to the fields he was now almost driven to despair wet as he was he felt if he lay down in the grass he should perish with cold while if he sought a nights lodging in any asylum his dress stained with blood and covered with dirt would infallibly cause him to be secured and delivered into the hands of justice and then the fetters which were still upon his legshow was he to get rid of them tired and dispirited he still wandered on again returning to the main road he passed through clapton and turning off on the left arrived at the foot of stamford hill he walked on for an hour longer till he could scarcely drag one leg after another at length he fell down on the road fully expecting each moment would prove his last how long he continued thus he scarcely knew but just before dawn he managed to regain his legs and crawling up a bank perceived he was within a quarter of a mile of tottenham a short way off in the fields he descried a sort of shed or cowhouse and thither he contrived to drag his weary limbs opening the door he found it littered with straw on which he threw himself and instantly fell asleep when he awoke it was late in the day and raining heavily for some time he could not stir but felt sick and exhausted his legs were dreadfully swelled his hands bruised and his fetters occasioned him intolerable pain his bodily suffering however was nothing compared with his mental anguish all the events of the previous day rushed to his recollection and though he had been unintentionally the cause of his mothers death he reproached himself as severely as if he had been her actual murderer had i not been the guilty wretch i am he cried bursting into an agony of tears she would never have died thus this strong feeling of remorse having found a natural vent in some degree subsided and he addressed himself to his present situation rousing himself he went to the door it had ceased raining but the atmosphere was moist and chill and the ground deluged by the recent showers taking up a couple of large stones which lay near jack tried to beat the round basils of the fetters into an oval form so as to enable him to slip his heels through them while he was thus employed a farming man came into the barn jack instantly started to his feet and the man alarmed at his appearance ran off to a neighbouring house before he could return jack had made good his retreat and wandering about the lanes and hedges kept out of sight as much as possible on examining his pockets he found about twenty guineas in gold and some silver but how to avail himself of it was the question for in his present garb he was sure to be recognised when night fell he crept into the town of tottenham as he passed along the main thoroughfare he heard his own name pronounced and found that it was a hawker crying a penny history of his escapes a crowd was collected round the fellow who was rapidly disposing of his stock heres the full true and particular account of jack sheppards last astonishing and nevertobeforgotten escape from the castle of newgate bawled the hawker with a print of him taken from the life showing the manner how he was shackled and handcuffed only one pennytwo copiestwo pencethank you sir heres the let me have one cried a servant maid running across the street and in her haste forgetting to shut the doorheres the money master and missis have been talking all day long about jack sheppard and im dying to read his life here you have it my dear returned the hawker sold again if you dont get back quickly lucy observed a bystander jack sheppard will be in the house before you this sally occasioned a general laugh if jack would come to my house id contrive to hide him remarked a buxom dame poor fellow im glad he has escaped jack seems to be a great favourite with the fair sex observed a smirking grocers apprentice of course rejoined the bystander who had just spoken and who was of a cynical turnthe greater the rascal the better they like him heres a particular account of jacks many robberies and escapes roared the hawkerhow he broke into the house of his master mr wood at dollis hill let me have one said a carpenter who was passing by at the momentmr wood was an old friend of mineand i recollect seeing jack when he was bound prentice to him a penny if you please sir said the hawkersold again here you have the full true and particular account of the barbarous murder committed by jack sheppard and his associate joseph blake alias blueskin upon the body of mrs wood thats false cried a voice behind him the man turned at the exclamation and so did several of the bystanders but they could not make out who had uttered it jack who had been lingering near the group now walked on in the middle of the little town stood the shop of a jew dealer in old clothes the owner was at the door unhooking a few articles of wearing apparel which he had exposed outside for sale amongst other things he had just brought down an old laced bavaroy a species of surtout much worn at the period what do you want fot that coat friend asked jack as he came up more than youll pay for it friend snuffled the jew how do you know that rejoined jack will you take a guinea for it double that sum might tempt me replied the jew its a noblemans coat upon my shoul heres the money replied jack taking the coat shall i help you on with it sir replied the jew becoming suddenly respectful no replied jack i half suspect this is a highwayman thought the jew hes so ready with his cash ive some other things inside sir which you might wish to buysome pistols jack was about to comply but not liking the mans manner he walked on further on there was a small chandlers shop where jack observed an old woman seated at the counter attended by a little girl seeing provisions in the window jack ventured in and bought a loaf having secured thisfor he was almost famishedhe said that he had lost a hammer and wished to purchase one the old woman told him she had no such article to dispose of but recommended him to a neighbouring blacksmith guided by the glare of the forge which threw a stream of ruddy light across the road jack soon found the place of which he was in search entering the workshop he found the blacksmith occupied in heating the tire of a cart wheel suspending his labour on jacks appearance the man demanded his business making up a similar story to that which he had told the old woman he said he wanted to purchase a hammer and a file the man looked hard at him answer me one question first he said i half suspect youre jack sheppard i am replied jack without hesitation for he felt assured from the mans manner that he might confide in him youre a bold fellow jack rejoined the blacksmith but youve done well to trust me ill take off your ironsfor i guess thats the reason why you want the hammer and fileon one condition what is it that you give em to me readily taking jack into a shed behind the workshop the smith in a short time freed him from his fetters he not only did this but supplied him with an ointment which allayed the swelling of his limbs and crowned all by furnishing him with a jug of excellent ale im afraid jack youll come to the gallows observed the smith buth if you do ill go to tyburn to see you but ill never part with your irons noticing the draggled condition jack was in he then fetched him a bucket of water with which jack cleansed himself as well as he could and thanking the honest smith who would take nothing for his trouble left the shop having made a tolerably good meal upon the loaf overcome by fatigue jack turned into a barn in stoke newington and slept till late in the day when he awakened much refreshed the swelling in his limbs had also subsided it rained heavily all day so he did not stir forth towards night however he ventured out and walked on towards london when he arrived at hoxton he found the walls covered with placards offering a reward for his apprehension and he everywhere appeared to be the general subject of conversation prom a knot of idlers at a publichouse he learnt that jonathan wild had just ridden past and that his setters were scouring the country in every direction entering london he bent his way towards the westend and having some knowledge of a secondhand tailors shop in rupert street proceeded thither and looked out a handsome suit of mourning with a sword cloak and hat and demanded the price the man asked twelve guineas but after a little bargaining he came down to ten taking his new purchase under his arm jack proceeded to a small tavern in the same street where having ordered dinner he went to a bedroom to attire himself he had scarcely completed his toilet when he was startled by a noise at the door and heard his own name pronounced in no friendly accents fortunately the window was not far from the ground so opening it gently he dropped into a backyard and from thence got into the street hurrying down the haymarket he was arrested by a crowd who were collected round a streetsinger jack paused for a moment and found that his own adventures formed the subject of the ballad not daring however to listen to it he ran on chapter xxvi how jack sheppard attended his mothers funeral that night jack walked to paddington and took up his quarters at a small tavern called the wheatsheaf near the green on the next morningsundaythe day on which he expected his mothers funeral to take place he set out along the harrow road it was a clear lovely october morning the air was sharp and bracing and the leaves which had taken their autumnal tints were falling from the trees the road which wound by westbourne green gave him a full view of the hill of hampstead with its church its crest of houses and its villas peeping from out the trees jacks heart was too full to allow him to derive any pleasure from this scene so he strolled on without raising his eyes till he arrived at kensal green here he obtained some breakfast and mounting the hill turned off into the fields on the right crossing them he ascended an eminence which from its singular shape seems to have been the site of a roman encampment and which commands a magnificent prospect leaning upon a gate he looked down into the valley it was the very spot from which his poor mother had gazed after her vain attempt to rescue him at the mint but though he was ignorant of this her image was alone present to him he beheld the grey tower of willesden church embosomed in its grove of trees now clothed in all the glowing livery of autumn there was the cottage she had inhabited for so many yearsin those fields she had rambledat that church she had prayed and he had destroyed all this but for him she might have been alive and happy the recollection was too painful and he burst into an agony of tears aroused by the sound of the church bells he resolved at whatever risk to attend divine service with this view he descended the hill and presently found a footpath leading to the church but he was destined to have every tide of feeling awakenedevery wound opened the path he had selected conducted him to his mothers humble dwelling when she occupied it it was neatness itself the little porch was overrun with creepersthe garden trim and exquisitely kept now it was a wilderness of weeds the glass in the windows was brokenthe roof unthatchedthe walls dilapidated jack turned away with an aching heart it seemed an emblem of the ruin he had caused as he proceeded other painful reminiscences were aroused at every step he seemed to be haunted by the ghost of the past there was the stile on which jonathan had sat and he recollected distinctly the effect of his mocking glancehow it had hardened his heart against his mothers prayer o god he exclaimed i am severely punished he had now gained the high road the villagers were thronging to church bounding the corner of a garden wall he came upon his former place of imprisonment some rustic hand had written upon the door jack sheppards cage and upon the wall was affixed a large placard describing his person and offering a reward for his capture muffling up his face jack turned away but he had not proceeded many steps when he heard a man reading aloud an account of his escapes from a newspaper hastening to the church he entered it by the very door near which his first crime had been committed his mothers scream seemed again to ring in his ears and he was so deeply affected that fearful of exciting attention he was about to quit the sacred edifice when he was stopped by the entrance of thames who looked pale as death with winifred leaning on his arm they were followed by mr wood in the deepest mourning shrinking involuntarily back into the farthest corner of the seat jack buried his face in his hands the service began jack who had not been in a place of worship for many years was powerfully affected accidentally raising his eyes he saw that he was perceived by the family from dollis hill and that he was an object of the deepest interest to them as soon as the service was over thames contrived to approach him and whispered be cautiousthe funeral will take place after evening service jack would not hazard a glance at winifred but quitting the church got into an adjoining meadow and watched the party slowly ascending the road leading to dollis hill at a turn in the road he perceived winifred looking anxiously towards him and when she discovered him she waved her hand returning to the churchyard he walked round it and on the western side near a small yewtree discovered a newmade grave whose grave is this he inquired of a man who was standing near it i cant say answered the fellow but ill inquire from the sexton william morgan here peter he added to a curlyheaded lad who was playing on one of the grassy tombs ask your father to step this way the little urchin set off and presently returned with the sexton its mrs sheppards gravethe mother of the famous housebreaker said morgan in answer to jacks inquiryand its well they let her have christian burial after allfor they say she destroyed herself for her son the crowners quest sat on her yesterdayand if she hadnt been proved out of her mind she would have been buried at four laneends jack could stand no more placing a piece of money in morgans hands he hurried out of the churchyard by my soul said the sexton thats as like jack sheppard as any one i ever seed i my born days hastening to the six bells jack ordered some refreshment and engaged a private room where he remained till the afternoon absorbed in grief meantime a change had taken place in the weather the day had become suddenly overcast the wind blew in fitful gusts and scattered the yellow leaves from the elms and horsechestnuts roused by the bell tolling for evening service jack left the house on reaching the churchyard he perceived the melancholy procession descending the hill just then a carriage drawn by four horses drove furiously up to the six bells but jack was too much absorbed to take any notice of it at this moment the bell began to toll in a peculiar manner announcing the approach of the corpse the gate was opened the coffin brought into the churchyard and jack whose eyes were filled with tears saw mr wood and thames pass him and followed at a foots pace behind them meanwhile the clergyman bareheaded and in his surplice advanced to meet them having read the three first verses of the impressive service appointed for the burial of the dead he returned to the church whither the coffin was carried through the southwestern door and placed in the centre of the aislemr wood and thames taking their places on either side of it and jack at a little distance behind jack had been touched in the morning but he was now completely prostrated in the midst of the holy place which he had formerly profaned lay the body of his unfortunate mother and he could not help looking upon her untimely end as the retributive vengeance of heaven for the crime he had committed his grief was so audible that it attracted the notice of some of the bystanders and thames was obliged to beg him to control it in doing this he chanced to raise his eyes and half fancied he beheld shaded by a pillar at the extremity of the western aisle the horrible countenance of the thieftaker before the congregation separated the clergyman descended from the pulpit and followed by the coffinbearers and mourners and by jack at a respectful distance entered the churchyard the carriage which it has been mentioned drove up to the six bells contained four personsjonathan wild his two janizaries and his porter obadiah lemon as soon as they had got out the vehicle was drawn up at the back of a tree near the cage having watched the funeral at some distance jonathan fancied he could discern the figure of jack but not being quite sure he entered the church he was daring enough to have seized and carried him off before the whole congregation but he preferred waiting satisfied with his scrutiny he returned despatched abraham and obadiah to the northwest corner of the church placed quilt behind a buttress near the porch and sheltered himself behind one of the mighty elms the funeral procession had now approached the grave around which many of the congregation who were deeply interested by the sad ceremonial had gathered a slight rain fell at the time and a few leaves caught by the eddies whirled around jonathan mixed with the group and sure of his prey abided his time the clergyman meanwhile proceeded with the service while the coffin was deposited at the brink of the grave just as the attendants were preparing to lower the corpse into the earth jack fell on his knees beside the coffin uttering the wildest exclamations of grief reproaching himself with the murder of his mother and invoking the vengeance of heaven on his own head a murmur ran through the assemblage by several of whom jack was recognised but such was the violence of his griefsuch the compunction he exhibited that all but one looked on with an eye of compassion that person advanced towards him i have killed her cried jack you have rejoined jonathan laying a forcible grasp on his shoulder you are my prisoner jack started to his feet but before he could defend himself his right arm was grasped by the jew who had silently approached him hellhounds he cried release me at the same moment quilt arnold rushed forward with such haste that stumbling over william morgan he precipitated him into the grave wretch cried jack are you not content with the crimes you have committedbut you must carry your villany to this point look at the poor victim at your feet jonathan made no reply but ordered his myrmidons to drag the prisoner along thames meanwhile had drawn his sword and was about to rush upon jonathan but he was withheld by wood do not shed more blood cried the carpenter groans and hoots were now raised by the crowd and there was an evident disposition to rescue a small brickbat was thrown which struck jonathan in the face you shall not pass cried several of the crowd i knew his poor mother and for her sake ill not see this done cried john dump slip on the handcuffs cried the thieftaker and now lets see wholl dare to oppose me i am jonathan wild i have arrested him in the kings name a deep indignant groan followed let me see the earth thrown over her implored jack and take me where you please no thundered wild allow him that small grace cried wood no i tell you rejoined jonathan shouldering his way out of the crowd my mothermy poor mother exclaimed jack but in spite of his outcries and resistance he was dragged along by jonathan and his janizaries at the eastern gate of the churchyard stood the carriage with the steps lowered the mob pursued the thieftaker and his party all the way and such missiles as could be collected were hurled at them they even threatened to cut the traces and take off the wheels from the carriage the jew got in first the prisoner was then thrust in by quilt before jonathan followed he turned to face his assailants back he cried fiercely i am an officer in the execution of my duty and he who opposes me in it shall feel the weight of my hand he then sprung into the coach the door of which was closed by obadiah who mounted the box to newgate cried jonathan putting his head out of the window a deep roar followed this order and several missiles were launched at the vehicle which was driven off at a furious pace and while her son was reconveyed to prison the body of the unfortunate mrs sheppard was committed to the earth chapter xxvii how jack sheppard was brought back to newgate jack sheppards escape from newgate on the night of the th of october was not discovered till the following morning for although the intelligence was brought by several parties to the lodge in the course of the night austin who was the officer in attendance paid no attention to them after pursuing the fugitive as before related jonathan wild returned to his own habitation where he was occupied during the remainder of the night with quilt arnold and obadiah lemon in removing everything which in case of a search might tend to criminate him satisfied in this respect he flung himself into a chair for his iron frame seldom required the indulgence of a bed and sought an hours repose before he began the villanies of another day he was aroused from his slumber about six oclock by the return of abraham mendez who not choosing to confess that jack had eluded his vigilance contended himself with stating that he had kept watch till daybreak when he had carefully searched the field and finding no trace of him had thought it better to return this information was received by jonathan with a lowering brow he comforted himself however with the certainty which he felt of capturing his prey on the sunday his breakfast despatched which he ate with a wolfish appetite he walked over to newgate chuckling as he went at the consternation which his appearance would create amongst the turnkeys entering the lodge the first person he beheld was austin who was only just up and whose toilette appeared scarcely completed a glance satisfied jonathan that the turnkey was not aware of the prisoners escape and he resolved not to destroy what he considered a good jest by a premature disclosure of it you are out betimes this morning mr wild observed austin as he put on his coat and adjusted his minor bob something fresh on hand i suppose im come to inquire after jack sheppard returned jonathan dont alarm yourself about him sir replied austin hes safe enough i assure you i should like to satisfy myself on that score rejoined wild drily so you shall sir replied austin who at this moment recollected with some uneasiness the applications at the lodgedoor during the night i hope you dont imagine anything has gone wrong sir it matters not what i think replied wild come with me to the castle instantly sir replied austin instantly here caliban attend to the door and keep the wicket locked till i return dye hear now sir taking the keys he led the way followed by jonathan who chuckled internally at the shock that awaited the poor fellow the door was opened and austin entered the cell when he absolutely recoiled before the spectacle he beheld and could scarcely have looked more alarmed if the prison had tumbled about his ears petrified and speechless he turned an imploring look at wild who was himself filled with astonishment at the pile of rubbish lying before him sdeath cried jonathan staring at the breach in the wall some one must have assisted him unless he has dealings with the devil he could never have done this alone i firmly believe he has dealings with the devil replied austin trembling from head to foot but perhaps he has not got beyond the room above its as strong if not stronger than this ill see so saying he scrambled over the rubbish and got into the chimney but though the breach was large enough to admit him below he could not squeeze his bulky person through the aperture into the red room i believe hes gone he said returning to jonathan the doors open and the room empty you believeyou know it replied jonathan fixing one of his sternest and most searching glances upon him nothing you can say to the contrary will convince me that you have not been accessory to his flight i siri swear tush interrupted jonathan harshly i shall state my suspicions to the governor come down with me to the lodge directly all further examinations must be conducted in the presence of proper witnesses with these words he strode out of the room darted down the stone stairs and on his arrival at the lodge seized the rope of the great bell communicating with the interior of the prison which he rang violently as this was never done except in some case of great emergency the application was instantly answered by all the other turnkeys by marvel the four partners and mrs spurling nothing could exceed the dismay of these personages when they learnt why they had been summoned all seemed infected with austins terrors except mrs spurling who did not dare to exhibit her satisfaction otherwise than by privately pinching the arm of her expected husband headed by jonathan all the turnkeys then repaired to the upper part of the jail and approaching the red room by a circuitous route several doors were unlocked and they came upon the scene of jacks exploits stopping before each door they took up the plates of the locks examined the ponderous bolts and were struck with the utmost astonishment at what they beheld arriving at the chapel their wonder increased all the jailers declared it utterly impossible he could have accomplished his astonishing task unaided but who had lent him assistance was a question they were unable to answer proceeding to the entry to the lower leads they came to the two strong doors and their surprise was so great at jacks marvellous performance that they could scarcely persuade themselves that human ingenuity could have accomplished it heres a door remarked ireton when he got to that nearest the leads which i could have sworn would have resisted anything i shall have no faith in future in bolts and bars mounting the roof of the prison they traced the fugitives course to the further extremity of the building where they found his blanket attached to the spike proving that he escaped in that direction after severely examining austin and finding it proved on the testimony of his fellowjailers that he could not have aided jack in his flight jonathan retracted his harsh sentence and even went so far as to say that he would act as mediator between him and the governor this was some satisfaction to the poor fellow who was dreadfully frightened as indeed he might well be it being the opinion of the jailers and others who afterwards examined the place that jack had accomplished singlehanded in a few hours and as far as it could be ascertained with imperfect implements what it would have taken half a dozen men several days provided with proper tools to effect in their opinion a hundred pounds would not repair the damage done to the prison as soon as jacks escape became known thousands of persons flocked to newgate to behold his workmanship and the jailers reaped am abundant harvest from their curiosity jonathan meanwhile maintained profound secrecy as to his hopes of capturing the fugitive and when jack was brought back to newgate on the sunday evening his arrival was wholly unexpected at a little after five on that day four horses dashed round the corner of the old bailey and drew up before the door of the lodge hearing the stoppage austin rushed out and could scarcely believe his eyes when he beheld jack sheppard in the custody of quilt arnold and abraham mendez jacks recapture was speedily made known to all the officers of the jail and the lodge was instantly crowded the delight of the turnkeys was beyond all bounds but poor mrs spurling was in a state of distraction and began to abuse jonathan so violently that her future husband was obliged to lay forcible hands upon her and drag her away by wilds command the prisoner was taken to the condemned hold whither he was followed by the whole posse of officers and by the partners two of whom carried large hammers and two the fetters there was only one prisoner in the ward he was chained to the ground but started up at their approach it was blueskin when he beheld jack he uttered a deep groan captain he cried in a voice of the bitterest anguish have these dogs again hunted you down if you hadnt been so unlucky i should have been with you before tomorrow night jack made no answer nor did he even cast his eyes upon his follower but jonathan fixing a terrible look upon him cried ha say you so you must be looked to my lads he continued addressing the partners when youve finished this job give that fellow a fresh set of darbies i suspect he has been at work upon those he has on the link of the chain next the staple is sawn through said ireton stooping to examine blueskins fetters search him and iron him afresh commanded jonathan but first let us secure sheppard well then remove them both to the middle stone hold where a watch shall be kept over them night and day till theyre taken to tyburn as theyre so fond of each others society they shant part company even on that occasion but shall swing from the same tree youll never live to see that day cried blueskin fixing a menacing look upon him what weight are these irons asked jonathan coolly addressing one of the partners more than three hundred weight sir replied the man theyre the heaviest set we haveand were forged expressly for captain sheppard theyre not half heavy enough replied wild let him be handcuffed and doubly ironed on both legs and when we get him into the stone ward he shall not only be chained down to the ground but shall have two additional fetters running through the main links fastened on each side of him well see whether hell get rid of his new bonds he added with a brutal laugh which was echoed by the bystanders mark me said jack sternly i have twice broken out of this prison in spite of all your precautions and were you to load me with thrice the weight of iron you have ordered you should not prevent my escaping a third time thats right captain cried blueskin well give them the slip yet and hang that butcherly thieftaker upon his own gibbet be silent dog cried jonathan and with his clenched hand he struck him a violent blow in the face for the first time perhaps in his life he repented of his brutality the blow was scarcely dealt when with a bound like that of a tiger blueskin sprang upon him the chain which had been partially cut through snapped near the staple before any assistance could be rendered by the jailers who stood astounded blueskin had got wild in his clutches his strength has been described as prodigious but now heightened by his desire for vengeance it was irresistible jonathan though a very powerful man was like an infant in his gripe catching hold of his chin he bent back the neck while with his left hand he pulled out a clasp knife which he opened with his teeth and grasping wilds head with his arm notwithstanding his resistance cut deeply into his throat the folds of a thick muslin neckcloth in some degree protected him but the gash was desperate blueskin drew the knife across his throat a second time widening and deepening the wound and wrenching back the head to get it into a more favourable position would infallibly have severed it from the trunk if the officers who by this time had recovered from their terror had not thrown themselves upon him and withheld him nows your time cried blueskin struggling desperately with his assailants and inflicting severe cuts with his knife fly captainfly aroused to a sense of the possibility of escape jack who had viewed the deadly assault with savage satisfaction burst from his captors and made for the door blueskin fought his way towards it and exerting all his strength cutting right and left as he proceeded reached it at the same time jack in all probability would have escaped if langley who was left in the lodge had not been alarmed at the noise and rushed thither seeing jack at liberty he instantly seized him and a struggle commenced at this moment blueskin came up and kept off the officers with his knife he used his utmost efforts to liberate jack from langley but closely pressed on all sides he was not able to render any effectual assistance fly cried jack escape if you can dont mind me casting one look of anguish at his leader blueskin then darted down the passage the only persons in the lodge were mrs spurling and marvel hearing the noise of the scuffle the tapstress fancying it was jack making an effort to escape in spite of the remonstrances of the executioner threw open the wicket blueskin therefore had nothing to stop him dashing through the open door he crossed the old bailey plunged into a narrow court on the opposite side of the way and was out of sight in a minute baffling all pursuit on their return the jailers raised up jonathan who was weltering in his blood and who appeared to be dying efforts were made to staunch his wounds and surgical assistance sent for has he escaped asked the thieftaker faintly blueskin said ireton nosheppard rejoined wild no no sir replied ireton hes here thats right replied wild with a ghastly smile remove him to the middle stone holdwatch over him night and day do you mind i do sir ironsheavy ironsnight and day depend upon it sir go with him to tyburnnever lose sight of him till the noose is tied wheres marvel here sir replied the executioner a hundred guineas if you hang jack sheppard i have it about me take it if i die never fear sir replied marvel oh that i could live to see it gasped jonathan and with a hideous expression of pain he fainted hes dead exclaimed austin i am content said jack my mother is avenged take me to the stone room blueskin you are a true friend the body of jonathan was then conveyed to his own habitation while jack was taken to the middle stone room and ironed in the manner wild had directed chapter xxviii what happened at dollis hill at length this tragedy is at an end said mr wood as having seen the earth thrown over the remains of the unfortunate mrs sheppard he turned to quit the churchyard let us hope that like her who loved much her sins are forgiven her without another word and accompanied by thames he then took his way to dollis hill in a state of the deepest depression thames did not attempt to offer him any consolation for he was almost as much dejected the weather harmonized with their feelings it rained slightly and a thick mist gathered in the air and obscured the beautiful prospect on his arrival at dollis hill mr wood was so much exhausted that he was obliged to retire to his own room where he continued for some hours overpowered by grief the two lovers sat together and their sole discourse turned upon jack and his illfated mother as the night advanced mr wood again made his appearance in a more composed frame of mind and at his daughters earnest solicitation was induced to partake of some refreshment an hour was then passed in conversation as to the possibility of rendering any assistance to jack in deploring his unhappy destiny and in the consideration of the course to be pursued in reference to jonathan wild while they were thus occupied a maidservant entered the room and stated that a person was without who had a packet for captain darrell which must be delivered into his own hands notwithstanding the remonstrances of wood and winifred thames instantly followed the domestic and found a man with his face muffled up at the door as she had described somewhat alarmed at his appearance thames laid his hand upon his sword fear nothing sir said the man in a voice which thames instantly recognised as that of blueskin i am come to render you a service there are the packets which my captain hazarded his life to procure for you and which he said would establish your right to the estates of the trenchard family there are also the letters which were scattered about wilds room after the murder of sir rowland and there he added placing in his hands a heavy bag of money and a pocketbook is a sum little short of fifteen thousand pounds how have you procured these things asked thames in the utmost astonishment i carried them off on the fatal night when we got into wilds house and you were struck down replied blueskin they have ever since been deposited in a place of safety you have nothing more to fear from wild how so asked thames i have saved the executioner a labour by cutting his throat replied blueskin and may i be cursed if i ever did anything in my whole life which gave me so much satisfaction almighty god is this possible exclaimed thames you will find it true replied blueskin all i regret is that i failed in liberating the captain if he had got off they might have hanged me and welcome what can be done for him cried thames thats not an easy question to answer rejoined blueskin but i shall watch night and day about newgate in the hope of getting him out he wouldnt require my aid but before i stopped jonathans mouth he had ordered him to be doublyironed and constantly watched and though the villain cant see his orders executed ive no doubt some one else will poor jack exclaimed thames i would sacrifice all my fortuneall my hopesto liberate him if youre in earnest rejoined blueskin give me that bag of gold it contains a thousand pounds and if all other schemes fail ill engage to free him on the way to tyburn may i trust you hesitated thames why did i not keep the money when i had it returned blueskin angrily not a farthing of it shall be expended except in the captains service take it replied thames you have saved his life replied blueskin and now mark me you owe what i have done for you to him not to me had i not known that you and your affianced bride are dearer to him than life i should have used this money to secure my own safety take it and take the estates in captain sheppards name promise me one thing before i leave you what is it asked thames if the captain is taken to tyburn be near the place of executionat the end of the edgeware road i will in case of need you will lend a helping hand yesyes swear it i do enough rejoined blueskin and he departed just as wood who had become alarmed by thamess long absence made his appearance with a blunderbuss in his hand hastily acquainting him with the treasures he had unexpectedly obtained thames returned to the room to apprize winifred of his good fortune the packets were hastily broken open and while wood was absorbed in the perusal of the despatch addressed to him by sir rowland thames sought out and found the letter which he had been prevented from finishing on the fatal night at jonathan wilds as soon as he had read it he let it fall from his grasp winifred instantly picked it up you are no longer thames darrell she said casting her eyes rapidly over it but the marquis de chatillon my father was of the bloodroyal of france exclaimed thames ehday whats this cried wood looking up from beneath his spectacles whowho is the marquis de chatillon your adopted son thames darrell answered winifred and the marchioness is your daughter added thames o lord ejaculated wood my head fairly turns round so many distressesso many joys coming at the same time are too much for me read that letter thamesmy lord marquis i mean read it and youll find that your unfortunate uncle sir rowland surrenders to you all the estates in lancashire youve nothing to do but to take possession what a strange history is mine said thames kidnapped and sent to france by one uncle it was my lot to fall into the hands of anothermy fathers own brother the marshal gaucher de chatillon to whom and to the cardinal dubois i owed all my good fortune the ways of providence are inscrutable observed wood when in france i heard from the marshal that his brother had perished in london on the night of the great storm it was supposed he was drowned in crossing the river as his body had never been found little did i imagine at the time that it was my own father to whom he referred i think i remember reading something about your father in the papers observed wood wasnt he in some way connected with the jacobite plots he was replied thames he had been many years in this country before his assassination took place in this letter which is addressed to my illfated mother he speaks of his friendship for sir rowland whom it seems he had known abroad but entreats her to keep the marriage secret for a time for reasons which are not fully developed and so sir rowland murdered his friend remarked wood crime upon crime unconsciously perhaps replied thames but be it as it may he is now beyond the reach of earthly punishment but wild still lives cried wood he also has paid the penalty of his offences returned thames he has fallen by the hand of blueskin who brought me these packets thank god for that cried wood heartily i could almost forgive the wretch the injury he did me in depriving me of my poor dear wifeno not quite that he added a little confused and now said thames for we must still preserve the name you will no longer defer my happiness hold interposed winifred gravely i release you from your promise a carpenters daughter is no fit match for a peer of france if my dignity must be purchased by the loss of you i renounce it cried thames you will not make it valueless in my eyes he added catching her in his arms and pressing her to his breast be it as you please replied winifred my lips would belie my heart were i to refuse you and now father your blessingyour consent cried thames you have both replied wood fervently i am too much honouredtoo happy in the union oh that i should live to be fatherinlaw to a peer of france what would my poor wife say to it if she could come to life again oh thamesmy lord marquis i meanyou have made me the happiestthe proudest of mankind not many days after this event on a bright october morning the bells rang a merry peal from the old gray tower of willesden church all the village was assembled in the churchyard young and old were dressed in their gayest apparel and it was evident from the smiles that lighted up every countenance from the roguish looks of the younger swains and the demure expression of several pretty rustic maidens that a ceremony which never fails to interest all classesa weddingwas about to take place at the gate opening upon the road leading to dollis hill were stationed william morgan and john dump presently two carriages dashed down the hill and drew up before it from the first of these alighted thames or as he must now be styled the marquis de chatillon from the second descended mr woodand after him came his daughter the sun never shone upon a lovelier couple than now approached the altar the church was crowded to excess by the numbers eager to witness the ceremony and as soon as it was over the wedded pair were followed to the carriage and the loudest benedictions uttered for their happiness in spite of the tumultuous joy which agitated him the bridegroom could not prevent the intrusion of some saddening thoughts as he reflected upon the melancholy scene which he had so recently witnessed in the same place the youthful couple had been seated in the carriage a few minutes when they were joined by mr wood who had merely absented himself to see that a public breakfast which he had ordered at the six bells for all who chose to partake of it was in readiness he likewise gave directions that in the after part of the day a whole bullock should be roasted on the green and distributed together with a barrel of the strongest ale in the evening a band of village musicians accompanied by most of the young inhabitants of willesden strolled out to dollis hill where they formed a rustic concert under the great elm before the door here they were regaled with another plentiful meal by the hospitable carpenter who personally superintended the repast these festivities however were not witnessed by the newlymarried pair who had departed immediately after the ceremony for manchester chapter xxix how jack sheppard was taken to westminster hall loaded with the heaviest fetters and constantly watched by two of the jailers assistants who neither quitted him for a single moment nor suffered any visitor to approach him jack sheppard found all attempts to escape impracticable he was confined in the middle stone ward a spacious apartment with good light and air situated over the gateway on the western side and allotted to him not for his own convenience but for that of the keepers who if he had been placed in a gloomier or more incommodious dungeon would have necessarily had to share it with him through this his last trial jacks spirits never deserted him he seemed resigned but cheerful and held frequent and serious discourses with the ordinary who felt satisfied of his sincere penitence the only circumstance which served to awaken a darker feeling in his breast was that his implacable foe jonathan wild had survived the wound inflicted by blueskin and was slowly recovering as soon as he could be moved with safety jonathan had himself transported to newgate where he was carried into the middle ward that he might feast his eyes upon his victim having seen every precaution taken to ensure his safe custody he departed muttering to himself i shall yet live to see him hangedi shall live to see him hanged animated by his insatiate desire of vengeance he seemed to gain strength dailyso much so that within a fortnight after receiving his wound he was able to stir abroad on thursday the th of november after having endured nearly a months imprisonment jack sheppard was conveyed from newgate to westminster hall he was placed in a coach handcuffed and heavily fettered and guarded by a vast posse of officers to temple bar where a fresh relay of constables escorted him to westminster by this time jacks reputation had risen to such a height with the populacehis exploits having become the universal theme of discourse that the streets were almost impassable for the crowds collected to obtain a view of him the vast area in front of westminster hall was thronged with people and it was only by a vigorous application of their staves that the constables could force a passage for the vehicle at length however the prisoner was got out when such was the rush of the multitude that several persons were trampled down and received severe injuries arrived in the hall the prisoners handcuffs were removed and he was taken before the court of kings bench the record of his conviction at the old bailey sessions was then read and as no objection was offered to it the attorneygeneral moved that his execution might take place on monday next upon this jack earnestly and eloquently addressed himself to the bench and besought that a petition which he had prepared to be laid before the king might be read this request however was refused and he was told that the only way in which he could entitle himself to his majestys clemency would be by discovering who had abetted him in his last escape the strongest suspicions being entertained that he had not affected it alone sheppard replied by a solemn assertion that he had received no assistance except from heavenan answer for which he was immediately reprimanded by the court it having been stated that it was wholly impossible he could have removed his irons in the way he represented he offered if his handcuffs were replaced to take them off in the presence of the court the proposal however was not acceded to and the chief justice powis after enumerating his various offences and commenting upon their heinousness awarded sentence of death against him for the following monday as jack was removed he noticed jonathan wild at a little distance from him eyeing him with a look of the most savage satisfaction the thieftakers throat was bound up with thick folds of linen and his face had a ghastly and cadaverous look which communicated an undefinable and horrible expression to his glances meanwhile the mob outside had prodigiously increased and had begun to exhibit some disposition to riot the coach in which the prisoner had been conveyed was already broken to pieces and the driver was glad to escape with life terrific shouts were raised by the rabble who threatened to tear wild in pieces if he showed himself amid this tumult several men armed with tremendous bludgeons with their faces besmeared with grease and soot and otherwise disguised were observed to be urging the populace to attempt a rescue they were headed by an athleticlooking swarthyfeatured man who was armed with a cutlass which he waved over his head to cheer on his companions these desperadoes had been the most active in demolishing the coach and now being supported by the rabble they audaciously approached the very portals of the ancient hall the shouts yells and groans which they uttered and which were echoed by the concourse in the rear were perfectly frightful jonathan who with the other constables had reconnoitred this band and recognised in its ringleader blueskin commanded the constables to follow him and made a sally for the purpose of seizing him enfeebled by his wound wild had lost much of his strength though nothing of his ferocity and energyand fiercely assailing blueskin he made a desperate but unsuccessful attempt to apprehend him he was however instantly beaten back and the fury of the mob was so great that it was with difficulty he could effect a retreat the whole force of the constables jailers and others was required to keep the crowd out of the hall the doors were closed and barricaded and the mob threatened to burst them open if jack was not delivered to them things now began to wear so serious a aspect that a messenger was secretly despatched to the savoy for troops and in half an hour a regiment of the guards arrived who by dint of great exertion succeeded in partially dispersing the tumultuous assemblage another coach was then procured in which the prisoner was placed jacks appearance was hailed with the loudest cheers but when jonathan followed and took a place beside him in the vehicle determined he said never to lose sight of him the abhorrence of the multitude was expressed by execrations hoots and yells of the most terrific kind so dreadful were these shouts as to produce an effect upon the hardened feelings of jonathan who shrank out of sight it was well for him that he had taken his place by sheppard as regard for the latter alone prevented the deadliest missiles being hurled at him as it was the mob went on alternately hooting and huzzaing as the names of wild and sheppard were pronounced while some individuals bolder than the rest thrust their faces into the coachwindow and assured jack that he should never be taken to tyburn well see that you yelping hounds rejoined jonathan glaring fiercely at them in this way jack was brought back to newgate and again chained down in the middle ward it was late before jonathan ventured to his own house where he remained up all night and kept his janizaries and other assistants well armed chapter xxx how jonathan wilds house was burnt down the day appointed for the execution was now close at hand and the prisoner who seemed to have abandoned all hopes of escape turned his thoughts entirely from worldly considerations on sunday he was conveyed to the chapel through which he had passed on the occasion of his great escape and once more took his seat in the condemned pew the rev mr purney the ordinary who had latterly conceived a great regard for jack addressed him in a discourse which while it tended to keep alive his feelings of penitence was calculated to afford him much consolation the chapel was crowded to excess but hereeven here the demon was suffered to intrude and jacks thoughts were distracted by jonathan wild who stood at a little distance from him and kept his bloodthirsty eyes fixed on him during the whole of the service on that night an extraordinary event occurred which convinced the authorities that every precaution must be taken in conducting jack to tyburna fact of which they had been previously made aware though scarcely to the same extent by the riotous proceedings near westminster hall about nine oclock an immense mob collected before the lodge at newgate it was quite dark but as some of the assemblage carried links it was soon ascertained to be headed by the same party who had mainly incited the former disturbance amongst the ringleaders was blueskin whose swarthy features and athletic figure were easily distinguished another was baptist kettleby and a third in a dutch dress was recognised by his grizzled beard as the skipper van galgebrok before an hour had elapsed the concourse was fearfully increased the area in front of the jail was completely filled attempts were made upon the door of the lodge but it was too strong to be forced a cry was then raised by the leaders to attack wilds house and the fury of the mob was instantly directed to that quarter wrenched from their holds the iron palisades in front of the thieftakers dwelling were used as weapons to burst open the door while this was passing jonathan opened one of the upper windows and fired several shots upon the assailants but though he made blueskin and kettleby his chief marks he missed both the sight of the thieftaker increased the fury of the mob to a fearful degree terrific yells rent the air the heavy weapon thundered against the door and it speedily yielded to their efforts come on my lads vociferated blueskin well unkennel the old fox as he spoke several shots were fired from the upper part of the house and two men fell mortally wounded but this only incensed the assailing party the more with a drawn cutlass in one hand and a cocked pistol in the other blueskin rushed up stairs the landing was defended by quilt arnold and the jew the former was shot by blueskin through the head and his body fell over the bannisters the jew who was paralysed by his companions fate offered no resistance and was instantly seized where is your accursed master demanded blueskin holding the sword to his throat the jew did not speak but pointed to the audiencechamber committing him to the custody of the others blueskin followed by a numerous band darted in that direction the door was locked but with the bars of iron it was speedily burst open several of the assailants carried links so that the room was a blaze of light jonathan however was nowhere to be seen rushing towards the entrance of the wellhole blueskin touched the secret spring he was not there opening the trapdoor he then descended to the vaultssearched each cell and every nook and corner separately wild had escaped robbed of their prey the fury of the mob became ungovernable at length at the end of a passage next to the cell where mrs sheppard had been confined blueskin discovered a trapdoor which he had not previously noticed it was instantly burst open when the horrible stench that issued from it convinced them that it must be a receptacle for the murdered victims of the thieftaker holding a link into the place which had the appearance of a deep pit blueskin noticed a body richly dressed he dragged it out and perceiving in spite of the decayed frame that it was the body of sir rowland trenchard commanded his attendants to convey it up stairsan order which was promptly obeyed returning to the audiencechamber blueskin had the jew brought before him the body of sir rowland was then laid on the large table opposite to it was placed the jew seeing from the threatening looks of his captors that they were about to wreak their vengeance upon him the miserable wretch besought mercy in abject terms and charged his master with the most atrocious crimes his relation of the murder of sir rowland petrified even his fierce auditors one of the cases in jonathans museum was now burst open and a rope taken from it in spite of his shrieks the miserable jew was then dragged into the wellhole and the rope being tied round his neck he was launched from the bridge the vengeance of the assailants did not stop here they broke open the entrance into jonathans storeroomplundered it of everything valuableransacked every closet drawer and secret hidingplace and stripped them of their contents large hoards of money were discovered gold and silver plate cases of watches and various precious articles nothing in short portable or valuable was left old implements of housebreaking were discovered and the thieftakers most hidden depositories were laid bare the work of plunder over that of destruction commenced straw and other combustibles being collected were placed in the middle of the audiencechamber on these were thrown all the horrible contents of jonathans museum together with the body of sir rowland trenchard the whole was then fired and in a few minutes the room was a blaze not content with this the assailants set fire to the house in halfadozen other places and the progress of the flames was rapid and destructive meanwhile the object of all this fearful disturbance had made his escape to newgate from the roof of which he witnessed the destruction of his premises he saw the flames burst from the windows and perhaps in that maddening spectacle suffered torture equivalent to some of the crimes he had committed while he was thus standing the flames of his house which made the whole street as light as day and ruddily illumined the faces of the mob below betrayed him to them and he was speedily driven from his position by a shower of stones and other missiles the mob now directed their attention to newgate and from their threats appeared determined to fire it ladders paviours rams sledgehammers and other destructive implements were procured and in all probability their purpose would have been effected but for the opportune arrival of a detachment of the guards who dispersed them not without some loss of life several prisoners were taken but the ringleaders escaped engines were brought to play upon wilds premises and upon the adjoining houses the latter were saved but of the former nothing but the blackened stone walls were found standing on the morrow chapter xxxi the procession to tyburn the noise of this disturbance did not fail to reach the interior of the prison in fact the reflection of the flames lighted up the ward in which jack sheppard was confined the night his execution was therefore passed in a most anxious state of mind nor was his uneasiness allayed by the appearance of jonathan wild who after he had been driven from the roof of the jail repaired to the middle stone ward in a fit of ungovernable passion to vent his rage upon the prisoner whom he looked upon as the cause of the present calamity such was his fury that if he had not been restrained by the presence of the two turnkeys he might perhaps have anticipated the course of justice by laying violent hands upon his victim after venting his wrath in the wildest manner and uttering the most dreadful execrations jonathan retired to another part of the prison where he passed the night in consultation with the governor as to the best means of conveying the prisoner securely to tyburn mr pitt endeavoured to dissuade him from attending in person representing the great risk he would incur from the mob which was certain to be assembled but jonathan was not to be deterred i have sworn to see him hanged he said and nothing shall keep me awaynothing by by wilds advice the usual constabulary force was greatly augmented messengers were despatched to all the constables and headboroughs to be in attendanceto the sheriffs to have an extraordinary number of their officers in attendanceand to the savoy to obtain the escort of a troop of grenadierguards in short more preparations were made than if a state criminal was about to be executed the morning of monday the th of november at length dawned it was a dull foggy day and the atmosphere was so thick and heavy that at eight oclock the curious who arrived near the prison could scarcely discern the tower of st sepulchres church by and by the tramp of horses feet was heard slowly ascending snow hill and presently a troop of grenadier guards rode into the area facing newgate these were presently joined by a regiment of foot a large body of the constables of westminster next made their appearance the chief of whom entered the lodge where they were speedily joined by the civic authorities at nine oclock the sheriffs arrived followed by their officers and javelinmen meantime the stone hall was crowded by all the inmates of the jail debtors felons turnkeys and officers who could obtain permission to witness the ceremony of the prisoners irons being struck off caliban who through the interest of mr ireton was appointed to the office stood with a hammer in one hand and a punch in the other near the great stone block ready to fulfil his duty close behind him stood the tall gaunt figure of marvel with his large bony hands his scraggy neck and illfavoured countenance next to the executioner stood his wifethe former mrs spurling mrs marvel held her handkerchief to her eyes and appeared in great distress but her husband whose deportment to her was considerably changed since the fatal knot had been tied paid no attention whatever to her grief at this moment the bell of newgate began to toll and was answered by another bell from st sepulchres the great door of the stone hall was thrown open and the sheriffs preceded by the javelinmen entered the room they were followed by jonathan who carried a stout stick under his arm and planted himself near the stone not a word was uttered by the assemblage but a hush of expectation reigned throughout another door was next opened and preceded by the ordinary with the sacred volume in his hand the prisoner entered the room though encumbered by his irons his step was firm and his demeanour dignified his countenance was pale as death but not a muscle quivered nor did he betray the slightest appearance of fear on the contrary it was impossible to look at him without perceiving that his resolution was unshaken advancing with a slow firm step to the stoneblock he placed his left foot upon it drew himself up to his full height and fixed a look so stern upon jonathan that the thieftaker quailed before it the black meantime began to ply his hammer and speedily unriveted the chains the first stroke appeared to arouse all the vindictive passions of jonathan fixing a ferocious and exulting look upon jack sheppard he exclaimed at length my vengeance is complete wretch cried jack raising his hand in a menacing manner your triumph will be shortlived before a year has expired you will share the same fate if i do i care not rejoined wild i shall have lived to see you hanged o jack dear dear jack cried mrs marvel who was now quite dissolved in tears i shall never survive this scene hold your tongue hussy cried her husband gruffly women ought never to show themselves on these occasions unless they can behave themselves properly farewell jack cried twenty voices sheppard looked round and exchanged kindly glances with several of those who addressed him my limbs feel so light now that my irons are removed he observed with a smile that i am half inclined to dance youll dance upon nothing presently rejoined jonathan brutally farewell for ever said jack extending his hand to mrs marvel farewell blubbered the executioners wife pressing his hand to her lips here are a pair of gloves and a nosegay for you oh dearoh dear be careful of him she added to her husband and get it over quickly or never expect to see me again peace fool cried marvel angrily do you think i dont know my own business austin and langley then advanced to the prisoner and twinning their arms round his led him down to the lodge whither he was followed by the sheriffs the ordinary wild and the other officials meantime every preparation had been made outside for his departure at the end of two long lines of footguards stood the cart with a powerful black horse harnessed to it at the head of the cart was placed the coffin on the right were several mounted grenadiers on the left some half dozen javelinmen soldiers were stationed at different points of the street to keep off the mob and others were riding backwards and forwards to maintain an open space for the passage of the procession the assemblage which was gathered together was almost countless every housetop every window every wall every projection had its occupants the wall of st sepulchres church was coveredso was the tower the concourse extended along giltspur street as far as smithfield no one was allowed to pass along newgate street which was barricaded and protected by a strong constabulary force the first person who issued from the lodge was mr marvel who proceeded to the cart and took his seat upon the coffin the hangman is always an object of peculiar detestation to the mob a tremendous hooting hailed his appearance and both staves and swords were required to preserve order a deep silence however now prevailed broken only by the tolling of the bells of newgate and st sepulchres the mighty concourse became for a moment still suddenly such a shout as has seldom smitten human ears rent the air he comes cried a thousand voices and the shout ascended to smithfield descended to snow hill and told those who were assembled on holborn hill that sheppard had left the prison between the two officers with their arms linked in his jack sheppard was conducted to the cart he looked around and as he heard that deafening shoutas he felt the influence of those thousand eyes fixed upon himas he listened to the cheers all his misgivingsif he had anyvanished and he felt more as if he were marching to a triumph than proceeding to a shameful death jack had no sooner taken his place in the cart than he was followed by the ordinary who seated himself beside him and opening the book of prayer began to read aloud excited by the scene jack however could pay little attention to the good mans discourse and was lost in a whirl of tumultuous emotions the calvacade was now put slowly in motion the horsesoldiers wheeled round and cleared a path the foot closed in upon the cart then came the javelinmen walking four abreast and lastly a long line of constables marching in the same order the procession had just got into line of march when a dreadful groan mixed with yells hootings and execrations was heard this was occasioned by jonathan wild who was seen to mount his horse and join the train jonathan however paid no sort of attention to this demonstration of hatred he had buckled on his hanger and had two brace of pistols in his belt as well as others in this holsters by this time the procession had reached the west end of the wall of st sepulchres church where in compliance with an old custom it halted by the will of mr robert dow merchant tailor it was appointed that the sexton of st sepulchres should pronounce a solemn exhortation upon every criminal on his way to tyburn for which office he was to receive a small stipend as soon as the cavalcade stopped the sexton advanced and ringing a handbell pronounced the following admonition all good people pray heartily unto god for this poor sinner who is now going to take his death for whom this great bell doth toll you who are condemned to die repent with lamentable tears ask mercy of the lord for the salvation of your own soul through the merits of the death and passion of jesus christ who now sits at the right hand of god to make intercession for you if you penitently return to him the lord have mercy upon you this ceremony concluded the calvacade was again put in motion slowly descending snow hill the train passed on its way attended by the same stunning vociferations cheers yells and outcries which had accompanied it on starting from newgate the guards had great difficulty in preserving a clear passage without resorting to severe measures for the tide which poured upon them behind around in front and at all sides was almost irresistible the houses on snow hill were thronged like those in old bailey every window from the groundfloor to the garret had its occupant and the roofs were covered with spectators words of encouragement and sympathy were addressed to jack who as he looked around beheld many a friendly glance fixed upon him in this way they reached holborn bridge here a little delay occurred the passage was so narrow that there was only sufficient room for the cart to pass with a single line of footsoldiers on one side and as the walls of the bridge were covered with spectators it was not deemed prudent to cross it till these persons were dislodged while this was effected intelligence was brought that a formidable mob was pouring down field lane the end of which was barricaded the advanced guard rode on to drive away any opposition while the main body of the procession crossed the bridge and slowly toiled up holborn hill the entrance of shoe lane and the whole line of the wall of st andrews church the bell of which was tolling was covered with spectators upon the steps leading to the gates of the church stood two persons whom jack instantly recognised these were his mistresses poll maggot and edgeworth bess as soon as the latter beheld him she uttered a loud scream and fainted she was caught by some of the bystanders who offered by her every assistance in their power as to mrs maggot whose nerves were more firmly strung she contented herself with waving her hand affectionately to her lover and encouraging him by her gestures while this was taking place another and more serious interruption occurred the advanced guard had endeavoured to disperse the mob in field lane but were not prepared to meet with the resistance they encountered the pavement had been hastily picked up and heaped across the end of the street upon which planks barrels and other barricades were laid most of the mob were armed with pikes staves swords muskets and other weapons and offered a most desperate resistance to the soldiery whom they drove back with a shower of pavingstones the arrival of the cart at the end of field lane appeared the signal for an attempt at rescue with a loud shout and headed by a powerfullybuilt man with a face as black as that of a mulatto and armed with a cutlass the rabble leapt over the barricades and rushed towards the vehicle an immediate halt took place the soldiers surrounded the cart drew their swords and by striking the rioters first with the blunt edge of their blades and afterwards with the sharp points succeeded in driving them back amid this skirmish jonathan greatly distinguished himself drawing his hanger he rode amongst the crowd trampled upon those most in advance and made an attempt to seize their leader in whom he recognised blueskin baffled in their attempt the mob uttered a roar such as only a thousand angry voices can utter and discharged a volley of missiles at the soldiery stones and brickbats were showered on all sides and mr marvel was almost dislodged from his seat on the coffin by a dead dog which was hurled against him and struck him in the face at length however by dealing blows right and left with their swords and even inflicting severe cuts on the foremost of the rabble the soldiers managed to gain a clear course and to drive back the assailants who as they retreated behind the barricades shouted in tones of defiance to tyburn to tyburn the object of all this tumult meanwhile never altered his position but sat back in the cart as if resolved not to make even a struggle to regain his liberty the procession now wound its way without further interruption along holborn like a river swollen by many currents it gathered force from the various avenues that poured their streams into it fetter lane on the left grays inn on the right added their supplies on all hands jack was cheered and jonathan hooted at length the train approached st giless here according to another old custom already alluded to a criminal taken to execution was allowed to halt at a tavern called the crown and take a draught from st giless bowl as his last refreshment on earth at the door of this tavern which was situated on the left of the street not more than a hundred yards distant from the church the bell of which began to toll as soon as the procession came in sight the cart drew up and the whole cavalcade halted a wooden balcony in one of the adjoining houses was thronged with ladies all of whom appeared to take a lively interest in the scene and to be full of commiseration for the criminal not perhaps unmixed with admiration of his appearance every window in the public house was filled with guests and as in the case of st andrews the churchyard wall of st giless was lined with spectators a scene now ensued highly characteristic of the age and the occasion the doleful procession at once assumed a festive character many of the soldiers dismounted and called for drink their example was immediately imitated by the officers constables javelin men and other attendants and nothing was to be heard but shouts of laughter and jestingnothing seen but the passing of glasses and the emptying of foaming jugs mr marvel who had been a little discomposed by the treatment he had experienced on holborn hill very composedly filled and lighted his pipe one group at the door attracted jacks attention inasmuch as it was composed of several of his old acquaintancesmr kneebone van galgebrok and baptist kettlebyall of whom greeted him cordially besides these there was a sturdylooking fellow whom he instantly recognised as the honest blacksmith who had freed him from his irons at tottenham i am here you see said the smith so i perceive replied jack at this moment the landlord of the crown a joviallooking stout personage with a white apron round his waist issued from the house bearing a large wooden bowl filled with ale which he offered to jack who instantly rose to receive it raising the bowl in his right hand jack glanced towards the balcony in which the group of ladies were seated and begged to drink their healths he then turned to kneebone and the others who extended their hands towards him and raised it to his lips just as he was about to drain it he encountered the basilisk glance of jonathan wild and paused i leave this bowl for you he cried returning it to the landlord untasted your father said so before you replied jonathan malignantly and yet it has tarried thus long you will call for it before six months are passed rejoined jack sternly once again the cavalcade was in motion and winding its way by st giless church the bell of which continued tolling all the time passed the pound and entered oxford road or as it was then not unfrequently termed tyburn road after passing tottenham court road very few houses were to be seen on the right hand opposite wardour street it was open country the crowd now dispersed amongst the fields and thousands of persons were seen hurrying towards tyburn as fast as their legs could carry them leaping over hedges and breaking down every impediment in their course besides those who conducted themselves more peaceably the conductors of the procession noticed with considerable uneasiness large bands of men armed with staves bludgeons and other weapons who were flying across the field in the same direction as it was feared that some mischief would ensue wild volunteered if he were allowed a small body of men to ride forward to tyburn and keep the ground clear until the arrival of the prisoner this suggestion being approved was instantly acted upon and the thieftaker accompanied by a body of the grenadiers rode forward the train meantime had passed marylebone lane when it again paused for a moment at jacks request near the door of a publichouse called the city of oxford scarcely had it come to a halt when a stalwart man shouldered his way in spite of their opposition through the lines of soldiery to the cart and offered his large horny hand to the prisoner i told you i would call to bid you farewell mr figg said jack so you did replied the prizefighter sorry youre obliged to keep your word heard of your last escape hoped youd not be retaken never sent for the shirt i didnt want it replied jack but who are those gentlemen friends of yours replied figg come to see yousir james thornhill mr hogarth and mr gay they send you every good wish offer them my hearty thanks replied jack waving his hand to the group all of whom returned the salutation and now farewell mr figg in a few minutes all will be over figg turned aside to hide the tears that started to his eyesfor the stout prizefighter with a mans courage had a womans heartand the procession again set forward chapter xxxii the closing scene tyburn was now at hand over the sea of heads arose a black and dismal object it was the gallows jack whose back was towards it did not see it but he heard from the pitying exclamations of the crowd that it was in view this circumstance produced no further alteration in his demeanour except that he endeavoured to abstract himself from the surrounding scene and bend his attention to the prayers which the ordinary was reciting just as he had succeeded in fixing his attention it was again shaken and he was almost unnerved by the sight of mr wood who was standing at the edge of a raised platform anxiously waving his hand to him jack instantly sprang to his feet and as his guards construed the motion into an attempt to escape several of them drew their swords and motioned to him to sit down but jack did not heed them his looks were fixed on his old benefactor god in heaven bless you unhappy boy cried wood bursting into tears god bless you jack extended his hand towards him and looked anxiously for thames but he was nowhere to be seen a severe pang shot through jacks heart and he would have given worlds if he possessed them to have seen his friend once more the wish was vain and endeavouring to banish every earthly thought he addressed himself deeply and sincerely to prayer while this was passing jonathan had ridden back to marvel to tell him that all was ready and to give him his last instructions youll lose no time said the thieftaker a hundred pounds if you do it quickly rely on me rejoined the executioner throwing away his pipe which was just finished a deep dread calm like that which precedes a thunderstorm now prevailed amongst the assemblage the thousand voices which a few moments before had been so clamorous were now hushed not a breath was drawn the troops had kept a large space clear around the gallows the galleries adjoining it were crowded with spectatorsso was the roof of a large tavern then the only house standing at the end of the edgeware roadso were the treesthe walls of hyde parka neighbouring barn a shedin short every available position the cart meantime had approached the fatal tree the guards horse and foot and constables formed a wide circle round it to keep off the mob it was an awful momentso awful that every other feeling except deep interest in the scene seemed suspended at this terrible juncture jack maintained his composurea smile played upon his face before the cap was drawn over itand the last words he uttered were my poor mother i shall soon join her the rope was then adjusted and the cart began to move the next instant he was launched into eternity scarcely had he been turned off a moment when a man with swarthy features leapt into the cart with an open claspknife in his hand and before he could be prevented severed the rope and cut down the body it was blueskin his assistance came too late a ball from wilds pistol passed through his heart and a volley of musketry poured from the guards lodged several balls in the yet breathing body of his leader blueskin however was not unattended a thousand eager assistants pressed behind him jacks body was caught and passed from hand to hand over a thousand heads till it was far from the fatal tree the shouts of indignationthe frightful yells now raised baffle description a furious attack was made on jonathan who though he defended himself like a lion was desperately wounded and would inevitably have perished if he had not been protected by the guards who were obliged to use both swords and firearms upon the mob in his defence he was at length rescued from his assailantsrescued to perish seven months afterwards with every ignominy at the very gibbet to which he had brought his victim the body of jack sheppard meanwhile was borne along by that tremendous host which rose and fell like the waves of the ocean until it approached the termination of the edgeware road at this point a carriage with servants in sumptuous liveries was stationed at the open door stood a young man in a rich garb with a mask on his face who was encouraging the mob by words and gestures at length the body was brought towards him instantly seizing it the young man placed it in the carriage shut the door and commanded his servants to drive off the order was promptly obeyed and the horses proceeded at a furious pace along the edgeware road half an hour afterwards the body of jack was carefully examined it had been cut down before life was extinct but a ball from one of the soldiers had pierced his heart thus died jack sheppard that night a grave was dug in willesden churchyard next to that in which mrs sheppard had been interred two persons besides the clergyman and sexton alone attended the ceremony they were a young man and an old one and both appeared deeply affected the coffin was lowered into the grave and the mourners departed a simple wooden monument was placed over the grave but without any name or date in after years some pitying hand supplied the inscription which ran thus illustration jack sheppard the end
