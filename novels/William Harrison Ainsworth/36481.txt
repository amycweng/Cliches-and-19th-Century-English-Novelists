device to perplex auriol prologue dr lamb the sixteenth century drew to a close it was the last day of the last year and two hours only were wanting to the birth of another year and of another century the night was solemn and beautiful myriads of stars paved the deep vault of heaven the crescent moon hung like a silver lamp in the midst of them a stream of rosy and quivering light issuing from the north traversed the sky like the tail of some stupendous comet while from its point of effluence broke forth ever and anon coruscations rivalling in splendour and variety of hue the most brilliant discharge of fireworks a sharp frost prevailed but the atmosphere was clear and dry and neither wind nor snow aggravated the wholesome rigour of the season the water lay in thick congealed masses around the conduits and wells and the buckets were frozen on their stands the thoroughfares were sheeted with ice and dangerous to horsemen and vehicles but the footways were firm and pleasant to the tread here and there a fire was lighted in the streets round which ragged urchins and mendicants were collected roasting fragments of meat stuck upon iron prongs or quaffing deep draughts of metheglin and ale out of leathern cups crowds were collected in the open places watching the wonders in the heavens and drawing auguries from them chiefly sinister for most of the beholders thought the signs portended the speedy death of the queen and the advent of a new monarch from the northa safe and easy interpretation considering the advanced age and declining health of the illustrious elizabeth together with the known appointment of her successor james of scotland notwithstanding the early habits of the times few persons had retired to rest an universal wish prevailing among the citizens to see the new year in and welcome the century accompanying it lights glimmered in most windows revealing the hollysprigs and laurelleaves stuck thickly in their diamond panes while whenever a door was opened a ruddy gleam burst across the street and a glance inside the dwelling showed its inmates either gathered round the glowing hearth occupied in mirthful sportsfoxithhole blindmans buff or shoethemareor seated at the ample board groaning with christmas cheer music and singing were heard at every corner and bands of comely damsels escorted by their sweethearts went from house to house bearing huge brown bowls dressed with ribands and rosemary and filled with a drink called lambswool composed of sturdy ale sweetened with sugar spiced with nutmeg and having toasts and burnt crabs floating within ita draught from which seldom brought its pretty bearers less than a groat and occasionally a more valuable coin such was the vigil of the year sixteen hundred on this night and at the tenth hour a man of striking and venerable appearance was seen to emerge upon a small wooden balcony projecting from a baywindow near the top of a picturesque structure situated at the southern extremity of london bridge the old mans beard and hair were as white as snowthe former descending almost to his girdle so were the thick overhanging brows that shaded his still piercing eyes his forehead was high bald and ploughed by innumerable wrinkles his countenance despite its deathlike paleness had a noble and majestic cast and his figure though worn to the bone by a life of the severest study and bent by the weight of years must have been once lofty and commanding his dress consisted of a doublet and hose of sadcoloured cloth over which he wore a loose gown of black silk his head was covered by a square black cap from beneath which his silver locks strayed over his shoulders known by the name of doctor lamb and addicted to alchemical and philosophical pursuits this venerable personage was esteemed by the vulgar as little better than a wizard strange tales were reported and believed of him amongst others it was said that he possessed a familiar because he chanced to employ a deformed crackbrained dwarf who assisted him in his operations and whom he appropriately enough denominated flapdragon doctor lambs gaze was fixed intently upon the heavens and he seamed to be noting the position of the moon with reference to some particular star after remaining in this posture for a few minutes he was about to retire when a loud crash arrested him and he turned to see whence it proceeded immediately before him stood the southwark gatewaya square stone building with a round embattled turret at each corner and a flat leaden roof planted with a forest of poles fifteen or sixteen feet high garnished with human heads to his surprise the doctor perceived that two of these poles had just been overthrown by a tall man who was in the act of stripping them of their grisly burdens having accomplished his object the mysterious plunderer thrust his spoil into a leathern bag with which he was provided tied its mouth and was about to take his departure by means of a ropeladder attached to the battlements when his retreat was suddenly cut off by the gatekeeper armed with a halberd and bearing a lantern who issued from a door opening upon the leads the baffled marauder looked round and remarking the open window at which doctor lamb was stationed hurled the sack and its contents through it he then tried to gain the ladder but was intercepted by the gatekeeper who dealt him a severe blow on the head with his halberd the plunderer uttered a loud cry and attempted to draw his sword but before he could do so he received a thrust in the side from his opponent he then fell and the gatekeeper would have repeated the blow if the doctor had not called to him to desist do not kill him good baldred he cried the attempt may not be so criminal as it appears doubtless the mutilated remains which the poor wretch has attempted to carry off are those of his kindred and horror at their exposure must have led him to commit the offence it may be doctor replied baldred and if so i shall be sorry i have hurt him but i am responsible for the safe custody of these traitorous relics and it is as much as my own head is worth to permit their removal i know it replied doctor lamb and you are fully justified in what you have done it may throw some light upon the matter to know whose miserable remains have been disturbed they were the heads of two rank papists replied baldred who were decapitated on tower hill on saint nicholass day three weeks ago for conspiring against the queen but their names demanded the doctor how were they called they were father and son replied baldredsir simon darcy and master reginald darcy perchance they were known to your worship too welltoo well replied doctor lamb in a voice of emotion that startled his hearer they were near kinsmen of mine own what is he like who has made this strange attempt of a verity a fair youth replied baldred holding down the lantern heaven grant i have not wounded him to the death no his heart still beats ha here are his tablets he added taking a small book from his doublet these may give the information you seek you were right in your conjecture doctor the name herein inscribed is the same as that borne by the othersauriol darcy i see it all cried lamb it was a pious and praiseworthy deed bring the unfortunate youth to my dwelling baldred and you shall be well rewarded use despatch i pray you as the gatekeeper essayed to comply the wounded man groaned deeply as if in great pain fling me the weapon with which you smote him cried doctor lamb in accents of commiseration and i will anoint it with the powder of sympathy his anguish will be speedily abated i know your worship can accomplish wonders cried baldred throwing the halberd into the balcony i will do my part as gently as i can and as the alchemist took up the weapon and disappeared through the window the gatekeeper lifted the wounded man by the shoulders and conveyed him down a narrow winding staircase to a lower chamber though he proceeded carefully the sufferer was put to excruciating pain and when baldred placed him on a wooden bench and held a lamp towards him he perceived that his features were darkened and distorted i fear its all over with him murmured the gatekeeper i shall have a dead body to take to doctor lamb it would be a charity to knock him on the head rather than let him suffer thus the doctor passes for a cunning man but if he can cure this poor youth without seeing him by the help of his sympathetic ointment i shall begin to believe what some folks avouch that he has relations with the devil while baldred was ruminating in this manner a sudden and extraordinary change took place in the sufferer as if by magic the contraction of the muscles subsided the features assumed a wholesome hue and the respiration was no longer laborious baldred stared as if a miracle had been wrought now that the countenance of the youth had regained its original expression the gatekeeper could not help being struck by its extreme beauty the face was a perfect oval with regular and delicate features a short silken moustache covered the upper lip which was short and proud and a pointed beard terminated the chin the hair was black glossy and cut short so as to disclose a highly intellectual expanse of brow the youths figure was slight but admirably proportioned his attire consisted of a black satin doublet slashed with white hose of black silk and a short velvet mantle his eyes were still closed and it was difficult to say what effect they might give to the face when they lighted it up but notwithstanding its beauty it was impossible not to admit that a strange sinister and almost demoniacal expression pervaded the countenance all at once and with as much suddenness as his cure had been effected the young man started uttering a piercing cry and placed his hand to his side caitiff he cried fixing his blazing eyes on the gatekeeper why do you torture me thus finish me at onceoh and overcome by anguish he sank back again i have not touched you sir replied baldred i brought you here to succour you you will be easier anon doctor lamb must have wiped the halberd he added to himself another sudden change the pain fled from the sufferers countenance and he became easy as before what have you done to me he asked with a look of gratitude the torture of my wound has suddenly ceased and i feel as if a balm had been dropped into it let me remain in this state if you have any pityor despatch me for my late agony was almost insupportable you are cared for by one who has greater skill than any chirurgeon in london replied baldred if i can manage to transport you to his lodgings he will speedily heal your wounds do not delay then replied auriol faintly for though i am free from pain i feel that my life is ebbing fast away press this handkerchief to your side and lean on me said baldred doctor lambs dwelling is but a step from the gatewayin fact the first house on the bridge by the way the doctor declares he is your kinsman it is the first i ever heard of him replied auriol faintly but take me to him quickly or it will be too late in another moment they were at the doctors door baldred tapped against it and the summons was instantly answered by a diminutive personage clad in a jerkin of coarse grey serge and having a leathern apron tied round his waist this was flapdragon bleareyed smokebegrimed lanternjawed the poor dwarf seemed as if his whole life had been spent over the furnace and so in fact it had been he had become little better than a pair of human bellows in his hand he held the halberd with which auriol had been wounded so you have been playing the leech flapdragon eh cried baldred ay marry have i replied the dwarf with a wild grin and displaying a wolfish set of teeth my master ordered me to smear the halberd with the sympathetic ointment i obeyed him rubbed the steel point first on one side then on the other next wiped it and then smeared it again whereby you put the patient to exquisite pain replied baldred but help me to transport him to the laboratory i know not if the doctor will care to be disturbed said flapdragon he is busily engaged on a grand operation i will take the risk on myself said baldred the youth will die if he remains here see he has fainted already thus urged the dwarf laid down the halberd and between the two auriol was speedily conveyed up a wide oaken staircase to the laboratory doctor lamb was plying the bellows at the furnace on which a large alembic was placed and he was so engrossed by his task that he scarcely noticed the entrance of the others place the youth on the ground and rear his head against the chair he cried hastily to the dwarf bathe his brows with the decoction in that crucible i will attend to him anon come to me on the morrow baldred and i will repay thee for thy trouble i am busy now these relics doctor cried the gatekeeper glancing at the bag which was lying on the ground and from which a bald head protrudedi ought to take them back with me heed them notthey will be safe in my keeping cried doctor lamb impatiently tomorrowtomorrow casting a furtive glance round the laboratory and shrugging his shoulders baldred departed and flapdragon having bathed the sufferers temples with the decoction in obedience to his masters injunctions turned to inquire what he should do next begone cried the doctor so fiercely that the dwarf darted out of the room clapping the door after him doctor lamb then applied himself to his task with renewed ardour and in a few seconds became wholly insensible of the presence of a stranger revived by the stimulant auriol presently opened his eyes and gazing round the room thought he must be dreaming so strange and fantastical did all appear the floor was covered with the implements used by the adeptboltheads crucibles cucurbites and retorts scattered about without any attempt at arrangement in one corner was a large terrestrial sphere near it was an astrolabe and near that a heap of disused glass vessels on the other side lay a black mysteriouslooking book fastened with brazen clasps around it were a rams horn a pair of forceps a roll of parchment a pestle and mortar and a large plate of copper graven with the mysterious symbols of the isaical table near this was the leathern bag containing the two decapitated heads one of which had burst forth on a table at the farther end of the room stood a large open volume with parchment leaves covered with cabalistical characters referring to the names of spirits near it were two parchment scrolls written in letters respectively denominated by the chaldaic sages the malachim and the passing of the river one of these scrolls was kept in its place by a skull an ancient and grotesquelooking brass lamp with two snakeheaded burners lighted the room from the ceiling depended a huge scaly seamonster with outspread fins open jaws garnished with tremendous teeth and great goggling eyes near it hung a celestial sphere the chimneypiece which was curiously carved and projected far into the room was laden with various implements of hermetic science above it were hung dried bats and flittermice interspersed with the skulls of birds and apes attached to the chimneypiece was a horary sculptured in stone near which hung a large starfish the fireplace was occupied by the furnace on which as has been stated was placed an alembic communicating by means of a long serpentine pipe with a receiver within the room were two skeletons one of which placed behind a curtain in the deep embrasure of the window where its polished bones glistened in the white moonlight had a horrible effect the other enjoyed more comfortable quarters near the chimney its fleshless feet dangling down in the smoke arising from the furnace doctor lamb meanwhile steadily pursued his task though he ever and anon paused to fling certain roots and drugs upon the charcoal as he did this variouscoloured flames broke forthnow blue now green now bloodred tinged by these fires the different objects in the chamber seemed to take other forms and to become instinct with animation the gourdshaped cucurbites were transformed into great bloated toads bursting with venom the longnecked boltheads became monstrous serpents the wormlike pipes turned into adders the alembics looked like plumed helmets the characters on the isaical table and those on the parchments seemed traced in fire and to be ever changing the seamonster bellowed and roared and flapping his fins tried to burst from his hook the skeletons wagged their jaws and raised their fleshless fingers in mockery while blue lights burnt in their eyeless sockets the bellows became a prodigious bat fanning the fire with its wings and the old alchemist assumed the appearance of the archfiend presiding over a witches sabbath auriols brain reeled and he pressed his hand to his eyes to exclude these phantasms from his sight but even thus they pursued him and he imagined he could hear the infernal riot going on around him suddenly he was roused by a loud joyful cry and uncovering his eyes he beheld doctor lamb pouring the contents of the matrassa bright transparent liquidinto a small phial having carefully secured the bottle with a glass stopper the old man held it towards the light and gazed at it with rapture at length he exclaimed aloudat length the great work is achieved with the birth of the century now expiring i first saw light and the draught i hold in my hand shall enable me to see the opening of centuries and centuries to come composed of the lunar stones the solar stones and the mercurial stonesprepared according to the instructions of the rabbi ben luccanamely by the separation of the pure from the impure the volatilisation of the fixed and the fixing of the volatilethis elixir shall renew my youth like that of the eagle and give me length of days greater than any patriarch ever enjoyed while thus speaking he held up the sparkling liquid and gazed at it like a persian worshipping the sun to live for ever he cried after a pauseto escape the jaws of death just when they are opening to devour meto be free from all accidentstis a glorious thought ha i bethink me the rabbi said there was one peril against which the elixir could not guard meone vulnerable point by which like the heel of achilles death might reach me what is itwhere can it lie and he relapsed into deep thought this uncertainty will poison all my happiness he continued i shall live in constant dread as of an invisible enemy but no matter perpetual lifeperpetual youthwhat more need be desired what more indeed cried auriol ha exclaimed the doctor suddenly recollecting the wounded man and concealing the phial beneath his gown your caution is vain doctor said auriol i have heard what you have uttered you fancy you have discovered the elixir vitae fancy i have discovered it cried doctor lamb the matter is past all doubt i am the possessor of the wondrous secret which the greatest philosophers of all ages have sought to discoverthe miraculous preservative of the body against decay the man who brought me hither told me you were my kinsman said auriol is it so it is replied the doctor and you shall now learn the connection that subsists between us look at that ghastly relic he added pointing to the head protruding from the bag that was once my son simon his sons head is within the sackyour fathers headso that four generations are brought together gracious heaven exclaimed the young man raising himself on his elbow you then are my greatgrandsire my father supposed you had died in his infancy an old tale runs in the family that you were charged with sorcery and fled to avoid the stake it is true that i fled and took the name i bear at present replied the old man but i need scarcely say that the charge brought against me was false i have devoted myself to abstrusest science have held commune with the stars and have wrested the most hidden secrets from naturebut that is all two crimes alone have stained my soul but both i trust have been expiated by repentance were they deeds of blood asked auriol one was so replied darcy with a shudder it was a cowardly and treacherous deed aggravated by the basest ingratitude listen and you shall hear how it chanced a roman rabbi named ben lucca skilled in hermetic science came to this city his fame reached me and i sought him out offering myself as his disciple for months i remained with him in his laboratoryworking at the furnace and poring over mystic lore one night he showed me that volume and pointing to a page within it said those characters contain the secret of confecting the elixir of life i will now explain them to you and afterwards we will proceed to the operation with this he unfolded the mystery but he bade me observe that the menstruum was defective on one point wherefore he said there will still be peril from some hidden cause oh with what greediness i drank in his words how i gazed at the mystic characters as he explained their import what visions floated before me of perpetual youth and enjoyment at that moment a demon whispered in my ear this secret must be thine own no one else must possess it ha exclaimed auriol starting the evil thought was no sooner conceived than acted upon pursued darcy instantly drawing my poniard i plunged it to the rabbis heart but mark what followed his blood fell upon the book and obliterated the characters nor could i by any effort of memory recall the composition of the elixir when did you regain the secret asked auriol curiously tonight replied darcywithin this hour for nigh fifty years after that fatal night i have been making fruitless experiments a film of blood has obscured my mental sight i have proceeded by calcitration solution putrefactionhave produced the oils which will fix crude mercury and convert all bodies into sol and luna but i have ever failed in fermenting the stone into the true elixir tonight it came into my head to wash the bloodstained page containing the secret with a subtle liquid i did so and doubting the efficacy of the experiment left it to work while i went forth to breathe the air at my window my eyes were cast upwards and i was struck with the malignant aspect of my star how to reconcile this with the good fortune which has just befallen me i know notbut so it was at this juncture your rash but pious attempt occurred having discovered our relationship and enjoined the gatekeeper to bring you hither i returned to my old laboratory on glancing towards the mystic volume what was my surprise to see the page free from blood auriol uttered a slight exclamation and gazed at the book with superstitious awe the sight was so surprising that i dropped the sack i had brought with me pursued darcy fearful of again losing the secret i nerved myself to the task and placing fuel on the fire dismissed my attendant with brief injunctions relative to you i then set to work how i have succeeded you perceive i hold in my hand the treasure i have so long soughtso eagerly coveted the whole worlds wealth should not purchase it from me auriol gazed earnestly at his aged relative but he said nothing in a few moments i shall be as full of vigour and activity as yourself continued darcy we shall be no longer the greatgrandsire and his descendant but friendscompanionsequalsequals in age strength activity beauty fortunefor youth is fortuneha ha methinks i am already young again you spoke of two crimes with which your conscience was burdened remarked auriol you have mentioned but one the other was not so foul as that i have described replied darcy in an altered tone inasmuch as it was unintentional and occasioned by no base motive my wife your ancestress was a most lovely woman and so passionately was i enamoured of her that i tried by every art to heighten and preserve her beauty i fed her upon the flesh of capons nourished with vipers caused her to steep her lovely limbs in baths distilled from roses and violets and had recourse to the most potent cosmetics at last i prepared a draught from poisonsyes poisonsthe effect of which i imagined would be wondrous she drank it and expired horribly disfigured conceive my despair at beholding the fair image of my idolatry destroyeddefaced by my hand in my frenzy i should have laid violent hands upon myself if i had not been restrained love may again rule my heartbeauty may again dazzle my eyes but i shall never more feel the passion i entertained for my lost amicenever more behold charms equal to hers and he pressed his hand to his face the mistake you then committed should serve as a warning said auriol what if it be poison you have now confected try a few drops of it on some animal nono it is the true elixir replied darcy not a drop must be wasted you will witness its effect anon like the snake i shall cast my slough and come forth younger than i was at twenty meantime i beseech you to render me some assistance groaned auriol or while you are preparing for immortality i shall expire before your eyes be not afraid replied darcy you shall take no harm i will care for you presently and i understand leechcraft so well that i will answer for your speedy and perfect recovery drink then to it cried auriol i know not what stays my hand said the old man raising the phial but now that immortality is in my reach i dare not grasp it give me the potion then cried auriol not for worlds rejoined darcy hugging the phial to his breast no i will be young againrichhappy i will go forth into the worldi will bask in the smiles of beautyi will feast revel singlife shall be one perpetual round of enjoyment now for the trialha and as he raised the potion towards his lips a sudden pang shot across his heart what is this he cried staggering can death assail me when i am just about to enter upon perpetual life help me good grandson place the phial to my lips pour its contents down my throatquick quick illustration the elixir of long life i am too weak to stir groaned auriol you have delayed it too long oh heavens we shall both perish shrieked darcy vainly endeavouring to raise his palsied armperish with the blissful shore in view and he sank backwards and would have fallen to the ground if he had not caught at the terrestrial sphere for support help mehelp me he screamed fixing a glance of unutterable anguish on his relative it is worth the struggle cried auriol and by a great effort he raised himself and staggered towards the old man savedsaved shrieked darcy pour it down my throat an instant and all will be well think you i have done this for you cried auriol snatching the potion nono and supporting himself against the furnace he placed the phial to his lips and eagerly drained its contents the old man seemed paralysed by the action but kept his eye fixed upon the youth till he had drained the elixir to the last drop he then uttered a piercing cry threw up his arms and fell heavily backwards deaddead flashes of light passed before auriols eyes and strange noises smote his ears for a moment he was bewildered as with wine and laughed and sang discordantly like a madman every object reeled and danced around him the glass vessels and jars clashed their brittle sides together yet remained uninjured the furnace breathed forth flames and mephitic vapours the spiral worm of the alembic became red hot and seemed filled with molten lead the pipe of the bolthead ran blood the sphere of the earth rolled along the floor and rebounded from the wall as if impelled by a giant hand the skeletons grinned and gibbered so did the deathshead on the table so did the skulls against the chimney the monstrous seafish belched forth fire and smoke the bald decapitated head opened its eyes and fixed them with a stony glare on the young man while the dead alchemist shook his hand menacingly at him unable to bear these accumulated horrors auriol became for a short space insensible on recovering all was still the lights within the lamp had expired but the bright moonlight streaming through the window fell upon the rigid features of the unfortunate alchemist and on the cabalistic characters of the open volume beside him eager to test the effect of the elixir auriol put his hand to his side all traces of the wound were gone nor did he experience the slightest pain in any other part of his body on the contrary he seemed endowed with preternatural strength his breast dilated with rapture and he longed to expand his joy in active motion striding over the body of his aged relative he threw open the window as he did so joyous peals burst from surrounding churches announcing the arrival of the new year while listening to this clamour auriol gazed at the populous and picturesque city stretched out before him and bathed in the moonlight a hundred years hence he thought and scarcely one soul of the thousands within those houses will be living save myself a hundred years after that and their childrens children will be gone to the grave but i shall live onshall live through all changesall customsall time what revelations i shall then have to make if i should dare to disclose them as he ruminated thus the skeleton hanging near him was swayed by the wind and its bony fingers came in contact with his cheek a dread idea was suggested by the occurrence there is one peril to be avoided he thought one perilwhat is it pshaw i will think no more of it it may never arise i will be gone this place fevers me with this he left the laboratory and hastily descending the stairs at the foot of which he found flapdragon passed out of the house book the first ebba chapter i the ruined house in the vauxhall road late one night in the spring of two men issued from a low obscurely situated publichouse near millbank and shaped their course apparently in the direction of vauxhall bridge avoiding the footpath near the river they moved stealthily along the farther side of the road where the open ground offered them an easy means of flight in case such a course should be found expedient so far as it could be discerned by the glimpses of the moon which occasionally shone forth from a rack of heavy clouds the appearance of these personages was not much in their favour haggard features stamped deeply with the characters of crime and debauchery fierce restless eyes beards of several days growth wild unkempt heads of hair formed their chief personal characteristics while sordid and ragged clothes shoes without soles and old hats without crowns constituted the sum of their apparel one of them was tall and gaunt with large hands and feet but despite his meagreness he evidently possessed great strength the other was considerably shorter but broadshouldered bowlegged longarmed and altogether a most formidable ruffian this fellow had high cheekbones a long aquiline nose and a coarse mouth and chin in which the animal greatly predominated he had a stubby red beard with sandy hair white brows and eyelashes the countenance of the other was dark and repulsive and covered with blotches the result of habitual intemperance his eyes had a leering and malignant look a handkerchief spotted with blood and tied across his brow contrasted strongly with his matted black hair and increased his natural appearance of ferocity the shorter ruffian carried a mallet upon his shoulder and his companion concealed something beneath the breast of his coat which afterwards proved to be a dark lantern not a word passed between them but keeping a vigilant lookout they trudged on with quick shambling steps a few sounds arose from the banks of the river and there was now and then a plash in the water or a distant cry betokening some passing craft but generally all was profoundly still the quaint dutchlooking structures on the opposite bank the line of coalbarges and lighters moored to the strand the great timberyards and coalyards the brewhouses gasworks and waterworks could only be imperfectly discerned but the moonlight fell clear upon the ancient towers of lambeth palace and on the neighbouring church the same glimmer also ran like a silver belt across the stream and revealed the great stern fortresslike pile of the penitentiaryperhaps the most dismallooking structure in the whole metropolis the world of habitations beyond this melancholy prison was buried in darkness the two men however thought nothing of these things and saw nothing of them but on arriving within a couple of hundred yards of the bridge suddenly as if by previous concert quitted the road and leaping a rail ran across a field and plunged into a hollow formed by a dried pit where they came to a momentary halt you aint abeen agammonin me in this matter tinker observed the shorter individual the coves sure to come why you cant expect me to answer for another as i can for myself sandman replied the other but if his own words to be taken for it hes sartin to be there i heerd him say as plainly as im a speakin to youill be here tomorrow nightat the same hour and that wos one oclock said the sandman thereabouts replied the other and who did he say that to demanded the sandman to hisself i spose answered the tinker for as i told you afore i could see no one vith him do you think hes one of our perfession inquired the sandman bless you nothat he aint returned the tinker hes a reglar slapup svell thats no reason at all said the sandman many a firstrate svell practises in our line but he cant be in his right mind to come to such a ken as that and go on as you mentions as to that i cant say replied the tinker and it dont much matter as far as vere consarned devil a bit rejoined the sandman exceptyoure sure it wornt a sperrit tinker ive heerd say that this crib is haanted and though i dont fear no livin man a ghosts a different sort of customer vell youll find our svell raal flesh and blood you may depend upon it replied the tinker so come along and dont lets be frightenin ourselves vith ould vimens tales with this they emerged from the pit crossed the lower part of the field and entered a narrow thoroughfare skirted by a few detached houses which brought them into the vauxhall bridge road here they kept on the side of the street most in shadow and crossed over whenever they came to a lamp byandby two watchmen were seen advancing from belvoir terrace and as the guardians of the night drew near the ruffians crept into an alley to let them pass as soon as the coast was clear they ventured forth and quickening their pace came to a row of deserted and dilapidated houses this was their destination the range of habitations in question more than a dozen in number were in all probability what is vulgarly called in chancery and shared the fate of most property similarly circumstanced they were in a sad ruinous stateunroofed without windows and floors the bare walls were alone left standing and these were in a very tumbledown condition these neglected dwellings served as receptacles for old iron blocks of stone and wood and other ponderous matters the aspect of the whole place was so dismal and suspicious that it was generally avoided by passengers after nightfall skulking along the blank and dreary walls the tinker who was now a little in advance stopped before a door and pushing it open entered the dwelling his companion followed him the extraordinary and incongruous assemblage of objects which met the gaze of the sandman coupled with the deserted appearance of the place produced an effect upon his hardy but superstitious nature looking round he beheld huge millstones enormous waterwheels boilers of steamengines iron vats cylinders cranes iron pumps of the strangest fashion a gigantic pair of wooden scales old iron safes old boilers old gaspipes old waterpipes cracked old bells old birdcages old plates of iron old pulleys ropes and rusty chains huddled and heaped together in the most fantastic disorder in the midst of the chaotic mass frowned the bearded and colossal head of neptune which had once decorated the forepart of a manofwar above it on a sort of framework lay the prostrate statue of a nymph together with a bust of fox the nose of the latter being partly demolished and the eyes knocked in above these three garden divinities laid their heads amicably together on the left stood a tall grecian warrior minus the head and right hand the whole was surmounted by an immense ventilator stuck on the end of an iron rod ascending like a lightningconductor from the steamengine pump seen by the transient light of the moon the various objects above enumerated produced a strange effect upon the beholders imagination there was a mixture of the grotesque and terrible about them nor was the building itself devoid of a certain influence upon his mind the ragged brickwork overgrown with weeds took with him the semblance of a human face and seemed to keep a wary eye on what was going forward below a means of crossing from one side of the building to the other without descending into the vault beneath was afforded by a couple of planks though as the wall on the farther side was some feet higher than that near at hand and the planks were considerably bent the passage appeared hazardous glancing round for a moment the tinker leaped into the cellar and unmasking his lantern showed a sort of hidingplace between a bulk of timber and a boiler to which he invited his companion the sandman jumped down the ale i drank at the two fighting cocks has made me feel drowsy tinker he remarked stretching himself on the bulk ill just take a snooze vake me up if i snoreor ven our sperrit appears the tinker replied in the affirmative and the other had just become lost to consciousness when he received a nudge in the side and his companion whisperedhes here vherevhere demanded the sandman in some trepidation look up and youll see him replied the other slightly altering his position the sandman caught sight of a figure standing upon the planks above them it was that of a young man his hat was off and his features exposed to the full radiance of the moon looked deathly pale and though handsome had a strange sinister expression he was tall slight and wellproportioned and the general cut of his attire the tightlybuttoned singlebreasted coat together with the moustache upon his lip gave him a military air he seems avalkin in his sleep muttered the sandman hes aspeakin to some von unwisible hushhush whispered the other lets hear wot hes asayin why have you brought me here cried the young man in a voice so hollow that it thrilled his auditors what is to be done it makes my blood run cold to hear him whispered the sandman vot dye think he sees why do you not speak to me cried the young manwhy do you beckon me forward well i obey i will follow you and he moved slowly across the plank see hes agoin through that door cried the tinker lets foller him i dont half like it replied the sandman his teeth chattering with apprehension we shall see summat asll take avay our senses tut cried the tinker its only a sleepyvalker wot are you afeerd on with this he vaulted upon the planks and peeping cautiously out of the open door to which they led saw the object of his scrutiny enter the adjoining house through a broken window making a sign to the sandman who was close at his heels the tinker crept forward on all fours and on reaching the window raised himself just sufficiently to command the interior of the dwelling unfortunately for him the moon was at this moment obscured and he could distinguish nothing except the dusky outline of the various objects with which the place was filled and which were nearly of the same kind as those of the neighbouring habitation he listened intently but not the slightest sound reached his ears after some time spent in this way he began to fear the young man must have departed when all at once a piercing scream resounded through the dwelling some heavy matter was dislodged with a thundering crash and footsteps were heard approaching the window hastily retreating to their former hidingplace the tinker and his companion had scarcely regained it when the young man again appeared on the plank his demeanour had undergone a fearful change he staggered rather than walked and his countenance was even paler than before having crossed the plank he took his way along the top of the broken wall towards the door now then sandman cried the tinker nows your time the other nodded and grasping his mallet with a deadly and determined purpose sprang noiselessly upon the wall and overtook his intended victim just before he gained the door hearing a sound behind him the young man turned and only just became conscious of the presence of the sandman when the mallet descended upon his head and he fell crushed and senseless to the ground illustration the ruined house in the vauxhall road the vorks done cried the sandman to his companion who instantly came up with the dark lantern lets take him below and strip him agreed replied the tinker but first lets see wot he has got in his pockets vith all my art replied the sandman searching the clothes of the victim a readeri hope its well lined vell examine it below the body ud tell awkvard tales if any von should chance to peep in shall we strip him here said the tinker now the darkey shines on em you see what famous togs the cull has on do you vant to have us scragged fool cried the sandman springing into the vault hoist him down here with this he placed the wounded mans legs over his own shoulders and aided by his comrade was in the act of heaving down the body when the streetdoor suddenly flew open and a stout individual attended by a couple of watchmen appeared at it there the villains are shouted the newcomer they have been murderin a gentleman seize emseize em and as he spoke he discharged a pistol the ball from which whistled past the ears of the tinker without waiting for another salute of the same kind which might possibly be nearer its mark the ruffian kicked the lantern into the vault and sprang after the sandman who had already disappeared acquainted with the intricacies of the place the tinker guided his companion through a hole into an adjoining vault whence they scaled a wall got into the next house and passing through an open window made good their retreat while the watchmen were vainly searching for them under every bulk and piece of iron here watchmen cried the stout individual who had acted as leader never mind the villains just now but help me to convey this poor young gentleman to my house where proper assistance can be rendered him he still breathes but he has received a terrible blow on the head i hope his skull aint broken it is to be hoped it aint mr thorneycroft replied the foremost watchman but them was two desperate characters as ever i see and capable of any hatterosity what a frightful scream i heard to be sure cried mr thorneycroft i was certain somethin dreadful was goin on it was fortunate i wasnt gone to bed and still more fortunate you happened to be comin up at the time but we mustnt stand chatterin here bring the poor young gentleman along preceded by mr thorneycroft the watchmen carried the wounded man across the road towards a small house the door of which was held open by a female servant with a candle in her hand the poor woman uttered a cry of horror as the body was brought in dont be cryin out in that way peggy cried mr thorneycroft but go and get me some brandy here watchmen lay the poor young gentleman down on the sofathere gently gently and now one of you run to wheeler street and fetch mr howell the surgeon less noise peggyless noise or youll waken miss ebba and i wouldnt have her disturbed for the world with this he snatched the bottle of brandy from the maid filled a wineglass with the spirit and poured it down the throat of the wounded man a stifling sound followed and after struggling violently for respiration for a few seconds the patient opened his eyes chapter ii the dogfancier the rookery who that has passed saint giless on the way to the city or coming from it but has caught a glimpse through some narrow opening of its squalid habitations and wretched and ruffianly occupants who but must have been struck with amazement that such a huge receptacle of vice and crime should be allowed to exist in the very heart of the metropolis like an ulcerated spot capable of tainting the whole system of late the progress of improvement has caused its removal but whether any less cogent motive would have abated the nuisance may be questioned for years the evil was felt and complained of but no effort was made to remedy it or to cleanse these worse than augean stables as the place is now partially if not altogether swept away and a wide and airy street passes through the midst of its foul recesses a slight sketch may be given of its former appearance entering a narrow street guarded by posts and crossbars a few steps from the crowded thoroughfare brought you into a frightful region the refuge it was easy to perceive of half the lawless characters infesting the metropolis the coarsest ribaldry assailed your ears and noisome odours afflicted your sense of smell as you advanced picking your way through kennels flowing with filth or over putrescent heaps of rubbish and oystershells all the repulsive and hideous features of the place were displayed before you there was something savagely picturesque in the aspect of the place but its features were too loathsome to be regarded with any other feeling than disgust the houses looked as sordid and as thickly crusted with the leprosy of vice as their tenants horrible habitations they were in truth many of them were without windows and where the frames were left brown paper or tin supplied the place of glass some even wanted doors and no effort was made to conceal the squalor within on the contrary it seemed to be intruded on observation miserable rooms almost destitute of furniture floors and walls caked with dirt or decked with coarse flaring prints shameless and abandonedlooking women children without shoes and stockings and with scarcely a rag to their backs these were the chief objects that met the view of men few were visiblethe majority being out on business it is to be presumed but where a solitary straggler was seen his sinister looks and mean attire were in perfect keeping with the spot so thickly inhabited were these wretched dwellings that every chamber from garret to cellar swarmed with inmates as to the cellars they looked like dismal caverns which a wild beast would shun clotheslines were hung from house to house festooned with every kind of garment out of the main street branched several alleys and passages all displaying the same degree of misery or if possible worse and teeming with occupants personal security however forbade any attempt to track these labyrinths but imagination after the specimen afforded could easily picture them it was impossible to move a step without insult or annoyance every human being seemed brutalised and degraded and the women appeared utterly lost to decency and made the street ring with their cries their quarrels and their imprecations it was a positive relief to escape from this hotbed of crime to the world without and breathe a purer atmosphere such being the aspect of the rookery in the daytime what must it have been when crowded with its denizens at night yet at such an hour it will now be necessary to enter its penetralia after escaping from the ruined house in the vauxhall road the two ruffians shaped their course towards saint giless running the greater part of the way and reaching the broadway just as the church clock struck two darting into a narrow alley and heedless of any obstructions they encountered in their path they entered a somewhat wider crossstreet which they pursued for a short distance and then struck into an entry at the bottom of which was a swingdoor that admitted them into a small court where they found a dwarfish person wrapped in a tattered watchmans greatcoat seated on a stool with a horn lantern in his hand and a cutty in his mouth the glow of which lighted up his hard withered features this was the deputyporter of the lodginghouse they were about to enter addressing him by the name of old parr the ruffians passed on and lifting the latch of another door entered a sort of kitchen at the farther end of which blazed a cheerful fire with a large copper kettle boiling upon it on one side of the room was a deal table round which several men of sinister aspect and sordid attire were collected playing at cards a smaller table of the same material stood near the fire and opposite it was a staircase leading to the upper rooms the place was dingy and dirty in the extreme the floors could not have been scoured for years and the walls were begrimed with filth in one corner with his head resting on a heap of coals and coke lay a boy almost as black as a chimneysweep fast asleep he was the waiter the principal light was afforded by a candle stuck against the wall with a tin reflector behind it before the fire with his back turned towards it stood a noticeable individual clad in a velveteen jacket with ivory buttons a striped waistcoat drab knees a faded black silk neckcloth tied in a great bow and a pair of ancient wellingtons ascending halfway up his legs which looked disproportionately thin when compared with the upper part of his square robustious and somewhat pursy frame his face was broad jolly and goodhumoured with a bottleshaped nose fleshy lips and light grey eyes glistening with cunning and roguery his hair which dangled in long flakes over his ears and neck was of a dunnish red as were also his whiskers and beard a superannuated white castor with a black hatband round it was cocked knowingly on one side of his head and gave him a flashy and sporting look his particular vocation was made manifest by the number of dogs he had about him a beautiful blackandtan spaniel of charles the seconds breed popped its short snubby nose and long silken ears out of each coatpocket a pug was thrust into his breast and he carried an exquisite blenheim under either arm at his feet reposed an isle of skye terrier and a partly cropped french poodle of snowy whiteness with a red worsted riband round his throat this person it need scarcely be said was a dogfancier or in other words a dealer in and a stealer of dogs as well as a practiser of all the tricks connected with that nefarious trade his selfsatisfied air made it evident he thought himself a smart clever fellowand adroit and knavish he was no doubtwhile his droll plausible and rather winning manners helped him materially to impose upon his customers his real name was taylor but he was known among his companions by the appellation of ginger on the entrance of the sandman and the tinker he nodded familiarly to them and with a sly look inquiredvell my artieswot luck oh pretty middlin replied the sandman gruffly and seating himself at the table near the fire he kicked up the lad who was lying fast asleep on the coals and bade him fetch a pot of halfandhalf the tinker took a place beside him and they waited in silence the arrival of the liquor which when it came was disposed of at a couple of pulls while mr ginger seeing they were engaged sauntered towards the cardtable attended by his fourfooted companions and now said the sandman unable to control his curiosity longer and taking out his pocketbook well see what fortun has given us illustration the dogfancier so saying he unclasped the pocketbook while the tinker bent over him in eager curiosity but their search for money was fruitless not a single banknote was forthcoming there were several memoranda and slips of paper a few cards and an almanac for the yearthat was all it was a great disappointment so weve had all this trouble for nuffin and nearly got shot into the bargain cried the sandman slapping down the book on the table with an oath i vish id never undertaken the job dont lets give it up in sich an urry replied the tinker summat may be made on it yet lets look over them papers look em over yourself rejoined the sandman pushing the book towards him ive done wi em here lazybones bring two glasses o rumandwaterstiff dye hear while the sleepy youth bestirred himself to obey these injunctions the tinker read over every memorandum in the pocketbook and then proceeded carefully to examine the different scraps of paper with which it was filled not content with one perusal he looked them all over again and then began to rub his hands with great glee wots the matter cried the sandman who had lighted a cutty and was quietly smoking it wots the row eh vy this is it replied the tinker unable to contain his satisfaction theres secrets contained in this here pocketbook asll be worth a hundred pound and better to us we hant had our trouble for nuffin glad to hear it said the sandman looking hard at him wot kind o secrets are they vy hangin secrets replied the tinker with mysterious emphasis he seems to be a terrible chap and to have committed murder wholesale wholesale echoed the sandman removing the pipe from his lips that sounds awful but what a precious donkey he must be to register his crimes i that way he didnt expect the pocketbook to fall into our hands said the tinker werry likely not replied the sandman but somebody else might see it i repeat he must be a fool spose we wos to make a entry of everythin we does wot a nice balance thered be agin us ven our accounts comed to be wound up ourn is a different busness altogether replied the tinker this seems a werry mysterious sort o person wot age should you take him to be vy fiveantwenty at the outside replied the sandman fiveansixty ud be nearer the mark replied the tinker theres dates as far back as that fiveansixty devils cried the sandman there must be some mistake i the reckonin there no its all clear an reglar rejoined the other and that doesnt seem to be the end of it neither i looked over the papers twice and one dated refers to some other dokiments they must relate to his granddad then said the sandman its impossible they can refer to him but i tell ee they do refer to him said the tinker somewhat angrily at having his assertion denied at least if his own words to be taken anyhow these papers is waluable to us if no one else believes in em its clear he believes in em hisself and will be glad to buy em from us thats a view o the case worthy of an old bailey lawyer replied the sandman wots the gemmans name the name on the card is auriol darcy replied the tinker any address asked the sandman the tinker shook his head thats unlucky agin said the sandman aint there no sort o clue none votiver as i can perceive said the tinker vy zounds then vere jist vere ve started from cried the sandman but it dont matter theres not much chance o makin a bargin vith him the crack o the skull i gave him has done his busness nuffin o the kind replied the tinker he alvays recovers from every kind of accident alvays recovers exclaimed the sandman in amazement wot a constitootion he must have surprisin replied the tinker he never suffers from injuriesat least not much never grows old and never expects to die for he mentions wot he intends doin a hundred years hence oh hes a lunattic exclaimed the sandman a downright lunattic and that accounts for his wisitin that ere ruined house and afancyin he heerd some one talk to him hes mad depend upon it that is if i aint cured him im of a different opinion said the tinker and so am i said mr ginger who had approached unobserved and overheard the greater part of their discourse vy vot can you know about it ginger said the sandman looking up evidently rather annoyed i only know this replied ginger that youve got a good case and if youll let me into it ill engage to make summat of it vell im agreeable said the sandman and so am i added the tinker not that i pays much regard to wot youve bin a readin in his papers purused ginger the gemmans evidently halfcracked if he aint cracked altogetherbut hes jist the person to work upon he fancies hisself immortaleh exactly so replied the tinker and he also fancies hes committed a lot o murders perused ginger a desperate lot replied the tinker then hell be glad to buy those papers at any price said ginger vell deal vith him in regard to the pocketbook as i deals vith regard to a dogask a price for its restitootion we must find him out first said the sandman theres no difficulty in that rejoined ginger you must be constantly on the lookout youre sure to meet him some time or other thats true replied the sandman and theres no fear of his knowin us for the werry moment he looked round i knocked him on the head arter all said the tinker theres no branch o the perfession so safe as yours ginger the law is favourable to you and the beaks is afeerd to touch you i think i shall turn dogfancier myself its a good business replied ginger but it requires a hedication as i wos sayin we gets a high price sometimes for restorin a favourite especially ven veve a softhearted lady to deal vith theres some vimen as fond o dogs as o their own childer and ven ve gets one o their precious pets ve makes em ransom it as the brigands you see at the adelphi or the surrey sarves their prisoners threatenin to send first an ear and then a paw or a tail and so on ill tell you wot happened tother day there wos a ladya miss viteas was desperate fond of her dog it wos a ugly warmint but no matter for thatthe creater had gained her heart vell she lost it and somehow or other i found it she vos in great trouble and a friend o mine calls to say she can have the dog agin but she must pay eight pound for it she thinks this dear and a friend o her own adwises her to wait sayin better terms will be offered so i sends vord by my friend that if she dont come down at once the poor animals throat vill be cut that werry night hahaha laughed the others vell she sent four pound and i put up with it pursued ginger but about a month arterwards she loses her favourite agin and strange to say i finds it the same game is played over agin and she comes down with another four pound but she takes care this time that i shant repeat the trick for no sooner does she obtain persession of her favourite than she embarks in the steamer for france in the hope of keeping her dog safe there oh miss bailey unfortinate miss baileyfolderiddletolollolunfortinate miss bailey sang the tinker but theres dogfanciers in france aint there asked the sandman lor bless ee yes replied ginger theres as many fanciers i france as here vy ve drives a smartish trade wi them through them foreign steamers theres scarcely a steamer as leaves the port o london but takes out a cargo o dogs ve sells em to the stewards stokers and sailorscheapand no questins asked they goes to ostend antverp rotterdam hamburg and sometimes to havre theres a mounseer coqquilu as comes over to buy dogs and ve takes em to him at a house near billinsgit market then youre alvays sure o a ready market somehow observed the sandman sartin replied ginger cos the laws so kind to us vy bless you a perliceman cant detain us even if he knows veve a stolen dog in our persession and ve svears its our own and yet hed stop you in a minnit if he seed you with a suspiciouslookin bundle under your arm now jist to show you the difference atwixt the two perfessionsi steals a dogwalue maybe fifty pound or praps more even if im catched i the fact i may get fined twenty pound or have six months imprisonment vile if you steals an old fogle walue three fardens youll get seven years abroad to a dead certainty that seems hard on us observed the sandman reflectively its the law exclaimed ginger triumphantly now ve generally escapes by payin the fine cos our pals goes and steals more dogs to raise the money ve alvays stands by each other theres a reglar horganisation among us so ve can alvays bring vitnesses to svear vot ve likes and ve so puzzles the beaks that the case gets dismissed and the constable says vich party shall i give the dog to your vorship upon vich the beak replies ashakin of his vise noddle give it to the person in whose persession it was found i have nuffin more to do vith it in course the dog is delivered up to us the law seems made for dogfanciers remarked the tinker wot dye think o this pursued ginger i wos astandin at the corner o grays inn lane vith some o my pals near a coachstand ven a lady passes by vith this here dogan a beauty it is a real longeared charleya follerin of her vell the moment i spies it i unties my apron whips up the dog and covers it up in a trice vell the lady sees me an gives me in charge to a perliceman but that sinifies nuffin i brings six vitnesses to svear the dog vos mine and i actually had it since it vos a blind little puppy and wots more i brings its mother and that settles the pint so in course im discharged the dog is given up to me and the lady goes avay lamentin i then plays the amiable an offers to sell it her for twenty guineas seein as how she had taken a fancy to it but she vont bite so if i dont sell it next week i shall send it to mounseer coqquilu the only vay you can go wrong is to steal a dog wi a collar on for if you do you may get seven years transportation for a bit o leather and a brass plate vorth a shillin vile the animal though vorth a hundred pound cant hurt you theres law againha ha dogfanciers law laughed the sandman some of the fancy is given to cruelty pursued ginger and crops a dogs ears or pulls out his teeth to disguise him but im too fond o the animal for that i may frighten old ladies sometimes as i told you afore but i never seriously hurts their pets nor did i ever kill a dog for his skin as some on em does and youre always sure o gettin a dog if you vants it i spose inquired the tinker alvays replied ginger no mans dog is safe i dont care how hes kept vere sure to have him at last ve feels our vay with the sarvents and finds out from them the walley the master or missis sets on the dog and soon after that the animals gone vith a bit o liver prepared in my particlar vay i can tame the fiercest dog as ever barked take him off his chain an bring him arter me at a gallop and do respectable parties ever buy dogs knowin theyre stolen inquired the tinker ay to be sure replied ginger sometimes firstrate nobs they put us up to it themselves theyll say ive jist left my lord soandsos and there i seed a couple o the finest pointers i ever clapped eyes on i vant you to get me jist sich another couple vell ve understands in a minnit an in doo time the identicle dogs finds their vay to our customer oh thats how its done remarked the sandman yes thats the vay replied ginger sometimes a partyll vant a couple o dogs for the shootin season and then ve asks vich vay are you agoininto surrey or kent and accordin as the answer is given ve arranges our plans vell yourn appears a profitable and safe employment i must say remarked the sandman perfectly so replied ginger nothin can touch us till dogs is declared by statute to be property and stealin em a misdemeanour and that wont occur in my time lets hope not rejoined the other two to come back to the pint from vich we started said the tinker our gemmans case is not so surprisin as it at first appears there are some persons as believe they never will dieand i myself am of the same opinion theres our old deputy herehim as ve calls old parrvy he declares he lived in queen besss time recollects king charles bein beheaded perfectly vell and remembers the great fire o london as if it only occurred yesterday walker exclaimed ginger putting his finger to his nose you may larf but its true replied the tinker i recollect an old man tellin me that he knew the deputy sixty years ago and he looked jist the same then as nowneither older nor younger humph exclaimed ginger he dont look so old now thats the curousest part of it said the tinker he dont like to talk of his age unless you can get him i the humour but he once told me he didnt know why he lived so long unless it were owin to a potion hed swallowed vich his master who was a great conjurer in queen besss days had brewd pshaw exclaimed ginger i thought you too knowin a cove tinker to be gulled by such an old vifes story as that lets have the old fellow in and talk to him replied the tinker here lazybones he added rousing the sleeping youth go an tell old parr ve vants his company over a glass o rumanvater chapter iii the hand and the cloak a furious barking from mr gingers dogs shortly after the departure of the drowsy youth announced the approach of a grotesquelooking little personage whose shoulders barely reached to a level with the top of the table this was old parr the dwarfs head was much too large for his body as is mostly the case with undersized persons and was covered with a forest of rusty black hair protected by a strangely shaped sealskin cap his hands and feet were equally disproportioned to his frame and his arms were so long that he could touch his ankles while standing upright his spine was crookened and his head appeared buried in his breast the general character of his face seemed to appertain to the middle period of life but a closer inspection enabled the beholder to detect in it marks of extreme old age the nose was broad and flat like that of an ourangoutang the resemblance to which animal was heightened by a very long upper lip projecting jaws almost total absence of chin and a retreating forehead the little old mans complexion was dull and swarthy but his eyes were keen and sparkling his attire was as singular as his person having recently served as double to a famous demondwarf at the surrey theatre he had become possessed of a castoff pair of tawny tights an elastic shirt of the same material and complexion to the arms of which little green batlike wings were attached while a bloodred tunic with vandyke points was girded round his waist in this strange apparel his diminutive limbs were encased while additional warmth was afforded by the greatcoat already mentioned the tails of which swept the floor after him like a train having silenced his dogs with some difficulty mr ginger burst into a roar of laughter excited by the little old mans grotesque appearance in which he was joined by the tinker but the sandman never relaxed a muscle of his sullen countenance their hilarity however was suddenly checked by an inquiry from the dwarf in a shrill odd tone whether they had sent for him only to laugh at him sartainly not deputy replied the tinker here lazybones glasses o rumanvater all round the drowsy youth bestirred himself to execute the command the spirit was brought water was procured from the boiling copper and the tinker handed his guest a smoking rummer accompanied with a polite request to make himself comfortable opposite the table at which the party were seated it has been said was a staircaseold and crazy and but imperfectly protected by a broken handrail midway up it stood a door equally dilapidated but secured by a chain and lock of which old parr as deputychamberlain kept the key beyond this point the staircase branched off on the right and a row of stout wooden banisters ranged like the feet of so many cattle was visible from beneath ultimately the staircase reached a small gallery if such a name can be applied to a narrow passage communicating with the bedrooms the doors of which as a matter of needful precaution were locked outside and as the windows were grated no one could leave his chamber without the knowledge of the landlord or his representative no lights were allowed in the bedrooms nor in the passage adjoining them conciliated by the tinkers offering old parr mounted the staircase and planting himself near the door took off his greatcoat and sat down upon it his impish garb being thus more fully displayed he looked so unearthly and extraordinary that the dogs began to howl fearfully and ginger had enough to do to quiet them silence being at length restored the tinker winking slyly at his companions opened the conversation i say deputy he observed veve bin havin a bit o a dispute vich you can settle for us well lets see squeaked the dwarf what is it vy its relative to your age rejoined the tinker ven wos you born its so long ago i cant recollect returned old parr rather sulkily you must ha seen some changes in your time resumed the tinker waiting till the little old man had made some progress with his grog i rayther think i havea few replied old parr whose tongue the generous liquid had loosened ive seen this great city of london pulled down and built up againif thats anything ive seen it grow and grow till it has reached its present size youll scarcely believe me when i tell you that i recollect this rookery of oursthis foul vagabond neighbourhoodan open country field with hedges round it and trees and a lovely spot it was broad saint giless at the time i speak of was a little country village consisting of a few straggling houses standing by the roadside and there wasnt a single habitation between it and convent garden for so the present market was once called while that garden which was fenced round with pales like a park extended from saint martins lane to drury house a great mansion situated on the easterly side of drury lane amid a grove of beautiful timber my eyes cried ginger with a prolonged whistle the place must be preciously transmogrified indeed if i were to describe the changes that have taken place in london since ive known it i might go on talking for a month pursued old parr the whole aspect of the place is altered the thames itself is unlike the thames of old its waters were once as clear and bright above london bridge as they are now at kew or richmond and its banks from whitefriars to scotland yard were edged with gardens and then the thousand gay wherries and gilded barges that covered its bosomall are goneall are gone those must ha been nice times for the jolly young vatermen vich at black friars wos used for to ply chanted the tinker but the steamers has put their noses out o joint true replied old parr and i for one am sorry for it remembering as i do what the river used to be when enlightened by gay craft and merry company i cant help wishing its waters less muddy and those ugly coalbarges lighters and steamers away london is a mighty city wonderful to behold and examine inexhaustible in its wealth and power but in point of beauty it is not to be compared with the city of queen besss days you should have seen the strand thena line of noblemens housesand as to lombard street and gracechurch street with their wealthy goldsmiths shopsbut i dont like to think of em vell im content vith lunnun as it is replied the tinker specially as there aint much chance o the ould city bein rewived not much replied the dwarf finishing his glass which was replenished at a sign from the tinker i spose my wenerable youve seen the king as bequeathed his name to these pretty creaters said ginger raising his coatpockets so as to exhibit the heads of the two little blackandtan spaniels what old rowley cried the dwarfoften i was page to his favourite mistress the duchess of cleveland and i have seen him a hundred times with a pack of dogs of that description at his heels old rowley wos a king arter my own art said ginger rising and lighting a pipe at the fire he loved the feminine specious as well as the canine specious can you tell us anythin more about him not now replied old parr ive seen so much and heard so much that my brain is quite addled my memory sometimes deserts me altogether and my past life appears like a dream imagine what my feelings must be to walk through streets still called by the old names but in other respects wholly changed oh if you could but have a glimpse of old london you would not be able to endure the modern city the very atmosphere was different from that which we now breathe charged with the smoke of myriads of seacoal fires and the old picturesque houses had a charm about them which the present habitations however commodious altogether want you talk like one o them smart chaps they calls and werry properly pennyaliars observed ginger but you make me long to ha lived i those times if you had lived in them you would have belonged to paris garden or the bullbaiting and bearbaiting houses in southwark replied old parr ive seen fellows just like you at each of those places strange though times and fashions change men continue the same i often meet a face that i can remember in james the firsts time but the old places are goneclean gone accordin to your own showin my wenerable friend you must ha lived uppards o two hundred and seventy year said ginger assuming a consequential manner now doorin all that time have you never felt inclined to kick the bucket not the least replied old parr my bodily health has been excellent but as i have just said my intellects are a little impaired not a little i should think replied ginger hemming significantly i dont know vether youre a deceivin of us or yourself my wenerable but von things quite clearyou cant have lived all that time its not in nater very well theni havent said old parr and he finished his rumandwater and set down the glass which was instantly filled again by the drowsy youth youve seen some picters o old lunnon and theyve haanted you in your dreams till youve begun to fancy you lived in those times said ginger very likely replied old parrvery likely there was something however in his manner calculated to pique the dogfanciers curiosity how comes it he said stretching out his legs and arranging his neckclothhow comes it if youve lived so long that you aint higher up in the stirrupsbetter off as folks say the dwarf made no reply but covering his face with his hands seemed a prey to deep emotion after a few moments pause ginger repeated the question if you wont believe what i tell you its useless to give an answer said old parr somewhat gruffly oh yes i believe you deputy observed the tinker and so does the sandman well then replied the dwarf ill tell you how it comes to pass fate has been against me ive had plenty of chances but i never could get on ive been in a hundred different walks of life but they always led down hill its my destiny thats hard rejoined the tinkerwerry hard but how dye account for livin so long he added winking as he spoke to the others ive already given you an explanation replied the dwarf av but its a curous story and i vants my friends to hear it said the tinker in a coaxing tone well then to oblige you ill go through it again rejoined the dwarf you must know i was for some time servant to doctor lamb an old alchemist who lived during the reign of good queen bess and who used to pass all his time in trying to find out the secret of changing lead and copper into gold ive known several indiwiduals as has found out that secret wenerable observed ginger and ve calls em smashers nowadaysnot halchemists doctor lambs object was actually to turn base metal into gold rejoined old parr in a tone of slight contempt but his chief aim was to produce the elixir of long life night and day he worked at the operationnight and day i laboured with him until at last we were both brought to the verge of the grave in our search after immortality one nighti remember it wellit was the last night of the sixteenth centurya young man severely wounded was brought to my masters dwelling on london bridge i helped to convey him to the laboratory where i left him with the doctor who was busy with his experiments my curiosity being aroused i listened at the door and though i could not distinguish much that passed inside i heard sufficient to convince me that doctor lamb had made the grand discovery and succeeded in distilling the elixir having learnt this i went downstairs wondering what would next ensue halfanhour elapsed and while the bells were ringing in the new year joyfully the young man whom i had assisted to carry upstairs and whom i supposed at deaths door marched down as firmly as if nothing had happened passed by me and disappeared before i could shake off my astonishment i saw at once he had drunk the elixir ahah exclaimed the tinker with a knowing glance at his companions who returned it with gestures of equal significance as soon as he was gone pursued the dwarf i flew to the laboratory and there extended on the floor i found the dead body of doctor lamb i debated with myself what to dowhether to pursue his murderer for such i accounted the young man but on reflection i thought the course useless i next looked round to see whether the precious elixir was gone on the table stood a phial from which a strong spirituous odour exhaled but it was empty i then turned my attention to a receiver connected by a worm with an alembic on the furnace on examining it i found it contained a small quantity of a bright transparent liquid which poured forth into a glass emitted precisely the same odour as the phial persuaded this must be the draught of immortality i raised it to my lips but apprehension lest it might be poison stayed my hand reassured however by the thought of the young mans miraculous recovery i quaffed the potion it was as if i had swallowed fire and at first i thought all was over with me i shrieked out but there was no one to heed my cries unless it were my dead master and two or three skeletons with which the walls were garnished and these in truth did seem to hear me for the dead corpse opened its glassy orbs and eyed me reproachfully the skeletons shook their fleshless arms and gibbered and the various strange objects with which the chamber was filled seemed to deride and menace me the terror occasioned by these fantasies combined with the potency of the draught took away my senses when i recovered i found all tranquil doctor lamb was lying stark and stiff at my feet with an expression of reproach on his fixed countenance and the skeletons were hanging quietly in their places convinced that i was proof against death i went forth but a curse went with me from that day to this i have lived but it has been in such poverty and distress that i had better far have died besides i am constantly haunted by visions of my old master he seems to hold converse with meto lead me into strange places exactly the case with the tother whispered the tinker to the sandman have you ever in the coorse o your long life met the young man as drank the lixir he inquired of the dwarf never do you happen to rekilect his name no it has quite escaped my memory answered old parr should you rekilect it if you heerd it asked the tinker perhaps i might returned the dwarf but i cant say wos it auriol darcy demanded the other that was the name cried old parr starting up in extreme surprise i heard doctor lamb call him so but how in the name of wonder do you come to know it veve got summat at last said the tinker with a selfapplauding glance at his friends how do you come to know it i say repeated the dwarf in extreme agitation never mind rejoined the tinker with a cunning look you see i does know some curous matters as veil as you my old file yoll be good evidence in case ve vishes to prove the fact agin him prove whatand against whom cried the dwarf one more questin and ive done pursued the tinker should you know this young man agin in case you chanced to come across him no doubt of it replied old parr his figure often flits before me in dreams shall ve let him into it said the tinker consulting his companions in a low tone ayay replied the sandman better vait a bit remarked ginger shaking his head dubiously theres no hurry no ve must decide at vonce said the tinker jist examine them papers he added handing the pocketbook to old parr and favour us vith your opinion on em the dwarf was about to unclasp the book committed to his charge when a hand was suddenly thrust through the banisters of the upper part of the staircase which as has been already stated was divided from the lower by the door a piece of heavy black drapery next descended like a cloud concealing all behind it except the hand with which the dwarf was suddenly seized by the nape of the neck lifted up in the air and notwithstanding his shrieks and struggles carried clean off great confusion attended his disappearance the dogs set up a prodigious barking and flew to the rescueone of the largest of them passing over the body of the drowsy waiter who had sought his customary couch upon the coals and rousing him from his slumbers while the tinker uttering a fierce imprecation upset his chair in his haste to catch hold of the dwarfs legs but the latter was already out of reach and the next moment had vanished entirely my eyes heres a pretty go cried ginger who with his back to the fire had witnessed the occurrence in openmouthed astonishment vy curse it if the wenerable aint ataken the pocketbook with him its my opinion the devil has flown avay with the old feller his time wos nearer at and than he expected devil or not ill have him back agin or at all events the pocketbook cried the tinker and dashing up the stairs he caught hold of the railing above and swinging himself up by a powerful effort passed through an opening occasioned by the removal of one of the banisters illustration the hand and the cloak groping along the gallery which was buried in profound darkness he shouted to the dwarf but received no answer to his vociferations neither could he discover any one though he felt on either side of the passage with outstretched hands the occupants of the different chambers alarmed by the noise called out to know what was going forward but being locked in their rooms they could render no assistance while the tinker was thus pursuing his search in the dark venting his rage and disappointment in the most dreadful imprecations the staircase door was opened by the landlord who had found the key in the greatcoat left behind by the dwarf with the landlord came the sandman and ginger the latter of whom was attended by all his dogs still barking furiously while the rear of the party was brought up by the drowsy waiter now wide awake with fright and carrying a candle but though every nook and corner of the place was visitedthough the attics were searched and all the windows examinednot a trace of the dwarf could be discovered nor any clue to his mysterious disappearance detected astonishment and alarm sat on every countenance what the devil can have become of him cried the landlord with a look of dismay ay thats the questin rejoined the tinker i begin to be of gingers opinion that the devil himself must have flown avay vith him no von else could ha taken a fancy to him i only saw a hand and a black cloak said the sandman i thought i seed a pair o hoofs cried the waiter and im quite sure i seed a pair o great glitterin eyes he added opening his own lacklustre orbs to their widest extent its a strange affair observed the landlord gravely its certain that no one has entered the house wearing a cloak such as you describe nor could any of the lodgers to my knowledge get out of their rooms it was old parrs business as you know to lock em up carefully for the night vell alls over vith him now said the tinker and vith our affair too im afeerd dont say die jist yet rejoined ginger the wenerables gone to be sure and the only thing he has left behind him barrin his topcoat is this here bit o paper vich dropped out o the pocketbook as he wos atakin flight and vich i picked from the floor it may be o some use to us but come lets go downstairs theres no good in stayin here any longer concurring in which sentiment they all descended to the lower room chapter iv the ironmerchants daughter a week had elapsed since auriol darcy was conveyed to the ironmerchants dwelling after the attack made upon him by the ruffians in the ruined house and though almost recovered from the serious injuries he had received he still remained the guest of his preserver it was a bright spring morning when a door leading to the yard in front of the house opened and a young girl bright and fresh as the mornings self issued from it a lovelier creature than ebba thorneycroft cannot be imagined her figure was perfectionslight tall and ravishingly proportioned with a slender waist little limbs and fairy feet that would have made the fortune of an operadancer her features were almost angelic in expression with an outline of the utmost delicacy and precisionnot cold classical regularitybut that softer and incomparably more lovely mould peculiar to our own clime ebbas countenance was a type of saxon beauty her complexion was pure white tinged with a slight bloom her eyes were of a serene summer blue arched over by brows some shades darker than the radiant tresses that fell on either cheek and were parted over a brow smoother than alabaster her attire was simple but tasteful and by its dark colour threw into relief the exceeding fairness of her skin ebbas first care was to feed her favourite linnet placed in a cage over the door having next patted the head of a huge bulldog who came out of his kennel to greet her and exchanged a few words with two men employed at a forge in the inner part of the building on the right she advanced farther into the yard this part of the premises being strewn with ironwork of every possible shape presented a very singular appearance and may merit some description there were heaps of rusty iron chains flung together like fishermens nets old iron areaguards iron kitchenfenders old grates safes piles of old iron bowls a large assortment of old iron pans and dishes a ditto of old ovens kettles without number sledgehammers anvils braziers chimneycowls and smokejacks stout upright posts supporting crossbeams on the top were placed at intervals on either side of the yard and these were decorated in the most artistic style with rattraps mantraps iron lanterns pulleys padlocks chains trivets triangles iron rods disused street lamps dismounted cannon and anchors attached to hooks in the crossbeam nearest the house hung a row of old horseshoes while from the centre depended a large rusty bell near the dogs kennel was a toolbox likewise garnished with horseshoes and containing pincers files hammers and other implements proper to the smith beyond this was an open doorway leading to the workshop where the two men before mentioned were busy at the forge though it was still early the road was astir with passengers and many waggons and carts laden with hay straw and vegetables were passing ebba however had been solely drawn forth by the beauty of the morning and she stopped for a moment at the street gate to breathe the balmy air as she inhaled the gentle breeze and felt the warm sunshine upon her cheek her thoughts wandered away into the green meadows in which she had strayed as a child and she longed to ramble amid them again perhaps she scarcely desired a solitary stroll but however this might be she was too much engrossed by the reverie to notice a tall man wrapped in a long black cloak who regarded her with the most fixed attention as he passed on the opposite side of the road proceeding to a short distance this personage crossed over and returned slowly towards the ironmerchants dwelling ebba then for the first time remarked him and was startled by his strange sinister appearance his features were handsome but so malignant and fierce in expression that they inspired only aversion a sardonic grin curled his thin lips and his short crisply curled hair ravenblack in hue contrasted forcibly and disagreeably with his cadaverous complexion an attraction like that of the snake seemed to reside in his dark blazing eyes for ebba trembled like a bird beneath their influence and could not remove her gaze from them a vague presentiment of coming ill smote her and she dreaded lest the mysterious being before her might be connected in some inexplicable way with her future destiny on his part the stranger was not insensible to the impression he had produced and suddenly halting he kept his eyes riveted on those of the girl who after remaining spellbound as it were for a few moments precipitately retreated towards the house just as she reached the door and was about to pass through it auriol came forth he was pale as if from recent suffering and bore his left arm in a sling you look agitated he said noticing ebbas uneasiness what has happened not much she replied a deep blush mantling her cheeks but i have been somewhat alarmed by the person near the gate indeed cried auriol darting forward where is he i see no one not a tall man wrapped in a long black cloak rejoined ebba following him cautiously ha cried auriol has he been here then you know the person i allude to she rejoined i know some one answering his description he replied with a forced smile once beheld the man i mean is not to be forgotten said ebba he has a countenance such as i never saw before if i could believe in the evil eye i should be sure he possessed it tis he there can be no doubt rejoined auriol in a sombre tone who and what is he then demanded ebba he is a messenger of ill replied auriol and i am thankful he is gone illustration the ironmerchants daughter are you quite sure of it she asked glancing timorously up and down the road but the mysterious individual could no longer be seen and so after exciting my curiosity in this manner you will not satisfy it she said i cannot rejoined auriol somewhat sternly nay then since you are so ungracious i shall go and prepare breakfast she replied my father must be down by this time stay cried auriol arresting her as she was about to pass through the door i wish to have a word with you ebba stopped and the bloom suddenly forsook her cheeks but auriol seemed unable to proceed neither dared to regard the other and a profound silence prevailed between them for a few moments ebba said auriol at length i am about to leave your fathers house today why so soon she exclaimed looking up into his face you are not entirely recovered yet i dare not stay longer he said dare not cried ebba and she again cast down her eyes but auriol made no reply fortunately the silence was broken by the clinking of the smiths hammers upon the anvil if you must really go said ebba looking up after a long pause i hope we shall see you again most assuredly replied auriol i owe your worthy father a deep debt of gratitudea debt which i fear i shall never be able to repay my father is more than repaid in saving your life she replied i am sure he will be sorry to learn you are going so soon i have been here a week said auriol if i remained longer i might not be able to go at all there was another pause during which a stout old fellow in the workshop quitted the anvil for a moment and catching a glimpse of the young couple muttered to his helpmate i say ned im athinkin our masterll soon have a soninlaw theres pretty plain signs on it at yonder door so there be john replied ned peeping round hes a goodlookin young feller that i wish ve could hear their discoorse no that aint fair replied john raking some small coal upon the fire and working away at the bellows i would not for the world ask a disagreeable question said ebba again raising her eyes but since you are about to quit us i must confess i should like to know something of your history forgive me if i decline to comply with your desire replied auriol you would not believe me were i to relate my history but this i may say that it is stranger and wilder than any you ever heard the prisoner in his cell is not restrained by more terrible fetters than those which bind me to silence ebba gazed at him as if she feared his reasoning were wandering you think me mad said auriol would i were so but i shall never lose the clear perception of my woes hear me ebba fate has brought me into this house i have seen you and experienced your gentle ministry and it is impossible so circumstanced to be blind to your attractions i have only been too sensible to thembut i will not dwell on that theme nor run the risk of exciting a passion which must destroy you i will ask you to hate meto regard me as a monster whom you ought to shun rather than as a being for whom you should entertain the slightest sympathy you have some motive in saying this to me cried the terrified girl my motive is to warn you said auriol if you love me you are lostutterly lost she was so startled that she could make no reply but burst into tears auriol took her hand which she unresistingly yielded a terrible fatality attaches to me in which you must have no share he said in a solemn tone would you had never come to my fathers house she exclaimed in a voice of anguish is it then too late cried auriol despairingly it isif to love you be fatal she rejoined ha exclaimed auriol striking his forehead with his clenched hand recall your wordsebbarecall thembut no once utteredit is impossible you are bound to me for ever i must fulfil my destiny at this juncture a low growl broke from the dog and guided by the sound the youthful couple beheld standing near the gate the tall dark man in the black cloak a fiendish smile sat upon his countenance that is the man who frightened me cried ebba it is the person i supposed ejaculated auriol i must speak to him leave me ebba i will join you presently and as the girl half sinking with apprehension withdrew he advanced quickly towards the intruder i have sought you for some days said the tall man in a stern commanding voice you have not kept your appointment with me i could not replied auriolan accident has befallen me i know it rejoined the other i am aware you were assailed by ruffians in the ruined house over the way but you are recovered now and can go forth you ought to have communicated with me it was my intention to do so said auriol our meeting cannot be delayed much longer pursued the stranger i will give you three more days on the evening of the last day at the hour of seven i shall look for you at the foot of the statue in hyde park i will be there replied auriol that girl must be the next victim said the stranger with a grim smile peace thundered auriol nay i need not remind you of the tenure by which you maintain your power rejoined the stranger but i will not trouble you further now and wrapping his cloak more closely round him he disappeared fate has once more involved me in its net cried auriol bitterly but i will save ebba whatever it may cost me i will see her no more and instead of returning to the house he hurried away in the opposite direction of the stranger chapter v the meeting near the statue the evening of the third day arrived and auriol entered hyde park by stanhope gate glancing at his watch and finding it wanted nearly threequarters of an hour of the time appointed for his meeting with the mysterious stranger he struck across the park in the direction of the serpentine river apparently he was now perfectly recovered for his arm was without the support of the sling and he walked with great swiftness but his countenance was deathly pale and his looks were so wild and disordered that the few persons he encountered shrank from him aghast a few minutes rapid walking brought him to the eastern extremity of the serpentine and advancing close to the edge of the embankment he gazed at the waters beneath his feet i would plunge into them if i could find repose he murmured but it would avail nothing i should only add to my sufferings no i must continue to endure the weight of a life burdened by crime and remorse till i can find out the means of freeing myself from it once i dreaded this unknown danger but now i seek for it in vain the current of his thoughts was here interrupted by the sudden appearance of a dark object on the surface of the water which he at first took to be a huge fish with a pair of green fins springing from its back but after watching it more closely for a few moments he became convinced that it was a human being tricked out in some masquerade attire while the slight struggles which it made proved that life was not entirely extinct though the moment before he had contemplated selfdestruction and had only been restrained from the attempt by the certainty of failing in his purpose instinct prompted him to rescue the perishing creature before him without hesitation therefore and without tarrying to divest himself of his clothes he dashed into the water and striking out instantly reached the object of his quest which still continued to float and turning it over for the face was downwards he perceived it was an old man of exceedingly small size habited in a pantomimic garb he also remarked that a rope was twisted round the neck of the unfortunate being making it evident that some violent attempt had been made upon his life without pausing for further investigation he took firm hold of the leathern wings of the dwarf and with his disengaged hand propelled himself towards the shore dragging the other after him the next instant he reached the bank clambered up the low brickwork and placed his burden in safety the noise of the plunge had attracted attention and several persons now hurried to the spot on coming up and finding auriol bending over a waterspritefor such at first sight the dwarf appearedthey could not repress their astonishment wholly insensible to the presence of those around him auriol endeavoured to recall where he had seen the dwarf before all at once the recollection flashed upon him and he cried aloud why it is my poor murdered grandfathers attendant flapdragon but no nohe must be dead ages ago yet the resemblance is singularly striking auriols exclamations coupled with his wild demeanour surprised the bystanders and they came to the conclusion that he must be a travelling showman who had attempted to drown his dwarfthe grotesque impish garb of the latter convincing them that he had been exhibited at a booth they made signs therefore to each other not to let auriol escape and one of them raising the dwarfs head on his knee produced a flask and poured some brandy from it down his throat while others chafed his hands these efforts were attended with much speedier success than might have been anticipated after a struggle or two for respiration the dwarf opened his eyes and gazed at the group around him it must be flapdragon exclaimed auriol ah who calls me cried the dwarf i rejoined auriol do you not recollect me to be sure exclaimed the dwarf gazing at him fixedly you are and he stopped you have been thrown into the water master flapdragon cried a bystander noticing the cord round the dwarfs throat i have replied the little old man by your governorthat is by this person cried another laying hold of auriol by himno said the dwarf i have not seen that gentleman for nearly three centuries three centuries my little patriarch said the man who had given him the brandy thats a long time think again its perfectly true nevertheless replied the dwarf his wits have been washed away by the water said the first speaker give him a drop more brandy not a bit of it rejoined the dwarf my senses were never clearer than at this moment at last we have met he continued addressing auriol and i hope we shall not speedily part again we hold life by the same tie how came you in the desperate condition in which i found you demanded auriol evasively i was thrown into the canal with a stone to my neck like a dog about to be drowned replied the dwarf but as you are aware im not so easily disposed of again the bystanders exchanged significant looks by whom was the attempt made inquired auriol i dont know the villains name rejoined the dwarf but hes a very tall dark man and is generally wrapped in a long black cloak ha exclaimed auriol when was it done some nights ago i should fancy replied the dwarf for ive been a terrible long time under water i have only just managed to shake off the stone at this speech there was a titter of incredulity among the bystanders you may laugh but its true cried the dwarf angrily we must speak of this anon said auriol will you convey him to the nearest tavern he added placing money in the hands of the man who held the dwarf in his arms willingly sir replied the man ill take him to the life guardsman near the barracksthats the nearest public ill join him there in an hour replied auriol moving away and as he disappeared the man took up his little burden and bent his steps towards the barracks utterly disregarding the dripping state of his habiliments auriol proceeded quickly to the place of rendezvous arrived there he looked around and not seeing any one flung himself upon a bench at the foot of the gentle eminence on which the gigantic statue of achilles is placed it was becoming rapidly dark and heavy clouds portending speedy rain increased the gloom auriols thoughts were sombre as the weather and the hour and he fell into a deep fit of abstraction from which he was roused by a hand laid on his shoulder recoiling at the touch he raised his eyes and beheld the stranger leaning over him and gazing at him with a look of diabolical exultation the cloak was thrown partly aside so as to display the tall gaunt figure of its wearer while the large collar of sable fur with which it was decorated stood out like the wings of a demon the strangers hat was off and his high broad forehead white as marble was fully revealed our meeting must be brief he said are you prepared to fulfil the compact what do you require replied auriol possession of the girl i saw three days ago said the other the ironmerchants daughter ebba she must be mine never cried auriol firmlynever beware how you tempt me to exert my power said the stranger she must be mineor i defy you rejoined auriol i will never consent fool cried the other seizing him by the arm and fixing a withering glance upon him bring her to me ere the week be out or dread my vengeance and enveloping himself in his cloak he retreated behind the statue and was lost to view as he disappeared a moaning wind arose and heavy rain descended still auriol did not quit the bench chapter vi the charles the second spaniel it was about two oclock on a charming spring day that a stout middleaged man accompanied by a young person of extraordinary beauty took up his station in front of langham church just as the clock struck the hour a young man issued at a quick pace from a crossstreet and came upon the couple before he was aware of it he was evidently greatly embarrassed and would have beaten a retreat but that was impossible his embarrassment was in some degree shared by the young lady she blushed deeply but could not conceal her satisfaction at the encounter the elder individual who did not appear to notice the confusion of either party immediately extended his hand to the young man and exclaimed what mr darcy is it you why we thought we had lost you sir what took you off so suddenly we have been expecting you these four days and were now walking about to try and find you my daughter has been terribly uneasy havent you ebba the young lady made no answer to this appeal but cast down her eyes it was my intention to call and give you an explanation of my strange conduct today replied auriol i hope you received my letter stating that my sudden departure was unavoidable to be sure and i also received the valuable snuffbox you were so good as to send me replied mr thorneycroft but you neglected to tell me how to acknowledge the gift i could not give an address at the moment said auriol well i am glad to find you have got the use of your arm again observed the ironmerchant but i cant say you look so well as when you left us you seem palereh what do you think ebba mr darcy looks as if he were suffering from mental anxiety rather than from bodily ailment she replied timidly i am so replied auriol regarding her fixedly a very disastrous circumstance has happened to me but answer me one question has the mysterious person in the black cloak troubled you again what mysterious person demanded mr thorneycroft opening his eyes never mind father replied ebba i saw him last night she added to auriol i was sitting in the back room alone wondering what had become of you when i heard a tap against the window which was partly open and looking up i beheld the tall stranger it was nearly dark but the light of the fire revealed his malignant countenance i dont exaggerate when i say his eyes gleamed like those of a tiger i was terribly frightened but something prevented me from crying out after gazing at me for a few moments with a look that seemed to fascinate while it frightened me he saidyou desire to see auriol darcy i have just quitted him go to langham place tomorrow and as the clock strikes two you will behold him without waiting for any reply on my part he disappeared ah you never told me this you little rogue cried mr thorneycroft you persuaded me to come out with you in the hope of meeting mr darcy but you did not say you were sure to find him so you sent this mysterious gentleman to her eh he added to auriol no i did not replied the other gloomily indeed exclaimed the ironmerchant with a puzzled look oh then i suppose he thought it might relieve her anxiety however since we have met i hope youll walk home and dine with us auriol was about to decline the invitation but ebba glanced at him entreatingly i have an engagement but i will forego it he said offering his arm to her and they walked along towards oxford street while mr thorneycroft followed a few paces behind them this is very kind of you mr darcy said ebba oh i have been so wretched i grieve to hear it he rejoined i hoped you had forgotten me i am sure you did not think so she cried as she spoke she felt a shudder pass through auriols frame what ails you she anxiously inquired i would have shunned you if i could ebba he replied but a fate against which it is vain to contend has brought us together again i am glad of it she replied because ever since our last interview i have been reflecting on what you then said to me and am persuaded you are labouring under some strange delusion occasioned by your recent accident be not deceived ebba cried auriol i am under a terrible influence i need not remind you of the mysterious individual who tapped at your window last night what of him demanded ebba with a thrill of apprehension he it is who controls my destiny replied auriol but what has he to do with me asked ebba much much he replied with a perceptible shudder you terrify me auriol she rejoined tell me what you meanin pity tell me before auriol could reply mr thorneycroft stepped forward and turned the conversation into another channel soon after this they reached the quadrant and were passing beneath the eastern colonnade when ebbas attention was attracted towards a man who was leading a couple of dogs by a string while he had others under his arm others again in his pocket and another in his breast it was mr ginger what a pretty little dog cried ebba remarking the charles the second spaniel allow me to present you with it said auriol you know i should value it as coming from you she replied blushing deeply but i cannot accept it so i will not look at it again for fear i should be tempted the dogfancier however noticing ebbas admiration held forward the spaniel and said do jist look at the pretty little creater miss it hant its equil for beauty dont be afeerd on it miss its as gentle as a lamb oh you little darling ebba said patting its sleek head and long silken ears while it fixed its large black eyes upon her as if entreating her to become its purchaser fairy seems to have taken quite a fancy to you miss observed ginger and she aint i the habit o fallin i love at first sight i dont wonder at it though for my part i should do jist the same if i wos in her place vell now

adjoining the group were reconnoitring auriol its him whispered the taller and darker of the two to his companionits the young man veve been lookin forauriol darcy it seems like him said the other

where you live and steal the dog back again take my advice mr darcy and dont buy it the bargains concluded said ginger delivering the dog to ebba and taking the money from auriol which having counted he thrust into his capacious breeches pocket how shall i thank you for this treasure auriol exclaimed ebba in an ecstasy of delight by transferring to it all regard you may entertain for me he replied in a low tone that is impossible she answered well i vote we drive away at once said mr thorneycroft halloa jarvey he cried hailing a coach that was passing adding as the vehicle stopped now get in ebba by this means we shall avoid being followed by the rascal so saying he got into the coach as auriol was about to follow him he felt a slight touch on his arm and turning beheld a tall and very forbidding man by his side beg pardin sir said the fellow touching his hat but aint your name mr auriol darcy it is replied auriol regarding him fixedly why do you ask i vants a vord or two vith you

tinker theres two friends o mine as vishes to be present at our conference ved better valk into a back street chapter vii the hand again followed by auriol who in his turn was followed by ginger and the sandman the tinker directed his steps to great windmill street where he entered a publichouse called the black lion leaving his fourfooted attendants with the landlord with whom he was acquainted ginger caused the party to be shown into a private room and on entering it auriol flung himself into a chair while the dogfancier stationed himself near the door now what do you want with me demanded auriol you shall learn presently replied the tinker but first it may be as vell to state that a certain pocketbook has been found ah exclaimed auriol you are the villains who beset me in the ruined

particlar ourselves but ve dont commit murder wholesale ve dont commit murder at all said ginger you may fancy pursued the tinker that ve aint perfectly acvainted with your history but to prove that

upon it here are the words how many crimes have i to reproach myself with how many innocents have i destroyed and all owing to my fatal compact with give me that paper cried auriol rising and attempting to snatch it from the dogfancier just as this moment and while ginger retreated from auriol the door behind him was noiselessly openeda hand was thrust through the chinkand the paper was snatched from his grasp before ginger could turn round the door was closed again halloa whats that he cried the papers gone the hand again cried the sandman in alarm see whos in the passageopen the doorquick ginger cautiously complied and peeping forth said theres no one there it must be the devil ill have nuffin more to do wi the matter poh poh dont be so chickenarted cried the tinker but come

and he quitted the room ill go and see wots the matter wi ginger said the sandman slinking after him the tinker looked nervously round he was not proof against his superstitious fears here take this purse and trouble me no more cried auriol the tinkers hands clutched the purse mechanically but he instantly laid it down again im bad enoughbut i wont sell myself to the devil he said and he followed his companions left alone auriol groaned aloud and covered his face with his hands when he looked up he found the tall man in the black cloak standing beside him a demoniacal smile played upon his features you here cried auriol of course replied the stranger i came to watch over your safety you were in danger from those men but you need not concern yourself more about them i have your pocketbook and the slip of paper that dropped from it here are both now let us talk on other matters you have just parted from ebba and will see her again this evening perchance replied auriol you will rejoined the stranger peremptorily remember your ten years limit draws to a close in a few days it will be at an end and if you renew it not you will incur the penalty and you know it to be terrible with the means of renewal in your hands why hesitate because i will not sacrifice the girl replied auriol you cannot help yourself cried the stranger scornfully i command you to bring her to me i persist in my refusal replied auriol it is useless to brave my power said the stranger a moon is just born when it has attained its first quarter ebba shall be mine till then farewell and as the words were uttered he passed through the door chapter viii the barber of london who has not heard of the barber of london his dwelling is in the neighbourhood of lincolns inn it is needless to particularise the street for everybody knows the shop that is to say every member of the legal profession high or low all to the very judges themselves have their hair cut or their wigs dressed by him a pleasant fellow is mr tuffnell triggefigaro himself not pleasanterand if you do not shave yourselfif you want a becoming flow imparted to your stubborn locks or if you require a wig i recommend you to the care of mr tuffnell trigge not only will he treat you well but he will regale you with all the gossip of the court he will give you the last funny thing of mr serjeant larkins he will tell you how many briefs the great mr skinner fyne receiveswhat the vicechancellor is doing and you will own on rising that you have never spent a five minutes more agreeably besides you are likely to see some noticeable characters for mr trigges shop is quite a lounge perhaps you may find a young barrister who has just been called ordering his first wig and you may hear the prognostications of mr trigge as to his future distinction ah sir he will say glancing at the stolid features of the young man you have quite the face of the chief justicequite the face of the chiefi dont recollect him ordering his first wigthat was a little before my time but i hope to live to see you chief sir quite within your reach if you choose to apply sure of it sirquite sure or you may see him attending to some grave master in chancery and listening with profound attention to his remarks or screaming with laughter at the jokes of some smart special pleader or talking of the theatres the actors and actresses to some young attorneys or pupils in conveyancers chambers for those are the sort of customers in whom mr trigge chiefly delights with them indeed he is great for it is by them he has been dubbed the barber of london his shop is also frequented by managing clerks barristers clerks engrossing clerks and others but these are for the most part his private friends mr trigges shop is none of your spruce west end haircutting establishments with magnificent mirrors on every side in which you may see the back of your head the front and the side all at once with walls bedizened with glazed french paper and with an anteroom full of bearsgrease oils creams toothpowders and cut glass no it is a real barbers and hairdressers shop of the good old stamp where you may get cut and curled for a shilling and shaved for half the price true the floor is not covered with a carpet but what of that it bears the imprint of innumerable customers and is scattered over with their hair in the window there is an assortment of busts moulded in wax exhibiting the triumphs of mr trigges art and above these are several specimens of legal wigs on the little counter behind the window amid large pots of pomade and bearsgrease and the irons and brushes in constant use by the barber are other bustos done to the life and for ever glancing amiably into the room on the block is a judges wig which mr trigge has just been dressing and a little farther on a higher block is that of a counsel on either side of the fireplace are portraits of lord eldon and lord lyndhurst some other portraits of pretty actresses are likewise to be seen against the counter rests a board displaying the playbill of the evening and near it is a large piece of emblematical crockery indicating that bearsgrease may be had on the premises amongst mr trigges livestock may be enumerated his favourite magpie placed in a wicker cage in the window which chatters incessantly and knows everything its master avouches as well as a christian and now as to mr tuffnell trigge himself he is very tall and very thin and holds himself so upright that he loses not an inch of his stature his head is large and his face long with marked if not very striking features charged it must be admitted with a very selfsatisfied expression one cannot earn the appellation of the barber of london without talent and it is the consciousness of this talent that lends to mr trigges features their apparently conceited expression a fringe of black whisker adorns his cheek and chin and his black bristly hair is brushed back so as to exhibit the prodigious expanse of his forehead his eyebrows are elevated as if in constant scorn the attire in which mr trigge is ordinarily seen consists of a black velvet waistcoat and tight black continuations these are protected by a white apron tied round his waist with pockets to hold his scissors and combs over all he wears a short nankeen jacket into the pockets of which his hands are constantly thrust when not otherwise employed a black satin stock with a large bow encircles his throat and his shirt is fastened by black enamel studs such is mr tuffnell trigge yclept the barber of london at the time of his introduction to the reader mr trigge had just advertised for an assistant his present young man rutherford watts being about to leave him and set up for himself in canterbury it was about two oclock and mr trigge had just withdrawn into an inner room to take some refection when on returning he found watts occupied in cutting the hair of a middleaged sourlooking gentleman who was seated before the fire mr trigge bowed to the sourlooking gentleman and appeared ready to enter into conversation with him but no notice being taken of his advances he went and talked to his magpie while he was chattering to it the sagacious bird screamed forth pretty dearpretty dear ah whats that who is it cried trigge pretty dearpretty dear reiterated the magpie upon this trigge looked around and saw a very singular little man enter the shop he had somewhat the appearance of a groom being clothed in a long grey coat drab knees and small topboots he had a large and remarkably projecting mouth like that of a baboon and a great shock head of black hair pretty dearpretty dear screamed the magpie i see nothing pretty about him thought mr trigge what a strange little fellow it would puzzle the lord chancellor himself to say what his age might be the little man took off his hat and making a profound bow to the barber unfolded the times newspaper which he carried under his arm and held it up to trigge what do you want my little friend eh said the barber high wageshigh wages screamed the magpie is this yours sir replied the little man pointing to an advertisement in the newspaper yes yes thats my advertisement friend replied mr trigge but what of it before the little man could answer a slight interruption occurred while eyeing the newcomer watts neglected to draw forth the hot curlingirons in consequence of which he burnt the sourlooking gentlemans forehead and singed his hair take care sir cried the gentleman furiously what the devil are you about yes take care sir as judge learmouth observes to a saucy witness cried triggetake care or ill commit you dn judge learmouth cried the gentleman angrily if i were a judge id hang such a careless fellow sarve him right screamed magsarve him right illustration the barber of london beg pardon sir cried watts ill rectify you in a minute well my little friend observed trigge and what may be your object in coming to me as the great conveyancer mr plodwell observes to his clientswhat may be your object you want an assistant dont you sir rejoined the little man humbly do you apply on your own account or on behalf of a friend asked trigge on my own replied the little man what are your qualifications demanded triggewhat are your qualifications i fancy i understand something of the business replied the little man i was a perruquier myself when wigs were more in fashion than they are now ha indeed said trigge laughing that must have been in the last centuryin queen annes timeeh you have hit it exactly sir replied the little man it was in queen annes time perhaps you recollect when wigs were first worn my little nestor cried mr trigge perfectly replied the little man french periwigs were first worn in charles the seconds time you saw em of course cried the barber with a sneer i did replied the little man quietly oh he must be out of his mind cried trigge we shall have a commission de lunatico to issue here as the master of the rolls would observe i hope i may suit you sir said the little man i dont think you will my friend replied mr trigge i dont think you will you dont seem to have a hand for hairdressing are you aware of the talent the art requires are you aware what it has cost me to earn the enviable title of the barber of london im as proud of that title as if i were lord chancellorlord chancellor screamed mag precisely mag said mr trigge as if i were lord chancellor well im sorry for it said the little man disconsolately pretty dear screamed mag pretty dear what a wonderful bird you have got said the sourlooking gentleman rising and paying mr trigge i declare its answers are quite appropriate ah mag is a clever creature sirthat she is replied the barber i gave a good deal for her little or nothing screamed maglittle or nothing what is your name friend said the gentleman addressing the little man who still lingered in the shop why sir ive had many names in my time he replied at one time i was called flapdragonat another old parrbut my real name i believe is morsegregory morse an old bailey answer cried mr trigge shaking his head flapdragon alias old parralias gregory morsealias pretty dear screamed mag and you want a place demanded the sourlooking gentleman eyeing him narrowly sadly replied morse well then follow me said the gentleman and ill see what can be done for you and they left the shop together chapter ix the moon in the first quarter in spite of his resolution to the contrary auriol found it impossible to resist the fascination of ebbas society and became a daily visitor at her fathers house mr thorneycroft noticed the growing attachment between them with satisfaction his great wish was to see his daughter united to the husband of her choice and in the hope of smoothing the way he let auriol understand that he should give her a considerable marriage portion for the last few days a wonderful alteration had taken place in auriols manner and he seemed to have shaken off altogether the cloud that had hitherto sat upon his spirits enchanted by the change ebba indulged in the most blissful anticipations of the future one evening they walked forth together and almost unconsciously directed their steps towards the river lingering on its banks they gazed on the full tide admired the glorious sunset and breathed over and over again those tender nothings so eloquent in lovers ears oh how different you are from what you were a week ago said ebba playfully promise me not to indulge in any more of those gloomy fancies i will not indulge in them if i can help it rest assured sweet ebba he replied but my spirits are not always under my control i am surprised at my own cheerfulness this evening i never felt so happy she replied and the whole scene is in unison with my feelings how soothing is the calm river flowing at our feethow tender is the warm sky still flushed with red though the sun has setand see yonder hangs the crescent moon she is in her first quarter the moon in her first quarter cried auriol in a tone of anguish all then is over what means this sudden change cried ebba frightened by his looks oh ebba he replied i must leave you i have allowed myself to dream of happiness too long i am an accursed being doomed only to bring misery upon those who love me i warned you on the onset but you would not believe me let me go and perhaps it may not yet be too late to save you oh no do not leave me cried ebba i have no fear while you are with me but you do not know the terrible fate i am linked to he said this is the night when it will be accomplished your moody fancies do not alarm me as they used to do dear auriol she rejoined because i know them to be the fruit of a diseased imagination come let us continue our walk she added taking his arm kindly ebba he cried i implore you to let me go i have not the power to tear myself away unless you aid me im glad to hear it she rejoined for then i shall hold you fast you know not what you do cried auriol release me oh release me in a few moments the fit will be passed she rejoined let us walk towards the abbey it is in vain to struggle against fate ejaculated auriol despairingly and he suffered himself to be led in the direction proposed ebba continued to talk but her discourse fell upon a deaf ear and at last she became silent too in this way they proceeded along millbank street and abingdon street until turning off on the right they found themselves before an old and partlydemolished building by this time it had become quite dark for the moon was hidden behind a rack of clouds but a light was seen in the upper storey of the structure occasioned no doubt by a fire within it which gave a very picturesque effect to the broken outline of the walls pausing for a moment to contemplate the ruin ebba expressed a wish to enter it auriol offered no opposition and passing through an arched doorway and ascending a short spiral stone staircase they presently arrived at a roofless chamber which it was evident from the implements and rubbish lying about was about to be razed to the ground on one side there was a large arch partly bricked up through which opened a narrow doorway though at some height from the ground with this a plank communicated while beneath it lay a great heap of stones amongst which were some grotesque carved heads in the centre of the chamber was a large square opening like the mouth of a trapdoor from which the top of a ladder projected and near it stood a flaming brazier which had cast forth the glare seen from below over the ruinous walls on the right hung the crescent moon now emerged from the cloud and shedding a ghostly glimmer on the scene what a strange place cried ebba gazing around with some apprehension it looks like a spot one reads of in romance i wonder where that trap leads to into the vault beneath no doubt replied auriol but why did we come hither as he spoke there was a sound like mocking laughter but whence arising it was difficult to say did you hear that sound cried auriol it was nothing but the echo of laughter from the street she replied you alarm yourself without reason auriol no not without reason he cried i am in the power of a terrible being who seeks to destroy you and i know that he is at hand listen to me ebba and however strange my recital may appear do not suppose it the ravings of a madman but be assured it is the truth beware cried a deep voice issuing apparently from the depths of the vault some one spoke cried ebba i begin to share your apprehensions let us quit this place come then said auriol not so fast cried a deep voice and they beheld the mysterious owner of the black cloak barring their passage out ebba you are mine cried the stranger auriol has brought you to me it is false cried auriol i never will yield her to you remember your compact rejoined the stranger with a mocking laugh oh auriol cried ebba i fear for your soul you have not made a compact with this fiend he has replied the stranger and by that compact you are surrendered to me and as he spoke he advanced towards her and enveloping her in his cloak her cries were instantly stifled you shall not go cried auriol seizing him release her or i renounce you wholly fool cried the stranger since you provoke my wrath take your doom and he stamped on the ground at this signal an arm was thrust from the trapdoor and auriols hand was seized with an iron grasp while this took place the stranger bore his lovely burden swiftly up the plank leading to the narrow doorway in the wall and just as he was passing through it he pointed towards the sky and shouted with a mocking smile to auriolbehold the moon is in her first quarter my words are fulfilled and he disappeared auriol tried to disengage himself from the grasp imposed upon him in vain uttering ejaculations of rage and despair he was dragged forcibly backwards into the vault illustration seizure of ebba chapter x the statue at charing cross one morning two persons took their way along parliament street and whitehall and chatting as they walked turned into the entrance of spring gardens for the purpose of looking at the statue at charing cross one of them was remarkable for his dwarfish stature and strange withered features the other was a man of middle size thin rather elderly and with a sharp countenance the sourness of which was redeemed by a strong expression of benevolence he was clad in a black coat rather rusty but well brushed buttoned up to the chin black tights short drab gaiters and wore a white neckcloth and spectacles mr loftus for so he was called was a retired merchant of moderate fortune and lived in abingdon street he was a bachelor and therefore pleased himself and being a bit of an antiquary rambled about all day long in search of some object of interest his walk on the present occasion was taken with that view by jove what a noble statue that is morse cried loftus gazing at it the horse is magnificentpositively magnificent i recollect when the spot was occupied by a gibbet and when in lieu of a statue an effigy of the martyred monarch was placed there replied morse that was in the time of the protectorate you cannot get those dreams out of your head morse said loftus smiling i wish i could persuade myself i had lived for two centuries and a half would you could have seen the ancient cross which once stood there erected by edward the first to his beloved wife eleanor of castile said morse heedless of the others remark it was much mutilated when i remember it some of the pinnacles were broken and the foliage defaced but the statues of the queen were still standing in the recesses and altogether the effect was beautiful it must have been charming observed loftus rubbing his hands and though i like the statue i would much rather have had the old gothic cross but how fortunate the former escaped destruction in oliver cromwells time i can tell you how that came to pass sir replied morse for i was assistant to john rivers the brazier to whom the statue was sold ah indeed exclaimed loftus i have heard something of the story but should like to have full particulars you shall hear them then replied morse yon statue which as you know was cast by hubert le sueur in was ordered by parliament to be sold and broken to pieces well my master john rivers being a stanch royalist though he did not dare to avow his principles determined to preserve it from destruction accordingly he offered a good round sum for it and was declared the purchaser but how to dispose of it was the difficulty he could trust none of his men but me whom he knew to be as hearty a hater of the roundheads and as loyal to the memory of our slaughtered sovereign as himself well we digged a great pit secretly in the cellar whither the statue had been conveyed and buried it the job occupied us nearly a month and during that time my master collected together all the pieces of old brass he could procure these he afterwards produced and declared they were the fragments of the statue but the cream of the jest was to come he began to cast handles of knives and forks in brass giving it out that they were made from the metal of the statue and plenty of em he sold too for the cavaliers bought em as memorials of their martyred monarch and the roundheads as evidences of his fall in this way he soon got back his outlay ha ha ha laughed loftus well in due season came the restoration pursued morse and my master made known to king charles the second the treasure he had kept concealed for him it was digged forth placed in its old positionbut i forget whether the brazier was rewarded i rather think not no matter cried loftus he was sufficiently rewarded by the consciousness of having done a noble action but let us go and examine the sculpture on the pedestal more closely with this he crossed over the road and taking off his hat thrust his head through the iron railing surrounding the pedestal while morse in order to point out the beauties of the sculpture with greater convenience mounted upon a stump beside him you are aware that this is the work of grinling gibbons sir cried the dwarf to be sure i am replied loftusto be sure what fancy and gusto is displayed in the treatment of these trophies the execution of the royal arms is equally admirable cried morse never saw anything finer rejoined loftusnever upon my life every one knows how easily a crowd is collected in london and it cannot be supposed that our two antiquaries would be allowed to pursue their investigations unmolested several ragged urchins got round them and tried to discover what they were looking at at the same time cutting their jokes upon them these were speedily joined by a streetsweeper rather young in the profession a ticketporter a butchers apprentice an old israelitish clothesman a coalheaver and a couple of charityboys my eyes cried the streetsweeper only twig these coves if they aint green uns im done old spectacles thinks he has found it all out remarked the porter ve shall hear wot it all means byandby plesh ma art cried the jew vat two funny old genelmen i vonder vat they thinks they sees ill tell ee master rejoined the butchers apprentice theyre a tryin vich on em can see farthest into a millstone illustration antiquaries only think of living all my life in london and never examining this admirable work of art before cried loftus quite unconscious that he had become the object of general curiosity look closer at it old gemman cried the porter the nearer you get the more youll admire it quite true replied loftus fancying morse had spoken itll bear the closest inspection i say ned observed one of the charityboys to the other do you get over the railin they must ha dropped summat inside see what it is im afraid o spikin myself joe replied the other but just give us a lift and ill try wot are you arter there you young rascals cried the coalheaver come down or ill send the perlice to you wot two precious guys these is cried a ragamuffin lad accompanied by a bulldog ive a good mind to chuck the little un off the post and set tartar at him here boy here that ud be famous fun indeed spicer cried another rapscallion behind him arrah let em alone will you there you young divils cried an irish bricklayer dont you see theyre only two paiceable antiquaries oh theyre antiquaries are they screamed the little streetsweeper vell i never see the likes on em afore did you sam never replied the porter och murther in irish yere upsettin me an all the fruits of my industry cried an applewoman against whom the bricklayer had run his barrow divil seize you for a careless wagabone why dont you look where yere goin and not dhrive into people in that way axes pardon molly said the bricklayer but i was so interested in them antiquaries that i didnt obsarve ye antiquaries be hanged whats such warmint to me cried the applewoman furiously youve destroyed my days market and bad luck to ye well never heed molly cried the goodnatured bricklayer ill make it up tye pick up your apples and you shall have a dhrop of the craiter if youll come along wid me while this was passing a stout gentleman came from the farther side of the statue and perceiving loftus criedwhy brotherinlaw is that you but loftus was too much engrossed to notice him and continued to expiate upon the beauty of the trophies what are you talking about brother cried the stout gentleman grinling gibbons replied loftus without turning round horace walpole said that no one before him could give to wood the airy lightness of a flower and here he has given it to a stone this may be all very fine my good fellow said the stout gentleman seizing him by the shoulder but dont you see the crowd youre collecting round you youll be mobbed presently why how the devil did you come here brother thorneycroft cried loftus at last recognising him come along and ill tell you replied the ironmerchant dragging him away while morse followed closely behind them im so glad to have met you pursued thorneycroft as soon as they were clear of the mob youll be shocked to hear what has happened to your niece ebba why what has happened to her demanded loftus you alarm me out with it at once i hate to be kept in suspense she has left me replied thorneycroftleft her old indulgent fatherrun away run away exclaimed loftus impossible ill not believe iteven from your lips would it were not sobut it is alas too true replied thorneycroft mournfully and the thing was so unnecessary for i would gladly have given her to the young man my sole hope is that she has not utterly disgraced herself no she is too high principled for that cried loftus rest easy on that score but with whom has she run away with a young man named auriol darcy replied thorneycroft he was brought to my house under peculiar circumstances i never heard of him said loftus but i have interposed morse ive known him these two hundred years eh day whos this cried thorneycroft a crackbrained little fellow whom ive engaged as valet replied loftus he fancies he was born in queen elizabeths time its no fancy cried morse i am perfectly acquainted with auriol darcys history he drank of the same elixir as myself if you know him can you give us a clue to find him asked thorneycroft i am sorry i cannot replied morse i only saw him for a few minutes the other night after i had been thrown into the serpentine by the tall man in the black cloak whats that you say cried thorneycroft quickly i have heard ebba speak of a tall man in a black cloak having some mysterious connection with auriol i hope that person has nothing to do with her disappearance i shouldnt wonder if he had replied morse i believe that black gentleman to be whatwho demanded thorneycroft neither more nor less than the devil replied morse mysteriously pshaw poh cried loftus i told you the poor fellow was half cracked at this moment a roguishlooking fellow with red whiskers and hair and clad in a velveteen jacket with ivory buttons who had been watching the ironmerchant at some distance came up and touching his hat said mr thorneycroft i believe my name is thorneycroft fellow cried the ironmerchant eyeing him askance and your name i fancy is ginger exactly sir replied the dogfancier again touching his hat exactly i didnt think you would rekilect me sir i bring you some news of your darter of ebba exclaimed thorneycroft in a tone of deep emotion i hope your news is good i wish it wos better for her sake as well as yours sir replied the dogfancier gravely but im afeerd shes in werry bad hands that she is if shes in the hands o the black gentleman observed morse vy old parr that aint you cried ginger gazing at him in astonishment vy ow you are transmogrified to be sure but what of my daughter cried thorneycroft where is she take me to her and you shall be well rewarded ill do my best to take you to her and without any reward sir replied ginger for my heart bleeds for the poor young creater as i said afore shes in dreadful bad hands do you allude to mr auriol darcy cried thorneycroft no hes as much a wictim of this infernal plot as your darter replied ginger i thought him quite different at firstbut ive altered my mind entirely since some matters has come to my knowledge you alarm me greatly by these dark hints cried thorneycroft what is to be done i shall know in a few hours replied ginger i aint got the exact clue yet but come to me at eleven oclock tonight at the turks head at the back o shoreditch church and ill put you on the right scent you must come alone i should wish this gentleman my brotherinlaw to accompany me said thorneycroft he couldnt help you replied ginger ill take care to have plenty of assistance its a dangerous busness and can only be managed in a sartin way and by a sartin person and hed object to any von but you tonight at eleven goodbye old parr ve shall meet again ere long and without a word more he hurried away chapter xi preparations on that same night at the appointed hour mr thorneycroft repaired to shoreditch and entering a narrow street behind the church speedily discovered the turks head at the door of which a hackneycoach was standing he was shown by the landlord into a small back room in which three men were seated at a small table smoking and drinking gin and water while a fourth was standing near the fire with his back towards the door the latter was a tall powerfully built man wrapped in a rough greatcoat and did not turn round on the ironmerchants entrance you are punctual mr thorneycroft said ginger who was one of the trio at the table and im happy to say ive arranged everythin for you sir my friends are ready to undertake the job only they vont do it on quite sich easy terms as mine the tinker and the sandman coughed slightly to intimate their entire concurrence in mr gingers remark as i said to you this mornin mr thorneycroft pursued ginger this is a difficult and a dangerous busness and theres no knowin wot may come on it but its your only chance o recoverin your darter yes its your only chance echoed the tinker vere about to risk our precious lives for you sir said the sandman so in coorse ve expects a perportionate revard if you enable me to regain my daughter you shall not find me ungrateful rejoined the ironmerchant i must have a hundred pounds said the tinkerthats my lowest and mine too said the sandman i shall take nuffin but the glory as i said afore remarked ginger im sworn champion o poor distressed young damsils but my friends must make their own bargins well i assent returned mr thorneycroft and the sooner we set out the better are you armed asked ginger i have a brace of pistols in my pocket replied thorneycroft all right thenveve all got pops and cutlashes said ginger so lets be off as he spoke the tinker and sandman arose and the man in the rough greatcoat who had hitherto remained with his back to them turned round to the ironmerchants surprise he perceived that the face of this individual was covered with a piece of black crape who is this he demanded with some misgiving a friend replied ginger vithout him ve could do nuffin his name is reeks and he is the chief man in our enterprise he claims a reward too i suppose said thorneycroft i will tell you what reward i claim mr thorneycroft rejoined reeks in a deep stern tone when all is over meantime give me your solemn pledge that whatever you may behold tonight you will not divulge it i give it replied the ironmerchant provided always no provision sir interrupted the other quickly you must swear to keep silence unconditionally or i will not move a footstep with you and i alone can guide you where your daughter is detained svear sir it is your only chance whispered ginger well if it must be i do swear to keep silence rejoined mr thorneycroft but your proceedings appear very mysterious the whole affair is mysterious replied reeks you must also consent to have a bandage passed over your eyes when you get into the coach anything more asked the ironmerchant you must engage to obey my orders without questioning when we arrive at our destination rejoined reeks otherwise there is no chance of success be it as you will returned thorneycroft i must perforce agree all then is clearly understood said reeks and we can now set out upon this ginger conducted mr thorneycroft to the coach and as soon as the latter got into it tied a handkerchief tightly over his eyes in this state mr thorneycroft heard the tinker and the sandman take their places near him but not remarking the voice of reeks concluded that he must have got outside the next moment the coach was put in motion and rattled over the stones at a rapid pace it made many turns but at length proceeded steadily onwards while from the profound silence around and the greater freshness of the air mr thorneycroft began to fancy they had gained the country not a word was spoken by any one during the ride after a while the coach stopped the door was opened and mr thorneycroft was helped out the ironmerchant expected his bandage would now be removed but he was mistaken for reeks taking his arm drew him along at a quick pace as they advanced the ironmerchants conductor whispered him to be cautious and at the same time made him keep close to a wall a door was presently opened and as soon as the party had passed through it closed the bandage was then removed from thorneycrofts eyes and he found himself in a large and apparently neglected garden though the sky was cloudy there was light enough to enable him to distinguish that they were near an old dilapidated mansion we are now arrived said reeks to the ironmerchant and you will have need of all your resolution i will deliver her or perish in the attempt said thorneycroft taking out his pistols the others drew their cutlasses now then follow me said reeks and act as i direct with this he struck into an alley formed by thick hedges of privet which brought them to the back part of the house passing through a door he entered the yard and creeping cautiously along the wall reached a low window which he contrived to open without noise he then passed through it and was followed by the others chapter xii the chamber of mystery we shall now return to the night of ebbas seizure by the mysterious stranger though almost deprived of consciousness by terror the poor girl could distinguish from the movements of her captor that she was borne down a flight of steps or some steep descent and then for a considerable distance along level ground she was next placed in a carriage which was driven with great swiftness and though it was impossible to conjecture in what direction she was conveyed it seemed to her terrified imagination as if she were hurried down a precipice and she expected every moment to be dashed in pieces at length the vehicle stopped and she was lifted out of it and carried along a winding passage after which the creaking of hinges announced that a door was opened having passed through it she was deposited on a bench when fright overmastering her her senses completely forsook her on recovering she found herself seated on a fauteuil covered with black velvet in the midst of a gloomy chamber of vast extent while beside her and supporting her from falling stood the mysterious and terrible stranger he held a large goblet filled with some potent liquid to her lips and compelled her to swallow a portion of it the powerful stimulant revived her but at the same time produced a strange excitement against which she struggled with all her power her persecutor again held the goblet towards her while a sardonic smile played upon his features drink he cried it will restore you and you have much to go through ebba mechanically took the cup and raised it to her lips but noticing the strangers glance of exultation dashed it to the ground you have acted foolishly he said sternly the potion would have done you good withdrawing her eyes from his gaze which she felt exercised an irresistible influence over her ebba gazed fearfully round the chamber it was vast and gloomy and seemed like the interior of a sepulchrethe walls and ceiling being formed of black marble while the floor was paved with the same material not far from where she sat on an estrade approached by a couple of steps stood a table covered with black velvet on which was placed an immense lamp fashioned like an imp supporting a caldron on his outstretched wings in this lamp were several burners which cast a lurid light throughout the chamber over it hung a cap equally fantastically fashioned a dagger with a richly wrought hilt was stuck into the table and beside it lay a strangely shaped mask an open book an antique inkstand and a piece of parchment on which some characters were inscribed opposite these stood a curiously carved ebony chair at the lower end of the room which was slightly elevated above the rest hung a large black curtain and on the step in the front of it were placed two vases of jet what is behind that curtain shudderingly demanded ebba of her companion you will see anon he replied meanwhile seat yourself on that chair and glance at the writing on the scroll ebba did not move but the stranger took her hand and drew her to the seat read what is written on that paper he cried imperiously ebba glanced at the document and a shudder passed over her frame by this she cried i surrender myself soul and body to you you do replied the stranger i have committed no crime that can place me within the power of the fiend cried ebba falling upon her knees i call upon heaven for protection avaunt as the words were uttered the cap suddenly fell upon the lamp and the chamber was buried in profound darkness mocking laughter rang in her ears succeeded by wailing cries inexpressibly dreadful to hear ebba continued to pray fervently for her own deliverance and for that of auriol in the midst of her supplications she was aroused by strains of music of the most exquisite sweetness proceeding apparently from behind the curtain and while listening to these sounds she was startled by a deafening crash as if a large gong had been stricken the cover of the lamp was then slowly raised and the burners blazed forth as before while from the two vases in front of the curtain arose clouds of incense filling the chamber with stupefying fragrance again the gong was stricken and ebba looked round towards the curtain above each vase towered a gigantic figure wrapped in a long black cloak the lower part of which was concealed by the thick vapour hoods like the cowls of monks were drawn over the heads of these grim and motionless figures mufflers enveloped their chins and they wore masks from the holes of which gleamed eyes of unearthly brightness their hands were crossed upon their breasts between them squatted two other spectral forms similarly cloaked hooded and masked with their gleaming eyes fixed upon her and their skinny fingers pointed derisively at her behind the curtain was placed a strong light which showed a wide staircase of black marble leading to some upper chamber and at the same time threw the reflection of a gigantic figure upon the drapery while a hand the finger of which pointed towards her was thrust from an opening between its folds forcibly averting her gaze ebba covered her eyes with her hands but looking up again after a brief space beheld an ebon door at the side revolve upon its hinges and give entrance to three female figures robed in black hooded and veiled and having their hands folded in a melancholy manner across their breasts slowly and noiselessly advancing they halted within a few paces of her who and what are ye she cried wild with terror the victims of auriol replied the figure on the right as we are such will you be ere long what crime have you committed demanded ebba we have loved him replied the second figure illustration the chamber of mystery is that a crime cried ebba if so i am equally culpable with you you will share our doom replied the third figure heaven have mercy upon me exclaimed the agonised girl dropping upon her knees at this moment a terrible voice from behind the curtain exclaimed sign or auriol is lost for ever i cannot yield my soul even to save him cried ebba distractedly witness his chastisement then cried the voice and as the words were uttered a side door was opened on the opposite side and auriol was dragged forth from it by two masked personages who looked like familiars of the inquisition do not yield to the demands of this fiend ebba cried auriol gazing at her distractedly will you save him before he is cast living into the tomb cried the voice and at the words a heavy slab of marble rose slowly from the floor near where ebba sat and disclosed a dark pit beneath ebba gazed into the abyss with indescribable terror there he will be immured unless you sign cried the voice and as he is immortal he will endure an eternity of torture i cannot save him so but i may precede him cried ebba and throwing her hands aloft she flung herself into the pit a fearful cry resounded through the chamber it broke from auriol who vainly strove to burst from those who held him and precipitate himself after ebba soon after this and while auriol was gazing into the abyss a tongue of blue flame arose from it danced for a moment in the air and then vanished no sooner was it gone than a figure shrouded in black habiliments and hooded and muffled up like the three other female forms slowly ascended from the vault apparently without support and remained motionless at its brink ebba exclaimed auriol in a voice of despair is it you the figure bowed its head but spoke not sign thundered the voice your attempt at selfdestruction has placed you wholly in my power sign at this injunction the figure moved slowly towards the table and to his unspeakable horror auriol beheld it take up the pen and write upon the parchment he bent forward and saw that the name inscribed thereon was ebba thorneycroft the groan to which he gave utterance was echoed by a roar of diabolical laughter the figure then moved slowly away and ranged itself with the other veiled forms all is accomplished cried the voice away with him on this a terrible clangour was heard the lights were extinguished and auriol was dragged through the doorway from which he had been brought forth end of the first book intermean chapter i the tomb of the rosicrucian on the night of the st of march and at a late hour a man wrapped in a large horsemans cloak and of strange and sinister appearance entered an old deserted house in the neighbourhood of stepney green he was tall carried himself very erect and seemed in the full vigour of early manhood but his features had a worn and ghastly look as if bearing the stamp of longindulged and frightful excesses while his dark gleaming eyes gave him an expression almost diabolical this person had gained the house from a garden behind it and now stood in a large dismantled hall from which a broad oaken staircase with curiouslycarved banisters led to a gallery and thence to the upper chambers of the habitation nothing could be more dreary than the aspect of the place the richlymoulded ceiling was festooned with spiders webs and in some places had fallen in heaps upon the floor the glories of the tapestry upon the walls were obliterated by damps the squares of black and white marble with which the hall was paved were loosened and quaked beneath the footsteps the wide and empty fireplace yawned like the mouth of a cavern the bolts of the closed windows were rusted in their sockets and the heaps of dust before the outer door proved that long years had elapsed since any one had passed through it taking a dark lantern from beneath his cloak the individual in question gazed for a moment around him and then with a sardonic smile playing upon his features directed his steps towards a room on the right the door of which stood open this chamber which was large and cased with oak was wholly unfurnished like the hall and in an equally dilapidated condition the only decoration remaining on its walls was the portrait of a venerable personage in the cap and gown of henry the eighths time painted against a panela circumstance which had probably saved it from destructionand beneath it fixed in another panel a plate of brass covered with mystical characters and symbols and inscribed with the name cyprianus de rougemont fra rc the same name likewise appeared upon a label beneath the portrait with the date pausing before the portrait the young man threw the light of the lantern full upon it and revealed features somewhat resembling his own in form but of a severe and philosophic cast in the eyes alone could be discerned the peculiar and terrible glimmer which distinguished his own glances after regarding the portrait for some time fixedly he thus addressed it dost hear me old ancestor he cried i thy descendant cyprian de rougemont call upon thee to point out where thy gold is hidden i know that thou wert a brother of the rosy crossone of the illuminatiand didst penetrate the mysteries of nature and enter the region of light i know also that thou wert buried in this house with a vast treasure but though i have made diligent search for it and others have searched before me thy grave has never yet been discovered listen to me methought satan appeared to me in a dream last night and bade me come hither and i should find what i sought the conditions he proposed were that i should either give him my own soul or win him that of auriol darcy i assented i am here where is thy treasure after a pause he struck the portrait with his clenched hand exclaiming in a loud voice dost hear me i say old ancestor i call on thee to give me thy treasure dost hear i say and he repeated the blow with greater violence disturbed by the shock the brass plate beneath the picture started from its place and fell to the ground what is this cried rougemont gazing into the aperture left by the plate hamy invocation has been heard and snatching up the lantern he discovered at the bottom of a little recess about two feet deep a stone with an iron ring in the centre of it uttering a joyful cry he seized the ring and drew the stone forward without difficulty disclosing an open space beyond it this then is the entrance to my ancestors tomb cried rougemont there can be no doubt of it the old rosicrucian has kept his secret well but the devil has helped me to wrest it from him and now to procure the necessary implements in case as is not unlikely i should experience further difficulty with this he hastily quitted the room but returned almost immediately with a mallet a lever and a pitchfork armed with which and the lantern he crept through the aperture this done he found himself at the head of a stone staircase which he descended and came to the arched entrance of a vault the door which was of stout oak was locked but holding up the light towards it he read the following inscription post ccl annos patebo in two hundred and fifty years i shall open cried rougemont and the date why the exact time is arrived old cyprian must have foreseen what would happen and evidently intended to make me his heir there was no occasion for the devils interference and see the key is in the lock so and he turned it and pushing against the door with some force the rusty hinges gave way and it fell inwards illustration the tomb of the rosicrucian from the aperture left by the fallen door a soft and silvery light streamed forth and stepping forward rougemont found himself in a spacious vault from the ceiling of which hung a large globe of crystal containing in its heart a little flame which diffused a radiance gentle as that of the moon around this then was the everburning lamp of the rosicrucians and rougemont gazed at it with astonishment two hundred and fifty years had elapsed since that wondrous flame had been lighted and yet it burnt on brightly as ever hooped round the globe was a serpent with its tail in its mouthan emblem of eternitywrought in purest gold while above it were a pair of silver wings in allusion to the soul massive chains of the more costly metal fashioned like twisted snakes served as suspenders to the lamp but rougemonts astonishment at this marvel quickly gave way to other feelings and he gazed around the vault with greedy eyes it was a septilateral chamber about eight feet high built of stone and supported by beautifully groined arches the surface of the masonry was as smooth and fresh as if the chisel had only just left it in six of the corners were placed large chests ornamented with ironwork of the most exquisite workmanship and these rougemonts imagination pictured as filled with inexhaustible treasure while in the seventh corner near the door was a beautiful little piece of monumental sculpture in white marble representing two kneeling and hooded figures holding a veil between them which partly concealed the entrance to a small recess on one of the chests opposite the monument just described stood a strangelyformed bottle and a cup of antique workmanship both encrusted with gems the walls were covered with circles squares and diagrams and in some places were ornamented with grotesque carvings in the centre of the vault was a round altar of black marble covered with a plate of gold on which rougemont read the following inscription hoc universi compendium unius mihi sepulcrum feci here then old cyprian lies he cried and prompted by some irresistible impulse he seized the altar by the upper rim and overthrew it the heavy mass of marble fell with a thundering crash breaking asunder the flag beneath it it might be the reverberation of the vaulted roof but a deep groan seemed to reproach the young man for his sacrilege undeterred however by this warning rougemont placed the point of the lever between the interstices of the broken stone and exerting all his strength speedily raised the fragments and laid open the grave within it in the garb he wore in life with his white beard streaming to his waist lay the uncoffined body of his ancestor cyprian de rougemont the corpse had evidently been carefully embalmed and the features were unchanged by decay upon the breast with the hands placed over it lay a large book bound in black vellum and fastened with brazen clasps instantly possessing himself of this mysteriouslooking volume rougemont knelt upon the nearest chest and opened it but he was disappointed in his expectation all the pages he examined were filled with cabalistic characters which he was totally unable to decipher at length however he chanced upon one page the import of which he comprehended and he remained for some time absorbed in its contemplation while an almost fiendish smile played upon his features aha he exclaimed closing the volume i see now the cause of my extraordinary dream my ancestors wondrous power was of infernal originthe result in fact of a compact with the prince of darkness but what care i for that give me wealthno matter what source it comes fromha ha and seizing the lever he broke open the chest beside him it was filled with bars of silver the next he visited in the same way was full of gold the third was laden with pearls and precious stones and the rest contained treasure to an incalculable amount rougemont gazed at them in transports of joy at length i have my wish he cried boundless wealth and therefore boundless power is mine i can riot in pleasureriot in vengeance as to my soul i will run the risk of its perdition but it shall go hard if i destroy not that of auriol his love of play and his passion for edith talbot shall be the means by which i will work but i must not neglect another agent which is offered me that bottle i have learnt from yon volume contains an infernal potion which without destroying life shatters the brain and creates maddening fancies it will well serve my purpose and i thank thee satan for the gift chapter ii the compact about two months after this occurrence and near midnight a young man was hurrying along pall mall with a look of the wildest despair when his headlong course was suddenly arrested by a strong grasp while a familiar voice sounded in his ear it is useless to meditate selfdestruction auriol darcy cried the person who had checked him if you find life a burden i can make it tolerable to you turning round at the appeal auriol beheld a tall man wrapped in a long black cloak whose sinister features were well known to him leave me rougemont he cried fiercely i want no societyabove all not yours you know very well that you have ruined me and that nothing more is to be got from me leave me i say or i may do you a mischief tut tut auriol i am your friend replied rougemont i purpose to relieve your distress will you give me back the money you have won from me cried auriol will you pay my inexorable creditors will you save me from a prison i will do all this and more replied rougemont i will make you one of the richest men in london spare your insulting jests sir cried auriol i am in no mood to bear them i am not jesting rejoined rougemont come with me and you shall be convinced of my sincerity auriol at length assented and they turned into saint jamess square and paused before a magnificent house rougemont ascended the steps auriol who had accompanied him almost mechanically gazed at him with astonishment do you live here he inquired ask no questions replied rougemont knocking at the door which was instantly opened by a hall porter while other servants in rich liveries appeared at a distance rougemont addressed a few words in an undertone to them and they instantly bowed respectfully to auriol while the foremost of them led the way up a magnificent staircase all this was a mystery to the young man but he followed his conductor without a word and was presently ushered into a gorgeouslyfurnished and brilliantlyilluminated apartment the servant then left them and as soon as he was gone auriol exclaimed is it to mock me that you have brought me hither to mock youno replied rougemont i have told you that i mean to make you rich but you look greatly exhausted a glass of wine will revive you and as he spoke he stepped towards a small cabinet and took from it a curiouslyshaped bottle and a goblet taste this wineit has been long in our family he added filling the cup it is a strange bewildering drink cried auriol setting down the empty goblet and passing his hand before his eyes you have taken it upon an empty stomachthat is all said rougemont you will be better anon i feel as if i were going mad cried auriol it is some damnable potion you have given me ha ha laughed rougemont it reminds you of the elixir you once quaffedeh a truce to this raillery cried auriol angrily i have said i am in no mood to bear it pshaw i mean no offence rejoined the other changing his manner what think you of this house that it is magnificent replied auriol gazing around i envy you its possession it shall be yours if you please replied rougemont mine you are mocking me again not in the least you shall buy it from me if you please at what price asked auriol bitterly at a price you can easily pay replied the other come this way and we will conclude the bargain proceeding towards the farther end of the room they entered a small exquisitelyfurnished chamber surrounded with sofas of the most luxurious description in the midst was a table on which writing materials were placed it were a fruitless boon to give you this house without the means of living in it said rougemont carefully closing the door this pocketbook will furnish you with them illustration the compact notes to an immense amount cried auriol opening the pocketbook and glancing at its contents they are yours together with the house cried rougemont if you will but sign a compact with me a compact cried auriol regarding him with a look of undefinable terror who and what are you some men would call me the devil replied rougemont carelessly but you know me too well to suppose that i merit such a designation i offer you wealth what more could you require but upon what terms demanded auriol the easiest imaginable replied the other you shall judge for yourself and as he spoke he opened a writingdesk upon the table and took from it a parchment sit down he added and read this auriol complied and as he scanned the writing he became transfixed with fear and astonishment while the pocketbook dropped from his grasp after a while he looked up at rougemont who was leaning over his shoulder and whose features were wrinkled with a derisive smile then you are the fiend he cried if you will have it socertainly replied the other you are satan in the form of the man i once knew cried auriol avaunt i will have no dealings with you i thought you wiser than to indulge in such idle fears darcy rejoined the other granting even your silly notion of me to be correct why need you be alarmed you are immortal true rejoined auriol thoughtfully but yet pshaw rejoined the other sign and have done with the matter by this compact i am bound to deliver a victima female victimwhenever you shall require it cried auriol precisely replied the other you can have no difficulty in fulfilling that condition but if i fail in doing so i am doomed but you will not fail interrupted the other lighting a taper and sealing the parchment now sign it auriol mechanically took the pen and gazed fixedly on the document i shall bring eternal destruction on myself if i sign it he muttered a stroke of the pen will rescue you from utter ruin said rougemont leaning over his shoulder riches and happiness are yours you will not have such another chance tempter cried auriol hastily attaching his signature to the paper but he instantly started back aghast at the fiendish laugh that rang in his ears i repentgive it me back he cried endeavouring to snatch the parchment which rougemont thrust into his bosom it is too late cried the latter in a triumphant tone you are mineirredeemably mine ha exclaimed auriol sinking back on the couch i leave you in possession of your house pursued rougemont but i shall return in a week when i shall require my first victim your first victim oh heaven exclaimed auriol ay and my choice falls on edith talbot replied rougemont edith talbot exclaimed auriol she your victim think you i would resign her i love better than life to you it is because she loves you that i have chosen her rejoined rougemont with a bitter laugh and such will ever be the case with you seek not to love again for your passion will be fatal to the object of it when the week has elapsed i shall require edith at your hands till then farewell stay cried auriol i break the bargain with thee fiend i will have none of it i abjure thee and he rushed wildly after rougemont who had already gained the larger chamber but ere he could reach him the mysterious individual had passed through the outer door and when auriol emerged upon the gallery he was nowhere to be seen several servants immediately answered the frantic shouts of the young man and informed him that mr rougemont had quitted the house some moments ago telling them that their master was perfectly satisfied with the arrangements he had made for him and we hope nothing has occurred to alter your opinion sir said the hall porter you are sure mr rougemont is gone cried auriol oh quite sure sir cried the hall porter i helped him on with his cloak myself he said he should return this day week if he comes i will not see him cried auriol sharply mind that deny me to him and on no account whatever let him enter the house your orders shall be strictly obeyed replied the porter staring with surprise now leave me cried auriol and as they quitted him he added in a tone and with a gesture of the deepest despair all precautions are useless i am indeed lost chapter iii irresolution on returning to the cabinet where his fatal compact with rougemont had been signed auriol perceived the pocketbook lying on the floor near the table and taking it up he was about to deposit it in the writingdesk when an irresistible impulse prompted him once more to examine its contents unfolding the roll of notes he counted them and found they amounted to more than a hundred thousand pounds the sight of so much wealth and the thought of the pleasure and the power it would procure him gradually dispelled his fears and arising in a transport of delight he exclaimedyes yesall obstacles are now removed when mr talbot finds i am become thus wealthy he will no longer refuse me his daughter but i am mad he added suddenly checking himselfworse than mad to indulge such hopes if it be indeed the fiend to whom i have sold myself i have no help from perdition if it be man i am scarcely less terribly fettered in either case i will not remain here longer nor will i avail myself of this accursed money which has tempted me to my undoing and hurling the pocketbook to the farther end of the room he was about to pass through the door when a mocking laugh arrested him he looked round with astonishment and dread but could see no one after a while he again moved forward but a voice which he recognised as that of rougemont called upon him to stay it will be in vain to fly said the unseen speaker you cannot escape me whether you remain here or notwhether you use the wealth i have given you or leave it behind youyou cannot annul your bargain with this knowledge you are at liberty to go but remember on the seventh night from this i shall require edith talbot from you where are you fiend demanded auriol gazing around furiously show yourself that i may confront you a mocking laugh was the only response deigned to this injunction give me back the compact cried auriol imploringly it was signed in ignorance i knew not the price i was to pay for your assistance wealth is of no value to me without edith without wealth you could not obtain her replied the voice you are only therefore where you were but you will think better of the bargain tomorrow meanwhile i counsel you to place the money you have so unwisely cast from you safely under lock and key and to seek repose you will awaken with very different thoughts in the morning how am i to account for my sudden accession of wealth inquired auriol after a pause you a gambler and ask that question returned the unseen stranger with a bitter laugh but i will make your mind easy on that score as regards the house you will find a regular conveyance of it within that writingdesk while the note lying on the table which bears your address comes from me and announces the payment of a hundred and twenty thousand pounds to you as a debt of honour you see i have provided against every difficulty and now farewell the voice was then hushed and though auriol addressed several other questions to the unseen speaker no answer was returned him after some moments of irresolution auriol once more took up the pocketbook and deposited it in the writingdesk in which he found as he had been led to expect a deed conveying the house to him he then opened the note lying upon the table and found its contents accorded with what had just been told him placing it with the pocketbook he locked the writingdesk exclaiming it is useless to struggle furtheri must yield to fate this done he went into the adjoining room and casting his eyes about remarked the antique bottle and flagon the latter was filled to the brimhow or with what auriol paused not to examine but seizing the cup with desperation he placed it to his lips and emptied it at a draught a species of intoxication but pleasing as that produced by opium presently succeeded all his fears left him and in their place the gentlest and most delicious fancies arose surrendering himself delightedly to their influence he sank upon a couch and for some time was wrapped in a dreamy elysium imagining himself wandering with edith talbot in a lovely garden redolent of sweets and vocal with the melody of birds their path led through a grove in the midst of which was a fountain and they were hastening towards its marble brink when all at once edith uttered a scream and starting back pointed to a large black snake lying before her and upon which she would have trodden the next moment auriol sprang forward and tried to crush the reptile with his heel but avoiding the blow it coiled around his leg and plunged its venom teeth into his flesh the anguish occasioned by the imaginary wound roused him from his slumber and looking up he perceived that a servant was in attendance bowing obsequiously the man inquired whether he had occasion for anything show me to my bedroomthat is all i require replied auriol scarcely able to shake off the effect of the vision and getting up he followed the man almost mechanically out of the room chapter iv edith talbot it was late when auriol arose on the following morning at first finding himself in a large and most luxuriantlyfurnished chamber he was at a loss to conceive how he came there and it was some time before he could fully recall the mysterious events of the previous night as had been foretold however by rougemont his position did not cause him so much anxiety as before after attiring himself he descended to the lower apartments in one of which a sumptuous breakfast awaited him and having partaken of it he took a complete survey of the house and found it larger and more magnificent even than he had supposed it he next supplied himself from the pocketbook with a certain sum for which he fancied he might have occasion in the course of the day and sallied forth his first business was to procure a splendid carriage and horses and to order some new and rich habiliments to be made with the utmost expedition he then proceeded towards may fair and knocked at the door of a large house at the upper end of curzon street his heart beat violently as he was shown into an elegant drawingroom and his trepidation momentarily increased until the servant reappeared and expressed his regret that he had misinformed him in stating that miss talbot was at home both she and mr talbot he said had gone out about halfanhour ago auriol looked incredulous but without making any remark departed hurrying home he wrote a few lines to mr talbot announcing the sudden and extraordinary change in his fortune and formally demanding the hand of edith he was about to despatch this letter when a note was brought him by his servant it was from edith having ascertained his new address from his card she wrote to assure him of her constant attachment transported by this proof of her affection auriol half devoured the note with kisses and instantly sent off his own letter to her fathermerely adding a few words to say that he would call for an answer on the morrow but he had not to wait thus long for a reply ere an hour had elapsed mr talbot brought it in person mr talbot was a man of about sixtytall thin and gentlemanlike in deportment with grey hair and black eyebrows which lent considerable expression to the orbs beneath them his complexion was a bilious brown and he possessed none of the good looks which in his daughter had so captivated auriol and which it is to be presumed therefore she inherited from her mother a thorough man of the world though not an unamiable person mr talbot was entirely influenced by selfish considerations he had hitherto looked with an unfavourable eye upon auriols attentions to his daughter from a notion that the connection would be very undesirable in a pecuniary point of view but the magnificence of the house in saint jamess square which fully bore out auriols account of his newlyacquired wealth wrought a complete change in his opinions and he soon gave the young man to understand that he should be delighted to have him for a soninlaw finding him so favourably disposed auriol entreated him to let the marriage take placewithin three days if possible mr talbot was greatly grieved that he could not comply with his young friends request but he was obliged to start the next morning for nottingham and could not possibly return under three days but we can be married before you go cried auriol scarcely i fear replied mr talbot smiling blandly you must control your impatience my dear young friend on the sixth day from thisthat is on wednesday in next weekwe are now at fridayyou shall be made happy the coincidence between this appointment and the time fixed by rougemont for the delivery of his victim struck auriol forcibly his emotion however escaped mr talbot who soon after departed having engaged his future soninlaw to dine with him at seven oclock auriol it need scarcely be said was punctual to the hour or rather he anticipated it he found edith alone in the drawingroom and seated near the window which was filled with choicest flowers on seeing him she uttered an exclamation of joy and sprang to meet him the young man pressed his lips fervently to the little hand extended to him edith talbot was a lovely brunette her features were regular and her eyes which were perfectly splendid were dark almondshaped and of almost oriental languor her hair which she wore braided over her brow and gathered behind in a massive roll was black and glossy as a ravens wing her cheeks were dimpled her lips of velvet softness and her teeth like ranges of pearls perfect grace accompanied all her movements and one only wondered that feet so small as those she possessed should have the power of sustaining a form which though lightsome was yet rounded in its proportions you have heard dear edith that your father has consented to our union said auriol after gazing at her for a few moments in silent admiration edith murmured an affirmative and blushed deeply he has fixed wednesday next pursued auriol but i wish an earlier day could have been named i have a presentiment that if our marriage is so long delayed it will not take place at all you are full of misgivings auriol she replied i confess it he said and my apprehensions have risen to such a point that i feel disposed to urge you to a private marriage during your fathers absence oh no auriol much as i love you i could never consent to such a step she cried you cannot urge me to it i would not abuse my dear fathers trusting love i have never deceived him and that is the best assurance i can give you that i shall never deceive you further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of mr talbot who held out both his hands to auriol and professed the greatest delight to see him and no doubt he was sincere the dinner passed off most pleasantly and so did the evening for the old gentleman was in high spirits and his hilarity was communicated to the young couple when auriol and mr talbot went upstairs to tea they found that ediths aunt mrs maitland had arrived to take charge of her during her fathers absence this lady had always exhibited a partiality for auriol and had encouraged his suit to her niece consequently she was well satisfied with the turn affairs had taken it was near midnight before auriol could tear himself away and when he rose to depart mr talbot who had yawned frequently but fruitlessly to give him a hint told him he might depend upon seeing him back on the evening of the third day and in the meantime he committed him to the care of mrs maitland and edith three days flew by rapidly and delightfully and on the evening of the last just as the little party were assembled in the drawingroom after dinner mr talbot returned from this journey well here i am he cried clasping edith to his bosom without having encountered any misadventure on the contrary i have completed my business to my entire satisfaction oh how delighted i am to see you dear papa exclaimed edith now auriol you can have no more apprehensions apprehensions of what cried mr talbot of some accident befalling you which might have interfered with our happiness sir replied auriol oh lovers are full of idle fears cried mr talbot they are unreasonable beings however here i am as i said before safe and sound tomorrow we will finish all preliminary arrangements and the day after you shall be made happyha ha do you know papa auriol intends to give a grand ball on our weddingday and has invited all his acquaintance to it remarked edith i hope you have not invited cyprian rougemont said mr talbot regarding him fixedly i have not sir replied auriol turning pale but why do you particularise him because i have heard some things of him not much to his credit replied mr talbot whatwhat have you heard sir demanded auriol why one shouldnt believe all the ill one hears of a man and indeed i cannot believe all i have heard of cyprian rougemont replied mr talbot but i should be glad if you dropped his acquaintance altogether and now let us change the subject mr talbot seated himself beside mrs maitland and began to give her some account of his journey which appeared to have been as pleasant as it had been rapid unable to shake off the gloom which had stolen over him auriol took his leave promising to meet mr talbot at his lawyers in lincolns inn at noon on the following day he was there at the time appointed and to mr talbots great delight and the no small surprise of the lawyer paid over a hundred thousand pounds to be settled on his future wife you are a perfect man of honour auriol said mr talbot clapping him on the shoulder and i hope edith will make you an excellent wife indeed i have no doubt of it nor iif i ever possess her mentally ejaculated auriol the morning passed in other preparations in the evening the lovers met as usual and separated with the full persuasion on ediths part at least that the next day would make them happy since the night of the compact auriol had neither seen rougemont nor heard from him and he neglected no precaution to prevent his intrusion chapter v the seventh night it was a delicious morning in may and the sun shone brightly on auriols gorgeous equipage as he drove to st georges hanover square where he was united to edith thus far all seemed auspicious and he thought he could now bill defiance to fate with the object of his love close beside him and linked to him by the strongest and holiest ties it seemed impossible she could be snatched from him nothing occurred during the morning to give him uneasiness and he gave orders that a carriage and four should be ready an hour before midnight to convey him and his bride to richmond where they were to spend their honeymoon night came and with it began to arrive the guests who were bidden to the ball no expense had been spared by auriol to give splendour to his fete it was in all respects magnificent the amusements of the evening commenced with a concert which was performed by the first singers from the italian opera after which the ball was opened by auriol and his lovely bride as soon as the dance was over auriol made a sign to an attendant who instantly disappeared are you prepared to quit this gay scene with me edith he asked with a heart swelling with rapture illustration the significant whisper quite so she replied gazing at him with tenderness i long to be alone with you come then said auriol edith arose and passing her arm under that of her husband they quitted the ballroom but in place of descending the principal staircase they took a more private course the hall which they were obliged to cross and which they entered from a sidedoor was spacious and beautifully proportioned and adorned with numerous statues on pedestals the ceiling was decorated with fresco paintings and supported by two stately scagliola pillars from between these a broad staircase of white marble ascended to the upper room as auriol had foreseen the staircase was thronged with guests ascending to the ballroom the doors of which being open afforded glimpses of the dancers and gave forth strains of liveliest music anxious to avoid a newlyarrived party in the hall auriol and his bride lingered for a moment near a pillar ha who is this cried edith as a tall man with a sinister countenance and habited entirely in black moved from the farther side of the pillar and planted himself in their path with his back partly towards them a thrill of apprehension passed through auriols frame he looked up and beheld rougemont who glancing over his shoulder fixed his malignant gaze upon him retreat was now impossible you thought to delude me said rougemont in a deep whisper audible only to auriol but you counted without your host i am come to claim my victim what is the matter with you that you tremble so dear auriol cried edith who is this strange person but her husband returned no answer terror had taken away his power of utterance your carriage waits for you at the door madamall is prepared said rougemont advancing towards her and taking her hand you are coming auriol cried edith who scarcely knew whether to draw back or go forward yesyes cried auriol who fancied he saw a means of escape this is my friend mr rougemontgo with him mr rougemont cried edith you told my father he would not be here your husband did not invite me madam said rougemont with sarcastic emphasis but knowing i should be welcome i came unasked but let us avoid those persons in another moment they were at the door the carriage was there with its four horses and a manservant in travelling attire stood beside the steps reassured by the sight auriol recovered his courage and suffered rougemont to throw a cloak over ediths shoulders the next moment she tripped up the steps of the carriage and was ensconced within it auriol was about to follow her when he received a violent blow on the chest which stretched him on the pavement before he could regain his feet rougemont had sprung into the carriage the steps were instantly put up by the manservant who mounted the box with the utmost celerity while the postillions plunging spurs into their horses dashed off with lightning speed as the carriage turned the corner of king street auriol who had just arisen beheld by the light of a lamp rougemonts face at the window of the carriage charged with an expression of the most fiendish triumph what is the matter cried mr talbot who had approached auriol i came to bid you goodbye why do i find you here alone where is the carriagewhat has become of edith she is in the power of the fiend and i have sold her to him replied auriol gloomily what mean you wretch cried mr talbot in a voice of distraction i heard that cyprian rougemont was here can it be he that has gone off with her you have hit the truth replied auriol he bought her with the money i gave you i have sold her and myself to perdition horror exclaimed the old man falling backwards ay breathe your lastbreathe your last cried auriol wildly would i could yield up my life likewise and he hurried away utterly unconscious whither he went end of the intermean book the second cyprian rougemont chapter i the cell mr thorneycroft and his companions had scarcely gained a passage in the deserted house which they had entered in the manner described in a previous chapter when they were alarmed by the sudden and furious ringing of a bell overhead the noise brought them instantly to a halt and each man grasped his arms in expectation of an attack but the peal ceasing in a few moments and all continuing quiet they moved on as before and presently reached a large hall with a lofty window over the door which being without shutters afforded light enough to reveal the dilapidated condition of the mansion from this hall four side doors opened apparently communicating with different chambers three of which were cautiously tried by reeks but they proved to be fastened the fourth however yielded to his touch and admitted them to a chamber which seemed to have been recently occupied for a lamp was burning within it the walls were panelled with dusky oak and hung at the lower end with tapestry representing the assyrian monarch ninus and his captive zoroaster king of the bactrians the chief furniture consisted of three large highbacked and grotesquelycarved armchairs near one of which stood a powerful electrical machine squares and circles were traced upon the floor and here and there were scattered cups and balls and other matters apparently belonging to a conjuring apparatus the room might be the retreat of a man of science or it might be the repository of a juggler but whoever its occupant was and whatsoever his pursuits the good things of the world were not altogether neglected by him as was proved by a table spread with viands and furnished with glasses together with a couple of tapernecked bottles while glancing upwards mr thorneycroft remarked that just above each chair the ceiling was pierced with a round hole the meaning of which he could not at the time comprehend though after circumstances sufficiently explained it to him a singular room he observed to reeks on concluding his survey did you expect to find any one here i hardly know replied the other that bell may have given the alarm but i will soon ascertain the point remain here till i return you are not going to leave us rejoined mr thorneycroft uneasily only for a moment said reeks keep quiet and no harm will befall you whatever you may hear without do not stir what are we likely to hear asked thorneycroft with increasing trepidation thats impossible to say answered reeks but i warn you not to cry out unnecessarily as such an imprudence would endanger our safety you are quite sure you dont mean to abandon us persisted thorneycroft make yourself easy i have no such intention rejoined reeks sternly oh vell take care on you dont be afeerd old gent said ginger yes vell take care on you added the tinker and the sandman you may depend upon them as upon me sir said reeks before we explore the subterranean apartments i wish to see whether any one is upstairs wots that you say about subterranean apartments mr reeks interposed ginger ve aint agoin below eh but without paying any attention to the inquiry reeks quitted the room and closed the door carefully after him he next crossed the hall and cautiously ascending a staircase at the farther end of it reached the landingplace beyond it was a gallery from which several chambers opened advancing a few paces he listened intently and hearing a slight sound in an apartment to the right he stepped softly towards it and placing his eye to the keyhole beheld a tall man dressed in black pacing to and fro with rapid strides while three other persons wrapped in sable gowns and disguised with hideous masks stood silent and motionless at a little distance from him in the tall man he recognised cyprian rougemont upon a table in the middle of the room was laid a large open volume bound in black vellum near it stood a lamp which served to illumine the scene suddenly rougemont stopped and turning over several leaves of the book which were covered with cabalistic characters appeared in search of some magic formula before he could find it however a startling interruption occurred an alarumbell fixed against the wall began to ring and at the same moment the doors of a cabinet flew open and a large ape for such it seemed to reeks clothed in a woollen shirt and drawers sprang forth and bounding upon the table beside rougemont placed its mouth to his ear the communication thus strangely made seemed highly displeasing to rougemont who knitted his brows and delivered some instructions in an undertone to the monkey the animal nodded its head in token of obedience jumped off the table and bounded back to the cabinet the doors of which closed as before rougemont next took up the lamp with the evident intention of quitting the room seeing which reeks hastily retreated to an adjoining chamber the door of which was fortunately open and had scarcely gained its shelter when the four mysterious personages appeared on the gallery reeks heard their footsteps descending the staircase and then creeping cautiously after them watched them across the hall and pause before the chamber containing mr thorneycroft and his companions after a moments deliberation rougemont noiselessly locked the door took out the key and leaving two of his attendants on guard returned with the third towards the staircase without tarrying to confront them reeks started back and hurried along the gallery till he came to a back staircase which conducted him by various descents to the basement floor where after traversing one or two vaults he entered a subterranean passage arched overhead and having several openings at the sides apparently communicating with other passages it was lighted at intervals by lamps which emitted a feeble radiance by the light of one of these reeks discovered the door of a cell it was of iron and as he struck it with his hand returned a hollow clangour on repeating the blow a hoarse voice from within cried leave me in peace is it auriol darcy who speaks demanded reeks it is replied the prisoner who are you that put the question a friend replied reeks i have no friend here said auriol you are mistaken rejoined reeks i have come with mr thorneycroft to deliver you mr thorneycroft has come too late he has lost his daughter replied auriol what has happened to her demanded reeks she is in the power of the fiend replied auriol i know she is detained by cyprian rougemont said reeks but what has befallen her she has become like his other victimslike my victims cried auriol distractedly do not despair rejoined reeks she may yet be saved saved how cried auriol all is over so it may seem to you rejoined reeks but you are the victim of delusion oh that i could think so exclaimed auriol but noi saw her fall into the pit i beheld her veiled figure rise from it i witnessed her signature to the fatal scroll there could be no illusion in what i then beheld despite all this you will see her again said reeks who are you who give me this promise asked auriol as i have already declared a friend replied reeks are you human as yourself then you seek in vain to struggle with the powers of darkness said auriol i have no fear of cyprian rougemont rejoined reeks with a laugh your voice seems familiar to me said auriol tell me who you are you shall know anon replied reeks but histwe are interrupted some one approaches chapter ii the enchanted chairs more than ten minutes had elapsed since reeks departure and mr thorneycroft who had hitherto had some difficulty in repressing his anger now began to give vent to it in muttered threats and complaints his impatience was shared by the tinker who stepping up to ginger said wot the devil can mr reeks be about i hope nuffin has happened to him dont mention a certain gents name here remarked ginger or if you do treat it vith proper respect pshaw exclaimed the tinker impatiently i dont like a man stayin avay in this manner it looks suspicious i wotes ve goes and sees arter him ve can leave the old gent to take a keviet nap by himself dont disturb yourself sir vell only jist giv a look about us and then come back stay where you are rascal cried thorneycroft angrily i wont be left stay where you are i command you vell veve got a noo captain im athinkin said the tinker winking at the others veve no vish to disobleege you sir ill only jist peep out into the hall and see if mr reeks is anyvhere thereabouts vy zounds he added as he tried the door its locked whats locked cried thorneycroft in dismay the door to be sure replied the tinker vere prisoners o lord you dont say so cried the ironmerchant in an agony of fright what will become of us a roar of laughter from the others converted his terror into fury i see how it is he cried you have entrapped me ruffians its all a trick you mean to murder me but ill sell my life dearly the first who approaches shall have his brains blown out and as he spoke he levelled a pistol at the tinkers head holloa wot are you arter sir cried that individual sheltering his head with his hands youre alabourin under a mistakea complete mistake if it is a trap vere catched in it as vell as yourself to be sure ve is added the sandman sit down and vait a bit i dessay mr reeksll come back and it vont do no good gettin into a passion well well i must resign myself i suppose groaned thorneycroft sinking into a chair its a terrible situation to be placed inshut up in a haunted house ive been in many much vurser sitivations observed ginger and i alvays found the best vay to get out on em wos to take things quietly besides theres no help for it said the tinker seating himself that remains to be seen observed the sandman taking the chair opposite thorneycroft if reeks dont come back soon ill bust open the door plenty o time for that said ginger sauntering towards the table on which the provisions were spread wot do you say to a mouthful o wittles i wouldnt touch em for the world replied the sandman nor i added the tinker they may be pisoned pisonednonsense cried ginger dont you see some von has been atakin his supper here ill jist finish it for him vith all my art said the tinker dont touch it on any account cried mr thorneycroft i agree with your companions it may be poisoned oh i aint afeerd cried ginger helping himself to a dish before him as good a pigeonpie as ever i tasted your health mr thorneycroft he added filling a goblet from one of the bottles my service to you gents famous tipple by jove drawing a long breath after the draught and smacking his lips with amazing satisfaction never tasted sich a glass o wine in all my born days he continued replenishing the goblet i wonder wot its called prussic acid replied mr thorneycroft gruffly proossic fiddlestick cried ginger more likely tokay i shall finish the bottle and never be the vorse for it hes gettin svipy said the tinker i vonder vether its really tokay no such thing cried thorneycroft let him alone i must taste it said the tinker unable to resist the temptation here give us a glass ginger vith pleasure replied ginger filling a goblet to the brim and handing it to him youd better be perwailed upon sandy vell i spose i must replied the sandman taking the goblet proffered him heres the beaks healths cried ginger i gives that toast cos theyre alvays so kind to us dogfanciers dogfancierssay rather dogstealers for thats the name such vagabonds deserve to be known by said mr thorneycroft with some asperity vell ve vont quarrel about names replied ginger laughing but ill relate a circumstance to you asll prove that wotever your opinion of our wocation may be the beaks upholds it there can be but one opinion as to your nefarious profession said mr thorneycroft and that is that its as bad as horsestealing and sheepstealing and should be punished as those offences are punished so i think sir said ginger winking at the others but to my story and dont interrupt me or i cant get through vith it properly theres a gent livin not a hundred miles from pall mall as the noospapers says as had a favourite scotch terrier not worth more nor halfacrown to any one but hisself but highly wallerable to him cos it wos a favourite vell the dog is lost a pal of mine gets hold on it and the gent soon offers a reward for its recovery this dont bring it back quite so soon as he expects cos he dont offer enough so he goes to an agent mr simpkins in the edger road and mr simpkins says to himsays he how are you sir i expected you some days ago youve comd about that ere scotch terrier youve got a wallable greyhound i understand a man told me hed have that afore long seein the gent stare mr s adds vel ill tell you wot you must give for your dog the party vont take less than six guineas he knows it aint vorth six shillin but its a great favourite and has given him a precious sight o trouble in gettin it give him trouble cries the gent angrilyand what has it given me i hope to see the rascal hanged i shall pay no such money werry vell replies mr simpkins coolly then your dogll be bled to death as the noblemans wos and thrown down a breathless carkis afore your door you dont mean to say that such a horrid circumstance as that really took place cried thorneycroft who was much interested in the relation only tother day i assure you replied ginger id shoot the ruffian who treated a dog of mine so if i caught him cried mr thorneycroft indignantly and sarve him right too said ginger i discourages all cruelty to hanimals but dont interrupt me again arter a bit more chafferin vith mr simpkins the gent offers three pound for his dog and then goes avay next day he reads a report i the times noospaper that a man has been taken up for dogstealin and that a lot o dogs is shut up in the greenyard behind the policeoffice in bow street so he goes there in search o his favourite and sure enough he finds it but the inspector vont give it up to him cos the superintendent is out o the vay shameful cried mr thorneycroft shameful indeed sir echoed ginger laughing thinkin his dog safe enough in the hands o the police the gent sleeps soundly that night but ven he goes back next mornin he finds it has disappeared the greenyard has been broken into overnight and all the dogs stolen from it under the noses of the police cried thorneycroft under their werry noses replied ginger but now comes the cream o the jest you shall hear wot the beak says to him ven the gent craves his assistance i cant interfere in the matter says he abendin of his brows in a majestic manner parties dont ought to come here vith complaints of vhich i cant take notice this place aint an advertisin office and i shant suffer it to be made von i vont listen to statements affectin the characters of absent parties statements affectin our charactersdo you tvig that sir i do indeed said thorneycroft sighing and i am sorry to think such a remark should have dropped from the bench youre right to say dropped from it sir laughed ginger i told you the beaks vos our best friends they alvays takes our parts ven the gent urges that it was a subject of serous importance to all dogowners the magistrit angrily interrupts him sayinthen let there be a meetin of dogowners to discuss their grievances dont come to me i cant help you and he vouldnt if he could cos hes the dogfanciers friend it looks like it i must own replied thorneycroft such reprehensible indifference gives encouragement to people of your profession government itself is to blame as all persons who keep dogs pay a tax for them their property ought to be protected im quite satisfied vith the present state of the law said ginger heres the vorthy beak ill drink his health a second time halloa wots that cried the tinker i thought i heerd a noise so did i rejoined the sandman a strange sort o rumblin sound overhead there it goes again cried ginger wot an awful din now its underneath said mr thorneycroft turning pale and trembling it sounds as if some hidden machinery were at work the noise which up to this moment had borne an indistinct resemblance to the creaking of wheels and pulleys now increased to a violent clatter while the house was shaken as if by the explosion of a mine beneath it at the same time the occupants of the chairs received a sharp electrical shock that agitated every limb and caused mr thorneycroft to let fall his pistol which went off as it reached the ground at the same time the sandman dropped his goblet and the tinker relinquished his grasp of the cutlass before they could recover from the shock all three were caught by stout wooden hooks which detaching themselves from the back of the chairs pinioned their arms while their legs were restrained by fetters which sprang from the ground and clasped round their ankles thus fixed they struggled vainly to get free the chairs seemed nailed to the ground so that all efforts to move them proved futile but the worst was to come from the holes in the ceiling already alluded to descended three heavy bellshaped helmets fashioned like those worn by divers at the bottom of the sea and having round eyeletholes of glass it was evident from the manner of their descent that these helmets must drop on the heads of the sittersa conviction that filled them with inexpressible terror they shouted and swore frightfully but their vociferations availed them nothing down came the helmets and the same moment the monkey which had been seen by reeks issued from a cupboard at the top of a cabinet and grinned and gibbered at them down came the first helmet and covered the tinker to the shoulders his appearance was at once ludicrous and terrible and his roaring within the casque sounded like the bellowing of a baited bull down came the second helmet though rather more slowly and the sandman was eclipsed in the same manner as the tinker and roared as loudly illustration the enchanted chairs in both these instances the helmets had dropped without guidance but in the case of mr thorneycroft a hand thrust out of the hole in the ceiling held the helmet suspended over his head like the sword of damocles while the poor ironmerchant momentarily expected the same doom as his companions his attention was attracted towards the monkey which clinging with one hand to the side of the cabinet extended the other skinny arm towards him and exclaimedwill you swear to go hence if you are spared no i will not replied the ironmerchant he had scarcely spoken when the helmet fell with a jerk and extinguished him like the others ginger alone remained during the whole of this strange scene he had stood with the bottle in hand transfixed with terror and astonishment and wholly unable to move or cry out a climax was put to his fright by the descent of the three chairs with their occupants through the floor into a vault beneath and as the helmets were whisked up again to the ceiling and the trapdoors closed upon the chairs he dropped the bottle and fell with his face upon the table he was however soon roused by a pull at his hair while a shrill voice called him by his name who is it groaned the dogfancier look up cried the speaker again plucking his hair ginger complied and beheld the monkey seated beside him vy it cant be surely he cried and yet i could almost svear it was old parr youre near the mark replied the other with a shrill laugh it is your venerable friend vot the deuce are you doing here and in this dress or rayther undress inquired ginger ven i see you this mornin you wos in the serwice of mr loftus ive got a new master since then replied the dwarf im sorry to hear it said ginger shaking his head you havent sold yourself like doctor forstereh faustus my dear gingernot forster corrected old parr no no ive made no bargain and to be plain with you ive no desire to remain long in my present masters service i dont like to ask the question too directly wenerable said ginger in a deprecatory tonebut is your masterhemis hehemthethe the devil you would say supplied old parr between ourselves im afraid theres no denying it la wot a horrible idea exclaimed ginger with a shudder it makes the flesh creep on ones bones then were in your masters power very like it replied old parr and there aint no chance o deliverance none that occurs to me o lord o lord groaned ginger ill repent ill become a reformed character ill never steal dogs no more in that case there may be some chance for you said old parr i think i could help you to escape come with me and ill try and get you out but wot is to become of the others demanded ginger oh leave them to their fate replied old parr no thatll never do cried ginger vere all in the same boat and must row out together the best vay ve can i tell you wot it is wenerable he added seizing him by the throatyour master may be the devil but youre mortal and if you dont help me to deliver my companions ill squeege your windpipe for you thats not the way to induce me to help you said old parr twisting himself like an eel out of the others gripe now get out if you can dont be angry cried ginger seeing the mistake he had committed and trying to conciliate him i only meant to frighten you a bit can you tell me if mr auriol darcy is here yes he is and a close prisoner replied old parr and the girlmiss ebber wot of her i cant say rejoined old parr i can only speak to the living then shes dead cried ginger with a look of horror thats a secret replied the dwarf mysteriously and im bound by a terrible oath not to disclose it ill have it out of you notvithstandin muttered ginger i vish you would lend me a knock on the head old feller i cant help thinkin ive got a terrible fit o the nightmare let this waken you then said old parr giving him a sound buffet on the ear holloa wenerable not so hard cried ginger ha ha ha screamed the dwarf you know what youre about now not exactly said ginger i vish i wos fairly out o this cursed place you shouldnt have ventured into the lions den said old parr in a taunting tone but come with me and perhaps i may be able to do something towards your liberation so saying he drew aside the tapestry and opened a panel behind it through which he passed and beckoned ginger to follow him taking a pistol from his pocket the latter complied chapter iii gerard paston before the chair in which mr thorneycroft was fixed reached the ground terror had taken away his senses a bottle of salts placed to his nose revived him after a time but he had nearly relapsed into insensibility on seeing two strange figures in hideous masks and sable cloaks standing on either side of him while at a little distance was a third who carried a strangelyfashioned lantern he looked round for his companions in misfortune but though the chairs were there they were unoccupied the masked attendants paid no attention to the ironmerchants cries and entreaties but as soon as they thought him able to move they touched a spring which freed his arms and legs from their bondage and raising him dragged him out of the vault and along a narrow passage till they came to a large sepulchrallooking chamber cased with black marble in the midst of which on a velvet fauteuil of the same hue as the walls sat cyprian rougemont it was in fact the chamber where ebba had been subject to her terrible trial bewildered with terror the poor ironmerchant threw himself at the feet of rougemont who eyeing him with a look of malignant triumph cried you have come to seek your daughter behold her and at the words the large black curtains at the farther end of the room were suddenly withdrawn and discovered the figure of ebba thorneycroft standing at the foot of the marble staircase her features were as pale as death her limbs rigid and motionless but her eyes blazed with preternatural light on beholding her mr thorneycroft uttered a loud cry and springing to his feet would have rushed towards her but he was held back by the two masked attendants who seized each arm and detained him by main force ebba he criedebba but she appeared wholly insensible to his cries and remained in the same attitude with her eyes turned away from him what ails her cried the agonised father ebba ebba call louder said rougemont with a jeering laugh do you not know me do you not hear me shrieked mr thorneycroft still the figure remained immovable i told you you should see her replied rougemont in a taunting tone but she is beyond your reach not so not so cried thorneycroft come to me ebbacome to your father o heaven she hears me not she heeds me not her senses are gone she is fast bound by a spell said rougemont take a last look of her you will see her no more and stretching out his hand the curtains slowly descended and shrouded the figure from view thorneycroft groaned aloud are you not content cried rougemont will you depart in peace and swear never to come here more if so i will liberate you and your companions so far from complying with your request i swear never to rest till i have rescued my child from you accursed being cried thorneycroft energetically you have sealed your doom then replied rougemont but before you are yourself immured you shall see how auriol darcy is circumstanced bring him along and followed by the attendants who dragged mr thorneycroft after him he plunged into an opening on the right a few steps brought him to the entrance of the cell touching the heavy iron door it instantly swung open and disclosed auriol chained to a stone at the farther corner of the narrow chamber not a word was spoken for some minutes but the captives regarded each other piteously oh mr thorneycroft cried auriol at length i beseech you forgive me i have destroyed your daughter you exclaimed the ironmerchant in astonishment it is true said rougemont i would have saved her if it had been possible cried auriol i warned her that to love me would be fatal to her i told her i was linked to an inexorable destiny which would involve her in its meshesbut in vain oh ejaculated thorneycroft you see you ought to blame him not me said rougemont with a derisive laugh i would have given my life my soul to preserve her had it been possible cried auriol horrors crowd so thick upon me that my brain reels cried thorneycroft merciless wretch he added to rougemont fiendwhatever you are complete your work of ruin by my destruction i have nothing left to tie me to life i would have the miserable live said rougemont with a diabolical laugh it is only the happy i seek to destroy but you have to thank your own obstinacy for your present distress bid a lasting farewell to auriol you will see him no more hold exclaimed auriol a word before we part ay hold echoed a loud and imperious voice from the depths of the passage hawho speaks demanded rougemont a shade passing over his countenance i gerard paston exclaimed reeks stepping forward the crape was gone from his brow and in its place was seen the handsome and resolute features of a man of middle life he held a pistol in either hand is it you gerard paston cried auriol regarding him the brother of clara my second victim it is replied the other your deliverance is at hand auriol and you have dared to penetrate here gerard cried rougemont stamping the ground with rage recollect you are bound to me by the same ties as auriol and you shall share his fate i am not to be intimidated by threats replied paston with a scornful laugh you have employed your arts too long deliver up auriol and this gentleman at once or and he levelled the pistols at him fire cried rougemont drawing himself up to his towering height no earthly bullets can injure me vell try that cried ginger coming up at the moment behind paston and he discharged a pistol with a deliberate aim at the breast of rougemont the latter remained erect and apparently uninjured you see how ineffectual your weapons are said rougemont with a derisive laugh it must be the devil cried ginger running off i will try mine said paston but before he could draw the triggers the pistols were wrested from his grasp by the two attendants who had quitted thorneycroft and stolen upon him unperceived and who next pinioned his arms chapter iv the pit so bewildered was the poor ironmerchant by the strange and terrible events that had befallen him that though released by the two masked attendants who left him as before related to seize gerard paston he felt utterly incapable of exertion and would probably have made no effort to regain his freedom if his coat had not been vigorously plucked behind while a low voice urged him to fly glancing in the direction of the friendly speaker he could just discern a diminutive object standing within the entrance of a sidepassage and reared up against the wall so as to be out of sight of rougemont and his attendants it was the monkeyor rather old parrwho continuing to tug violently at his coat at last succeeded in drawing him backwards into the passage and then grasping his hand tightly hurried him along it the passage was wholly unlighted but mr thorneycroft could perceive that it was exceedingly circuitous and winded round like a maze where are you taking me he inquired attempting to stop ask no questions rejoined the dwarf pulling him along do you want to be captured and shut up in a cell for the rest of your life certainly not replied thorneycroft accelerating his movements i hope theres no chance of it theres every chance of it rejoined old parr if youre taken youll share auriols fate o lord i hope not groaned the ironmerchant i declare you frighten me so much that you take away all power of movement i shall drop in a minute come along i say screamed the dwarf i hear them close behind us and as he spoke shouts and the noise of rapidlyapproaching footsteps resounded along the passage i cant stir another step gasped the ironmerchant im completely done better yield at once what without a struggle cried the dwarf tauntingly think of your daughter and let the thought of her nerve your heart she is lost for ever if you dont get out of this accursed place she is lost for ever as it is cried the ironmerchant despairingly noshe may yet be saved rejoined the dwarf come oncome onthey are close behind us and it was evident from the increased clamour that their pursuers were upon them roused by the imminence of the danger and by the hope of rescuing his daughter mr thorneycroft exerted all his energies and sprang forward a little farther on they were stopped by a door it was closed and venting his disappointment in a scream the dwarf searched for the handle but could not find it we are entrappedwe shall be caught he cried and then woe to both of us fool that i was to attempt your preservation better i had left you to rot in a dungeon than have incurred rougemonts displeasure the ironmerchant replied by a groan its all over with me he said i give it upill die here nowe are saved cried the dwarf as the light now flashing strongly upon the door revealed a small iron button within itsavedsaved as he spoke he pressed against the button which moved a spring and the door flew open just as they passed through it the two masked attendants came in sight the dwarf instantly shut the door and finding a bolt on the side next him shot it into the socket scarcely had he accomplished this when the pursuers came up and dashed themselves against the door but finding it bolted presently ceased their efforts and apparently withdrew they are gone by some other way to intercept us cried old parr who had paused for a moment to listen come on mr thorneycroft ill try replied the ironmerchant with a subdued groan but im completely spent oh that i ever ventured into this place its too late to think of that now besides you came here to rescue your daughter rejoined old parr take care and keep near me i wonder where this passage leads to dont you know inquired the ironmerchant not in the least returned the dwarf this is the first time ive been hereand it shall be the last if im allowed any choice in the matter you havent told me how you came here at all observed thorneycroft i hardly know myself replied the dwarf but i find it more difficult to get out than i did to get in how this passage twists about i declare we seem to be returning to the point we started from i think we are turning round ourselves cried thorneycroft in an agony of fright my head is going oh dear oh dear why it does seem very strange i must say remarked the dwarf coming to a halt i could almost fancy that the solid stone walls were moving around us they are moving cried thorneycroft stretching out his hand i feel em lord have mercy upon us and deliver us from the power of the evil one the place seems on fire cried the dwarf a thick smoke fills the passage dont you perceive it mr thorneycroft dont ito be sure i do cried the ironmerchant coughing and sneezing i feel as if i were in a room with a smoky chimney and no window open ohohim choking dont mind it cried the dwarf who seemed quite at his ease we shall soon be out of the smoke i cant stand it cried mr thorneycroft i shall die oh poahpishpuff come on i tell youyoull get some fresh air in a minute rejoined old parr halloa hows this no outlet were come to a dead stop dead stop indeed echoed the ironmerchant weve come to that long ago but what new difficulty has arisen merely that the roads blocked up by a solid wallthats all replied old parr blocked up exclaimed thorneycroft then were entombed alive i am said the dwarf with affected nonchalance as to you youve the comfort of knowing itll soon be over with you but for me nothing can harm me dont be too sure of that cried a voice above them did you speak mr thorneycroft asked the dwarf noonot i gasped the ironmerchant im suffocatinghelp to drag me out get out if you can cried the voice that had just spoken its rougemont himself cried the dwarf in alarm then theres no escape none whatever rascal replied the unseen speaker i want you i have more work for you to do i wont leave mr thorneycroft cried the dwarf resolutely ive promised to preserve him and ill keep my word fool cried the other you must obey when i command and as the words were uttered a hand was thrust down from above which grasping the dwarf by the nape of the neck drew him upwards lay hold of me mr thorneycroft screamed old parr im going up againlay hold of mepull me down wellnigh stifled by the thickening and pungent vapour the poor ironmerchant found compliance impossible before he could reach the dwarf the little fellow was carried off left to himself mr thorneycroft staggered along the passage expecting every moment to drop until at length a current of fresh air blew in his face and enabled him to breathe more freely somewhat revived he went on but with great deliberation and it was well he did so for he suddenly arrived at the brink of a pit about eight feet in depth into which if he had approached it incautiously he must infallibly have stumbled and in all probability have broken his neck this pit evidently communicated with a lower range of chambers as was shown by a brazen lamp burning under an archway a ladder was planted at one side and by this mr thorneycroft descended but scarcely had he set foot on the ground than he felt himself rudely grasped by a man who stepped from under the archway the next moment however he was released while the familiar voice of the tinker exclaimed vy bless my art if it aint mister thorneycroft yes its me certainly mr tinker replied the ironmerchant whos that youve got with you vy who should it be but the sandman rejoined the other gruffly veve set ourselves free at last and have made some nice diskiveries into the bargin yes veve found it all out added the tinker what have you discoveredwhat have you found out cried the ironmerchant breathlessly have you found my daughter where is she take me to her not so fast old gent not so fast rejoined the tinker ve aint sure as ow

archway halloa sandy did you shut the door arter you not i replied the other open it easily said rejoined the tinker but not quevite so easily done vy zounds its shut of itself and bolted itself on tother side some one must have followed you groaned thorneycroft were watched on all sides ay and from above too cried the sandman look up there he added in accents of alarm whats the matter what new danger is at hand inquired the ironmerchant look up i say cried the sandman dont ye see tinker ay ay i see replied the other the roofs acomin in upon us lets get out o this as fast as ve can and he kicked and pushed against the door but all his efforts were unavailing to burst it open at the same time the sandman rushed towards the ladder but before he could mount it all egress by that means was cut off an immense iron cover worked in a groove was pushed by some unseen machinery over the top of the pit and enclosed them in it chapter v new perplexities for several hours deep sleep occasioned by some potent medicaments had bound up the senses of auriol on awaking he found himself within a cell the walls the floor and the ceiling of which were of solid stone masonry in the midst of this chamber and supporting the ponderous roof stood a massive granite pillar the capital of which was grotesquely ornamented with deathsheads and crossbones and against this pillar leaned auriol with his left arm chained by heavy links of iron to a ring in the adjoining wall beside him stood a pitcher of water and near him lay an antiquelooking book bound in black vellum the dungeon in which he was confined was circular in form with a coved roof sustained by the pillar before mentioned and was approached by a steep flight of steps rising from a doorway placed some six feet below the level of the chamber and surmounted by a pointed arch a stream of light descending from a narrow aperture in the roof fell upon his wasted and haggard features his darkbrown hair hung about his face in elflocks his beard was untrimmed and a fixed and stony glare like that of insanity sat in his eye he was seated on the groundneither bench nor stool being allowed himwith his hand supporting his chin his gaze was fixed upon vacancyif that can he called vacancy which to him was filled with vivid images his garb was not that of modern times but consisted of a doublet and hose of rich material wrought in the fashion of elizabeths days after remaining for some time in this musing attitude auriol opened the old tome before him and began to turn over its leaves it was full of magical disquisitions and mysterious characters and he found inscribed on one of its earlier pages a name which instantly riveted his attention having vainly sought some explanation of this name in the after contents of the book he laid it aside and became lost in meditation his reverie ended he heaved a deep sigh and turned again to the open volume lying before him and in doing so his eye rested for the first time on his habiliments on beholding them he started and held out his arm to examine his sleeve more narrowly satisfied that he was not deceived he arose and examined himself from head to foot he found himself as has been stated attired in the garb of a gentleman of elizabeths time what can this mean he cried have i endured a long and troubled dream during which i have fancied myself living through more than two centuries o heaven that it may be so oh that the fearful crimes i suppose i have committed have only been enacted in a dream oh that my victims are imaginary oh that ebba should only prove a lovely phantom of the night and yet i could almost wish the rest were realso that she might exist i cannot bear to think that she is nothing more than a vision but it must be soi have been dreamingand what a dream it has beenwhat strange glimpses it has afforded me into futurity methought i lived in the reigns of many sovereignsbeheld one of them carried to the blocksaw revolutions convulse the kingdomold dynasties shaken down and new ones spring up fashions seem to me to have so changed that i had clean forgotten the old ones while my fellowmen scarcely appeared the same as heretofore can i be the same myself is this the dress i once wore let me seek for some proof and thrusting his hand into his doublet he drew forth some tablets and hastily examined them they bore his name and contained some writing and he exclaimed aloud with joy this is proof enoughi have been dreaming all this while the scheme works to a miracle muttered a personage stationed at the foot of the steps springing from the doorway and who though concealed from view himself was watching the prisoner with a malignant and exulting gaze and yet why am i here pursued auriol looking around ah i see how it is he added with a shudder i have been madperhaps am mad still that will account for the strange delusion under which i have laboured i will act upon that hint muttered the listener of what use is memory continued auriol musingly if things that are not seem as if they were if joys and sorrows which we have never endured are stamped upon the brainif visions of scenes and faces and events which we have never witnessed never known haunt us as if they had once been familiar but i am madmad the listener laughed to himself how else if i were not mad could i have believed that i had swallowed the fabled elixir vitae and yet is it a fable for i am puzzled still methinks i am oldoldoldthough i feel young and look young all this is madness yet how clear and distinct it seems i can call to mind events in charles the seconds time hawho told me of charles the second how know i there was such a king the reigning sovereign should be james and yet i fancy it is george the fourth oh i am madclean mad there was another pause during which the listener indulged in a suppressed fit of laughter would i could look forth from this dungeon pursued auriol again breaking silence and satisfy myself of the truth or falsehood of my doubts by a view of the external world for i am so perplexed in mind that if i were not distracted already they would be enough to drive me so what dismal terrible fancies have possessed me and weigh upon me stillthe compact with rougemontha now it comes cried the listener oh that i could shake off the conviction that this were not sothat my soul though heavily laden might still be saved oh that i dared to hope this i must interrupt him if he pursues this strain said the listener illustration rougemonts device to perplex auriol whether my crimes are real or imaginarywhether i snatched the cup of immortality from my grandsires dying lipswhether i signed a compact with the fiend and delivered him a victim on each tenth yeari cannot now know but if it is so i deeply bitterly regret them and would expiate my offences by a life of penance at this moment rougemont attired in a dress similar to that of the prisoner marched up the steps and cried what ho auriolauriol darcy who speaks demanded auriol ah is it you fiend what you are still in your old fancies rejoined rougemont i thought the draught i gave you last night would have amended you tell me who and what i am cried auriol stupefied with astonishment in what age i am living and whether i am in my right mind or not for the first you are called auriol darcy replied rougemont for the second you are living in the reign of his most catholic majesty james i of england and sixth of scotland and for the third i trust you will soon recover your reason amazement cried auriol striking his brow with his clenched hand then i am mad its plain your reason is returning since you are conscious of your condition replied rougemont but calm yourself you have been subject to raging frenzies and i have been shut up here for safety demanded auriol precisely observed the other and you are your keeper replied rougemont my god what a brain mine must be cried auriol answer me one questionis there such a person as ebba thorneycroft you have often raved about her replied rougemont but she is a mere creature of the imagination auriol groaned and sank against the wall since you have become so reasonable you shall again go forth into the world said rougemont but the first essay must be made at night for fear of attracting observation i will come to you again a few hours hence farewell for the present and casting a sinister glance at his captive he turned upon his heel descended the steps and quitted the cell chapter vi doctor lamb again night came and the cell grew profoundly dark auriol became impatient for the appearance of his keeper but hour after hour passed and he did not arrive worn out at length with doubt and bewildering speculations the miserable captive was beset with the desire to put an end to his torments by suicide and he determined to execute his fell purpose without delay an evil chance seemed also to befriend him for scarcely was the idea formed than his foot encountered something on the ground the rattling of which attracted his attention and stooping to take it up he grasped the bare blade of a knife this will at all events solve my doubts he cried aloud i will sheathe this weapon in my heart and if i am mortal my woes will be ended as he spoke he placed the point to his breast with the full intent to strike but before he could inflict the slightest wound his arm was forcibly arrested would you destroy yourself madman roared a voice i thought your violence was abated and that you might go forth in safety but i find you are worse than ever auriol uttered a groan and let the knife fall to the ground the newcomer kicked it to a distance with his foot you shall be removed to another chamber he pursued where you can be more strictly watched take me forthoh take me forth cried auriol it was a mere impulse of desperation which i now repent i dare not trust you you will commit some act of insane fury for which i myself shall have to bear the blame when i yielded to your entreaties on a former occasion and took you forth i narrowly prevented you from doing all we met a mischief i have no recollection of any such circumstance returned auriol mournfully but it may be true nevertheless and if so it only proves the lamentable condition to which i am reducedmemory and reason gone ay both gone cried the other with an irrepressible chuckle ha exclaimed auriol starting i am not so mad but i recognise in you the evil being who tempted me i am not so oblivious as to forget our terrible interviews what you are in your lunes again cried rougemont fiercely nay then i must call my assistants and bind you let me belet me be implored auriol and i will offend you no more whatever thoughts may arise within me i will not give utterance to them only take me forth i came for that purpose said rougemont but i repeat i dare not you are not sufficiently master of yourself try me said auriol well rejoined the other i will see what i can do to calm you so saying he disappeared for a few moments and then returning with a torch placed it on the ground and producing a phial handed it to the captive drink he said without a moments hesitation auriol complied it seems to me rather a stimulant than a soothing potion he remarked after emptying the phial you are in no condition to judge rejoined the other and he proceeded to unfasten auriols chain now then come with me he said and do not make any attempt at evasion or you will rue it like one in a dream auriol followed his conductor down the flight of stone steps leading from the dungeon and along a narrow passage as he proceeded he thought he heard stealthy footsteps behind him but he never turned his head to see whether he was really followed in this way they reached a short steep staircase and mounting it entered a vault in which rougemont paused and placed the torch he had brought with him upon the floor its lurid glimmer partially illumined the chamber and showed that it was built of stone rude benches of antique form were set about the vault and motioning auriol to be seated upon one of them rougemont sounded a silver whistle the summons was shortly afterwards answered by the dwarf in whose attire a new change had taken place he was now clothed in a jerkin of grey serge fashioned like the garments worn by the common people in elizabeths reign and wore a trenchercap on his head auriol watched him as he timidly advanced towards rougemont and had an indistinct recollection of having seen him before but could not call to mind how or where is your master abed demanded rougemont abed good lack sir exclaimed the dwarf little of sleep knows doctor lamb he will toil at the furnace till the stars have set doctor lamb repeated auriol surely i have heard that name before very likely replied rougemont for it is the name borne by your nearest kinsman how is the poor young gentleman asked the dwarf glancing commiseratingly at auriol my master often makes inquiries after his grandson and grieves that the state of his mind should render it necessary to confine him his grandson idoctor lambs grandson cried auriol in sooth are you young sir returned the dwarf were you in your reason you would be aware that my masters name is the same as your owndarcyreginald darcy he assumes the name of doctor lamb to delude the multitude he told you as much yourself sweet sir if your poor wits would enable you to recollect it am i in a dream good fellow tell me that cried auriol lost in amazement alack no sir replied the dwarf to my thinking you are wide awake but you know sir he added touching his forehead you have been a little wrong here and your memory and reason are not of the clearest where does my grandsire dwell asked auriol why here sir replied the dwarf and for the matter of locality the house is situated on the south end of london bridge on the bridgedid you say on the bridge friend cried auriol ay on the bridgewhere else should it be you would not have your grandsire live under the river rejoined the dwarf though for ought i know some of these vaults may go under it they are damp enough auriol was lost in reflection and did not observe a sign that passed between the dwarf and rougemont will it disturb doctor lamb if his grandson goes up to him said the latter after a brief pause my master does not like to be interrupted in his operations as you know sir replied the dwarf and seldom suffers any one except myself to enter his laboratory but i will make so bold as to introduce master auriol if he desires it you will confer the greatest favour on me by doing so cried auriol rising sit downsit down said rougemont authoritatively you cannot go up till the doctor has been apprised remain here while flapdragon and i ascertain his wishes so saying he quitted the chamber by a farther outlet with the dwarf during the short time that auriol was left alone he found it vain to attempt to settle his thoughts or to convince himself that he was not labouring under some strange delusion he was aroused at length by the dwarf who returned alone your grandsire will see you said the mannikin one word before we go cried auriol seizing his arm saints how you frighten me exclaimed the dwarf you must keep composed or i dare not take you to my master pardon me replied auriol i meant not to alarm you where is the person who brought me hither what your keeper said the dwarf oh he is within call he will come to you anon now follow me and taking up the torch he led the way out of the chamber mounting a spiral staircase apparently within a turret they came to a door which being opened by flapdragon disclosed a scene that wellnigh stupefied auriol it was the laboratory precisely as he had seen it above two centuries ago the floor was strewn with alchemical implementsthe table was covered with mystic parchments inscribed with cabalistic charactersthe furnace stood in the cornercrucibles and cucurbites decorated the chimneyboardthe sphere and brazen lamp hung from the ceilingthe skeletons grinned from behind the chimneycornerall was there as he had seen it before there also was doctor lamb in his loose gown of sable silk with a square black cap upon his venerable head and his snowy beard streaming to his girdle the old mans gaze was fixed upon a crucible placed upon the furnace and he was occupied in working the bellows he moved his head as auriol entered the chamber and the features became visible it was a face never to be forgotten come in grandson said the old man kindly come in and close the door after you the draught affects the furnacemy athanor as we adepts term it so you are better your keeper tells memuch better are you indeed living cried auriol rushing wildly towards him and attempting to take his hand offoff cried the old man drawing back as if alarmed you disturb my operations keep him calm flapdragon or take him hence he may do me a mischief i have no such intention sir said auriol indeed i have not i only wish to be assured that you are my aged relative to be sure he is young sir interposed the dwarf why should you doubt it o sir cried auriol throwing himself at the old mans feet pity me if i am mad but offer me some explanation which may tend to restore me to my senses my reason seems gone yet i appear capable of receiving impressions from external objects i see you and appear to know you i see this chamberthese alchemical implementsthat furnacethese different objectsand i appear to recognise them am i deceived or is this real you are not deceived my son replied the old man you have been in this room before and you have seen me before it would be useless to explain to you now how you have suffered from fever and what visions your delirium has produced when you are perfectly restored we will talk the matter over and as he said this he began to blow the fire anew and watched with great apparent interest the changing colours of the liquid in the cucurbite placed on the furnace auriol looked at him earnestly but could not catch another glance so intently was the old man occupied at length he ventured to break the silence i should feel perfectly convinced if i might look forth from that window he said convinced of what rejoined the old man somewhat sharply that i am what i seem replied auriol look forth then said the old man but do not disturb me by idle talk there is the rosy colour in the projection for which i have been so long waiting auriol then walked to the window and gazed through the tinted panes it was very dark and objects could only be imperfectly distinguished still he fancied he could detect the gleam of the river beneath him and what seemed a long line of houses on the bridge he also fancied he discerned other buildings with the high roofs the gables and the other architectural peculiarities of the structures of elizabeths time he persuaded himself also that he could distinguish through the gloom the venerable gothic pile of saint pauls cathedral on the other side of the water and as if to satisfy him that he was right a deep solemn bell tolled forth the hour of two after a while he returned from the window and said to his supposed grandsire i am satisfied i have lived centuries in a few nights the old london merchant a sketch flos mercatorumepitaph on whittington at that festive season when the days are at the shortest and the nights at the longest and when consequently it is the invariable practice of all sensible people to turn night into day when the state of the odds between business and pleasure is decidedly in favour of the latter when high carnival is held in london and everything betokens the prevalence and influence of good cheer when pastrycooks are in their glory and green trays in requisition when porters groan beneath hampers of game and huge tubs of canterbury brawn when trains arriving from the eastern counties are heavy laden with turkeys and hares when agents in town send barrels of oysters to correspondents in the country when christmasbox claimants disturb ones equanimity by day and waits those licensed nuisances to which even our reverence for good old customs cannot reconcile us break ones first slumber at night when surly christians awake and salute the band of little carollers with jugs of cold water when their opposite neighbour who has poked his nightcapped head from his window retires with a satisfactory chuckle when the meat at mr gibletts in bond street which for the last six weeks has announced the approach of christmas by its dailyincreasing layers of fat as correctly as the almanack has reached the neplusultra of adiposity when wondering crowds are collected before the aforesaid gibletts to gaze upon the yellow carcass of that leviathan prize oxthe fat being rendered more intensely yellow by its contrast with the green holly with which it is garnishedas well as to admire the snowy cakes of suet with which the sides of that leicestershire sheep are loaded when the grocers trade is in request and nothing is heard upon his counter but the jingling of scales and the snapping of twine when the vendor of sweetmeats as he deals forth his citron and sultanas in the due mincedmeat proportions to that pretty housemaid whispers something in a soft and sugared tone about the misletoe when coming twelfth nights cast their shadows before and mr gunter feels doubly important when pantomimes are about to unfold all their magic charms and the holidays have fairly commenced when the meteorological prophet predicts that thursday the st will be fair and frosty and it turns out to be drizzling rain and a sudden thaw when intelligence is brought that the ice bears the intelligence being confirmed by the appearance of sundry donkeycarts containing ice an inch thick and rendered indisputable by the discharge of their crystal loads upon the pavement before mr groves the fishmongers when crack performers in paletots or mackintoshes with skates in their hands cigars in their mouths and tights and furtopped boots on their lower limbs are seen hastening up baker street in the direction of the regents park when a marquee is pitched upon the banks of the serpentine and a quadrille executed by the beforementioned crack skaters in tights and furtopped boots upon its frozen waters when the functionaries of the humane society begin to find some employment for their ropes and punt when old father thames who for a couple of months appears to have been undecided about the colours of his liverynow inclining to a cloak of greyish dun now to a mantle of orange tawnyhas finally adopted a white transparent robe with facings of silver when as you pass down harley street the lights in the drawingroom windows of every third house the shadows on the blinds and above all the enlivening sound of the harp and piano satisfy you that its fair inmate is at home when housequakes streetthunders and doorbatteries are heard from midnight until morn when the knocker at no park street responds to the knocker at no when a barrelorgan and a popular melody salute your ear as you enter oxford street when the doors of the ginpalaces seem to be always opening to let people in but never to let them out and the roar of boisterous revelry is heard from the bar when various vociferations arise from various courts and passages when policemen are less on the alert though their interference is more requisite than usual when uproarious jollity prevails when universal london getteth drunk and in short when christmas is come and everybody is disposed to enjoy himself in his own way at this period of wassail and rejoicing it was that a social party to which i am now about to introduce the reader was assembled in a snug little diningroom of a snug little house situated in that snug little pile of building denominated the sanctuary in westminster when a man has any peculiarity of character his house is sure to partake of it the room which he constantly inhabits reflects his image as faithfully as a mirror nay more so for it reflects his mind as well as his person a glance at no st jamess place would satisfy you its owner was a poet we can judge of the human as of the brute lion by the aspect of his den the room marks the man visit it in his absence and you may paint his portrait better than the limner who has placed his breathing canvas on the walls from that wellworn elbowchair and the slippers at its feet the slippers of an old man are never to be mistaken you can compute his age from that faded brocade dressinggown and green velvet cap you can shape out his figure from the multiplicity of lookingglasses you at once infer that he has not entirely lost his vanity or his good looks that goldheaded cane gives you his carriageit is not a crutchhandled stick but a cane to flourish jauntily that shagreen spectaclecase that chased silver snuffbox with the jupiter and leda richly and somewhat luxuriously wrought upon its lid that fine sevres porcelain that gorgeous berlinware those rare bronzes half consumed by the true hoary green aerugo those little egyptian images that lachrymatory that cinerary urn that brick from the colosseum that tesselated pavement from pompeii looking like a heap of variouscoloured dice and a world of other rarities furnish unerring indications of his tastes and habits and proclaim him a member of the archaeological society while that open volume of sir thomas urquharts rabelais published by the abbotsford club gives you his course of study the morning post his politics that flute and those musical notes attest the state of his lungs and that wellblotted copy of verses of which the ink is scarcely dry proclaims his train of thought the door opens and an old gentleman enters exactly corresponding to your preconceived notions you require no introduction you have made his acquaintance halfanhour ago the apartment to which we are about to repair was a complete index to the mind and character of its possessor sir lionel flamstead i have called it a diningroom from its ordinary application to the purposes of refection and festivity but it had much more the air of a library or study it was a small comfortable chamber just large enough to contain halfadozen people though by management double that number had been occasionally squeezed into its narrow limits the walls were decorated with curious old prints maps and plans set in old black wormeaten frames and representing divers personages places and structures connected with london and its history over the mantelpiece was stretched vertues copy of ralph aggass famous survey of our great metropolis made about the beginning of elizabeths reign or perhaps a little earlier when it was scarcely so great a metropolis as at the present time and when novelists gentlemen of the press cabmen omnibus cads and other illustrious personages were unborn and undreamed of when st giless in lieu of its mysterious and daedalian seven dials which should have for their motto wordsworths title we are seven consisted of a little cluster of country houses surrounded by a grove of elms when a turreted wall girded in the city from aldgate to grey friars when a pack of staghounds was kept in finsbury fields and archers and crossbowmen haunted the purlieus of the spital when he who strolled westward from charing cross then no misnomer beheld neither opera house nor clubhouse but a rustic lane with a barn at one end and a goodly assortment of haycarts and haystacks at the other when the thames was crossed by a single bridge and that bridge looked like a street and the street itself like a row of palaces on the right of this plan hung a sketch of will somers jester to henry viii after the picture by holbein on the left an engraving of geoffrey hudson the diminutive attendant of henrietta maria this niche was devoted to portraits of the bluff king before mentioned and his six spouses that to the melancholy charles and his family here the great fire of with its black profiles of houses relieved by a sheet of bloody and malicious flame formed a pleasant contrast to the icy wonders of the frost fair held on the thames in when carriages were driven through the lines of tents and an ox was roasted on the water to the infinite delectation of the citizens there old saint pauls in the words of victor hugo one of those gothic monuments so admirable and so irreparable and which is but ill replaced by the modern bastard counterpart of the glorious fane of st peter at rome reared its venerable tower not dome and lofty spire to the sky next to st pauls came the reverend abbey of westminster taken before it had been disfigured by the towers added by wren and next to the abbey opened the long and raftered vista of its magnificent neighbouring hall several plans and prospects of the tower of london as it appeared at different epochs occupied a corner to themselves then came a long array of taverns from the tabard in southwark the boars head in eastcheap and the devil near temple bar embalmed in the odour of poesy to the nags head in cheapside notorious for its legend of the consecration of the protestant bishops in there also might you see in billinsgate the salutation and the boars head near london

and the folly as it once floated in the river opposite old somerset house then came the halls beginning with guildhall and ending with old skinners next the crosses from pauls to charing then the churches gateways hospitals colleges prisons asylums inns of courtin short for it is needless to particularise further london and its thousand recollections rose before you as you gazed around scarcely an old edifice to which an historical tradition could be attached and what old london edifice is destitute of such traditions was wanting nor were the great of oldthe spirits who gave interest and endurance to these decayed or decaying structures wanting but i shall not pause to enumerate their portraits or make out a catalogue as long as the list of homers ships or the gallery of mr lodge sufficient has been said i trust to give the reader an idea of the physiology of the room yet stay i must not omit to point out the contents of those groaning shelves in the goodly folios crowded there are contained the chronicles of holinshed and hall of grafton fabian and stow of matthew of paris and his namesake of westminster let him not be terrified at the ponderous size of these admirable old historians nor be deterred by the black letter if he should chance to open a volume their freshness and picturesque details will surprise as much as they will delight him from this wealthy mine shakspeare drew some of his purest ore the shelves are crowned by a solitary bust it is that of a modern it is that of a lover of london and a character of london it is doctor johnson having completed the survey of the apartment i shall now proceed to its occupants these were five in numberjolly fellows allseated round a circular diningtable covered with glasses and decanters amidst which a portly magnum of claret and a deep and capacious china punchbowl must not pass unmentioned they were in the full flow of fun and conviviality enjoying themselves as good fellows always enjoy themselves at the season of the year the port was delectableold as saint pauls i was going to saynot quite howeverbut just old enough the claret was nectar or what is better it was lafitte the punch was drink for the gods the jokes of this party would have split your sidestheir laughter would have had the same effect on your ears never were heard peals of merriment so hearty and prolonged you only wondered how they found time to drink so quick did each roar follow on the heels of its predecessor that they did drink however was clear that they had drunk was equally certain and that they intended to continue drinking seemed to come within the limits of probability sir lionel flamstead was a retired merchantone of those highsouled highprincipled traders of whom our city was once so justly proud and of whom so few in these days of railway bubbles and other harebrained speculations can be found his word was his bondonce passed it was sufficient his acceptances were accounted safe as the bank of england had sir thomas gresham descended from his niche he could not have been treated with greater consideration than attended sir lionels appearance on change all eyes followed the movements of his tall and stately figureall hats were raised to his courteous but ceremonious salutation affable yet precise and tinctured with something of the punctiliousness of the old school his manners won him universal respect and regard even from those unknown to him by his intimates he was revered his habits were as regular as clockwork and the glass of cold punch at toms or the basin of soup at birchs wound him up for the day his attire was as formal as his manners being a slight modification of the prevalent costume of some fiveandthirty years ago he had consented not without extreme reluctance to clothe his nether limbs in the unmentionable garment of recent introduction but he resolutely adhered to the pigtail there is something bythebye in a pigtail to which old gentlemen cling in spite of all remonstrance with loverlike pertinacity only hint the propriety of cutting it off to your greatuncle or your grandfather and you may rely on being cut off with a shilling yourself be this as it may sir lionel gathered his locks once sable as the riband that bound them but now thickly strewn with the silver blossoms of the grave into a knot and suffered them to dangle a few inches below his collar his shoes shone with a lustre beyond french polish and his hat was brushed till not a wind dared to approach it sir lionel wore a white unstarched cravat with a thick pad in it sported a frill over his waistcoat carried a black ebony cane in his hand and was generally followed by a pet pugdog one of the most sagacious and disagreeable specimens of his species sir lionel flamstead i have said was talli might have said he was very tallsomewhat narrower across the shoulders than about the hipsa circumstance which did not materially conduce to his symmetrywith grey benevolent eyes shaded by bushy intelligent browsa lofty expansive forehead in which in the jargon of phrenology the organs of locality and ideality were strongly developed and which was rendered the more remarkable from the flesh having fallen in on either side of the templeswith a nose which had been considered handsome and well proportioned in his youth but to which good living had imparted a bottle form and a bottle tintand cheeks from which all encroachment of whiskers was sedulously removed in order we conclude that his rosy complexion might be traced from its point of concentration upon the prominent feature before mentioned to its final disappearance behind his ears such was sir lionel flamstead a nights adventure in rome chapter i santa maria maggiore the pope was saying the high high mass all on saint peters day with the power to him given by the saints in heaven to wash mens sins away the pope he was saying the blessed mass and the people kneeld around and from each mans soul his sins did pass as he kissed the holy ground the grey brother chancing to be in rome in the august of i visited the gorgeous church of santa maria maggiore during the celebration of the anniversary of the holy assumption it was a glorious sight to one unaccustomed to the imposing religious ceremonials of the romish church to witness all the pomp and splendour displayed at this high solemnityto gaze down that glittering pile and mark the various ecclesiastical dignitaries each in their peculiar and characteristic costume employed in the ministration of their sacred functions and surrounded by a wide semicircle of the papal guards so stationed to keep back the crowd and who with their showy scarlet attire and tall halberds looked like the martial figures we see in the sketches of callot nor was the brilliant effect of this picture diminished by the sumptuous framework in which it was set overhead flamed a roof resplendent with burnished gold before me rose a canopy supported by pillars of porphyry and shining with manycoloured stones while on either hand were chapels devoted to some noble house and boasting each the marble memorial of a pope melodious masses proper to the service were ever and anon chanted by the papal choir and overpowering perfume was diffused around by a hundred censers subdued by the odours the music and the spectacle i sank into a state of dreamy enthusiasm during a continuance of which i almost fancied myself a convert to the faith of rome and surrendered myself unreflectingly to an admiration of its errors as i gazed among the surrounding crowd the sight of so many prostrate figures all in attitudes of deepest devotion satisfied me of the profound religious impression of the ceremonial as elsewhere this feeling was not universal and as elsewhere likewise more zeal was exhibited by the lower than the higher classes of society and i occasionally noted amongst the latter the glitter of an eye or the flutter of a bosom not altogether agitated i suspect by holy aspirations yet methought on the whole i had never seen such abandonment of soul such prostration of spirit in my own colder clime and during the exercise of my own more chastened creed as that which in several instances i now beheld and i almost envied the poor maiden near me who abject upon the earth had washed away her sorrows and perhaps her sins in contrite tears as such thoughts swept through my mind i felt a pleasure in singling out particular figures and groups which interested me from their peculiarity of costume or from their devotional fervour amongst others a little to my left i remarked a band of mountaineers from calabria for such i judged them to be from their wild and picturesque garb deeply was every individual of this little knot of peasantry impressed by the ceremonial every eye was humbly cast down every knee bent every hand was either occupied in grasping the little crucifix suspended from its owners neck in telling the beads of his rosary or fervently crossed upon his bare and swarthy breast while gazing upon this group i chanced upon an individual whom i had not hitherto noticed and who now irresistibly attracted my attention though a little removed from the calabrian mountaineers and reclining against the marble walls of the church he evidently belonged to the same company at least so his attire seemed to indicate though the noble cast of his countenance was far superior to that of his comrades he was an old man with a face of the fine antique roman stampa bold outline of prominent nose rugged and imperious brow and proudlycut chin his head and chin as well as his naked breast were frosted over with the snowy honours of many winters and their hoar appearance contrasted strikingly with the tawny hue of a skin almost as dark and as lustrous as polished oak peasant as he was there was something of grandeur and majesty in this old mans demeanour and physiognomy his head declined backwards so as completely to expose his long and muscular throat his arms hung listlessly by his side one hand drooped upon the pavement the other was placed within his breast his eyes were closed the old mans garb was of the coarsest fabric he wore little beyond a shirt a loose vest a sort of sheepskin cloak and canvas leggings bound around with leathern thongs his appearance however was above his condition he became his rags as proudly as a prince would have become his ermined robe the more i scrutinised the rigid lines of this old mans countenance the more i became satisfied that many singular and perhaps not wholly guiltless events were connected with his history the rosary was in his handthe cross upon his breastthe beads were untoldthe crucifix unclaspedno breath of prayer passed his lips his face was turned heavenward but his eyes were closedhe dared not open them why did he come thither if he did not venture to pray why did he assume a penitential attitude if he felt no penitence so absorbed was i in the perusal of the workings of this old mans countenance as to be scarcely conscious that the service of high mass was concluded and the crowd within the holy pile fast dispersing the music was hushed the robed prelates and their train had disappeared joyous dames were hastening along the marble aisles to their equipages all save a few kneeling figures near the chapels were departing and the old man aware from the stir and hum prevailing around that the ceremonial was at an end arose stretched out his arm to one of his comrades a youth who had joined him and prepared to follow the concourse was he really blind assuredly not besides he did not walk like as one habituated to the direst calamity that can befall our nature he staggered in his gait and reeled to and fro yet wherefore did he not venture to unclose his eyes within the temple of the most high what would i not have given to be made acquainted with his history for i felt that it must be a singular one i might satisfy my curiosity at once he was moving slowly forward guided by his comrade in a few seconds it would be too latehe would have vanished from my sight with hasty footsteps i followed him down the church and laid my hand with some violence upon his shoulder the old man started at the touch and turned now indeed his eyes were opened wide and flashing full upon meand such eyes heretofore i had only dreamed of such age had not quenched their lightning and i quailed beneath the fierce glances which he threw upon me but if i was at first surprised at the display of anger which i had called forth in him how much more was i astonished to behold the whole expression of his countenance suddenly change his eyes continued fixed upon mine as if i had been a basilisk apparently he could not avert them while his whole frame shivered with emotion i advanced towards him he shrank backwards and but for the timely aid of his companion would have fallen upon the pavement at a loss to conceive in what way i could have occasioned him so much alarm i rushed forward to the assistance of the old man when his sonfor such it subsequently appeared he wasrudely repelled me and thrust his hand into his girdle as if to seek for means to prevent further interference meanwhile the group had been increased by the arrival of a third party attracted by the cry the old man had uttered in falling the newcomer was an italian gentleman somewhat stricken in years of stern and stately deportment and with something sinister and forbidding in his aspect he was hastening towards the old man but he suddenly stopped and was about to retire when he encountered my gaze as our eyes met he started and a terror as sudden and lively as that exhibited by the old man was at once depicted in his features my surprise was now beyond all bounds and i continued for some moments speechless with astonishment not a little of the inexplicable awe which affected the old man and the stranger was communicated to myself altogether we formed a mysterious and terrible triangle of which each side bore some strange and unintelligible relation to the other the newcomer first recovered his composure though not without an effort coldly turning his heel upon me he walked towards the old man and shook him forcibly the latter shrank from his grasp and endeavoured to avoid him but it was impossible the stranger whispered a few words in his ear of which from his gestures being directed towards myself i could guess the import the old man replied his action in doing so was that of supplication and despair the stranger retorted in a wild and vehement manner and even stamped upon the ground but the old man still continued to cling to the knees of his superior weak superstitious fool at length exclaimed the stranger i will waste no more words upon thee do or say what thou wilt but beware and spurning him haughtily back with his foot he strode away the old mans reverend head struck against the marble floor his temple was cut open by the fall and blood gushed in torrents from the wound recovering himself he started to his feeta knife was instantly in his hand and he would have pursued and doubtless slain his aggressor if he had not been forcibly withheld by his son and by a priest who had joined them maledizione exclaimed the old mana blow from himfrom that hand i will stab him though he were at the altars foot though he had a thousand lives each should pay for it release me paolo release me for by heaven he dies peace father cried the son still struggling with him thou art not my son to hinder my revenge shouted the enraged father dost not see this bloodmy bloodthy fathers bloodand thou holdest me back thou shouldst have struck him to the earth for the deedbut he was a noble and thou daredst not lift thy hand against him wouldst thou have had me slay him in this holy place exclaimed paolo reddening with anger and suppressed emotion no no returned the old man in an altered voice not here not here though twere but just retribution but i will find other means of vengeance i will denounce himi will betray all though it cost me my own life he shall die by the hands of the common executionerthere is one shall testify for me and he pointed to me again i advanced towards him if thou hast aught to disclose pertaining to the holy church i am ready to listen to thee my son said the priest but reflect well ere thou bringest any charge thou mayest not be able to substantiate against one who stands so high in her esteem as him thou wouldst accuse the son gave his father a meaning look and whispered somewhat in his ear the old man became suddenly still right right said he i have bethought me twas but a blow he is wealthy i am poor there is no justice for the poor in rome my purse is at your service said i interfering you shall have my aid your aid echoed the old man staring at me will you assist me signor i will enough i may claim fulfilment of your promise stop old man i said answer me one question ere you depart whence arose your recent terrors you shall know hereafter signor he said i must now begone we shall meet again follow me not he continued seeing i was bent upon obtaining further explanation of the mystery you will learn nothing now and only endanger my safety addio signor and with hasty steps he quitted the church accompanied by his son who is that old man i demanded of the priest i am as ignorant as yourself he replied but he must be looked to he talks threateningly and he beckoned to an attendant who was he who struck him was my next inquiry one of our wealthiest nobles he replied and an assured friend of the church we could ill spare him do not lose sight of them he added to the attendant and let the sbirri track them to their haunts they must not be suffered to go forth tonight a few hours restraint will cool their hot calabrian blood but the name of the noble father i said renewing my inquiries i must decline further questioning returned the priest coldly i have other occupation and meanwhile it will be well to have these stains effaced which may else bring scandal on these holy walls you will excuse me my son so saying he bowed and retired i made fruitless inquiries for the old man at the door of the church he was gone none of the bystanders who had seen him go forth knew whither stung by curiosity i wandered amid the most unfrequented quarters of rome throughout the day in the hope of meeting with the old calabrian but in vain as however i entered the courtyard of my hotel i fancied i discovered amongst the lounging assemblage gathered round the door the dark eyes of the younger mountaineer in this i might have been mistaken no one answering to his description had been seen near the house chapter ii the marchesa une chose tenebreuse fait par des hommes tenebreux lucrece borgia on the same night i bent my steps towards the colosseum and full of my adventure of the morning found myself not without apprehension involved within its labyrinthine passages accompanied by a monk who with a small horn lantern in his hand acted as my guide i fancied that by its uncertain light i could discover stealthy figures lurking within the shades of the ruin whatever suspicions i might entertain i pursued my course in silence emerging from the vomitorio we stood upon the steps of the colossal amphitheatre the huge pile was bathed in rosy moonlight and reared itself in serene majesty before my view while indulging in a thousand speculations occasioned by the hour and the spot i suddenly perceived a figure on a point of the ruin immediately above me nothing but the head was visible but that was placed in bold relief against the beaming sky of night and i recognised it at once no nobler roman head had ever graced the circus when rome was in her zenith i shouted to the old calabrian for he it was i beheld almost ere the sound had left my lips he had disappeared i made known what i had seen to the monk he was alarmedurged our instant departure and advised me to seek the assistance of the sentinel stationed at the entrance to the pile to this proposal i assented and having descended the vasty steps and crossed the open arena we arrived without molestation at the doorway the sentinel had allowed no one to pass him he returned with me to the circus and after an ineffectual search amongst the ruins volunteered his services to accompany me homewards through the forum i declined his offer and shaped my course towards a lonesome vicolo on the right this was courting danger but i cared not and walked slowly forward through the deserted place scarcely had i proceeded many paces when i heard footsteps swiftly approaching and ere i could turn round my arms were seized from behind and a bandage was passed across my eyes all my efforts at liberation were unavailing and after a brief struggle i remained passive make no noise said a voice which i knew to be that of the old man and no harm shall befall you you must come with us ask no questions but follow i suffered myself to be led without further opposition whithersoever they listed we walked for it might be halfanhour much beyond the walls of rome i had to scramble through many ruins and frequently stumbled over inequalities of ground i now felt the fresh breeze of night blowing over the wide campagna and my conductors moved swiftly onwards as we trod on its elastic turf at length they came to a halt my bandage was removed and i beheld myself beneath the arch of an aqueduct which spanned the moonlit plain a fire was kindled beneath the arch and the ruddy flame licked its walls around the blaze were grouped the little band of peasantry i had beheld within the church in various and picturesque attitudes they greeted my conductors on their arrival and glanced inquisitively at me but did not speak to me the elder calabrian whom they addressed as cristofano asked for a glass of aqua vitae which he handed respectfully to me i declined the offer but he pressed it upon me you will need it signor he said you have much to do tonight you fear perhaps it is drugged behold and he drank it off i could not after this refuse his pledge and now signor said the old man removing to a little distance from the group may i crave a word with youyour name as i had no reason for withholding it i told him how i was called hum had you no relation of the name of none whatever and i sighed for i thought of my desolate condition strange he muttered adding with a grim smile but however likenesses are easily accounted for what likenesses i asked whom do i resemble and what is the motive of your inexplicable conduct you shall hear he replied frowning gloomily step aside and let us get within the shade of these arches out of the reach of yonder listeners the tale i have to tell is for your ears alone i obeyed him and we stood beneath the shadow of the aqueduct years ago began the old man an englishman in all respects resembling yourself equally well favoured in person and equally young came to rome and took up his abode within the eternal city he was of high rank in his own country and was treated with the distinction due to his exalted station here at that time i dwelt with the marchese di i was his confidential servanthis adviserhis friend i had lived with his fathercarried him as an infantsported with him as a boyloved and served him as a man loved him i say for despite his treatment of me i loved him then as much as i abhor him now well signor to my story if his youth had been profligate his manhood was not less depraved it was devoted to cold calculating libertinism soon after he succeeded to the estates and title of his father he married that he loved his bride i can scarcely believe for though he was wildly jealous of her he was himself unfaithful and she knew it in italy revenge in such cases is easily within a womans power and for aught i know the marchesa might have meditated retaliation my lord however took the alarm and thought fit to retire to his villa without the city and for a time remained secluded within its walls it was at this crisis that the englishman i have before mentioned arrived in rome my lady who mingled little with the gaieties of the city had not beheld him but she could not have been unacquainted with him by report as every tongue was loud in his praises a rumour of his successes with other dames had reached my lord nay i have reason to believe that he had been thwarted by the handsome englishman in some other quarter and he sedulously prevented their meeting an interview however did take place between them and in an unexpected manner it was the custom then as now upon particular occasions to drive during the heats of summer within the piazza navona which is flooded with water one evening the marchesa drove thither she was unattended except by myself our carriage happened to be stationed near that of the young englishman the marchesa was beautiful no doubt i said interrupting him most beautiful he replied and so your countryman seemed to think for he was lost in admiration of her i am not much versed in the language of the eyes but his were too eloquent and expressive not to be understood i watched my mistress narrowly it was evident from her glowing cheek though her eyes were cast down that she was not insensible to his regards she turned to play with her dog a lovely little greyhound which was in the carriage beside her and patted it carelessly with the glove which she held in her hand the animal snatched the glove from her grasp and as he bounded backwards fell over the carriage side my lady uttered a scream at the sight and i was preparing to extricate the struggling dog when the englishman plunged into the water in an instant he had restored her favourite to the marchesa and received her warmest acknowledgments from that moment an intimacy commenced which was destined to produce the most fatal consequences to both parties did you betray them i asked somewhat impatiently i was then the blind tool of the marchese i did so replied the old man i told him all particulars of the interview he heard me in silence but grew ashy pale with suppressed rage bidding me redouble my vigilance he left me my lady was now scarcely ever out of my sight when one evening a few days after what had occurred she walked forth alone upon the gardenterrace of the villa her guitar was in her hand and her favourite dog by her side i was at a little distance but wholly unperceived she struck a few plaintive chords upon her instrument and then resting her chin upon her white and rounded arm seemed lost in tender reverie would you had seen her signor as i beheld her then or as one other beheld her you would acknowledge that you had never met with her equal in beauty her raven hair fell in thick tresses over shoulders of dazzling whiteness and the most perfect proportion her deep dark eyes were thrown languidly on the ground and her radiant features were charged with an expression of profound and pensive passion in this musing attitude she continued for some minutes when she was aroused by the gambols of her dog who bore in his mouth a glove which he had found as she took it from him a letter dropped upon the floor had a serpent glided from its folds it could not have startled her more she gazed upon the paper offended but irresolute yes she was irresolute and you may conjecture the rest she paused and by that pause was lost with a shrinking grasp she stooped to raise the letter her cheeks which had grown deathly pale again kindled with blushes as she perused it she hesitatedcast a bewildering look towards the mansionplaced the note within her bosomand plunged into the orangebower her lover awaited her there he did i saw them meet i heard his frenzied wordshis passionate entreaties he urged her to flyshe resisted he grew more urgentmore impassioned she uttered a faint cry and i stood before them the englishmans hand was at my throat and his sword at my breast with the swiftness of thought and but for the screams of my mistress that instant must have been my last at her desire he relinquished his hold of me but her cries had reached other ears and the marchese arrived to avenge his injured honour he paused not to inquire the nature of the offence but sword in hand assailed the englishman bidding me remove his lady the clash of their steel was drowned by her shrieks as i bore her away but i knew the strife was desperate before i gained the house my lady had fainted and committing her to the charge of other attendants i returned to the terrace i met my master slowly walking homewards his sword was gonehis brow was benthe shunned my sight i knew what had happened and did not approach him he sought his wife what passed in that interview was never disclosed but it may be guessed at from its result that night the marchesa left her husbands hallsnever to return next morn i visited the terrace where she had received the token the glove was still upon the ground i picked it up and carried it to the marchese detailing the whole occurrence to him he took it and vowed as he took it that his vengeance should never rest satisfied till that glove had been steeped in her blood and he kept his vow i asked shuddering many months elapsed ere its accomplishment italian vengeance is slow but sure to all outward appearance he had forgotten his faithless wife he had even formed a friendship with her lover which he did the more effectually to blind his ultimate designs meanwhile time rolled on and the marchesa gave birth to a childthe offspring of her seducer great god i exclaimed was that child a boy it wasbut listen to me my tale draws to a close one night during the absence of the englishman by secret means we entered the palazzo where the marchesa resided we wandered from room to room till we came to her chamber she was sleeping with her infant by her side the sight maddened the marchese he would have stricken the child but i held back his hand he relented he bade me make fast the door he approached the bed i heard a rustlea scream a white figure sprang from out the couch in an instant the light was extinguishedthere was a blowanotherand all was over i threw open the door the marchese came forth the corridor in which we stood was flooded with moonlight a glove was in his handit was dripping with blood his oath was fulfilledhis vengeance completeno not complete for the englishman yet lived what became of him i inquired ask me not replied the old man you were at the chiesa santa maria maggiore this morning if those stones could speak they might tell a fearful story and that was the reason you did not dare to unclose your eyes within those holy precinctsa film of blood floated between you and heaven the old man shuddered but replied not and the child i asked after a pause what of their wretched offspring it was conveyed to england by a friend of its dead father if he were alive that boy would be about your age signor indeed i said a horrible suspicion flashing across my mind after the englishmans death continued cristofano my master began to treat me with a coldness and suspicion which increased daily i was a burden to him and he was resolved to rid himself of me i spared him the troublequitted romesought the mountains of the abruzziand thence wandered to the fastnesses of calabria and becameno matter what here i am heavens appointed minister of vengeance the marchese dies tonight tonight old man i echoed horrorstricken add not crime to crime if he has indeed been guilty of the foul offence you have named let him be dealt with according to the offended laws of the country do not pervert the purposes of justice justice echoed cristofano scornfully ay justice you are poor and powerless but means may be found to aid you i will assist the rightful course of vengeance you shall assist it i have sworn he shall die before dawn and the hand to strike the blow shall be yours mine never your own life will be the penalty of your obstinacy if you refuse nor will your refusal save him by the mother of heaven he dies and by your hand you saw how he was struck by your resemblance to the young englishman this morning in the chiesa it is wonderful i know not who or what you are but to me you are an instrument of vengeance and as such i shall use you the blow dealt by you will seem the work of retribution and i care not if you strike twice and make my heart your second mark ere i could reply he called to his comrades and in a few moments we were speeding across the campagna we arrived at a high wallthe old man conducted us to a posterngate which he opened we entered a garden filled with orangetrees the perfume of which loaded the midnight air we heard the splash of a fountain at a distance and the thrilling notes of a nightingale amongst some taller trees the moon hung like a lamp over the belvidere of the proud villa we strode along a wide terrace edged by a marble balustrade the old man pointed to an open summerhouse terminating the walk and gave me a significant look but he spoke not a window thrown open admitted us to the house we were within a hall crowded with statues and traversed noiselessly its marble floors passing through several chambers we then mounted to a corridor and entered an apartment which formed the anteroom to another beyond it placing his finger upon his lips and making a sign to his comrades cristofano opened a door and disappeared there was a breathless pause for a few minutes during which i listened intently but caught only a faint sound as of the snapping of a lock presently the old man returned he sleeps he said in a low deep tone to me sleeps as his victim sleptsleeps without a dream of remorse and he shall awaken as she awoke to despair come into his chamber we obeyed the door was made fast within side the curtains of the couch were withdrawn and the moonlight streamed full upon the face of the sleeper he was hushed in profound repose no visions seemed to haunt his peaceful slumbers could guilt sleep so soundly i half doubted the old mans story placing us within the shadow of the canopy cristofano approached the bed a stiletto glittered in his hand awake he cried in a voice of thunder the sleeper started at the summons i watched his countenance he read cristofanos errand in his eye but he quailed not cowardly assassin he cried you have well consulted your own safety in stealing on my sleep and who taught me the lesson fiercely interrupted the old man am i the first that have stolen on midnight slumber gaze upon this when and how did it acquire its dye and he held forth a glove which looked blackened and stained in the moonlight the marchese groaned aloud my cabinet broken open at length he exclaimedvillain how dare you do this but why do i rave i know with whom i have to deal uttering these words he sprung from his couch with the intention of grappling with the old man but cristofano retreated and at that instant the brigands who rushed to his aid thrust me forward i was face to face with the marchese the apparition of the murdered man could not have staggered him more his limbs were stiffened by the shock and he remained in an attitude of freezing terror is he come for vengeance he ejaculated he is cried cristofano give him the weapon and a stiletto was thrust into my hand but i heeded not the steel i tore open my bosoma small diamond cross was within the folds do you recollect this i demanded of the marchese it was my wifes he shrieked in amazement it was upon the infants bosom as he slept by her side on that fatal night said cristofano i saw it sparkle there that infant was myselfthat wife my mother i cried the murderer stands before you strike exclaimed cristofano i raised the dagger the marchese stirred not i could not strike do you hesitate angrily exclaimed cristofano he has not the courage returned the younger calabrian you reproached me this morning with want of filial duty behold how a son can avenge his father and he plunged his stiletto within the bosom of the marchese your father is not yet avenged young man cried cristofano in a terrible tone you alone can avenge him ere i could withdraw its point the old man had rushed upon the dagger which i held extended in my grasp he fell without a single groan the end
