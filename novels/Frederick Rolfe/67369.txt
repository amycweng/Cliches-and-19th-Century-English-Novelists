her judgment fr rolfe xxij jul hadrian the seventh prooimion in mind he was tired worn out by years of hope deferred of loneliness of unrewarded toil in body he was almost prostrate by the pain of an arm on the tenth day of vaccination bodily pain stung him like a personal affront some one will have to be made miserable for this he once said during the throes of a toothache he was no stranger to mental fatigue but when to that was added corporeal anguish he came near collapse his capacity for work was constricted the mere sight of his writing materials filled him with disgust but because he had a horror of being discovered in a state of inaction after breakfast he sat down as usual and tried to write dazed in a torrent of ideas he painfully halted for words stumbling in a maze of words he frequently lost the thread of his argument now and then in sheer exhaustion his pen remained immobile he sat in a small low armchair which was covered with shabby brocade dullred and green an old drawingboard of the large size denominated antiquarian rested on his knees the lower edge frayed the brocade on the arms of the chair his little yellow cat flavio lay asleep on the tilted board nestling in the bend of his left elbow that was the only living creature to whom he ever spoke with affection as well as with politeness his left hand steadied his ms the sheets of which were clipped together at the top by a metal clip at the upper edge of the board a couple of publishers dummies reposed having the outward similitude of sixshilling novels but he had filled their pages with his archaic handwriting the first contained thoughtsnot great thoughts nor thoughts selected on any particular principle but phrases and opinions such as sophokles denunciation or gabriele dannunzios sentence old legitimate monarchies are everywhere declining and demos stands ready to swallow them down its miry throat the second was his private dictionary which as an artificer in verbal expression he had compiled taking greek words from liddellandscott and latin words from andrews enlarging his english vocabulary with such simple but pregnant formations as the adjective hybrist from or the noun gingilism from gingilismus he was looking askance at his ms in two hours he had written no more than fourteen lines and these were deformed by erasures of words and sentences by substitutions and additions he struck an upward line from left to right across the sheet laid down his pen lifted board cat books and ms from his knees and laid them by he could not work he poked the little fire burning in the corner of a fireclayed grate he was shivering for though march was going out like nine lions he was very lightly clad in a blue linen suit such as is worn over all by engineers he had an impish predilection for that garb since a cantankerous rednosed prelate anxious to sneer at unhaloed poverty inanely had said that he looked like a neapolitan he brushed the accumulation of cigaretteash from the front of his jacket and seized a pair of springdumbbells but at once returned them warned by the pain of his left armpit he took up the newspaper which he had brought with him after breakfast and read again the news from rome and the news of russia the former he could see was merely the kind of subterfuge which farthing journalists are wont to use when they are excluded from a view of facts it said much and signified nothing our special correspondent was being hoodwinked and knew it but did not like to confess it and so indulged his imagination something was occurring in rome something mysterious was occurring in rome that could be deduced from the dispatch but nothing more the news of russia was a tale of unparalleled ghastliness it emanated from berlin no direct communication with russia having taken place for a fortnight how exquisitely horrible it is he said to flavio and i believe its perfectly true the tzarwell that was to be expected but the tsaritzathough if ever a woman bore her fate in her face she did poor creature those dreadful haunted eyes of hers that hard old young soft face the innocent babies how abominably cynically cruel yet there have been omens and portents of just such a tragedy as this any time these last few years they must have known it was coming or is this another example of the onlookers seeing most of the game he fetched a book of newspaper cuttings and turned the pages here you are flavio he said to the sleeping cat and hereand here if these are not forewarningswell he sat down again and studied certain paragraphs attentively education by the knout petersburgall russia is in a state of unrest and seething with discontent the very air is alive with the rumours of tumults on the one hand and of coups dtat on the other the strangest stories are being bandied about as to what is taking place at kiev sula and all parts of the empire in fact but especially in moscow there it seems while students and members of the higher classes are being thrown into prison by the hundrednot a few of them being packed off to siberiathe workers are being treated with quite extraordinary consideration they are even allowed to say their say and hold public meetings without let or hindrance a thing unheard of in russia in petersburg itself an ominous state of things prevails and the city is completely in the hands of the police and the military the streets are thronged with gensdarmes even private houses are packed with soldiers and never a week passes without some disorder arising or some public demonstration being made in february a terrible scene occurred in the house of nicholas ii a sort of peoples palace in the course of a theatrical performance there some students threw down from the gallery into the body of the hall leaflets in which they demanded redress of their grievances the place was crowded with lawabiding people for the most part nevertheless the gensdarmerie who are always within hail rushed in and simply trampled under foot all who came in their way one great fellow was seen to deliberately stamp on the face of a poor lad who had fallen cracking it like a nut how many were injured is unknown and probably will remain so on sunday the state of things was even worse during the previous week the students had sent to the leading journals and even to the police a formal announcement that they intended to hold a demonstration in the newsky prospect to demand in constitutional fashion the redress of their grievances it was taken for granted that measures would be taken to prevent the meeting and the newsky was crowded for the occasion with the usual loungers and pleasureseekers but so far as everyone was aware the police seemed to have done nothing in the matter and it was known only to a few that the courtyards of the great houses of the neighbourhood were filled with gensdarmes and soldiers up to twelve oclock all went well then quite suddenly not only students but working men began to stream into the newsky from every sidestreet and within a very few minutes the place was one vast crowd in the square before the kasan cathedral alone there were at least suddenly seditious cries were raised red flags were waved stones were thrown and in the midst of it all the gensdarmes began a mad gallop through the crowd it was a ghastly sight for they slashed right and left with their swords even at the bystanders bent only on escaping many were wounded some were killedhow many no two accounts agreeand in the course of the following week hundreds of arrests were made since then other demonstrations of the same kind have been held and will continue to be held let the cost be what it may the students declare until a clean sweep has been made of the police regime under which russia is groaning the gathering of the storm m baltaicheffs murder has drawn the worlds attention to the present state of things in russiawhich is much worse than most people imagine the present movement is not confined to the students alone though it is that class which makes most noise the revolutionary fever has gained a hold of the lower classesbrains and brawn as we said yesterday have combined and the combination is formidable more significant however than anything else if it be true is the statement of the neue freie presse that during the demonstrations in the kasan square in petersburg a detachment of infantry was called upon to fire upon the crowd the men thrice refused to obey were marched back to barracks no enquiry being subsequently held and that similar incidents have occurred elsewhere with universal service the army is only the people in uniform any popular feeling must sooner or later touch the army and if the soldiers cannot be depended upon to shoot the game of absolutism is up the great cataclysm may be nearer at hand than is generally supposed signs of smouldering revolt petersburgin two of the districts of the poltava government workmans riots have occurred in consequence of the systematic repression of little russia by greater russia the journal pridjeprowski krai gave the first intimation of the state of affairs and was promptly suspended for eight months petersburgthe murder of the procurator of the holy synod is regarded in a measure as the symptom of the general situation in russia it is reported that the chateau of the duke of mecklenburgh in se russia has been pillaged and destroyed by rioters berlinon the arrival of the express train from berlin at wirballen on the russian frontier today a passenger was arrested and nihilist documents were discovered in his trunks this is the third nihilist arrest within the fortnight the berlin police have received information from petersburg of numerous revolutionists having recently left france they are now maintaining from berlin a vigorous agitation against the tsars government from london too the whereabouts of several suspects have been reported in most cases the berlin authorities are powerless to effect arrests but they always supply full information to russia so that suspicious characters are always detained in passing the frontier anarchy advancing the kreuzzeitung which is unusually wellinformed in russian affairs expresses the opinion that one of the immediate consequences of the triumph of japan will be a general rising of the russian peasants against their landlords and of the army against the aristocracy the same paper declares that revolutionary agents of social democratic tendencies have long been systematically poisoning the minds of the people he turned back to the gathering of the storm and read the ominous paragraph again warning enough in all conscience he said first the public prosecutor assassinated at odessa then the chief of secret police of petersburg then the procurator of the holy synod and now a hekatombe sovereign royalty aristocracy government bureaucracy all annihilated and anarchy in excelsis france will take fire at any minute now thats absolutely certain oh how horrible but were all christians flavio and this is only one of the many funny ways in which we love one another he rose and went to the window the yellow cat deliberately stretched himself yawned and followed and proceeded to carry out a wonderful scheme of feints and ambuscades in regard to a pingpong ball which was kept for his proper diversion the man looked on almost lovingly flavio at length captured the ball took it between his forepaws and posed with all the majesty of a lion of trafalgar square anon he uttered a little low gurgle of endearment fixing the great eloquent mystery of amber and black velvet eyes tardy grave upon his human friend no notice was vouchsafed flavio got up and gently rubbed his head against the nearest hand my boy the man murmured and he lifted the little cat on to his shoulder he went downstairs he could not work and he was going to take an easy and he wanted a novel he said to his landlady he feared that he had read all the books in the house yes and those in the drawingroom too after a quarter of an hour application to a neighbour produced three miserable derelicts a nameless sixpenny shudder a braddon and an edna lyall not to seem ungracious he took them upstairs and pitched them into a corner to be returned upon occasion that salient trait of his character the desire not to be ungracious the readiness to be unselfish and selfsacrificing had done him incalculable injury this world is infested by innumerable packs of halflicked cubs and quartercultivated mediocrities who seem to have nothing better to do than to buzz about harassing and interfering with their betters out of courtesy out of kindness he was used to give way but all the same he tenaciously knew and clung to his original purpose he knew that delay was his enemy yet he invariably would stand aside and let himself be delayed and now towards the end of his youth he was poor lonely a misanthropic altruist he returned to his armchair breathing a long sigh of irritation and exhaustion broke up three cigarette dottels for a tobacco famine was afflicting him rolled them in a fresh paper and applied a match flavio with an indulgent protestant mew bounded from his knee to a bedroom chair and coiled himself up to sleep the armchair was placed directly in front of the fireplace the ordinary garretcoloured iron fireplace and mantel of a suburban lodginghouse attic to the grey wall above the mantel a large sheet of brown packingpaper was tacked on this background were pinned photographs of the hermes of herculaneum the terracotta sebastian of south kensington donatellos liparose david and the vivid david of verrocchio the wax model of cellinis perseys an unknown rugger xv prized for a single example of the rare felinehuman type and the ouds sebastian of twelfth night of tucked into the edges of these were italian picture postcards presenting andrea

the mantelshelf contained stone bottles of ink pipes a miniature in a closed morocco case a cast of cardinal andrea della valles seal from oxford two pairs of silver spectacles in shagreen cases four tiny ingots of pure copper a sponge gum bottle and an open book with painted covers showing eros at the knees of psyche and a mysterious group of divers in the clear of the moon the door was at a yard to the left of the fireplace at a rightangle uncaredfor clothes black serge and blue linen hung upon it a small wooden washstand stood between the door and the armchair convenient to the writers hand a strawboard covered the hole in its top and supported inkbottles pens penknife scissors a lamp a biscuittin of cigarettedottels sixteen exquisite greek intaglj on the lower shelf stood a row of booksofreference between the washstand and the fire was the chair whereon flavio slumbered if one may use so indelicate a word of so delicate a cat about four feet of wall extended on the right of the fireplace pinned there were a pencil design for a diamastigosis a black and white panel of young sophokles as choregos after salamis done on the back of an admiralty chart a water colour of tarquinio santacroce and alexander vi a pair of foils and fencing masks and a curious grecoitalian seal shewing st george as a wingfooted perseys wearing what looked like the garter mantle and labelled substitutes for shelves stood against the lower part of the wall a rushbasket closed and full of letters set up on end supported files of the american saturday review the author the outlook the salpinx reynardss and the pall mall gazette and a feather broom for dusting books and papers or for correcting flavio when obstreperous another rushbasket placed lengthwise on a bedroom chair held a row of books ms notebooks duodecimo classics of plantin estienne maittaire with english and american editions of the writers own works the third wall was pierced by two small windows wide open to the full always a chest of drawers protruded endways into the room its top was used as a standing desk the drawers opened towards the fourth wall sheaves of letters in metal clips hung at the end between it and the armchair more shelves were contrived of rushbaskets placed beneath and upon a small wooden table booksofreference lexicons and a box of blank paper congregated here convenient to the writers hand the little table drawer contained notepaper envelopes sealingwax and stamps the whole was arranged so that when once ensconced in the armchair before the fire with his writingboard on his knees the digladiator could reach all his weapons by a simple extension of his arms the attic was eleven feet square lowpitched and with half the ceiling slanting to the fourth foot from the floor on the fourth wall here was a campbed a small mirror and a towelrail three pairs of two six and tenpound dumbbells a pair of boots on trees a bottle of eucalyptus and a sprayproducer his eyes as they wandered round the room met these things he took a towel and went downstairs to the bathroom to wash his hands on returning he enticed flavio with a bit of string the cat was unwilling to play gazed at him with innocent imperscrutable round eyes elaborately yawned and requested permission to retire the odour of the kitchendinner was perceptible the door was opened and shut he put the butt of his cigarette in an earthenware jar on his left for future use the maid appeared with his lunch a basinful of bread and milk following some subconscious train of thought he stretched himself took the little mirror from the wall and went to the window its one of your bad days my friend he commented regarding his own image you look all your age and twelve years more draw down those feathered brows man never mind the upright furrow which makes you look stern draw them down and open your eyes and look alert do something to counteract the tender thin line of that mouth you mustnt let yourself relax like this it brings out your wrinkles and shews the sparseness of your hair if you had an inch more thigh and say a couple of inches more shin you might look people down a little more but with that meek subservient aspecthow luckock used to chaff about itno wonder everyone takes advantage of you whats the good of having your fastidious mind clearly written on that fastidious mouth if you dont insist on behaving fastidiously cultivate the art of looking as though you were about to say no you always can say yes after no but if you begin with yes as you always do you prevent yourself from ever saying no thats why everyone can swindle you youre far too anxious to give way buck up a bit you ugly little thing ugly as you are youre neither vulgar nor commonplace straighten your back and open your eyes wide and pull yourself together he put the mirror in its place and again cast a glance round the room seeking something to read something anything that was not too recent in his mind he picked up at random one of the rejected novels it was called donovan he remembered having seen in an exteapedlars magazine a print of the writer thereof he also remembered that he had found her selfconscious pose and labial conformation intensely antipathetic his sense of beauty was a great deal more than acute let his predilection which was for reticent expert virtue in the male and for innate delicate modesty in the female once be satisfied and the door to his favour lay open however he argued with himself she sells her books by tens of thousands while we dont sell ours by tens of hundreds well have a look at her work and see how she does it he ate his bread and milk and seriously and deliberately set himself to dissect and analyse the book the manner of the portrayal of a youth of an abnormal type of youth the sentientmodest type at once disgusted him by its inadequacy and superficiality the male human animal is omnipresent it is not difficult for an observant and careful writer to describe the things as they appear but the authors sex had prevented her from knowing and therefore from describing the things as they are it is doubtful whether man ever mentally knew woman it is certain that woman never knew man except in cases of occessionthe author of the gadfly for example he found the image of donovan fairly convincing not so the real donovan in his eponymous history obviously was the creation of a good sweetminded woman who created him in her own image the student several times was at the point of closing the book from sheer annoyance only the knowledge that he had nothing else to do and the desire to gain instruction caused him to persevere his temper only was logical in so far as it endowed him with the faculty of pursuance he began many things he followed them oftentimes the influence of luna on his environment obliged him to pause but invariably he returned to themeven after long years he returned to them and then slowly surely he concluded what he had begun he had tenacitythe feline pertinacity of vigorous untainted english blood cigarette after cigarette he rolled and smoked he frequently turned back and read a chapter over again flavio mewed for admittance he took him on his knee and continued reading stroking the little cat meanwhile tickling his larynx till he purred content so the dull march afternoon passed at five the maid brought a tray containing black coffee and dripping toast at halfpast six he took a bath and attended to his appearance execrating the pain of his swollen arm and the difficulty of keeping it out of the water he dined at halfpast seven on some soup and haricotbeans with butter and a baked apple meanwhile he counted the split infinitives in the days pall mall gazette when he was adolescent an oxford tutor had said of him that he possessed a critical faculty of no mean order at the time he had not understood the saying perfectly but he cultivated the faculty he taught himself in a very bitter school the arts of selection and discrimination and the art of annihilating rubbish to this perhaps was due his complete psychical detachment from other men he trod upon so many worms and few things are more exasperating than a man of whom it truly may be said a chiels amang ye takin notes after dinner he returned to his attic with his cup and the coffeepot and resumed his task in time he forgot the pain of his arm he even forgot the usual terrified anticipation of the late postmans knock such was his faculty for concentration he smoked cigarettes and sipped black coffee now and then oblivious of flavio who returned from a walk about eleven and promptly went to sleep on the foot of the bed a little after midnight he reached the end of the book turned back and examined the last chapter again and put it down yes he said shes a dear good woman her bookwellher book is cheap awkward vulgarbut its good its unpalteringly ugly and simple and good evidently its best to be good it pays anyhow its bound to pay in the long run he pushed flavios chair to the wall near the door by its side he placed the washstand from the left of his armchair he disposed the armchair also against the wall leaving a cleared space of garretcoloured drugget between the dead fire and the bed this was his gymnasium if a book like that pays he reflected it must be that theres a lot of people who care for books about the good why not do one of that sort instead of casting folklore and history before publishers who turn and rend you the pity is that the good should be so dreadfully dowdy evidently k and are just as distinct as they were in the days of the broadbrowed one sophisms again why cant you be honest and simple instead of subtile and complex youre just like your own cat ambuscading a pingpong ball as strategically and as scrupulously as though it were a mouse for goodness sake dont try to deceive yourself its all very well to pose before the world but theres no one here to see you now strip man strip stark you perfectly know that the good always is admirable whether it be dowdy or chic and that what you call the beautiful is no more than a matter of opinion worthwell generally speaking not worth six and eightpence he threw all his clothes on the armchair picked his trousers out of the heap and folded them lengthwise over the towelrail powdered his arm with borax and bound cottonwool over it looked at his dumbbells while he brushed his hair sprayed the room with eucalyptus and got into bed extreme fatigue and pain rendered him almost hysterical his thoughts expressed themselves in ejaculations when he had tied a handkerchief over his eyes straightened his legs and laid his right cheek on the pillow yes it pays to be goodjust simple goodness pays i know oh i know i always knew it god if ever you loved me hear me hear me de profundis ad te ad te clamavi dont i want to be good and clean and happy what desire have i cherished since my boyhood save to serve in the number of your mystics what but that have i asked of you who made me not a chance do you give meeverever listen how can i serve you how be happy clean or good while you keep me so sequestered oh i know of that psalm where it is written that you set apart for yourself the godly am i godly ah no nor even goodly im your prisoner writhing in my fetters fettered impotent utterly unhappy only he who is good and clean is happy i am clean god but neither good nor happy not alone can a man be good or happy force which generates no one thing is not force all intelligence must be active potent im intelligent so o god you made me therefore i must be active of my nature i must act for the chance to act i languish i am impotent and inactive always he who wishes to be good strives to do good deeds must be done to others by the doer therefore i in my loneliness am futile friends and which of them have you left me faithful these twelve years of my solitude god not one andrews faithless and aubrey faithless brander faithless lancaster faithless strages faithless and perfidious scuttle also fareham roole and nicholas faithless tatham faithless that detestable and deceitful blackcote who came fawning upon me crying courage you shall suffer no more as you have suffered and then robbed me of months and years of labour ah and lawrence my little lawrence faithless women what do i know of women nothing fiat justitiawell theres caerleon but a bishop is very far above me and his friendship is only condescensionhonest genial kind butcondescension still he wishes me well i truly think it but if only he would believe me trust me shew faith in me and absolutely trust mei might do what the mouse did for the lion strong but why do i name my splendid master strong of nature and strong of name and station strong of body and strong of mind immensely my superior altogether knowing all my weakness and all my imperfection who to me is as much like you as any man can be it is only grand indulgence and urbanity on his part which make him know me and when the sun lacks splendour only then will megaloprepes need me only then kalos kagathos perchance may need me why o god have you made me strange uncommon such a mystery to my fellowcreatures not a man among men like other people do i want to appear like other people no no certainly not butlord god am i such a ruffian as to merit exile oh of course im a sinner vile and shameful but god look at the wreck which you have let them make of me and my life you have some purpose in it all oh you must have if you are god and i know that you are o god i thank you but lookhavent i tried and toiled and suffered yet you never allow me any satisfaction any gain or reward for all my trouble no but you always let some shameless brigand rob me snatching the fair fruit of my labours yes i know how i dream of certain pleasures certain luxuries cleanness whiteness freshness and simplicity and the life of quiet healthful vigorous and serene welldoing all in secret and all unostentatious which when once i achieve success i will have i know all about that but you know also i that never should use success in that way if you gave it to me now did i ever use success for myself and not for others no i couldnt endure the eternal silent wistful vision of your maidenmother you know why i want freedom power and moneyjust to make a few people happy just to put things right a bit just to make things easy just to straighten out tangled lives whose tangles make me rage because i myself am helpless is that wrong noi swear my aim is single and unselfish i dont want credit even you well know that you made me alldenuded of the power of loving anybody of the power of being loved by any selfcontained you have made me i shall always be detached and apart from others murmur no i never have murmurednor will murmur truly though i should like to love to be loved but so long i have been alone and lonely i suppose i must go on like that always till the end they are frightened of me even when they come to the very verge of loving they are frightened because of certain labels which i frequently use to put on others frightened lest i should fit them also some day with a label oh often they have told me that they wouldnt like me to be against them i will stop that o god if you desire it but instead of it what i think you mean me not to waste the one talent you have given then i beg of you give me scope i must act no i am not doing well at presentnot my best oh i know it and i loathe it all my life is a pose somehow or other i have taken the pose or stolid stupids force me into the pose of strange recondite haughty genius very subtile very learned inaccessibleeverything thats foolish god you know what a sham i am how silly this is how very little i know really dont i know it too dont i always tell them then they say that im modestmehamodest heres the truth by my one hope of salvation i am frightened of all men known and unknown and of women i go in violent terror though i always do say superb and hard things to the one and all pretty gentle soft things to the other while writing pitilessly of them bothfor im frightened of them frightened and i want to avoid them and to keep them off me therefore i pose and therefore also i provide an image which they can worship like or loathe as it pleases or displeases or strikes aweand they generally loathe it all the time while they manifest their feelings i look on like a child at punch and judy oh its wrong very wrong wrong altogether but what can i do god tell me clearly unmistakeably and distinctly tell me tell me what i must doand make me do it he got out of bed took his rosary from his trousers pocket and returned during the fifth meditation on the finding of the lord in the temple he fell asleep dr courtleigh and dr talacryn he repeated as a query in the tone of one to whom beelzebub and the archangel periel have been announced at eleven oclock on the morning of a working day yes the maid replied clergymen one is that bishop who came before the bishop who came before andwhats the other like oh quite old and feeblerather stoutishbut hes been a fine handsome man in his day he wears a red necktie under his collar welliam thanks ill be down in a minute george put his writingboard away and brushed the front of his blue linen jacket mentally and corporeally pulling himself together flavio i should just like to know the meaning of this i rather wish that i had iulo here to back me up if they are meditating mischief an athletic and quarrelsome youngster with an eye like a basilisk and a mouth full of torrential english would be an excellent trump to play mischief what nonsense dont you give way to your nerves man respectable epistatai do not habitually engage in mischief as you are well aware you have nothing to fear so put on a maskthe superior one with a tinge of disdain in itand brace yourself up to resist the devil and go downstairs at once to see him flee the two visitors were in the diningroom a confined drab and aniline room rather overfilled with indistinct but useful furniture when george entered they stood upgrave important men of over forty and seventy years respectively darkhaired and robust whitehaired and of picturesque and supercilious mien george went straight to the younger prelate kneeled and kissed the episcopal ring your eminency will understand that i do not wish to be disrespectful he said to the senior with as much quiet antipathy as could be crowded into one mans voice but the bishop of caerleon calls himself my friend and i am at a loss to know to what i may attribute the honour of your eminencys presence or the manner in which you will allow me to receive you i hope mr rose that you will accept my blessing as well as dr talacryns the cardinalarchbishop replied in a voice where hauteur strangely struggled with timidity he extended his hand george instantly took it and respectfully kneeled again noting that this ring contained a cameo instead of the cardinalitial sapphire then he caused his guests to become seated the atmosphere seemed to him laden with the invigorating aroma of possibilities zmnts wishes to ask you a few questions the young bishop began and he thought you would not take it amiss if i were present as your friend george shot a glance of wouldbe affectionate gratitude at the speaker and turned saying i have been imagining your eminency in romein the conclave i was there until a fortnight ago and thenwell you are said to be an expert in the annals of conclaves mr rose so it will interest you to know that we stand adjourned for the removal of the conclave from rome oh dear no there is no need for removal the piedmontese usurpers treat us with profound respect im bound to say no we simply stand adjourned but this is extremely interesting george exclaimed surely its unique and may i askno i would not venture to inquire the cause but is this generally known i have seen nothing of it in the papers and i am not on speaking terms with any roman catholics except the no it is not generally known and it is not intended to make an official announcement for reasons which you will understand and which i believe you will respect i am much honoured by your eminencys confidence george purred certain affairs required my personal presence in england the cardinal continued he was a feeble aged man almost senile sometimes he hesitated he stumbled but he maintained the progression of the conversation on its hands and knees as it were with these are very pregnant times mr rose george went to the door admitted his cat who was mewing outside and resumed his seat flavio brushed by cardinalitial and episcopal gaiters turn by turn bounded to his friends knee couched and became still save for twinkling ears the prelates exchanged glances but perhaps you will let me say no more on that subject and come directly to the point i wished to consult you upon the cardinal now seemed to have cleared the obstacles and he archiepiscopally pranced along it has recently been brought very forcibly to my remembrance that you were at one time a candidate for holy orders mr rose i am cognizant of all the unpleasantness which attended that portion of your career but it is only lately that i have realised the fact that you yourself have never accepted acquiesced in the adverse verdict of your superiors i never have accepted it i never have acquiesced in it i never will accept it i never will acquiesce in it would you mind telling me your reasons i should have to say very disagreeable things eminency never mind tell me all the truth try to feel that you are confiding in your spiritual father whose only desire is to do justicei may even say to do justice at the eleventh hour i am inclined indeed to believe that because you yourself have condescended to come to me i wish in fact to believe that butis it advisable to rake up old grievances is it desirable to scarify halfhealed wounds and how did your eminency find me after all these years the feline temper of him produced dalliance it certainly was a difficult matter at first you had completely disappeared i object to that george interrupted he suddenly saw that this was the one chance of his life of saying the right thing to the right person and he determined to fight every step of the way with this cardinal before death claimed him i object to that he repeated i neither disappeared nor hid myself in any way there was no question of concealment whatever i found myself most perfidiously deserted and i went on my way alone neither altering my habits nor changing my appearance there was no implication of that kind mr rose i am very glad to hear your eminency say so but such things are said they are the formul which spite or indolence or foolishness uses of a man whom it has not seen for a month sometimes they are detrimental to me they are offensive and i am not in a mood to tolerate them the cardinal swallowed the cachet and proceeded i first wrote to you at your publishers and my letters were returned unopened and marked refused that was in accordance with my own explicit directions a few years ago the opportunity was given me of drawing a sharp line across my life you mean i allude to a series of libels which were directed against me in the newspapers especially in catholic newspapersdirty keltic woodpulp precisely but why was that an occasion for drawing what you call a sharp line across your life eminency said george calming down and setting out to be concise and categorical scores of people who had known me all my life must have seen that those attacks were libellous and false you yourself must have seen that he stretched out a hand and opened and shut it as though claws protruded from velvet and retired yet only a single one out of all those scores came forward to assure me of friendship in that dreadful moment all the rest spewed their bile or licked their lips in unctuous silence i was left to bear the brunt alone except for that one and he was not a catholic except from him i had no sympathy and no comfort whatever i dont know any case in all my reading to say nothing of my experience where a man had a better or a clearer or a more convincing test of the trueness and the falseness of his friends not to do any man an injustice and that no one might call me rash or precipitate in my decision i waited two yearstwo whole years the bishop of caerleon came to me in this period of isolation and one other catholic a man of my own trade later that one betrayed me again so i will say no more of him women of course i neglect and the rest unanimously held aloof then i published a book and i told my publishers to refuse all letters which might be addressed to them for me the sharp line was drawn i wanted no more fairweather friends afraid to stand by me in storms if after those two awful years i had received overtures from my former acquaintances i really think i should have fulminated at them st matthew xxv what is that i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat down to depart from me ye cursed into onial fire yes the sharp line was drawn across my life i had one true friend a protestant as for the faith i found it comfortable as for the faithful i found them intolerable the bishop of caerleon at present is the exception which proves the rule because he came to me in the teeth of calumny you are hard mr rose very hard i am what you and your catholics have made me poor childpoor child the cardinal adjected i request that your eminency will not speak to me in that tone i disdain your pity at this date the catastrophe is complete i nourish no grudge and seek no revenge no nor even justice i am content to live my own life avoiding all my brothercatholics or treating them with severe forbearance when circumstances throw them in my path i dont squash cockroaches the effect on your own soul the effect on my own soul is perfectly ghastly i positively loathe and distrust all catholics known and unknown with one exception i have become a rudderless derelict i have lost all faith in man and i have lost the power of loving how terrible the cardinal sighed and are there none of us for whom you have a kindly feeling at times i mean you cannot always be in a state of whitehot rage you know there must be intervals when the tension of your anger is relaxed perhaps from sheer fatigue for anger is deliberate the effect of exertion and in those intervals have you never caught yourself thinking kindly of any of your former friends yes eminency there are very many clerks and laics both with whom strange to say when my anger is not dynamic i sometimes wish to be reconciled however i myself never will approach them and they afford me no opportunity they do not come to me as you have come his voice softened a little and his smile was an alluring illumination but you would meet them with vituperation and naturally they dont want to expose themselves to affronts oh of course if their sense of duty to say nothing of decency does not teach them to risk affrontsbut i will not say before hand how i should meet them beyond this it would depend on their demeanour to me i should do as i am done by for example he turned to the ruddy bishop did i heave chairs or chinaware at your lordship indeed you did not although i thoroughly deserved both yrmnts the young prelate continued i believe i understand mr roses frame of mind he has been hit very hard and hes badly bruised he is a burnt child and he dreads the fire its only natural im firmly convinced that he has been more sinned against than sinning and though im sorry to see him practically keeping us at arms length i really dont know what else we can expect until we treat him as we ourselves would like to be treated true true the cardinal conceded but its a pity all the same the bishop concluded the cardinal audibly thought you have perhaps not many very kindly feelings towards me personally mr rose i have no kindly feelings at all toward your eminency and i believe you to be aware of my reasons i trust that i never should be found wanting in reverence to your sacred purple but apart from that indignant recollection stiffened and inflamed the speakerindeed i only am speaking civilly to you now because you are the successor of augustine and theodore and dunstan and anselm and chichele and chichester and because my friend the bishop of caerleon has made you my guest for the nonce my lord cardinal i do not know what you want of me nor why you have come to me but let me tell you that you shall not entangle me again in my talk you are going the catholic way to work with me and that is the wrong way frankness and open honesty is the only way to win meif you want me well well you were going to give me your own view of your vocation your eminency first was about to tell me how you found me after your letters to my publishers had been returned i applied to several catholics who formerly had been your friends and when they could tell me nothing i had a letter sent to all the bishops of my province directing inquisition to be made among the clergy your personality if not your name was certain to be known to at least one of these if you still remained catholic you know if i still remained catholic george growled with contemptuous ire people in your position mr rose have been known to commit apostasy and it is precisely because people in my position habitually commit apostasy that i decline to do what is expected of me no ill follow my cats example of exclusive singularity it would be too obliging and too silly to give you catholics that weapon to use against me no no eminency rest assured that i rather will be a nuisance and poor as i am than an apostate and rich as i might be the cardinal raised his eyebrows i trust you have a worthier motive than that i mentioned that i was not in revolt against the faith but against the faithful and the grace of god oh of course the grace of god george hastened in common courtesy conventionally to adjoin the fine dark brows came down again and the cardinal continued as soon as i had issued the mandate to my suffragans dr talacryn at once furnished the desired information i see said george then where would your eminency like me to begin tell me your own tale in your own way dear child george softly and swiftly stroked his little cat he compelled himself to think intensely to marshal salient facts on which he had brooded day and night unceasingly for years and to try to eliminate traces of the acerbity of the devouring fury with which they still inspired him perhaps id better tell mr rose yrmnts that weve already gone very deeply into his case the bishop said it will make it easier for him to speak when he knows that it is not information were seeking but his personal point of view indeed it will said george and i sincerely thank your lordship if you already know the facts you will be able to check my narrative and all i have to do is to state the said facts to the best of my knowledge and belief i will begin with my career at maryvale where i was during a scholastic year of eight months as an ecclesiastical subject of the bishop of claughton and where i received the tonsure at the end of those eight months my diocesan wrote that he was unable to make any further plans for me because there was not i quote his words an unanimous verdict of the superiors in favour of my vocation this was like a bolt from the blue for the four superiors verbally had testified the exact contrary to me instantly i wrote inviting them to explain the discrepancy it was the long vacation in reply the president averred inability to understand my diocesans statement advised me to change my diocese and volunteered an introduction to the bishop of lambeth in which he declared that my talents and energy i am quoting again would make me a very valuable priest the vicepresident declined to add anything to what he already had told me a dark man he was who hid inability under a guise of austerity the professor of dogmatic theology said that he never had been asked for and never had volunteered an opinion the professor of moral theology who was my confessor said the same and further he superintended my subsequent correspondence with my bishop you will mark the intentions of that act of his however all came to nothing the bishop of claughton refused to explain to recede to afford me satisfaction the bishop of lambeth refused to look at me because the bishop of claughton had rejected me it was my first introduction to the inexorability of the roman machine inexorable in iniquity as in righteousness did you form any opinion at this juncture the cardinal inquired waving a white hand i formed the opinion that someone carelessly had lied that someone clumsily had blundered and that all concerned were determined not to own themselves or anyone else but me to be in the wrong a mistake had been made and by quibbles by evasions by threats by every holeandcorner means conceivable the mistake was going to be perpetuated had the case been one of the ordinary type of ecclesiastical student the hebete and halflicked keltic class i mean either i furiously should have apostatized or i mildly should have acquiesced and should have startedin as a porkbutcher or a cheesemonger but those intellectually myopic authorities were unable to discriminate and they quite gaily wrecked a life oh yes i formed an opinion and i very freely stated it i mean did you form any opinion of your own concerning your vocation no my opinion concerning my vocation such as it was and is had been formed when i was a boy of fifteen i was very fervent about that time i frankly admit that i played the fool from seventeen to twenty sowed my wild oats if you like but i never relinquished my divine gift i just neglected it and said domani like any roman and at twentyfour i became extremely earnest about it yes my opinion was as now unchanged unchangeable continue the cardinal said a year after i left maryvale the archbishop of agneda was instigated by one of his priests a varsity man who knew me well to invite me to volunteer for his archdiocese i was only too glad his grace sent me to st andrews college in rome the priest who recommended me and canon dugdale assured me that in return for my services my expenses would be borne by the archbishop they never were i was more than one hundred and twenty pounds out of pocket after four months in college i was expelled suddenly and brutally no reason ever has been given to me and i never have been aware of a reason which could justify so atrocious an outrage my archbishop maintained absolute silence i did hear it said that i had no vocation that was the gossip of my fellowstudents immature cubs mostly hybrid larrikins given to false quantities and nasal cacophonies i took and take no account of such gossip if my legitimate superiors had had grounds for their action grounds which they durst expose to daylight and if they frankly had stated the same to me i believe i should have given very little trouble as it is i am of course a thorn or a pest or a firebrand or a rodent and purulent ulcervous en faites votre choix the case is a mystery to me inexplicable except by an hypothesis connected with the character of the rector of st andrews college i remember the marquess of mountstuart reading a leading article about him out of the scotsman to me in and remarking that he was an awful little liar but perhaps the right reverend gentleman is known to your eminency well known mr rose well known and now tell me of your subsequent proceedings i made haste to offer my services to other bishops when i found every door shut against me i firmly deliberated never to recede from my grade of tonsured clerk under any circumstances whatever and i determined to occupy my energies with some pursuit for which my nature fitted me until the divine giver of my vocation should deign to manifest it to others as well as to myself i chose the trade of a painter i was just beginning to make headway when the defalcations of a catholic ruined me all that i ever possessed was swallowed up even my tools of trade illegally were seized i began life again with no more than the clothes on my back a book of hours and eight shillings in my pocket i obtained from a certain prelate whose name i need not mention a commission for a series of pictures to illustrate a scheme which he had conceived for the confounding of anglicans he saw specimens of my handicraft was satisfied with my ability provided me with materials for a beginning and a disused skittlealley for a studio and a few weeks later i quote his secretary he altered his mind and determined to put his money in the building of a cathedral i think that i need not trouble your eminency with further details quite unnecessary mr rose i dont know how i kept alive until i got my next commission i only remember that i endured that frightful winter of in light summer clothes unchanged but i did not die and by odds and ends of work i managed to recover a great deal of my lost ground then a harebrained and degenerate priest asked me to undertake another series of pictures i worked two years for him and he valued my productions at fifteen hundred pounds in fact he sold them at that rate well he never paid me again i lost all my apparatus all my work and was reduced to the last extreme of penury then i began to write simply because of the imperious necessity of expressing myself and i had much to say note please that i asked nothing better than to be a humble chantrypriest saying mass for the dead it was denied me i turned to express beautiful and holy ideals on canvas again i was prevented i must and will have scope an outlet for what the president of maryvale called my talent and energy literature is the only outlet which you catholics have left me blame yourselves not me oh yes i have very much to say he paused the cardinal evaded his glance and intently gazed at the underside of wellmanicured pinkonyx fingernails and about your vocation mr rose what is your present opinion george wrenched himself from retrospection my opinion eminency as i already have had the honour of telling you is the same as it always has been that is to say that i have a divine vocation to the priesthood you persist eminency i am not one of your low erse or pseudo gaels flippertigibbets of frothy flighty fervour whom you can blow hither and thither with a sixpence for a fan thank the lord im english born under cancer tenacious slow and sure naturally i persist cardinalitial eyebrows reascended the man to whom divine providence vouchsafes a vocation is bound to prosecute it i am prosecuting it i never for one moment have ceased from prosecuting it but now you have attained a position as an author yes in the teeth of you all and no thanks to anyone but myself however that is only the means to an end in what way in this way when i shall have earned enough to pay certain debts which i incurred on the strength of my faith in the honour of a parcel of archiepiscopal and episcopal and clerical sharpers and also a sum sufficient to produce a small and certain annuity then i shall go straight to rome and square the rector of st andrews college shh the bishop sibilated the cardinal threw up delicate hands yrmnts mustnt be offended by mr roses satirical way of putting it the bishop hastily put in hes a regular phrasemaker its his trade you know but at the bottom of his good heart im sure he means nothing but what is right and proper and george youre not the man to smite the fallen monsignor cateran was deposed seven years ago and more i beg your eminencys pardon if i have spoken inurbanely and i thank your lordship for interpreting me so generously i didnt know that cateran had come to his cannae really im sorry but ive been stabbed and stung so many years that now i am able to retaliate i am as touchy as a hornet with a brandnew sting i cant help it i seem to take an impish delight in making my brothercatholics especially clerks smart and wince and squirm as i myself have squirmed and winced and smarted im sorry i simply meant to say that when i have made myself free and independent then i will try again to give you evidence of my vocation have you approached your diocesan recently the cardinal inquired his grace died soon after my expulsion from st andrews college i approached his successor who refused to hear me and is dead i never have approached the present archbishop beyond giving him notice of my existence and persistence for i certainly will not come before him with chains on my hands chains debts have you any special reason for belonging to the archdiocese of agneda there is a certain fascination in the idea of administering to a horde of unspeakable barbarians the horrible and ultimate britons ferocious to strangers otherwise i have no special reason i had no choice i happen to have been made an ecclesiastical subject of agneda at the instance of mr george semphill and at the invitation of the late archbishop smithson that is all would you be inclined to offer your services to another bishop now eminency it is not i who have lost the athenians it is the athenians who have lost me i would say that in greek if i thought you would understand me when the athenians want me they will not have much difficulty in finding me but to tell you the truth i find these bishopjohnnies excessively tiresome as i said just now when agneda silently relieved himself of his obligations to me i offered my services to halfadozen of them more or less plainly telling them my history and my circumstances what a fool they must have thought meor what a brazen and dangerous scoundrel yes i do believe they thought me that i was astonishingly unsophisticate then i didnt know a tithe of what i know now and i solemnly assever that i believe those owllike hierarchs to have been completely flabbergasted because i neither whimpered penitence nor whined for mercy but actually had the effrontery to tell them the blind and naked truth about myself truth nude and unadorned is such a rare commodity among catholics as you know and especially among the clergy and i suppose as long as we continue to draw the majority of our spiritual pastors from the hooligan class from the scum of the gutter that the man who tells the truth in his own despite always emphatically will be condemned as mad or bad or both really mr rose the cardinal interjected yes eminency we teach little children that there are three kinds of lies and that the officiose lie which is told to excuse oneself or anotherthe meanest lie of the lot i sayis only a venial sin its in the catechism well naturally enough the miserable little wretches who cant possibly grasp the subtilty of a distinguo put undue importance on that abominable world only and they grow up as the most despicable of all liars ouf i learned all this from a thin thing named danielson just after my return to the faith of my forefathers he lied to me in my innocence i took his word then i found him out and preached on the enormity of his crime well sir says he as bold as brass its only a venial sin george youre beside the point the bishop said his eminency will indulge me what was i saying ohthat i had had enough of being rebuffed by bishops i came to that conclusion when his lordship of chadsee blandly told me that i never would get a bishop to accept my services as long as i continued to tell the truth about my experiences i stopped competing for rebuffs then i do not propose to begin again until i am the possessor of a chequebook the cardinal was gazing through the leaves of an indiarubber plant out of the window his magnificent eyes were drained of all expression when the nervose deliberatelyhardened and pathetic voice of the speaker ceased he brought the argument to a focus with these words george arthur rose i summon you to offer yourself to me i am not ready to offer myself to your eminency not ready i hoped that i had made it clear to you that in regard to my vocation i am marking time until i shall have earned enough to pay my debts incurred on the strength of my faith in the honour of a parcel of archiepiscopal and episcopal and clerical sharpers and also a sum sufficient to produce me a small and certain annuity you keep harping upon that string the cardinal complained it is the only string which you have left unbroken on my lute i see you are a very sensitive subject mr rose i think that long brooding over your wrongs has fixed in you some such pagan and erroneous idea as that which juvenal expresses in the verse where he says that poverty makes a man ridiculous nothing of the kind george retorted with all his claws out on the contrary it is ithe creature of you my lord cardinal and your catholicswho make holy poverty look ridiculous a clever paradox the cardinal let a tinge of his normal sneer affect his voice not even a paradox a poor thing but mine own george flung in glaring through his greatgreatgrandfathers silver spectacles which he used indoors well well the moneyquestion need not trouble you said the cardinal turning again to the window indifference was his pose but it does trouble me it vitally troubles me and your amazing summons troubles me as wellnow why do you come to me after all these years precisely mr rose after all these years as you say it has been suggested to me and i am bound to say that i agree with the suggestion that we ought to take your singular persistency during all these yearshow many years say twenty that we must take your singular persistency during twenty years as a proof of the genuineness of your vocation george turned his face to the little yellow cat who had climbed to and was nestling on his shoulder and therefore the cardinal continued i am here today to summon you to accept holy order with no delay beyond the canonical intervals i will respond to that summons within two years within two years life is uncertain mr rose we who are here today may be in our graves by then i myself am an old man i know your eminency is an old man i by the grace of god the virtue of my ancestors and my own attention to my physique am still a young man and younger by far than my years i have not been preserved in the vigour and freshness of youth by miracle after miracle during twenty years for nothing and when i shall have published three more books i will respond to your summons not till then i told you that the moneyquestion need not hinder you yes eminency and my late diocesan said the same thing several years ago you are suspicious mr rose i have reason to be suspicacious eminency the cardinal threw up his hands the gesture wedded irritation to despair you doubt me he all but gasped i trusted your eminency in and the bishop intervened for cardinalitial human nature burst out in vermilion flames george he said i am witness of zmntss words whats the good of that suppose that i take his eminencys word suppose that in a couple of months he alters his mind determines to mistake the large for the great and to perpetrate another peasoupandstreakybaconcoloured caricature of an electriclightstation what then would be my remedy where would be my contract again and could i hale a prince of the church before a secular tribunal would i could i subpna your lordship to testify against your metropolitan and provincial would i would you my lord cardinal i must speak and you must hear me as man to man you are offering me holy orders on good grounds on right and legitimate grounds on grounds which i knew would be conceded sooner or later i thank god for conceding them now you also are offering something in the shape of money in his agitation he suddenly rose to flavios supreme discomfiture and began to roll a cigarette from dottels in a tray on the mantelpiece if i correctly interpret you you are offering to me who will be no mans pensioner who will accept no mans gifts a gift a pension no the cardinal very mildly interjected but restitution oh george ejaculated suddenly sitting down and staring like the martyr who while yet the pagan pincers were at work upon his tenderest internals beheld the angelbearers of his amaranthine coronal amends and restitution the cardinal repeated what am i to say george addressed his cat and the bishop you are simply to say in what form you will accept this act of justice from us the cardinal responded taking the question to himself oh i must have time to think you must afford me time to think no george said the bishop take no time at all speak your mind now do make an effort to believe that we are sincerely in earnest and that in this matter we are in your hands i may say that yrmnts he inquired certainly we place ourselves in mr roses handsunreservedlyha the cardinal affirmed and gasped with the exertion george concentrated his faculties and recited rather than spoke demurely and deliberately and dynamically i must have a written expression of regret for the wrongs which have been done to me both by your eminency and by others who have followed your advice command or example it is here the cardinal said taking a folded paper from the fascicule of his breviary we knew that you would want that i may point out that i have written in my own name and also as the mouthpiece of the catholic body george took the paper and carefully read it two or three times with some flickering of his thin fastidious lips it certainly was very handsome then he said i thank your eminency and my brothercatholics and put the document in the fire where in a moment it was burned to ash man alive cried the bishop i do not care to preserve a record of my superiors humiliation said george again in his didactic recitative i see that mr rose knows how to behave nobly as you said frank the cardinal commented only now and then eminency one cannot be always posing but i long ago had arranged to do that if you ever should give me the opportunity and now he pausedand continued you concede my facts we may not deny them mr rose then now that i in my turn have placed myself in your hands again he was reciting i must have a sum of moneythat paradoxical must was quite in his best manneri must have a sum of money equal to the value of all the work which i have done since and of which i have beenfor which i have not been paid i must have five thousand pounds and the amount of your debts and a solatium for the sufferings you no more can solace me for my sufferings than you can revest me with ability to love my neighbour the paltry amount of my debts concerns me and my creditors and no one else if i had been paid for my work i should have had no debts when i am paid i shall pay the five thousand pounds are yours mr rose but who is being robbed my dear child from the cardinal and george from the bishop robbed eminency dont we all know the catholic manner of robbing peter to pay paul i repeat who is being robbed that i may be paid for i refuse to touch a farthing diverted from religious funds or extracted from the innocuous devout you need not be alarmed on that score your history is wellknown to many of us as you know latterly it has deeply concerned some of us as perhaps you do not know and one who used to call himself your friend whohapromised never to let you sinkand let you sinkone who acquiesced when others wronged you has now been moved to place ten thousand pounds at my disposal in retribution as a sort of sinoffering i intend to use it for your rehabilitation mr rosewell then for your enfranchisement now that we understand each other i shall open an accounthave you a banking account thoughvery good i will open an account in your name at couttss on my way back to pimlico i must know the name of that penitent sinner for quite a score have said as much as your eminency has quoted edward lancaster i might have guessed it well he never will miss itits just a drop of his oceani think i can do as much with it as he caneminency give him my love and say that i will take five thousand pounds not more the restoh i know i hand it to your eminency to give to converted clergymen who are harassed with wives or to a sensible secular home for working boys or to the bishop of caerleon for his dreadful diocese yes divide it between them the prelates stood up to go george kneeled and received benedictions we shall see you at archbishops house mr rose said the cardinal on the doorstep if your eminency will telegraph to agneda at once you will be able to get my dimissorials to your archdiocese by tomorrow mornings post i will be at archbishops house at halfpast seven to confess to the bishop of caerleon your eminency says mass at eight and will admit me to holy communion at halfpast eight the post will be in and you will give me the four minor orders thenwell then eminency with a dear smile you see i am not anxious for delay now and meanwhile i will go and have a turkish bath and buy a roman collar and think myself back into my newnomy old life what does yrmnts make of him the bishop inquired as the shabby brougham moved away god knows god only knows the cardinal responded i hope well weve done what we set out to do havent we what a most extraordinary what a most incomprehensible creature to be sure i dont of course like his paganism nor his flippancy nor his slang nor his readiness to dictate and he is certainly sadly lacking in humility he treated both of us with scant respect you must admit frank what was it he called ushabishopjohnniesnow you cant defend that and owllike hierarchs too indeed no i believe he hasnt a scrap of reverence for any of us after all i dont exactly see that we can expect it but it may come in time do you really think so said the cardinal and the four eyes in the carriage turned together met and struck the spark of a recondite and mutual smile for my part the younger prelate continued im going to try to make amends for the immense wrong i did him by neglecting him i cant get over the feeling of distrust i have of him yet but i confess im strangely drawn to him it is such a treat to come across a man whos not above treating a bishop as his equal did it strike you that he was acting a part indeed yes i think he was acting a part nearly all the time but im sure he wasnt conscious of it hes as transparent and guileless as a child whatever it seemed to me that he had all these pungent little speeches cut and dried he said them like a lesson well poor fellow hes thought of nothing else for years and i find yrmnts that mental concentration carried to anything like that extreme gives a sort of power of prevision i really believe that he had foreseen something and was quite prepared for us strange said the cardinal whose supercilious oblique regard indicated dearth of interest in ideas that were out of his depth he behaved very well about the money though very well indeed but what a fool well frank we can only pray that he may turn out well i think he will i really think he will i hope and trust that we shall find the material of sanctity there an unpleasant kind of sanctity perhaps he will be difficult that singular character and the force which all those selfconcentrated years have given himoh hell never submit to management depend upon it frank ive seen just that type of face among academic anarchists it will be our business to watch him for he will go his own way and his way will have to be our way it wont be the wrong way butoh yes he will be very difficult wellgod only knows will you be on the lookout for a telegraph office frank while i get through my little hours perhaps we had better the cardinal opened his breviary at sext and made the sign of the cross george returned to the diningroom and sat down in the cane foldingchair which the cardinal had vacated he lighted the cigarette rolled during conversation flavio had taken possession of the seat lately occupied by the bishop a deepcushioned wickerwork armchair and was very majestically posed haunches broad and high and yellow as a cocoon the beautiful brush displayed at length forepaws daintily tucked inward under the paler breast the grand head guardant a shameless female began to shriek scales and roulades in an opposite house george made plans for blasting her with a mammoth gramaphone which should bray nothing but trumpetchoruses out of his open windows he smoked his cigarette to the butt eyeing the cat then he said boy where are we flavio winked and turned away his head as who should say obviously here george accepted the hint he went upstairs and changed into black serge borrowed a few sovereigns from his landlord ate his lunch of bread and milk and took the l and nw rail to highbury walking away from the station amid the blatant and vivacious inurbanity of islington upper street he kept his mental processes inactivethe higher mental processes of induction and deduction the faculties of criticism and judgment his method was aristotelean in that he drew his universals from a consideration of numerous particulars he had plenty of material for thought and he stored it till the time for thinking came now he was out of doors for the sake of physical exercise also he was getting the mornings events into perspective at present his mind resembled warm wax on a tablet wherein externals inscribed but transient impressionsan obese magenta jewess with new boots which had a white line round their idiotic high heelsa baby with neglected nostrils festooned over the side of a mailcarta neat boys leg long and singularly wellturned extended in the act of mounting a bicyclean anglican sisterofmercy displaying sidespring prunellos and one eye in a haberdashers violent windowa venerable shy drudge of a pianotuner whose left arm was dragged down by the weight of the unmistakable little bag of toolsthe weary anxious excruciating asking look in the eyes of all he made his way southwestward walking till he was tired for an hour and a half anon he was lying face downward in the calidarium of the bath a slim white form evenly muscular boyishly fine and smooth his forehead rested on his crossed arms veiling his eyes he came here because here he was unknown the place with its attendants and frequenters was quite strange to him he would not be bored by the banalities of familiar tractators and an encounter with any of his acquaintance was out of the question from time to time he refreshed himself in the shower but while his procumbent body was at rest in the hot oxygenated air he let his mind work easily and quickly after two hours he concluded his bath with a long cold plunge and retired rosily tingling to the unctuarium to smoke here he made the following entries in his pocketbook have i been fair to them yes but unmerciful nb for an act to be really good and meritorious it must be performed noluntarily and with selfcompulsion what have i gained a verbal promise of priesthood and a verbal promise of five thousand pounds mymymymymymym what has he gained if hes honest the evacuation of a purulent abscess the allegiance of a man who wants to be faithful and perhaps the merit of saving a soul nb there was unwillingness and selfcompulsion in him why was he so timid a great part of what i said was gratuitously exasperating why did he stand it what does he know that i dont know what do i know that he doesnt know what salient things have i in my usual manner left unsaid did i say more than enough have i given myself away again is he honest what was his real motive oh why did he humiliate himself so dont know dont know dont know now what shall i do advance one pace do ye nexte thynge as he was powdering his vaccinated arm with borax before dressing he said to himself go into berners street and buy a gunmetal stock and two dozen roman collars with a seam down the middle if you can get them and then go to scotts and buy a flat hat the black serge will have to do as it is if they dont like a jacket let them dislike it and then go home and examine your conscience the bishop locked the parlourdoor took the crucifix from the mantel and stood it on the table kissed the cross embroidered on the little violet stole which he had brought with him and put it over his shoulders he sat down rectangularly to the end of the table his left cheek toward the crucifix his back to the penitent george kneeled on the floor by the side of the table in face of the crucifix made the sign of the cross and began bless me o father for i have sinned may the lord be in thine heart and on thy lips that thou with truth and with humility mayest confess thy sins in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen i confess to god almighty to blessed mary evervirgin to blessed michael archangel to blessed john baptist to the holy apostles peter and paul to all saints and to thee o father that i excessively have sinned in thought in word and in deed through my fault through my fault through my very great fault i last confessed five days ago received absolution performed my penance since then i broke the first commandment once by being superstitiously silly enough to come downstairs in socks because i accidentally put on my left shoe before my right twice by speaking scornfully of and to gods ministers i broke the third commandment once by omitting to hear mass on sunday twice by permitting my mind to be distracted by the brogue of the priest who said mass on saturday i broke the fourth commandment once by being pertly pertinacious to my superior twice by saying things to grieve him was that wilful partly but i was annoyed by his manner to me what had you to complain of in his manner side he had used me rather badly he came to make amends i took umbrage at what i considered to be the arrogance of his manner i was wrong i confess an ebullition of my own critical intolerant impatient temper which i ought to have curbed is there anything more on your conscience my son lots i confess that i have broken the sixth commandment once by continuing to read an epigram in the anthology after i had found out that it was obscene i have broken the eighth commandment once by telling a story defamatory of a royal personage now dead i dont know whether it was true or false it was a common story which i had heard and i ought not to have repeated it i have broken the third commandment of the church once by eating drippingtoast at tea on friday i was hungry it was very nice i made a good meal of it and couldnt eat any dinner this was thoughtless at first then wilful are you bound to fast this lent yes father those are all the sins of which i am conscious since my last confession i should like to make a general confession of the chief sins of my life as well i am guilty of inattention and halfheartedness in my spiritual exercises sometimes i can concentrate upon them sometimes i allow the most paltry things to distract me my mind has a twist towards frivolity towards perversity i know the sane and i love and admire it but i dont control myself as i ought to do i say my prayers at irregular hours sometimes i forget them altogether how many times a week on an average not so often as that not more than once a month i think the same with my office what office you havent that obligation well no not in a way but several years ago when i received the tonsure i immediately began to say the divine office did you make any vow no father it was one of my private fads i was awfully anxious to get on to the priesthood as quickly as possible and as soon as i was admitted to the clerical estate i busied myself in acquiring ecclesiastical habits i wrote the necessary parts of the liturgy on large sheets of paper and pinned them on my bedroom walls and i used to learn them by heart while i was dressing the office was another thing i said it fairly regularly for about three years sometimes a bit of nasty vulgar latin for which someone merited a swishing shocked me and i stopped in the middle of a lectionit generally was a lectionbut i never relinquished the practice for more than a day circumstances deprived me of my breviary but i kept a little bookofhours and i went on saying all but mattins and lauds it wasnt satisfactory and i had no ordo and after a month or two i gave it up then i began to say the little office and that is of obligation because i have made my profession in the third order of st francis i added to it the office for the dead to make up a decent quantity but i have not been regular the same with my duties generally i go to confession and communion once a week but sometimes i dont go on the proper days sometimes i miss mass on holidays for absurd reasons yes often i generally hear mass every day and when i fail it always is on a holiday explain my son i live between two churches the one is half an hour away the other a quarter have you been obliged to live where you do yes as far as one is obliged to do a detestable inconvenient thing i did not choose the place a false friend enticed me there absconded with some papers of mine and obliged me to stay there and rot there continue my son when i am well disposed i go to the distant church when i am lazy i dont go at allthis only refers to holidaysbecause at the near one i should have to encounter the scowls of a purseproud family who knew me when i was welloff and who glare at me now as though i committed some impertinence in using a church which they have decorated with a chromolithograph also i detest kneeling in a pew like a protestant with somebodys breath oozing down the back of my collar i can hear mass with devotion as well as with sthetic pleasure in a church which has dark corners and no pews ive never seen one in this country where i can be unconscious of the hideous persons and outrageous costumes of the congregation the appalling substitute for ecclesiastical music the tawdry insolence of the place the pretentious demeanour of the ministers things like these distract me and sometimes keep me away altogether i like to worship my maker alone from a distance unseen of all save him you see among the laity i am as a fish out of water because i am a clerk whose place is not without but within the cancelli however i confess that i habitually more or less am guilty of neglect of duty on grounds which i know to be fantastic and sensuous and indefensible i confess that i have used irreverent expletives such as o my god and damn not very often i confess that i am imperfectly resigned to the will of god i very often think that i do not know and cannot know what is gods will i generally follow my instincts not of course when i know them to be sinful i generally resist those but in planning my life in trial when i really want to know gods will i have no test which i can apply to the operations of my intellect i am not alluding to dogma i implicitly take that from the church i mean lifes little quandaries years ago i used to consult my confessor i never got an apt or an illuminating or even an intelligent response time was short there were a lot of people waiting outside the confessional or his reverence had been interrupted in the middle of his office an inapplicable platitude was pitched at me and of course i went away in a rage later i grew to think that a man ought not to shirk his personal responsibility that he ought to be prepared to decide for himself and face the consequence i gave up consulting the clergy except upon technical points i do my best by myself and i pray god to be merciful to my mistakes i earnestly desire to do his will in all things but i often fail for example i cant stand pain it makes me savage literally i dont bear chastisement submissively i confess all my failures i was lacking in filial respect towards my parents i have been irreverent and disobedient to my superiors i have argued with them instead of meekly submitting my will to theirs i have given them nicknames labels that stick that annoy them by revealing mental and corporeal characteristics of which they are not proud for example i said that the violet legs of my collegerector were formed like little jacobean communionrails and i nicknamed a certain domestic prelate the greek for muddymind i havent done these things out of really vicious wanton cruelty but out of pride in my own powers of penetration and perception or out of culpable frivolity i confess that i have been wanting in love patience sincerity justice towards my neighbour selfishness selfwill and a fatuous desire to be distinct from other people have caused these breaches of gods law that desire nearly always is unconscious or subconscious seldom deliberate i am unkind with my bitter tongue and pen for example i made a jibe of the scrofula of a publisher i am impatient with mental or natural weakness for example i brought tears into a schoolboys eyes by my remarks when he recorded edward iiis words to philippa in reference to the six burgesses of calais as dam i can deny you nothing but i wish you had been otherwhere i am insincere sinfully not criminally i mean that i delight in bewildering others by posing as a monument of complex erudition when i really am a very silly simpleton i am unjust in my readiness to judge on insufficient evidence by my habit of believing all i hearthats a tremendously salient fault of mineand by telling or repeating detrimental stories i confess the sin of detraction i have told improper stories not of the ordinary revolting kind but those which are exquisite or witty or recondite the koprolalian kind those which are common in colleges and among the clergy i have had the injustice to label roman catholic stories if it were necessary to designate them with particularity the classic epithet milesian would serve but it is never necessary i have not often offended in this way but now and then according to the company in which i have happened to be i confess that i have sinned against myselffor example i have not avoided ease and luxury i have only been too glad to enjoy them when they came in my way i have been fastidious in my person my tastes my dress affecting delicate habits likes and dislikes i hate getting up early in the morning and do it with a bad grace i am dainty in my diet i never have conquered my natural antipathy to fleshmeat especially to entrails such as sweetbreads and kidneys i abhor fishmeat on account of its abominable stench formerly i never would sit at a table where fishmeat was served i can do that now with an effort of will but i could not eat fish without physical nausea i never will eat it once i made a man sick by the filthy comparison which i used in regard to some oysters which he was about to eat i have not avoided dangerous occasions of sin i have not been prompt to resist temptation for example my desire to improve my knowledge leads me to minute appreciation and analysis of everything which interests me in regard to the fine arts i study the nude human anatomy generally with no emotion beyond passionate admiration for beauty i never have been able to find beauty shameful ugliness yes in regard to literature i have read prohibited books and magazinesthe nineteenth century and books ancient and modern which are of a certain kind my motive always has been to inform myself i perfectly have known into what areas of temptation i was straying as a rule no effect has been produced on me save the feeling of disgust at writers who write grossly for the sake of writing grossly like stratn or pontano i confess that two or three times in my life i have delighted in impure thoughts inspired by some lines in ciceros oration for m coelius and perhaps half a dozen times by a verse of john addington symonds in the artist i confess that i have dallied with these thoughts for an instant before dismissing them there is one thing which i never have mentioned in confession to my satisfaction i mean that i have mentioned it in vague terms only i have not felt quite sure about it i know that i cannot think of it and of the stainless purity of the mothermaid at the same time hence i conclude that i am guilty relieve your mind my son about fourteen years ago i dined with a woman whose husband was a great friend of mine her two children dined with usa girl of fifteen a boy of thirteen her husband was away on business for a few months soon after dinner she sent the children to bed a few minutes later she went to say goodnight to them she was an excellent mother i remained in the drawingroom when she returned i was standing to take my departure as she entered she closed the door and switched off the electric light i instinctively struck a match she laughed apologising for being absentminded i said the usual polite idioms and went away a fortnight later i dined there again by invitation all went on as before but this time when she came back from saying goodnight to the children she was wearing a violet flannel dressinggown i said nothing at all and instantly left her afterwards i gave her the cut direct in the street i never have spoken to her since her husband was a good man a martyr and i immensely admired him he died a few years later i have no feeling for her except detestation she was wickedly ugly vague thoughts ensued from these incidents thoughts not connected with her but with some sensuous idea some phasma of my imagination they never were more than thoughts i think that i must have delighted in them because they returned to me perhaps twelve or fourteen times in as many years i confess these sins of thought also i think that i ought to confess myself lacking in alacrity after the first switching off of the electric light and that i never ought to have remained alone with that woman again i was ridiculously dense for only after the second event did i see what the first had portended i confess that i have not kept my senses in proper custody i place no restraint whatever upon sight hearing taste smell touch except in so far as my natural sympathies or antipathies direct me i cultivate them and refine them and sharpen them but never mortify them i hardly ever practise selfdenial even when i do i catch myself extracting elements of sthetic enjoyment from it for example i was present at the amputation of a leg under ansthetics directly the saw touched the marrow of the thigh bone the other leg began to kick i was next to it and the surgeon told me to hold it still it was ghastly but i did and then i actually caught myself admiring the exquisite silky texture of human skin father i am my masters most unfaithful servant i am a very sorry christian i confess all these sins all the sins which i cannot remember all the sins of my life i implore pardon of god and from thee o father penance and absolution therefore i beseech blessed mary evervirgin blessed michael archangel blessed john baptist the holy apostles peter and paul all saints and thee o father to pray for me to the lord our god my son do you love god from silence tardily the response emerged i dont know i really dont know he is maker of the world to me he is to me truth and righteousness and beauty he is lord of all to me he is first he is last he is perfect he is supreme i believe in god the father almighty i believe in god the son redeemer of the world i believe in god the holy ghost the lord the lifegiver one god in trinity and trinity in unity i absolutely believe in him there isnt in my mind the slightest shade of a question about him i unconditionally trust him i am not afraid of him because i cant think of him as anything but righteous and merciful to think otherwise would be both absurd and unfair to myself and im quite sure that im ready and willing and delighted to make any kind of sacrifice for him i dont know why so far i clearly see then in my mind there comes a great gapfilled with fog do you love your neighbour no i frankly detest him and her let me explain most people are repulsive to me because they are ugly in person more because they are ugly in manner many because they are ugly in mind not that i never met people different to these i have people have occurred to me with whom i should like to be in sympathy but i have been unable to get near enough to them i seem to be a thing apart i cant understand my neighbour what satisfies him does not satisfy me once i induced a young lover to let me read his loveletters he brought them every day for a week his love had appeared to be a perfect idyll pure and lovely as a flower welli never read such rot in my life simply categories of features and infantile gibberish done in the style of a housemaids novelette it made me sick this kind of thing annoys me terrifies me you see i want to understand my neighbour in order to love him but i dont think i know what love is but i want tobadly do you love yourself father do you mean the essence of me or the form yourself well of course i look after my body and cultivate my mind im afraid i dont pay enough attention to my soul i certainly dont admire my person thats all wrong i can pick out a hundred deviations from the canon of proportion in it lysippos would have had a fit and the tint is not quite pure i make the best of it but i dont think it matters much as for my mind i suppose im clever in a way compared with other people but im not half as clever as im supposed to be or as i should like to be in fact im rather more of a stupid ignoramus than otherwise naturally i stick up for myself when i care to against others but to myself i despise myself oh im not interesting on the whole i think that i despise myself body mind and soul if i thought that they would be any good to anyone else id throw them away tomorrowif i could do it neatly and tidily and completely and with no one there to make remarks theyre no particular pleasure to me my son tell me what would give you pleasure nothing father im tired really nothingexcept to flee away and be at rest my son that is actually the longing of your soul for god whatever cultivate that longing oh cultivate it with all your powers it will lead you to love him and then your longing will be satisfied for god is love as st john tells us thank him with all your heart for this great gift of longing besiege him day and night for an increase of it at the same time remember the words of christ our saviour how he said if ye love me keep my commandments remember that he definitely commands you to love your neighbour this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you mortify those keen senses of that vile body which by gods grace you are already moved to despise in the words of st paul keep it under and bring it into subjection and do try to love your neighbour lay yourself out to be his servant for love is service serve the servants of god and you will learn to love god and his servants for his sake you have tasted the pleasures of the world and they are as ashes in your mouth you say that there is nothing to give you pleasure that is a good sign cultivate that detachment from the world which is but for a moment and then passeth away in the tremendous dignity to which you are about to be calledthe dignity of the priesthoodbe ever mindful of the vanity of worldly things as a priest you will be subject to fiercer temptations than those which assault you now brace up the great natural strength of your will to resist them continue to despise yourself begin to love your neighbour continueyes continueunconsciously but soon consciously to love god my son the key to all your difficulties present and to come is love for your penance you will saywell the penance for minor orders is rather longfor your penance you will say the divine praises with the celebrant after mass now renew your sorrow for all your past sins and say after me o my godbecause by my sins i have deserved helland have lost my claim to heaveni am truly sorry that i have offended theeand i firmly resolveby thy graceto avoid sin for the time to comeo my godbecause thou art infinitely goodand most worthy of all lovei grieve from my heart for having sinned against theeand i purposeby thy gracenever more to offend thee for the time to come ego te absolvo in nomine patris et filj et spiritus sancti amen go in peace and pray for me when a couple of hours later george actually found himself doorkeeper reader exorcist and acolyth he noted also with some exasperation that he was in his usual nasty morning temper he sat down to breakfast with the cardinal and the bishop in anything but a cheerful frame of mind they had said a few civil kindlike words to him after the ceremonies ad multos annos and a sixpenny rosary emanated from his new ordinary but in the refectory they left him to himself while they ate their eggsandbacon discussing the news of the day he chose a cup of coffee and soaked some fingers of toast in it his idea was to bring himself into harmony with his novel environment environment meant so much to him now he no longer was an irresponsible vagrant atom floating in the void at his own will or driven into the wilderness by some irresistible human cyclone but an officer of a potent corporation subject to rule a man under authority his pose was to be as simple and innocuous as possible alertly to wait for orders and at the present moment to win a merit from a contemplation of the honour which was his in being received as a guest at the cardinalitial table he turned his head to the left wondering whether mere accident had placed him at his eminencys right hand where the light from the window fell full upon him he studied the singularly distinct features of his diocesan who was reading from the times of the outbreak of revolution in france where general andrs armyreforms of the blatant scandalous venality of combes and pelletan and the influence of that frightful society of schoolboys called les frres de la cte had thrown the military power into the hands of jaurs and his anarchists revived the commune and broken off diplomatic relations with the powers dreadful his eminency feared that he would be obliged to return to rome by the searoute unless perhaps he could go comfortably through germany oh very dreadful george listened regretting that he had not the paper and a cigarette all to himself but the coffee was not bad and the ponderous irritation of his matutinal headache was disappearing he took another cup he remembered how he had laughed at an occ note in the pall mall gazette some few months before to the effect that the old tradition of antipathy between the two peoples separated by the channel was as dead as georgian england and the era of the bienaim and suggesting that the two leading democracies of the worldengland a democracy indeedought to live on terms of good understanding and neighbourliness or some such tomfoolery how could two walk together unless they were agreed and on what single permanent and vital essential were england and france agreed george could think of none any more than nelson could commerce yes perhaps some fools thought so forgetful that commerce fluctuates from day to day and that it is the spawningbed of individual and international rivalry no he had no confidence in france she openly had been accumulating combustibility these five years and here was the conflagration this seemed to be a thoroughly french revolution sudden sanguinary flamboyant engendered by selfesteem on instability and produced with lan and theatrical effect brisk and prompt to war soft and not in the least able to resist calamity fickle in catching at schemes and always striving after noveltiesfrench characteristics remained unaltered twenty centuries after julius csar made a note of them for all time george detected himself in the very act of affixing a label to a nation he brought down his will with a thud on his critical faculty the bishop looked at the cardinal suggesting that mr rose was accustomed to smoke over his meals dont you find it bad for the digestion the cardinal inquired in the tone of an archbishop to an acolyth an access of genial gentlehood and something else to which george at the moment was unable to put a name suddenly infused his manner when he had spoken i dont think i have a digestion at least it never manifests itself to me happy man the cardinal exclaimed to no one in particular adding well perhaps we might go upstairs and mr rose can have his cigarette and listen to me at the same time the room to which they went was a private cabinet a very vermilion and gold room large airy princely the cardinal took a long envelope from the bureau i think you will find that correct mr rose he said you had better open it before we go any further the contents were a blank chequebook and a bankbook containing messrs couttss acknowledgment of the credit of ten thousand pounds to the current account of the reverend george arthur rose notwithstanding his natural hypersensibility that peculiar individual did not become the plaything of his emotions until some time after the event which brought them into action at the moment when blows or blessings fell upon him he rarely was conscious of more than a crab is conscious of when its shell is struck or stroked later when he deliberately set himself to analyse consequences all his senses throbbed and tingled but at first he was wont to act on the impulse certainlybut to act having acquainted himself with the contents of the envelope he took out his beloved waterman saying im sure your eminency will let me have the pleasure of writing my first cheque here he handed to the cardinal a draft for five thousand pounds payable to bearer it afterwards occurred to him that he could have taken no more cynical way of testing the reality of this fortune he felt ashamed of himself for he hated cynicism the act itself merely was the act of a man awakening from a vivid dream and automatically doing what he had resolved before falling asleep to do in effect it was by way of being a pinch of a kind to himself there was no doubt whatever but that it was a pinch of another kind to the cardinal followed alternately disclaimers stolidity embarrassment humility unction the cheque went into the bureau the chequebook and the bankbook into the pocket of georges jacket and now what was the extent of his theological studies his general knowledge of course was unexceptional but specialknowledge theology well in dogma he had done the treatises on gracea very difficult treatise mr roseand on the churcha very important treatise mr roseand in moral theology he had read lehmkuhl especially on the eucharist and on penancenothing could be better mr rose these had been the subjects of the professorial lectures at maryvale during the years which had elapsed since then he had read them again and again until he thought he had them at his fingers ends as for cardinal franzelins de ecclesia that was the maryvale textbook he found it one of the most fascinating books in the world in fact it was a regular bedside book of his and by this time he knew it by heart being a man of letters of course he would like to enlarge it a little to put a gloss upon it here and there perhaps even to expand the thesis at certain points st augustines encheiridion was another favourite book and st anselms cur deus homo was another his reading was extensive and curious but sad to say desultory and unsystematic because undirected he had read the standard works as a matter of duty but he had made a far more exhaustive study of obscure writers the occult white magic bien entendue was intensely interesting the book on demoniality by fr sinistrari of ameno for example perhaps it would be desirable for him to tabulate the sum of his studies that his eminency might decide whether to have him examined in those or to submit him to a fresh course quite unnecessary mr rose and now touching the matter of ceremonial he had made a point of mastering martinucci practice as well as theory it was astonishing what a lot could be done with a guidebook a few householdimplements and imagination he was aware that he had practised under difficulties but a few rehearsals beneath the eye of an expert and canon law nothing at all well well just those few treatises in dogmatic and moral theology in particular and a large amount of random reading in general of course the grace of god can supply all our deficiencies i myself things which are hidden from the wise and prudent ofttimes are revealed untooh yes well mr rose it is not a large or humanly speaking an adequate equipment forfor the priesthood certainly but we must consider the years which you have waited yes well perhaps we had better waste no more time now go home and pack your bag and come and stay with me for a little till we can settle on your future i shall give you the subdiaconate tomorrow morning and you can arrange to say your first mass on sunday in the cathedral my first mass must be a black mass eminency the cardinalitial eyebrows would go up it is a longplanned intention eminency it is all i can do i quite understand mr rose you would wish to say your first mass quietly and alone you shall say it in the private chapel the bishop of caerleon would like to be your assistant andhai shall be very glad if you will allow me to serve you george looked from the cardinal to the bishop and back again after storm this was calm and peace with a vengeance footnotes footnote this onomatopoiia presents the english catholic pronunciation of his eminency footnote this onomatopoiia presents the english catholic pronunciation of your eminency chapter i what was causing the special correspondents in rome to exude the subterfuges with which as a pisaller they are accustomed to gain their daily bread was no such recondite matter after all just as jews are less commercial and jesuits less cunning so journalists are less capable than they are supposed to be as a matter of fact they are quite unscientific persons in that they go about their business in a fortuitous manner trusting to the human element called smartness for producing their effects they have not yet realized the instability of all human elements the superhuman is a sealed book to them they mean oh so well but they have no knowledge of first principles they invariably commit the unpardonable error of confounding universals with particulars because the influence of fragile or unworthy authority custom the imperfection of undisciplined senses and concealment of ignorance by ostentation of seeming wisdom are as stumblingblocks which obstruct their path to truth add to this a lack of sympathetic intuition and of an historical knowledge of their subject they take no end of pains to acquire a fluid style of writing and it may be admitted that within their limitations they can describe the superficies of almost anything which may be shoved under their noses but as for giving a scientific description under such heads for example as the material formal efficient and final causes so that one can derive a satisfactory understanding of the thing describedthat is beyond their power and as for proceeding in a scientific manner whether by means of the liberal or the socalled occult arts to what on the whole is the essence of their business viz the collection of news why sir notyet apeers young men or sir uriah tepeddles criminalinvestigators or the yearnest exoletes who fill the daily anagraph with food for literary lionlets and roman catholic clergy and nonconforming philanthropists have no such adequate ideal of their branch of literature their aim is to please editors or proprietors and so to earn an asnearasmaybelegally honest living no more consequently when during march and april a score or so of these good gentlemen found themselves in rome with the doors of the conclave brickedup in their faces the windows boarded and canvascovered and even the chimneys with one exception capped they knew no better than to curse quite quietly all to themselves to say that nothing was happening because they could not see what was happening and to write dicaculous descriptions of the crowd and the seven puffs of smoke which on seven separate occasions distracted the said crowd in the square of st peters for if there be one place in all this orb of earth where a secret is a secret that place is a roman conclave it is due to the superlative incompetency of the spies ignorant of their subject they cannot seize its saliencies they cannot move a hairs breadth out of their conventional groove notwithstanding that common sense should teach them the imperative necessity for applying unconventional methods to unconventional cases when once we have emerged from the banal blinding stifling paralysing obfuscation of the nineteenth century and that should be in about ten years time it will be obligatory for our special correspondent to add two things to his professional apparatus the first is the power of mindprojection as well as that other power of willprojection which already uptodate practical commonsense menoftheworld like the jesuits use to such advantage the second is a

knowledge credited him with the possession of the evil eye their eminencies were thankful to think that the fingers which they would need for inscribing their suffrages need not be employed in making perpetual horns once walledup and the conclavists having been satisfied about their comical constitutional privileges the cardinals spent the evening in visiting one another in their cells in discussing the prospects of the five candidates in canvassing for and promising suffrages the five themselves were divided into two parties which ferraio who was a bit of a wag denominated in an abstruse jest the snarlers and the mewers a roman tradition alleges that the letter r the litera canina exercises an indefinable influence over an election in that it occurs in the family names of alternate pontiffs others declared this tradition to be grounded upon no more sure warranty than old wives fables anicularum lucubrationes serafinovagellaio gentilotto fiamma gave expression to that theory circumlocution aside there was little to choose between the five luigi orezzo was cardinalbishop dean of the sacred college chamberlain of the holy roman church mariano ragna was secretary of

propagation of the gospel in foreign parts only had the successor of the fisherman as his superior domenico fiamma archbishop of bologna was in the prime of vigorous life and famous for his brilliant intellect and noble mind a cardinal is prohibited from voting for himself orezzo promised his suffrage to ragna ragna his to orezzo snarlers should snarl at each other serafinovagellaio also promised his suffrage to ragna having the idea that an official is worthy of observance but gentilotto supported fiamma and fiamma gentilotto morning saw mass and communion in the pauline chapel and their eminencies proceeding to their thrones in the xystine chapel a long silence came to pass fat wax tapers glimmered on the altar on the screen on the desk before each throne so the cardinals waited smoothing violet robes and the white uncovered rochets which indicated that supreme spiritual authority was devolved into their hands no one was moved to speak election was not to be accomplished by the way of inspiration mastersofceremonies placed on the table before the altar two silver basons containing little paper billets the names of the fiftyseven cardinals were written each on a little snip of parchment the snips rolled up were tucked in holes in fiftyseven lead balls the balls were dropped into a huge violet burse one by one counted by the electors the burse was wellshaken and vaghemestre drew out three the first bore the name moccolo the second popk the third harrera thus were elected the cardinalscrutators in turn each cardinal provided himself with a blank billet from the silver basons retired to his desk and set about recording his suffrage at the top of the billet he wrote i cardinal and his name folded it over sealed it at each side at the bottom he wrote his motto folded it over sealed it at each side in the middle he wrote elect to the supreme pontificate the most reverend lord my lord cardinal and the name of the candidate to whom he gave his suffrage scratching of quills splashing of scattered pounce punctuated momentous silence in obedience to the bull of gregory x some made efforts to disguise their script the results were hideous last all folded their billets to about the breadth of an inch and in turn each cardinal approached the altar alone holding his suffrage at arms length between the index and middle fingers of his right hand bent his knee rising swore i attest before christ who is to be my judge that i choose him whom i think fittest to be chosen if it be according to gods will a great gold chalice covered by a paten stood on the altar each cardinal laid his suffrage on the paten tipped it until the suffrage slid into the chalice replaced the paten and returned to his throne cardinalscrutator moccolo took the chalice by the foot placed one hand on the paten and shook thoroughly to mix the suffrages the cardinaldean the cardinalpriorpriest and the cardinalarchdeacon brought down the chalice to the table from which the billetbasons now had been removed a ciborium stood there the three scrutators sat at one side of the table in face of the sacred college harrera counted the suffrages one by one from the chalice into the ciborium there were fiftyseven a grateful sigh went up a hitch would have invalidated the scrutiny giving their eminencies the pains of voting and sealing and swearing over again moccolo drew out one suffrage unfolded it without violating the sealed ends discovered the name of the candidate to whom the vote was given and passed it to popk who also looked at the name and passed it to harrera who read the name aloud each cardinal had on his desk a printed list of the sacred college the names ran down the middle of the sheets to right and left were horizontal lines on which a tally of the votes was kept as harrera published the names he filed each billet piercing the word elect with a needle through which a skein of violet silk was threaded when all were filed he tied a knot in the silk and laid the bunch of suffrages on the altar the way of scrutiny at first produced the usual result the fiftyseven suffrages were so evenly distributed among the five candidates that no one was elected orezzo had eight viz ragna moccolo agnello manco sarda macca pepato di petra ragna had thirteen viz orezzo serafinovagellaio cacciatore vivole berstein nascha saasca harrera ferita

in their separate cells after siesta and before prayers those who could walk took exercise in the galleries others read the daily office with their chaplains there was conversation canvassing in the

ragna raising his total to twentyfour serafinovagellaio kept but five supporters viz his brother and the four germans gentilotto lost the nine french but gained gennaio di bonti cassia creta bringing his total to seven the defection of the two erse reduced fiammas adherents to eleven and once more the puff of smoke emptied the square of st peters private conferences occupied time candles burned late into the night violet silk robes sussurated between violet serge curtains everywhere there were colloquies hints exhortations arguments promises promises dictated suggested given ragna took the opinion of his friends concerning a commodious pontifical name vivole offered him formosus the second and a pinch of capuchin snuff out of the pages of his breviary but berstein preferred aloysius the first the secretary of state would bear both in mind cohesion in clots began the french germans spaniards and erse already were united in four groups what the leader of each group would do the nine the four the three and the two would do by demonstrating that cardinaldeacons occasionally were raised to titles or suburban sees by popes whom they had elected cardinalarchdeacon macca collected a little diaconal fraction of four himself pietratti sega and pepato ten italians viz conella manco di petra ferita creta cassia gennaio di bonti sarda bosso agreed to vote together mundo refused to join the spaniards and nefski the germans on account of sundry events in poland ferraio archbishop of milan would stick to fiamma under all circumstances because they both had been raised to the cardinalature together saviolli threw in his lot with the keltic and american cardinals della volta was in sympathy with saviolli and his friends del drudo delivered himself of the cryptic sentence that one who had been a majordomo ought to know a fresh egg from a stale one and cardinalvicar respiro and riciso archbishop of turin agreed with del drudo so in the morning the third capitular assembly revealed an extraordinary state of affairs orezzo lost all his supporters but four viz moccolo agnello anziano portolano serafinovagellaio lost all votes except his brothers gentilotto lost all but three viz fiamma zafferano mantenuti fiamma retained his loyal eleven and ragna began to score first he kept orezzo and serafinovagellaio the benedictine the capuchin the jesuit and the three spaniards the nine french for a wonder remained constant to him for two consecutive days so did the two erse indeed otuohy who as a student had vowed that he never would look a woman in the face and kept his vow was as persistent as he had been when leo xiii had tried to force him into the primacy of eblana in the teeth of electors who rejected him the four germans the four deacons and the decade of italians also joined ragna whose tally went in jumps so to speak from two to five and eight and seventeen and nineteen and twentythree and twentyseven and thirtyseven according to the constitution of alexander iii made at the council of lateran in the year of the fructiferous incarnation of the son of god mclxxx and confirmed by subsequent bulls of gregory xv and urban viii the votes of twothirds of the cardinals present at the scrutiny are required for the election of a pope not one of their eminencies was ignorant of the fact that twothirds of fiftyseven is thirtyeight wherefore when the tallies shewed thirtyseven votes for ragna and the junior scrutator stood up with just one more billet in his hand some began stertorously to breathe through their noses some went mauve and some magenta while those of a phlegmatic habit of body reached for the cords of the canopies above their thrones which descend at the manifestation of christs vicar harrera read the name ragna what happened next happened very quickly the scrutators broke the seals of the billets one by one and harrera read aloud the names of the electors as well as the name of the elected at the thirteenth he read i cardinal mariano ragna elect to the supreme pontificate the most reverend lord my lord cardinal mariano ragna this was a horrid example of the clever strong man who loses control of his directive faculty in the moment of excitement no one could have done such a thing out of wilful wickedness for the stringency of conclavial regulations effectually denies success to nefarious practices everyone knows that the secretary of state by voting for himself just when he was on the verge of achieving the most tremendous of all ambitions forfeited his own suffrage and his election was nulled by defect of a single vote what passions dilacerated his breast god only knows he shutup himself in his cell during the rest of the day horribly snarling orezzo who injudiciously went to sympathize suddenly cameaway mouthing and tottering the fourth scrutiny began to shew how unpardonable a mistake is ragnas ten italians and four germans fled to the faction of fiamma ragna himself voted for serafinovagellaio the tally gave orezzo four ragna twentythree serafinovagellaio two gentilotto three fiamma twentyfive in the fifth scrutiny desertions from ragna continued the french nine voted for orezzo the three spaniards for gentilotto the tally gave orezzo thirteen ragna eleven serafinovagellaio two gentilotto six fiamma twentyfive and now the french began to be flighty in the sixth scrutiny they were seen to have dashed from orezzo to gentilotto making the tally of orezzo four of ragna eleven of serafinovagellaio two of gentilotto fifteen of fiamma twentyfive little suburban boys formerly used to satiate their emotions with a phrenetic and turbulent pastime called general post the seventh scrutiny indicated a conclavial propensity for a verisimilar species of energetic dissipation the four cardinaldeacons evidently despairing of ragna left him so did the two erse cardinalpresbyters the diaconate went over to gentilotto who lost the french to serafinovagellaio the erse voted for the cardinalchamberlain the seventh puff of smoke from the chimney in the square of st peters was caused by the burning of fiftyseven suffrages allotted thus orezzo ragna serafinovagellaio gentilotto fiamma confabulations to say naught of protocols became the order of the day and night no new candidate was forthcoming the five candidates flatly refused to retire or to alter the disposition of their suffrages moccolo agnello anziano portolano refused to desert orezzo zafferano and mantenuti refused to abandon gentilotto vincenzovagellaio refused to be false to his brother the benedictine the capuchin and the jesuit refused to forsake ragna fiammas stalwart twentyfive excited disgust ringed and middle fingers were protruded at it although there was not a single cleanbred englishman in its ranks it was said to be getting quite english and that is a very bitter taunt in the vatican when the quirinale is notoriously anglophile as for the portugal mundo its leaderwell everyone knows that portugal has been in the king of englands pocket since the lisbon extravaganza said saasca as for the germanswell everybody knows that prussians are just as bestially cynical as jonbulls said coucheur the francohispanoerse faction was quite ready to go anywhere and vote for anybody who was not english the deacons on the contrary remembered that england was very much the fashion and began to have respect unto the twentyfive but the way of scrutiny failed and the way of access also failed to produce a pontiff fiammas tally rose to twentynine by the accession of the diaconate the francohispanoerse alliance attached itself by fits and starts to orezzo to ragna to serafinovagellaio to gentilotto but the indispensable twothirds of fiftyseven never was attained and after a week of errancy their eminencies thought that the whole affair was rather tiresome ragnas massive prognathous jaw the colour of porphyry bulged in emitting a suggestion as the college seemed unlikely to come to any agreement why not elect an old man who in the course of nature only could live a year or two and whose demise would necessitate another conclave at an early date he unselfishly would designate orezzo there for example was a cardinal to whom the paparchy was by way of being owed since when he actually had lost it to leo let orezzo now be elected and during his brief pontificature let the most eminent lords devote their energies towards arrangements for giving him a generous glorious and enlightened successor who in this reactionary age was experienced in all the devious subtilties of secular diplomacy and who was under sixtyfive years old the sacred college rejected the bare idea what elect a pope who out of sheer personal antipathy would make it his business to annul the policy of leo what elect a pope who had spent more than a quarter of a century in composing and reciting litanies of complaints against leos management of the church what elect a pope who had proved himself to be purely barbarian by the ferocity of his ritual tapping on the forehead of the dead leo di meliora ragna adroitly disclaimed a personal predilection for orezzo that idea was dismissed then what was the general question the way of compromise cooed vincenzovagellaio there was another capitular session in the xystine chapel by means of the snips of parchment the lead balls the huge violet burse nine cardinals were chosen by lot and appointed as cardinalcompromissaries singularly enough they were courtleigh mundo fiamma grace ferraio saviolli nefski gentilotto and della volta the college executed a compromise in writing no one contradicting or opposing it whereby these nine were invested with absolute power and faculty to make provision of a pastor for the holy roman church the compromissaries conferred to begin with they mutually protested that they would not be understood to give their consent by all sorts of words or expressions which might fall from them in the heat of debate unless they expressly set the same down in writing then they looked whole inquisitions one at another saying nothing and after halfanhour they adjourned till the morrow gathered up their trains and swept each to his separate cell stupid conclavists tried to read their expressions as well try to find out his thoughts from the sole of his unworn shoe as from the face of a cardinal the cardinalitial mask is as superior in impenetrable pachydermatosity to that of the proverbial publicschoolboy as is the cuticle of a crocodile to that of pulex irritans the task of the compromissaries was too onerous to be begun until a chaos of ideas had been set in order gentilotto and fiamma paced up and down the galleries together acceptance of their present office had nullified their chances of the triple crown either would have worn that gladly and well neither was inclined to struggle for it the scrutinies dreadfully had annoyed their dignity the pure and gentle dignity of gentilotto the radiant opulent dignity of fiamma to have escaped from the sweaty turmoil of competition satisfied them ferraio joined them in their perambulation joined his ideas and sympathies to theirs mundo paid a visit to courtleigh and heard his confession the cardinal of pimlico had no use for the conclavial confessor who was a jesuit nefski pallid and wan tried a little walk by the aid of the arm of della volta and afterwards those two said mattins and lauds together saviolli satout the evening in graces cell chatting about the munroe doctrine courtleigh sat alone in his cell his hands were on the arms of his chair his gaze was fixed on the flame of the candle his thoughts whirled eddyed and were still he fell asleep his brother who was his chaplain peered through the violet curtains inquiring his needs he needed nothingperhaps he would do a little writing before saying his nightprayers monsignor john placed a dispatchbox on the table a couple of new candles on the prickets and retired anon his eminency opened the box with a miniature gold key hinged to the underside of the bezel of his cameo ring and meditatively turned over and over his archiepiscopal correspondence one packet of letters seemed to fascinate him he held it in his hands for a long time fixedly regarding it he untied the vermilion ribbon and began to read he had read these letters before just before he entered the conclave he would read them again now reading helps thought it is as a strong arm supporting feeble steps it is as the pinions upon which thought can fly or it is inspiration cardinal courtleigh read a dozen pages or so then he sat with his chin in his hand gazing again at the candleflame his thoughts were flying they were quite personal quite unconnected with his present situation or his present office orezzo ragna and serafinovagellaio engaged the compromissaries in conversations wherever they met them in doorways on promenades quite often they called to make perfectly certain that they lacked no conveniences in their cells morning and evening conferences were occupied by long discussions on the merits of the three remaining candidates and of the other fiveandforty cardinals the predilections of the powers were passed in review the ambassador of the emperor had notified that austria would look favourably upon rugscha but to think of that old manborn in nearly ninety years oldoh quite impossible the siege of peter needed no more senility but rather juvence old men were so obstinate much more obstinate than headstrong youth the ambassador of the catholic king had urged the claims of the archbishop of compostella true that one was not so oldbut threescore years and tenis it not the psalmists limit and did any of their eminencies desire to assist at another conclave say within the next five years their eminencies had had enough of conclaves to last them for the span of their mortal lives the french ambassador had made no recommendation seeing that the commune had recalled him torn him out of the train at modane on the french frontier and sliced him in pieces portugal had plumped for mundo who declared himself unwilling to accept and as compromissary incapable of accepting the paparchy italymymymymymwell italy a geographical expression no more now then the others the german emperor his majesty had nominated courtleigh now why the cardinal of pimlico smiling really did not know he was much obliged he was sure perhaps the young man thought that by nominating one of his own uncles subjects and a very unworthy one he would induce his said uncle to return the compliment and nominate a german and would the uncle so oblige courtleigh thought not the aforesaid uncle was quite as selfwilled as and infinitely more tactful than and the last person in the world to let his leg be pulled by his imperial nephew well then what was the king of englands attitude courtleigh did not know but he believedindeed he had had it from mr chamberlainyes and the lord chamberlain saidnot the lord chamberlain mister chamberlainthe prime ministerhad said that his majesty was not by way of meddling with matters which did not concern him the compromissaries pronounced the king of englands conduct to be most observable and the cardinal of pimlico added that in any case he as a compromissary was ineligible while the cardinal of baltimore calculated that america also would stand out of this deal a definite decision evaded capture satisfaction seemed to be such a very long way up in the air not one of the nine was sensible of an overwhelming irresistible impulse to select any particular individual as pope that is such an invidious undertaking the spirit faints at its immensity but the compromissaries subconsciously were drawing near and nearer to each other and away from the rest who in their turn cohered in curiosity the fourth conference was an unusually futile one mundo frankly and abruptly stated his conviction that the lord god was not intending himself to take a vicegerent out of the sacred college whereat their eminencies laughed and adjourned conversing of other and secular affairs courtleigh went out on della voltas arm eminency he said i have known you now for nearly twenty years and whenever i see you i always fancy that i have met you somewhere in other circumstances you have never been in london i thought not and i suppose you havent what they call a double i dont mean that your type is common far from it but at times i seem you remind me of and yet i do not know of whom and another night enshrouded the palace on the vatican hill as cardinal courtleigh was trying to shave himself next morning the phantom of his friend della volta invaded his mental vision suddenly resemblance and remembrance clashed together striking a spark by the light of it he saw and knewsomething he laughed shortly and grew grave he was deeply engrossed with his dispatchbox until the hour of conference the matters which he laid before the other compromissaries caused several precedents to be set aside and some to be created and at pm fortytwo cardinals wearing the habits of ordinary priests drove away in cabs towards the railwaystation while the cardinalchamberlain unlocked the inside of the door of the conclave hereditarymarshal ghici summoned from his watching chamber to unlock the outside was flabbergasted by an invitation to declare whether the vatican was a prison for cardinals as well as for popes he did hate being mocked by a boiled lobster fifteen comparatively speechless eminencies spent a few weeks there in quiet leisure reading in the library admiring the pictures and the sculptures sometimes strolling in the gardens one of them seriously began to study botany and the cardinaldean with a view to a future bull composed a very scathing indictment of that hypocritical anomaly called christian socialism and all the time the pontifical army guarded the inside of every entrance fraternizing through the gratings with the national army outside but special correspondents of the london newspapers in rome munched vacuity and excreted fibs after their kind by twos and threes plain but very dignified priests arrived were admitted and changed black for violet one did not change he was only cardinal courtleighs new chaplain the door of the conclave was locked on both sides and brickedup again ensued another session of the compromissaries when their authentic act was put into prescribed form by apostolic prothonotaries ensued a final capitular assembly in which the act of the compromise was published ensued a tempest of tongues and manners dissolving as storms do in muttered thunders less and less convulsive upheavals a parcel of broken boughs and chimneypots stillness peace relief and sunbright april smiles chapter iii when their lords had entered the xystine chapel for this last exercise the conclavists went away about their own affairs and the door was shut the reverend george arthur rose departed with the bishop of caerleon who was actingchaplain to cardinal mundo they walked in the royal gallery between the xystine and the pauline chapels george was in a mood of silence his mind as usual was receiving impressions the historic scene being enacted under his notice the magnificent masks veiling the humanity of the actors the mysterious gloom of the stage its smallness its air of cavernous confinement the sour oppressive septic odour of architectural and waxen and human antiquity he had been told that he would have to say mass before noon and his head ached from fasting in that indescribably stifling effluvia he remembered that in former days necessity frequently had forced him to abstain from all food for a hundred hours at a time often during four days in the week he had eaten nothing but that was in the open air on the shore of a northern sea or among the heather on moors and mountains where the wind and the spray gave life here the fast of less than twenty hours made him sick and sulky however it had to be tolerated semphill once had told him that a course in an ecclesiastical college and the first few years of clerical life were as disgusting as ten years penal servitude he took it at that with his eyes open it was part of the business he determined to go through with it still he was in a better position now than he ever had been before he no longer was alone dr talacryn had seemed anxious for his company since that day in london and george was inclined to value kindness the bishop of caerleon appeared to be precisely what the newfledged priest knew himself to needa sympathetic expert subintelligent walkingstick honest and sturdy as oak oh for the certainty of fidelity presently george took out his cherished edition of theokritos by estienne in spare moments he was introducing his companion to the melody of greek and together they read and analyzed the twelfth idyll an hour later the bishop suggested that they should go into the pauline chapel and say some prayers george followed him prayer is a mindcleanserthe best anyhow it is an effort always due they looked for a clean fourfeetoffloor kneeled side by side and got into communication with the unseen georges method was intellectual rather than formal to him with his keen and carefully cultivated sense of the ridiculous the absurdity of a human individual composing complacent criticisms of divine decrees hashing up scriptural and liturgical tags with a proper and essentially sensuous pleasure in patchwork seemed like gratuitous impertinence dear jesus be not to me a judge but a saviour was all the form of words which he used it included everything as far as he could see he repeated it over and over again and again like a wonderful incantation and anon it had its psychic effect he became in direct communication with the invisible omniscient to whom all hearts are open from whom no secrets are hid it was just his own method compiled from bittersweet experience in time he began to finger his moonstone rosary concentrating his meditation on the mystery of the annunciation his mind strenuously went to work on that his lips swiftly enunciated the prayers after five decades he said salve regina and examined his conscience was there any difference in him he felt more clear he felt that he had effected some kind of a difference that was relief but was it worth anything wasnt it stained was he really strengthened by the exercise for example was he now filled and inflamed with pure love no was he any nearer to pure love fit to be thought of even harshly by pure love no well he had done his best it would come some day god be merciful to us all poor sinners he looked at the bishop two weeks his junior in years two centuries his senior in worth of every kind the cheerful satisfied stolidity of that one turning from his prayers and meeting georges gaze with a homely smile was something astounding how different men are here was one envying the other his stolidity and the other half afraid of the agility of the one george realized that this bishop never had had embarrassments of any kind nor could have he saw the great gulph which is fixed between the simple and the complex there was a stir at the door of the chapel i think perhaps wed better be getting back said dr talacryn two mastersofceremonies appeared in attendance upon cardinalarchdeacon macca and cardinaldeacon berstein as george and his companion approached them they turned and retraced their steps george wished them anywhere but there impeding him when he ought to be runningoff to the service of his diocesan they completely blocked the path as they went before him with superb unconcern how stiff how antipathetic the elder one looks he whispered with acerbity shhh the bishop sibilated the door of the xystine chapel was open conclavists from all quarters hurried towards it george and his friend found themselves impelled through the portals beyond the delicate marble screen gleamed the six steady flamelets of the candles on the altar the protentous figures in the doom appeared to writhe inside the screen macca and berstein went and paused and faced the crowd which followed them george was looking about him vehemently alert he had felt like this three times in his life before at the exsequies of the queen of england at the incoronation of the king of england at the foot of the first grave which had opened in his path through life it was the feeling of the cognoscente who is permitted during sixty seconds to do his own pleasure in a treasurechest filled to the brim with inestimable intagliate gems it was the feeling of absolute acquisitiveness here was history in the making and he was in the front rank of the spectators there was no time to think of effects this was a case of causes and every detail must be seized and stored selection could come later appreciation afterwards but now he must collect first his glance flashed upward to the little square canopies they all were in position then to the occupants of the five and fifty thrones they were sitting as still as the conscriptfathers sat in their curule chairs turnedto and watching the crowd which oozed through the screengates unconsciously george was urged further and further in his demeanour was abstrusely unemotional he continued violently absorbent of the spectacle presently he whispered to the bishop what is it what is happening i think god has given us a pope oh whom wait we shall know in a minute the silence the stillness the dim light where motionless forms of cardinals curved like the frozen crests of waves carven in white jade and old ivory on a sea of amethyst were more than marvellous a voice came out of the gloom an intense voice reciting some formula george did not take the latin easily from an italian tongue he found himself translating reverend lord the sacred college has elected thee to be the successor of st peter wilt thou accept pontificality reverend he thought why not most eminent he instantly turned to the bishop with another question on his tongue the bishop was kneeling behind him the crowd also was kneeling why in the world did not he kneel too why should he hesitate for a moment he faced round once more a single black figure with an alert weary white face alone and erect in the splendour of violet he glanced again at the canopies it was on him on him that all eyes were why did he not kneel again the voice of the cardinalarchdeacon intoned reverend lord the sacred college has elected thee to be the successor of st peter wilt thou accept pontificality there was no mistake the awful tremendous question was addressed to him a murmur from the bishop prompted him the response is voloor nolo the surging in his temples the booming in his ears miraculously ceased he took one long slow breath crossed right hand over left upon his breast became like a piece of a pageant and responded i will two hands clapped and the canopies came down rustling and flapping the sacred college struggled to its feet as gods vicegerent passed to the rear of the high altar they offered him three suits of pontifical white large medium and small the large was too large the small too small but the medium would serve for the present he began to undress among the throng of assistants with the noncurance of one accustomed to swim in sandford lasher he forbade all help refusing to be touched when he had assumed the white hosen cassock sash rochet cape and cap the crimson shoes and stole the great new gold ring of the fisherman he went through his former pockets leaving nothing behind tucked his handkerchief into his left sleeve and asked for the bishop of caerleon while mastersofceremonies and the augustinian sacristan hurried to prepare altars for the episcopal consecration of the pope dr talacryn was admitted to the apostolic presence he made obeisance the moment was too enormous for words but eyes spoke a glass of water then the pontiff said the fast holy father will not be broken remain always close at hand please he felt as though the whole world suddenly had left him not that he himself had moved or changed but the world the past was entirely gone and blotted out the future was obscure the present was all strange his unrelated idea was to steady himself by this one link with the past water was brought he dipped half his handkerchief wrang it out pressed it on his hot dry eyes all through the long ceremony of consecration he carried himself with enigmatical equanimity though his eyes saw nothing but the matters of each moment and though his bearing seemed to indicate an aloof indifference yet within his sensibilities were at their tensest nothing escaped him and he was mobilizing his forces planning his campaign he was lookingdown he was surveying the opening vista two or three moves on the apostolic chessboard he already could foresee at the conferring of the episcopal ring he drewback his hand and demanded an amethyst instead of the proffered emerald the ceremony halted till the canonical stone came cardinals noted the first manifestation of pontifical will with much concern and with some annoyance ragna muttered of ignoble upstarts vivole of boyish arrogance berstein of beggars on horseback he who is born of a hen always scratches the ground asserted the benedictine cacciatore and he who was a frog is now a king labeur quoted from the satyricon of petronius arbiter they brought him before the altar and set him in a crimsonvelvet chair asking what pontifical name he would choose hadrian the seventh the response came unhesitatingly undemonstratively your holiness would perhaps prefer to be called leo or pius or gregory as is the modern manner the cardinaldean inquired with imperious suavity the previous english pontiff was hadrian the fourth the present english pontiff is hadrian the seventh it pleases us and so by our own impulse we command then there was no more to be said the election of hadrian the seventh was proclaimed in the conclave they came to the ceremony of adoration one by one their eminencies kissed the supreme pontiffs foot and hand and cheek contact with senile humanity made his juvenile soul shudder all the time he was saying in his mind not unto us o lord not unto us yet that seemed such a silly inadequate thing to say it was not humility it was physical loathing which nauseated him all secretly some had the breaths of bustards and all but one were hot he would have liked to tear off his own cheek with clawed tongs by a peculiar mental gymnastic he vaulted to the verse who sweeps an house as in thy sight makes that and th action fine he clutched the thought and clung to it greatest and best or by what other name thou wishest to be called i am only thy means this horrible osculation is no more than a chance for them to benefit themselves by honouring thee through me let them i will be the meansthy means to all men ouf how it hurts his external serenity was unflinchingly feline he just tolerated attention the arrows of cardinalitial eyes impinged upon him and glanced off the ice of his mail he withdrew his sensibilities from the surface and concentrated them in the inmost recesses of his soul foreseeing forescheming one steps enough for me was another tag which became detached from the bundles of his memory to float in the ocean of his counsels he made sure of the one step fearlessly strode and stood and prepared for the next he never looked behind the amethyst the pontifical name and now yes begin as you mean to go on he advised himself when the huge princes of the church bourgeoned in ermine and vermilion hadrian mitred and coped in silver and gold followed macca who bore the triple cross tumultuous sumptuous splendour proceeded through the conclave into the gallery of benediction over the porch of st peters masons were removing brickwork from a blocked window leading to a balcony on the right hand halfway down the long gallery the supreme pontiff beckoned orezzo lord cardinal this balcony looksinto the church into the church holiness which window looksout over the city the window on the left let the window on the left be opened the sacred college swung together as to a scrum pressure never had influenced george arthur rose he used to say that you might squash him to death if you could but you never should make him do what you were too lazy or too proud or too silly to persuade him to do he would wait a century for his own way and unless you actually and literally had removed him from the face of the earth by the usual methods of assassination you would find him still implacably persistent at the end of the said century he had learned the trick from flavio observing that if he would not open the door when the cat mewed to go out the creature remained in the room but would not come and sit on his friends neck nor agree to anything except the opening of the door and hadrian the seventh was quite prepared to be hustled and hullabaloedat as leo the thirteenth had been hullabaloed at and hustled in but no earthly power should extort apostolic benediction from his hand and lips except at a place and a time of his own choosing they might push this pope on to the inner balcony and they might lead a horse to the water but not even the college of cardinals arrayed in all its glory could make the one drink the other bless holiness that window was brickedup in and has not been opened since let it now be opened ragna snarled and burst out of the phalanx there was a tinge of truculence about him holiness pope leo wished to have had it opened on the day of his own election but it was impossible impossible capisce the rust of the stanchions the solidity of the cement all that we know the gentleness of pope leo was persuaded we are not gentle and we are not to be persuaded by violence orezzo though secretly inchanted that anyone should act differently to his one antipathy pope leo was rather shocked at the notion of blessing the city and the world while what he held to be the piedmontese usurper was occupying peters socalled patrimony and intangible rome it is an ingrained idea with his school that peoples should excruciate for the petty spites of potentates but he tried urbanity holy father have pity upon us and deliver us as soon as possible from the miseries which afflict us in this conclave deign blessings to the faithful in the church today and we will see what can be done about the other affair tomorrow hadrian looked a little amused the bishop of caerleon thought that he never had seen more cruelly dispassionate inflexibility at a sign from the pope the mastermason came forward and fell on his knees hadrian stooped son open that window through and through vermilion billows the masons dived and thrust across the breadth of the gallery conveying ladders crowbars hammers conclavial porters threw down rolls of carpet which they were about to spread and sat upon them berstein squawked and expectorated hadrian winced and marked the man at the clang of hammers masonry began to fall a white dust hovered in the air the vermilion college swept away with the white pope some went to the end of the gallery where loud voices became protestant midway the germans halted with most of the italians they conversed more moderately a few paces beyond the range of operations the pope remained quite still by his side he detained macca with his cross behind him congregated the bishop of caerleon and the nine cardinalcompromissaries in a break of the clang of the hammers hadrian intoned kyrie eleson mundo gave prompt response the assemblage at first failed to catch the idea but by degrees voice acceded to voice and the litanies of the saints magniloquently reverberated through the gallery outside in the square of st peters only a few hundreds of people were collected interest in the proceedings of the conclave was nearly dead and several special correspondents were beginning to think seriously of the superior excitements of a murdertrial at new bailey but many oldfashioned romans wished to be able to tell their grandchildren that they themselves had been in the square when the pope was proclaimed in the church and again on the morning of st georges day no smoke had been vomited from the xystine chimney the affair was very mysterious what combinations behind those white walls inside the basilica there were thousands of expectant people officials of the vatican cardinalitial familiars prelates penitentiaries beneficiaries who had not been immured in the conclave also there were lords and ladies of eminent quality belonging to the black or clerical party who had been admitted with meticulous secrecy in broad daylight and in face of all rome by a privy door every day for weeks they had come and waited hoping to be among the first to salute the pope to go to st peters in the morning before dinner and in the evening before supper had become the mode in a society which has few and futile dissipations of its own and to which the comity of the quirinale and white society is forbidden fruit some who were near the great doorway thought they heard faint tappings in the gallery overhead rumour protruded her tongue certainly there were tappings more ponderous more insistent certainly the balcony was being opened then the crashing ceased in the hush surmises were born and stifled or nurtured a loose benedictine with a face of a flesher who was leaning against one of the great piers suddenly asseverated that the tapping had begun again but in another placefurther away he said an honorary decurial chamberlainofthecloakandsword sniffed longnosedly picking a vandyke beardlet and stuttered theyre nnnever oopening the outer bbbbbbbbbalcony that notion resembled the spark between negative and positive poles it vibrated and glittered and fell upon a heap of human combustibles then what are we waiting here for shouted prince clenalotti and he made a dash at the door by which he had entered naturally he led a stampede the crowd in the square stood obliquely to the church with all its eyes directed to the vatican when round from via della sagrestia poured a stream of halfwild creatures shooting instant glances at the vacant balcony and bringing amazing news the two crowds flew together thronging the wide stone steps and the open space beneath the military rigesced to attention the special correspondents as one man made for the obelisk in the centre or the basins of the fountains and setup portable pairs of steps and of course motorcars and cabs and caio and tizio and also sempronio not to mention maria and elena and yolanda and also margherita began to issue from every borgo avenue there was nothing to be seen except the empty balcony over the porch it was neither canopied nor decorated but someone said that there was movement behind the window that was concisely true more the window itself was moving the sunflashed panes of glass turned dull as it swung on its hinges inward the italian army presented arms rome kneeled on the stones the special correspondents ascended their pairs of steps directed phonographic and kinematographic machines pressed buttons and revolved wheels a tiny figure splashed a web of clothofgold over the balcony and a tiny ermine and vermilion figure ascended placing a tiny triple cross came in a stentorian megaphonic roar a proclamation by the cardinalarchdeacon i announce to you great joy we have for a pope the lord george of the roses of england who has imposed upon himself the name of hadrian the seventh he gave place to another tiny figure silver and gold irradiant in the sun a clear thin thread of a voice sang our help is in the name of the lord phonographs recorded the sonorous response who hath made heaven and earth hadrian the seventh raised his hand and sang again may almighty god father son and holy ghost bless you it was the apostolic benediction of the city and the world chapter iv now things went briskly there was a brain which schemed and a will to be obeyed the hands began to realize that they would have to act manually dear deliberate rome simply gasped at a pontiff who said tomorrow and meant it the sacred college found that it had no option naturally it looked as black as night but the cardinalarchdeacon could not refuse pointblank to crown and when hadrian announced that his incoronation would take place in the morning on the steps of st peters futile effort suggested difficulty preventing possibility that was the only course open to the opposition three cardinals in turn alleged that there would not be time to give notice of the ceremony to arrange the church to issue tickets of admission hadrian swept these ideas aside as rubbish another courted catastrophe saying that there was no time to summon the proper officials he heard that there were sixteen hours in which to summon those who actually were indispensable a fifth said that owing to the antichristian tendencies of the times no representatives of the king of france of the holy roman emperor of the first conservator of the roman people were forthcoming and he politely inquired how the quadruplex lavation could be performed in their absence the pope responded that he was capable of washing his hands four times without any assistance in the absence of legitimate assistants but the general of the church was not to seek the modern syndic of rome was the equivalent of the ancient first conservator the austrian ambassador could represent the empire while as for wretched kingless unkingly francelet someone instantly go out into the streets of rome and catch the first christian frenchman there encountered anyhow the quadruplex lavation was accidental the essential was that the supreme pontiff should sing a pontifical mass at the high altar of st peters and should receive the triple crown these things would be done at eight oclock on the following morning all the doors of the basilica were to be fixed open at midnight and so remain no official notice need be published and that was all then the pope shutup himself in his predecessors gorgeous rooms inspecting them till they gave him a pain in his eyes luckily he had secured his pouchfull of tobacco and a book of cigarettepapers he smoked and thought looking out of the windows over rome after sunset he ate some cutlets and a salad placed two chairs face to face near the righthand window and sent for the bishop of caerleon and a large jug of milk his interior arrangements were as disreputably healthy as those of a schoolboy dr talacryn came and observed the forms hadrian sent him to clear the antechambers and to close the doors he returned and remained standing the pope was sitting in one of the splendidly uncomfortable red chairs we have sent for your lordship because we have occasion for your special services i am at all times very ready and willing to serve your holiness hadrian was attracted to this bishop lots of his acts he loathed but he liked the man and believed him honest the bishop was attracted to the pope he liked him but he could not understand him and was a little frightened of him but stillit was as well to know all that could be known and that might be useful we placed this chair for your lordship said hadrian dr talacryn was astonished but not more than much his trained placid nature stood him in good stead at a mark of favour which would have abashed many and rendered others presumptuous i thank your holiness he simply said it appeared that the ship was cleared for action the pope continued in his usual concise monotone he spoke in the key of e minor very quickly indeed slurring the letter r clipping some words and every final g enunciating others with emphasis in a manner curiously suggestive of fur and indiarubber and talons as for his matter he seemed to be arguing with himself by the way in which he arrayed his ideas disclosing his process of thought we have very much to do and we are confronted by the physical impossibility of carrying out our schemes we find ourself surprizingly placed at the head of affairs we believe that we should not have been placed there unless the service which we are able to do had been deemed desirable therefore we feel bound to act but though we know or shall know what to do yet we cannot do it with this one pair of hands we must have assistants with whom we can be intimate and who themselves can be sympathetic first of all we wish to have your lordship the bishop was quite honest enough to get a little rosier with pleasure very pleased whatever he said next we need information do you know the circumstances which led to our election in the main they are known to me holiness indeed i may say that they are generally knownexcept to the supreme pontiff himself the bishop added with an episcopally roguish smile hadrian enjoyed the point please bear this dogma carefully and continually in mindthe pope wellinformed is wiser than the pope illinformed remember also that hadrian at all times desires to know everything at present he wishes to know what you know about his election briefly the details can be given later briefly the conclave found no pope by the ordinary means and committed the task to certain cardinalcompromissaries these chose your holiness but why cardinal courtleigh was he a compromissary how many were there he was one of nine the others were never mind their names for the moment now we take it that these nine cardinals are welldisposed toward us most assuredly holy father good nine the names please courtleigh grace archbishop of baltimore yes saviolli what is he he formerly was nuncio or something in america was he not please give the status of each he was archbishop of lepanto and pontifical ablegate to the united states of america now he is one of the curia then came della volta formerly majordomo also of the curia he by the bye is your holinesss double according to cardinal courtfield how delicious hadrian vivaciously put in mundo who led the compromissaries is patriarch of lisbon nefski is archbishop of prague poor fellow why poor fellow oh he was nearly killed by the anarchistswell then ferraio is archbishop of milan gentilotto is prefectgeneral of the society for the propagation of the faith and fiamma is archbishop of bologna the two last were candidates at first but gave it up by consenting to become compromissaries these you say are welldisposed to us yes holy father a kelt an american a portugal five italians and a pole no a bohemian holiness oh hadrian directed the bishop to a writingtable now whether this be in accordance with regulations or not we neither know nor care please writehe sipped a glass of milk and began to dictatehadrian viibishopservant of the servants of godwills that you immediately shall cometo himin the vatican palaceat rome nothingexcept the gravest physical inabilityor your duty to your familyif such there beis to impede you all catholicsare to afford youthe comfortconveyanceand assistanceof which you may stand in need please sign it with your own name and make five copies of it the bishop sighing for his typewriter diligently wrote in an angular oblique almost illegible hand electric lights sprang up in the city the pope lighted candles closed the curtains and rolled a cigarette then he came and sat by the table looking at the manuscriptsconsidering the huge ring on his own indexfinger smiling to himself he took a taper and a stick of sealingwax and produced the littlepeterinaboat at the foot of the six sheets address them he continued to the reverend george semphill st gowffs north britainreverend james sterling oakheath staffordreverend george leighton shorham sussexreverend gerald whitehead wilton warwickreverend robert carvale duntellin ayrshireandyes do you know that eighteen years ago he had the most exquisitely beautiful face and the most exquisitely beautiful soul and the most exquisitely horrible voice of any boy in the collegeaddress the sixth to percy van kristen madison avenue new york while dr talacryn was closing the envelopes the pope himself wrote on a sheet of paper which also he sealed hadrianus pm vii dilectissimo filio francisco talacryni caerleonis episcopo te in cardinalem designamus et approbamus quod tamen sub silentio tenebis donec tempus idoneum aderit datum romae sub annulo piscatoris anno pontificatus nostri i ad viiii kal mai now please come and kneel here he said the bishop looked an inquiry but he came round the table and kneeled before the pope who addressed him in these words wellbeloved son francis talacryn bishop of caerleon we appoint thee to and confirm thee in the cardinalature but thou shalt not disclose the fact until the proper time so saying he lightly pinchedtogether the bishops lips putting the breve into his hand silence the pontiff continued now will you yourself go to san silvestronot to the postoffice hereand stamp and post those letters one thing more there will be no hitch tomorrow right then after leaving san silvestro will you find prince pilastro and prince orso and tell themwe certainly shall have the support of these nine goodwell quite informally let those princes as princesassistant at the pontifical throne know of our insuing incoronation when you have named that to prince pilastro say also informally that the supreme pontiff wishes the syndic of rome to know that when he has received the crowns he intends to go to lateran to take possession of his episcopal see no there is to be no fuss we will go as simply as possible and on foot will you always be quite near we name you trainbearer and will make your office a sinecure god bless you da boch a dibechod hadrian remained standing at the antechamberdoor watching the bishops big figure disappear along the corridor he thought it a pity that a tendency to corpulency was not checked by healthy physical exercise a detachment of the swiss guard stood armed and motionless at regular intervals for me was his plebeian thought a small man appeared bowing he had a servile air hadrians second glance recognised him is there an apartment on the top storey above this he inquired but yes holiness a large apartment of smaller rooms not having the altitude of these you will cause them to be emptied by noon tomorrow now you can go to bed please take care that no one comes inside this door until the morning the pope closed the door and returned through the antechambers and the throneroom to the table where he had been working he sat on the edge of the table for about an hour swinging a leg thinking and sipping milk then he took a candle and went into a dressingroom with huge oak clothespresses opening their doors he looked for a cloak among piles and festoons of new clothes there were several of crimson velvet after vainly searching for something plain he put on one of these and proceeded to the outer door taking a breviary from the table on the way out in the corridor he signed to the nearest guard the blackredyellowandsteel figure came and kneeled do you know the way into st peters the pope said but yes most holy father procure what keys are necessary and conduct us thither son but securely most holy father the swiss went on before hadrian followed feeling annoyed by the salutes with which he was received along the way he had been so long unnoted that notice irritated and abashed him life would be unbearable if trumpets and quaint halberds greeted every movement he had not the stolidity of born personages presently he threw back his cloak and kept head and hand raised in a gesture which petrified they passed through innumerable passages and descended stairs emerging in a chapel where lights burned about a tabernacle of gilded bronze and lapis lazuli here he paused while his escort unlocked the gates of the screen once through that he sentback the guard to his station but he himself wenton into the vast obscurity of the basilica he walked very slowly it was as though his eyes were wrapped in clear black velvet so intense and so immense was the darkness then very far away to the right he saw as it were a coronal of dim stars glimmeringon the floor they seemed to be he was in the mighty nave and the stars were the everburning lamps surrounding the confession he slowly approached them as he passed within them he took one from its golden branch and descended the marble steps here he spread the cloak on the floor placed the lamp beside it and fell to prayer outside in the city and the world men played or worked or sinned or slept inside at the very tomb of the apostle the apostle prayed at midnight bolts of great doors clanged and fell a cool air crept in subsacristans setup iron candlesticks huge antique here and there upon the marmoreal pavement the burning torch of each made a little oasis of light in the immeasurable gloom from far away a slim white form which carried a crimson cloak swiftly came shedding benedictions on the startled beholders and disappeared in the chapel of the sacrament on returning to his apartment hadrian went straight to bed invoking the souls in purgatory to awaken him at six oclock he slept instantly and well at seven oclock he had paid his debt with the de profundis and was dressed and waiting in the throneroom entered to him a dozen cardinals two by two opening their ranks they disclosed the cardinalpriorpriest solemnly ostending the image of a cock in silvergilt hadrian stood on the steps of the throne still erect vivid he seemed so brimming over with restrained energy that he resembled a white flame not a sound was uttered in silence they came and they went away in silence when the pontiff was alone again he strode and stopped in the middle of the floor no lord i never will deny theenever he exclaimed with tremendous emphasis but keep me and teach me and govern me that i may govern and teach and keep thy flock o thou shepherd of the people when the bishop of caerleon conveyed the extraordinary news to the syndic of rome prince pilastro at once inquired what arrangements were made no arrangements are made but look here said marcantonio who affected english brusqueness of course we are very happy that the holy father should come among us but you know we are bound by our own guarantees to give him all the honours of a sovereignregnant we shall be shamed in the eyes of europe if we omit those what i mean by that is this is a stateprogress and we shall have to turn out the troops and stop the traffic and line the streets i dont think his holiness expects you to do all that prince im not speaking officially and im not bringing you an official request for anything of the kind which you name the holy father says he is going quite simplyon foot in fact now i should just like to know what the devil if your splendour will excuse the french that means perhaps his holiness thinks that the movement of the sedia gestatoria or of a litter will make him sick it did with leo you know whats the matter with a white mule i happen to know that he cannot ride peuh no sportsman then and yet hes english yes but not the kind of sportsman you mean prince well what does he want me to do lets say that i am sent to warn you of his intention in order that you may arrest him for disturbing the traffic if you choose of course we shant do that no of course you wont thats only my way of putting it i think he really means to advise you beforehand so that it can never be said that he played you a trick took you unawares stole a march on you so to speak i see well this is one of the amazing things which you english do as a matter of course its either frantic madness or will his holiness go in any sort of state i think not you see time is short and between ourselves im not at all sure that were all of one mind over there by rights you know i ought to walk with orso just before the ambassadors does orso know about this walking business no only of the incoronation that means that there will be no formal procession it is well you see as pilastro i walk with orso in the popes progress while as syndic of rome i ought to walk at the head of the pontifical pages who precede his blessedness i cant do both can i well i request your splendour to convey my respects to our holy father and to say that prince pilastro will assist at the throne during the incoronation and the syndic of rome will go before the pope to lateran you will not take the chance of coming to blows with prince orso on the question of precedence then joked the bishop but no during the incoronation i shall secure the right hand and the pope will be between us afterward no question of precedence will arise because orso may or may not join in this promenade to lateran and in each case the syndic will have the more honourable position i may not be the rose but at least i shall be near the rosea great deal nearer than orso punned the versatile marcantonio at eight in the morning hadrian descended to st peters miscellaneous multitudes paved the spaces with tumultuous eyes he came down in ruddy vesture gleaming with rubies and garnets and carbuncles like a fire borne high above the crowd slowly deliberately dropping benedictions his english phlegm was much admired they roared at him long live the popeking instantly he stopped his bearers and the very air of him struck sudden silence people stared and forgot to shout the wave of acclamation ebbed in the great nave and transepts he moved onward sitting erect godlike with a frozen mien prohibiting personal homage mitred and enthroned he was the servant of those who would serve him that was the import of his demeanour a child acolyth of the lowest rank held up before him a salver containing flax set it on fire and shrilled behold most holy father how that the glory of this world passeth away his features shewed no emotion he well knew all about that he was accepting even insisting on the observance of all rites to consolidate him in the supreme pontificature not that he cared for them but that he might be free to act it was not the glory of the world which he craved but the combat the combatbecause one rests so much more sweetly after strife slowly and with all the unspeakable solemnity accumulated during centuries the mass was sung the apostle elevated the host to the four quarters of the globe cardinals ruffled like huge flamingoes round him he always was white and still at the end the cardinalarchpriest of st peters brought him a damask purse containing twentyfive gold coins honorarium for a mass wellsung he bestowed it on della volta and sega who had intoned the gospel in greek and latin and they passed it to their trainbearers down the nave he went again toward the great porch out of the crowd a voice cried christus regnat as he sat enthroned amid the surging peoples macca crowned him saying receive this tiara adorned with three crowns and know thyself to be the ruler of the world the father of princes and kings the earthly vicar of jesus christ our saviour hadrian understood the formula in no metaphorical but in the plain and literal sense of the words he neither minimised nor magnified their significance he had an opportunity which was entirely grateful to him he was ruler father vicar and he was altogether unafraid he stood up and blessed the city and the world in the xystine chapel they relieved him of the pontifical regalia and the voluminous farflowing petticoat of white taffetas which is so sumptuous to the eye of the beholden and so ridiculously cumbersome to the legs of the wearer and he ate some apples while orezzo on behalf of the sacred college recited timehonoured compliments lord cardinals said hadrian we thank you for your service and we invite those of you who are able and willing to attend us now when we go to take possession of our episcopal see he moved towards the door the short train of his cassock trailed behind him and the bishop of caerleon stooped to it ragna had something to howl holiness this is suicide for you and murder for us the city is full of jews and freemasons and we shall most assuredly be stabbed or shot or shattered to pieces with bombs or drenched with vitrol the church wants a martyr badly your eminency is invited not commanded berstein muttered to vivole in a scandalized tone that the pope was courting popularity pepato with a note of admiration commented on the mad english word of the invitation rushed on ahead of the crowd of officials many began to arrange themselves in a certain order others had pressing calls elsewhere mastersofceremonies wracking their brains for long forgotten details flew hither and thither with instructions and pushes poor old grani sat down in a recess and wept to think that there was no time to get out the white gennets annually presented by the king of spain hadrian came on slowly chatting with caerleon giving people a chance of making up their minds when he emerged from the colonnade in the square of st peters the syndic of rome fell into the ranks just before the pope and a royal escort of the prtorian guard surrounded him hadrian stopped and beckoned prince pilastro sir syndic are we free he mewed but free holy father let your soldiers precede and not surround us and let no one come within ten paces of us we go by via giulia and monte celio the squadron moved to the head of the line the pope took his train from the bishop threw it over his left arm and cameon alone acting as though the ideal were real he made it real if jews and freemasons would slay him well and good it was part of the days work no doubt he was by no means anxious to be martyred and he sincerely hoped that if it should come to him it would not be very painful or distorting but as it was his own affair a piece of the part he was fulfilling he displayed himself alone ten paces before him went prince pilastro looking back from time to time ten paces behind him came the bishop ruddy and strong in white and purple wondering the vermilion nine followed in a compact phalanx very venerable and grand and after a great deal of bustle and noise seventeen other cardinals added their magnificence a motley of patriarchs archbishops bishops prelates and pontifical guards closed the rear a tremendous shout greeted hadrians first appearance in the square it was quite incoherent for the real significance of the pageant was not immediately realized no pope had set his foot in rome since but here undoubtedly was the pope with a gentle inflexible facea lonely white figure whose left hand lay on the little cross on his breast whose right hand gravely scattered the same sign this crowd was not the even human parallels which authority is wont to describe on streets when the great go by it was a concurrence from sideways coalescing with loafers and ordinary passersby suddenly dipping its knees gazing panting and emitting howls of delirious onomatopes cabs and carts swept to the side of the road and the drivers kneeled on the boxes here and there some dowdy alien said what mockery and patronizingly explained that the salvation army did these things much more properly here and there some sour sorry incapable stood spitting in praise of secret societies here and there some godless worldling scoffed in an undertone but hadrian wenton walking at that deceptive pace of his which seemed so leisurely and was so swift his movements resembled the running of a perfectlygeared machine they had the smooth and forceful grace of the athlete whose muscles are supple and strong even the occasional impulse had no jerkiness it was the manner with which he disguised his natural timidity he sometimes glanced from side to side once he smiled at a barelegged rascalt of brown boys who kneeled by one of berninis angels on the parapet of the bridge he adored children although he was so desperately afraid of them going up the hill by the church of sts john and paul a little girl dabbed an indescribable rag on her head rushed into the road dashing primroses and remained transfixed by her own audacity he led her by the hand to her mother and blessed them both all his life long he had yearned to be giving now under any circumstances he always had something to give ten words and a gesture and people seemed so thankful for it he was glad in the porch of the mother and mistress of all churches in the city and the world he sat on the low throne while canons made shift to intone he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill that he may set him with the princes even with the princes of his people they gave him gold and silver keys they attended him to the throne of precious marbles in the centre of the apse they intoned te deum ascending to the lodge of benediction he blessed the mobile vulgar in the square of st john and anon returned in the way by which he came bishop of rome in act and deed and supreme pontiff chapter v being physically tired with the exertion of withstanding the concentrated gaze of rome he rested all the afternoon the palace was a scene of commotion cardinals and their familiars cackled and cooed and squeaked and growled in corners or arranged for return to their distant sees workmen clearedaway the structure of the conclave hadrian made an attempt to getinto the gardens with a book but obsequious black velvet chamberlains with their heads in frills like saucers made themselves so extremely necessary and auditors of the ruota scudded along byepaths with such obvious secrecy and bounded out of boxhedges before him by carefully calculated accident so very frequently that at last he took refuge in the pontifical apartment he rang the gong and sent for caerleon we have a more or less distinct remembrance of a place on the lake of albano called castel something castel gandolfo holiness yes and it used to be a pontifical villa it is a pontifical villa now but since an order of religious women have used part of it as a convent which part they i believe keep the pontifical suite in statu quo hoping for the day when the holy father shall come to his own again good now will you at once telegraph to those nuns that the pope is coming to his own tomorrow for the inside of a week and please arrange everything on a plain and private scale that is the first thing perhaps id better do that at once whatever yes but dont be long when the bishop returned hadrian invited him to take a tour of observation round the rooms they were accentedly antipathetic too red too ormolu too floridly renascent too distractingly rococo he could not work in them yes worknothing was going to interfere with that how in the name of heaven could anyone work under these painted ceilings among all these violently ineffectual curves now that he was able he must have what he wanted he was going to move on to the topfloor where people could not stamp on his head and where there was a better view from the windows he would have clean bare spaces and simplicity without frippery then his mind could move by the clothespresses he damned red velvet that should go the feeling of it made him squirm the sight of it on his person reminded him of the barking of malodorous dogs and the braying of assertive donkeys white was all right if it fitted properly he would stick to white soft flannelly white not this shiny cloth with a decent surplice which did not resemble the garments of davids servants after the attentions of the children of ammona surplice and the pallium and the pontifical red stole in public but no lacethat should be left to ladies how delicious to have plenty of white clothes to wear how delicious to wear white in the sun well he was going to work to earn all these amenities and now talking of work something would have to be done to the rooms upstairs and certain things would have to be settled regarding the domestic arrangements to what official ought directions to be given the majordomo is the head of the household and the master of the chamber has immediate charge of your holinesss person that set man look now he shall continue to be master of the chamber we will not repeat the mistake of pius ix or interfere with any of their offices but he must not come near us we should feel bound to assist his decrepitude and our idea is to be so free from secular cares that we can concentrate undivided attention upon our apostolature there is the root of the matter that man is a stranger his age makes it certain that he has got into a groove he is full of prior experiences and opinions which he cannot and ought not to be expected to change for a newcomer but if he remains here it will be ourself who will have to obey him that would distract us therefore we must interpose someone whom we knowsomeone who is young enough to suit himself to us there are two young ruffians of about twentyfive years old who like most of his other acquaintances formerly loved and hated george arthur rose their circumstances are disagreeable they never had a chance they are hotheaded passionate people always in love with some woman or other because they have no means of amusing themselves innocently being tied and bound with the chains of respectable poverty they really have no opportunity of leading godly righteous and sober lives theyre insane unhealthy because civilization gives them no opportunity to live sane healthy lives unless they crush all the most salient and most admirable characteristics of their individuality please send for themjohn devine arkwright street prestoniulo carrino bloomsbury square londonand let us give them some service and much freedom and a little wholesome neglect to strengthen and develop their characters and to give play to their individual natures as good old jowett says we believe in making it not difficult but easy to be good look frank tell iulo carrino to bring with him that yellow cat which you may remember by the bye both these men cannot move without money take this cheque for george arthur roses balance at couttss use what is generousgenerous mind youand account to us later and now about the other things we had better see centrina and the majordomo upstairs the pope and the bishop inspected a series of empty rooms on the topfloor they occupied the ne and the se sides of the palace hadrian chose the large room in the angle with windows on two sides for the secret chamber it was approached from the ne corridor by way of fifteen antechambers and a large room suitable for private receptions beyond the antechambers there was another series of apartments which he also took the private room in the angle sittingroom or workshop as he called it led into some smaller rooms on the se face of the palace here he fixed upon a bedroom bathroom dressingroom oratory and sundry storerooms accessible by a single door in the last room which led into the corridor overlooking the court of st damasus the majordomo and the masterofthechamber attended the latter was quaking about his situation hadrian rapidly reassured him and came to the point you are confirmed in your benefice until such time as you choose to retire the emoluments and the pension are at your disposal in a few days two gentlemen will arrive from england you will prepare a parlour and a bedroom for each adjoining the first antechamber fix a bell in each parlour communicating with this room they were standing in the room which had been selected as a workshop you will provide two servants for them they will take their meals in their parlours after their arrival our commandments will come to you through them he turned and addressed himself to the majordomo these two gentlemen must be given some official status if i understand aright your holiness is appointing two gentlemeninwaitingintheapostolicchamber that will do when they arrive see that they have diplomas of appointment as gentlemen of the apostolic chamber the bishop of caerleon will arrange with you about their emoluments now let us furnish these rooms they went out into the corridor and reentered the apartment by the first antechamber cover all the walls and ceilings with brownpacking paperyes brownpacking papercarta straccia the pope repeated stain all the woodwork with a darker shade of brown the gilding of the cornices can remain as it is no carpets these small greenishblue tiles are clean and they soothe the eye curtains you may hang very voluminous linen curtains on the doors and windows greenishblue linen to match the tiles and without borders furnish all those antechambers with rush chairs and oaken tables remember that everything is to be plain without ornamentin this room you may place the usual throne and canopy and that crucifix from downstairshow exquisite the motherofpearl figure isand the stools and twelve large candlesticksiron or brassnow this room is to be a workshop let us have a couch and three armchairs all large and low and wellcushioned covered with undyed leather get some of those large plain wooden tables which are used in kitchens about three yards long and oneandahalf wide put writingmaterials on one of them there on the right of the window leave the middle of the room empty put three small bookcases against that wall and a cupboard heremake a bedroom of this room let the bed be narrow and long with a husk mattress and let the back of the head be toward the window put one of the large wooden tables here and a dozen rushchairshe spoke to the bishop do you know that there is no water here at all except in little jugs he continued to the majordomo line the walls of this room with greenishblue tiles like those on the floor put several pegs on both doors in this corner put a drainpipe covered with a grating and six feet above it let a waterpipe and tap project rectangularly two feet from the wall yes six feet from the floor two feet from the wall and let there be a constant and copious supply of waterrainwater if possible do you understand the majordomo understood the masterofthechamber shivered and lamps get two plain oillamps for each room with copper shades large lamps to give a very strong light paint over both doors of the bedroom on the outside of each intrantes excommunicantur ipso facto when we have finished here he addressed the masterofthechamber again you will parade your staff and we will select one person and provide him with a dispensation from that rule as long as he behaves himself well he will have charge of the bedroom and the sole right to enter it the pope passed into the next room paused and whispered explicit directions to the majordomo and moved on to the farther room the clothespresses from downstairs can be moved into this room they will serve and you had better make a door here so that it can be entered from the corridor he went on again this room is to be the vestryand this the oratory let us have a plain stone altar and the stations and the bare necessaries for mass all of the simplest let everything walls floor ceiling everything be whitenatural white not painted and make a door here also leading into the corridor a large doubledoor convenient for the faithful who assist at the pontifical mass the rooms beyondyou will take order about them at a convenient occasion hadrian and the bishop returned to the pontifical apartments downstairs your holiness will excuse me yes but have you ever contemplated the present situation no why well your holiness seems to have everything cut and dried the pope laughed you shall know that george arthur rose has had plenty of time for thinking and scheming his schemes never came to anything except once and he certainly never schemed for this but you understand perhaps that the last twenty years have rendered hadrian conscious both of his abilities and his limitations as well as of his requirements and hence he is able at a glance to describe in detail what he wants when he wants something without knowing what he wants he asks questions for example what is that hinged arrangement under cardinal courtleighs ring a masterkey holiness i have just got one too the bishop shewed his own ring what is that i have several places which i have to keep locked safes cupboards and that sort of thing and the keys which are all different have to be entrusted to my various chaplains and so on well each of these can only open the lock of the thing which concerns him but with that masterkey i can unlock everything and no one else in the world can do that capital where do you get these things made at a place in band streetbrahma i think the name is tell them to the voice sank for some scarlet gentleman began to bring in tables with the sealed dishes of the pontifical supper hadrians eyes lingered on the intruders for a moment they were so slim so robust so deft so grave so roman he drew the bishop into the embrasure of a window arent they lovely he said isnt the world full of lovely things lovely live things its the dead and the stagnant that are ugly this was so rapid a change of mood that talacryn could not follow it as soon as the servants were gone hadrian continued returning the episcopal ring tell your brahma people to fit all the doors upstairs with locks which have separate keys and to send another score of locks also with separate keys and also to send a man here who is capable of making an episcopal ring for us which shall contain a masterkey to all those locks very well holy father dont go supper can wait a minute look here we desire to be in direct communication with the sacred college we chiefly are curious to know the nine compromissaries but distinctions sometimes are invidious at all events we must have a long and secret conference with cardinal courtleigh so will you please make it known to their eminencies that we will receive them after supper ask pimlico to remain after the others andwho manages the finances here the cardinaldeacon of santa maria nuova is apostolic treasurer and the majordomo is responsible for the household expenses ask the treasurer particularly to come dont come yourself goodnight god bless you caerleon firmly had believed that he knew george arthur rose to be charmingperhaps somewhat incomprehensible and therefore perhaps somewhat dangerous but as for hadriancaerleon felt about him as m and mme curie felt when they first put a penny on a piece of radium and observed the penetrative energy incessantly thrown off from a source which was both concrete and inexhaustible the popes evening party was well attended some of the older members of the sacred college who really had suffered from the discomforts of the conclave had left the vatican most of the french absented themselves as they had every right to do in view of the informality of the invitation the secretary of state stayed away on a plea of business but a mixed motive in which inquisitiveness was the dominant ingredient impelled thirtytwo vermilion princes into the pontiffs throneroom the cardinaldean notwithstanding his age and infirmity came with glee next to succeeding to the paparchy himself nothing suited him better than to have a perfect stranger for a pope who evidently was about to subvert every single act of leos he said almost as much to hadrian bustling up to the throne and using a stool we take it very kindly that your eminency should come to us and we let you know that we summon our first consistory to meet on the thirtieth day of april said the pope in a tone which was a skilful blend of the worlds rulers with that of youth to age of a newcomer to an old stager orezzo was pleased he took the ball of conversation and set it rolling it is a fortunate event holiness he said that the divine leomay his soul rest in a cool placenever carried out his intention of nominating his successors ah the pope responded we remember reading about that in an english newspaper the pall mall gazette a few years back perhaps your eminency can tell us what truth there was in the report the facts holy father were these leo so firmly believed that the policy which he had seen fit to pursue during his long reign was essential to the welfare of the church that he wished to be assured of its continuance and he would have had each of us to promise him that upon election we would not depart from his example some of usi name no nameswere unwilling to bind ourselves and being unable to secure unanimous assurance leo declared that he would use the plenitude of the apostolic power and nominate his successors the other cardinals attracted by these words drew nearer to the throne some sat on stools others remained standing all intently listened to orezzo all intently gazed at hadrian the aspect of the pontiff did not give satisfaction it was not listless it was not inattentive for as a matter of fact it indicated very vivid ardent studiose concern a perfect perception of being among the doctors but hadrian seemed to be treating the matter too impersonally too much from the viewpoint of the outsider he gave no sign whatever that he was conscious how very nearly this thing touched himself he reminds one of a surgeon probing for a bullet in a body which is not his said mundo to fiamma and he will find that bullet the archbishop of bologna replied hadrian who could see as far through a brick wall as most men and a great deal further than some was not by any means unconscious of the situation and was avidly curious after information he pursued the inquiry many thought it would have been more delicate to drop it yes that was the gist of the statement in the paper he continued to orezzo we remember it well because we wondered whether or not such a privilege was included in that plenitude of apostolic power we could not find a precedent and none of the authorities whom we consulted could provide one advise us lord cardinal if orezzo had not been cardinalbishop of ostia and velletri dean of the sacred college and chamberlain of the holy roman church he would have grinned he found the moment unmitigatedly delectable holiness there is a pious opinion represented i believe by the cardinalpenitentiaryserafinovagellaio violently flushedto the effect that the divine leo was not in error also there is another pious opinion represented i happen to know by the rest of the college that on this point the said divine leo erred as infallibly as possible this was thin ice indeed your eminencys exposition hath been most sound the matter is one for the theologians said hadrian ceasing to lean forward but why lord cardinal do you call it fortunate that the nomination was not effected because if it had been effected we might not have experienced the pleasure of saluting a pontiff who according to the cardinal of pimlico is an academic anarchist hadrian candidly and simply laughed with a friendly look at courtleigh who did not at all like being the second victim of orezzos caustic tongue his eminency has taken that bad habit of labelling people from us he said but although we give due weight to the epithet academic we abhor from and cannot away with the term anarchist aristocrat we are not the mere word democrat fills us with repugnance such as it is our philosophy is individualistic altruism but eminencies is not the labelling of matter which is in a state of flux humanity for example somewhat futile even supposing the labelled matter to be static do not the very words on the label change their meaning with the course of time but deeds remain and the motive of a deed is that by which it must and will be judged give us then the benefit of your holy prayers lord cardinals that our motives may be pure and our acts acceptable to him who has deigned to our unworthy hands the awful office of his vicegerent here on earth he leaned back in his chair for the moment after this little outburst the sense of his enormous responsibility was upon him in an indefinite shadowy sort of way it had been in his mind to utter some such allocution to the cardinals by way of explaining to them his own conception of his task but he had intended to make it more of a deliberate formal pronouncement the instant when the words had passed his lips however he perceived that in one sentence he had said all he also perceived that the gaiety of the beginning and the solemnity of the conclusion sufficed to give his utterance distinction he said no more there was no doubt but that he had created an impression an impression which differed it is true according to the temper of the impressedbut still he had created an impression those eminencies who were more formal than vital assumed that professional abstraction of demeanour which marks a conference of clergy while one of their number is talking shop those two or three who were devout enthusiasts blessed themselves and exhibited the white cornea beneath the iris of their eyes the majority who combined the qualities of the dignified finegentlemanoftheoldschool with those of the scholar the teacher and the practical christian beamed instant approbation their verdict was that the utterance was very correct and proper nothing could be more true the assemblage splitup into groups and separate conversations were begun the pope sat still and grave orezzo gracefully pleaded his age and the hour of night kissed the apostles knee and retired hadrian beckoned the cardinaldeacon of santa maria nuova and addressed him in a confidential manner we understand that the expenses of our household pass through the hands of the majordomo are they paid from some fund particularly allotted to the purpose yes most holy lord from the details are unimportant and the expenses of the paparchy in general there are numerous funds most holy lord which are administered by numerous departments under my supervision and those funds some suffice and some do not suffice they vary no doubt most holy lord they vary is there any particular fund over which we have exclusive control the whole revenue most holy lord is subject to your pleasure but peters pence belong to the pontiffregnant personally they are his private propertysalaryhonorarium i should say in eight days your eminency will be good enough to let us know the annual average of that income say for the last twenty years it shall be done most holy lord meanwhile what money is at our disposal at this moment there has been accumulated a large reserve the exact amount of which is known only to the bankers it is yours most holy lord what approximately is the sum in round numbers most holy lord it cannot be less than five millions lire pounds sterling most holy lord hadrians eyes sparkled where is it the bulk is in the bank of england most holy lord but there is much gold in the safe which safe the safe in the bedroom wall most holy lord where is the key the cardinalchamberlain holds all keys most holy lord tomorrow your eminency will be good enough to cause the safe in the bedroomwall to be removed to a similar position in the bedroom which we have instructed the majordomo to prepare on the upper storey and now please follow the cardinalchamberlain obtain the key of the safe and bring it to us the apostolic treasurer rose and went out hadrian also stood up the company understanding that the reception was ended made obeisance and began to move away the pope detained courtleigh eminency he said we have many things to say to you but we will not detain you now tomorrow we go to castel gandolfo come with us a few tired priests are sure of a hospitable welcome there yes come with us who is that young cardinal by the door that is monsignor nefski holinessthe archbishop of prague he is marked by some fearful sorrow a most fearful sorrow indeed once in a mans rooms at oxford a young undergraduate happened to enter he had just that deadly pallor that dense black hair that rigidity of feature that bleached bleak fixity of gaze when he was gone we remarked on his appearance our host said that he had been seeing his best friend drowned they were on a cliff somewhere in your eminencys nativeland taking photographs of breakers in the height of a storm the friend was on the very verge suddenly the cliff gave way and he fell into the raging sea he was a magnificent swimmer he struggled with the billows for more than half an hour there was no help within five miles and finally the breath was battered out of him the other perforce had to stand by and watch it all it indelibly marked him cardinal nefski you say is marked by a fearful experience lately was it as fearful as that ten weeks ago holiness and a much more fearful experience eminency bring him also to castel gandolfo some of you must attend the pope let us have those to whom we can be useful when he was alone hadrian examined the safe in the bedroom wall it added to his consciousness of his immense potentiality what a number of longplanned things he could do now with its contents he would open a current account at the bank of italy with that and another at the bank of englandhe acquainted himself with the tools of his new trade truly caerleon did not altogether err in calling him an incomprehensible creature on the one hand with his principle of giving he could not even grasp a problem which involved taking while on the other hand he utterly failed to realize that most people are averse from giving as for himself he took freely and as freely he was going to give as for the bishop of caerleons opinionit is so easy and so satisfactory to call a man an incomprehensible creature when one is mentally incapable of comprehending or unwilling to try to comprehend the creature chapter vi he spent the first day at castel gandolfo in the garden writing enjoying the loveliness of late spring he produced a score of sheets of swiftlyscribbled manuscript bristling with emendations the second day he summoned cardinal courtleigh directly after breakfast and addressed him with some formality we desire to establish relations with your eminency chiefly because you hold so responsible a position in england a country dear above all countries to us which we design to treat with singular favour in pursuance of our intention and of our desire certain matters must be defined if our words are unpleasing your eminency must take them in the light of our said intention and desire the cardinal put on his cardinalitial mask he was to hear and to note this rash young man if anything needed to be said he was there to say it it is our wish to make england a people prepared for the lord we will attempt it of the whole world and for this reason we begin with the race which dominates the world we find ourself impeded at the outset by the present habitude and conduct of english catholics especially of the aboriginal english catholics at this unexpected fulguration this feline scratch the cardinalitial eyebrows shot upward with a jerk and horizontally came down again his eminency slightly bowed and attended the pope fingered a volume of cuts from english newspapers selected a cut and continued kindly let us have your opinion of this statementa remarkable petition has been prepared for presentation to parliament the petitioners are the roman catholic laity resident in england and they pray parliament to set up some control over roman catholic moneys and interests it is pointed out that the total capital invested in the roman catholic clergy in the united kingdom must amount to nearly it is alleged that no account is afforded by the roman catholic bishops of the management or disbursements of such property and moneys and the petitioners also call attention to gross injustices which are of daily occurrence that emanated from a priest of my archdiocese holiness it was a terrible scandal but we were successful in preventing it from spreading then there was such a petition at first we were prepared to ascribe it to the imagination of one of sir notyet apeers young men and really were there many supporters of the petition unfortunately yes then you have rebellion within the camp and was there any ground for these statements there was no ground whatever for the insinuation that we habitually misuse our trusteeship the man had a grievance his agitation was merely a means to compel us to solace him he trusted by making himself unpleasant to us to make us pleasant to him so he attacked our financial arrangements it was a wicked stroke for you know holy father that we cannot be expected to account to any tomdickandharry for bequests and endowments which we administer your accounts are properly audited no doubt to a great extent yes but not invariably you trust much to the honesty and the financial ability of individual clerks we do not presume for a moment that there is any systematic malversation of trust you have had a lesson on that subject lesson yes in after the notorious carvale case when the infatuated imbecility of the gaelic and pictish bishops was shewn to render them undesirable as trustees the clergy simply dare not stray into illegal paths oh no but are the clergy actually capable of financial administration as capable i suppose as other men priests are not as other men however we take it that you all believe yourselves to have acted conscientiously we also take it that in view of the power and influence which the position of trustee affords your clergy eagerly become trustees and are unwilling to submit to supervision or to criticism that is quite human we entirely disapprove of it but what would your holiness have we cannot say it in one sentence you must collect our mind from our conduct as well as from our words we entirely disapprove of the clergy competing for or using any secular power or dominance whatever especially such power as inheres in the command of money the clergy are ministersministersnot masters and as to the other chargethe gross injustices which are of daily occurrence that of course is simply the scream of an opponent it is spite does your eminency mean that there are no injustices dont you know of gross injustices it needs must that offences come but woe to him by whom the offence cometh eminency why not frankly face the predicament the clergy are more than less human and they certainly are not even the pick of humanity now dont they attempt too much in the first instance and in the second dont they invariably refuse to admit or amend their blunders listen to this the pall mall gazette states on the authority of the missiones catholicae that in australia during the last five years we have increased our numbers from to but the government census taken last year gives the total population of australia at that leaves only for the other religious and irreligious bodies as a matter of fact the latest roman catholic record is therefore an overstatement of has been made which is absurd and perpetuated which is damnable i do not precisely see your holinesss point no well let us go to another the pope produced a small green ticket on which was printed church of the sacred heartquest roadadmit bearer tomidnight servicenew years eve middle seat d this comes from your eminencys archdiocese he said the cardinal looked at the thing as one looks at the grass of the field there it is one has seen it all before we disapprove of that said the pope what would your holiness suggest then to prevent improper persons from attending these services improper persons should be encouraged to attend no obstacle should be placed in their way the cardinal was irritated then we should have scenes of disorder to say nothing of profanation that is where your eminency and all the aboriginals err your opinion is formed upon the apprehensive sentimentality of pious oldladiesofbothsexes whose ideal of right is the notobviously wrong when a thing is unpleasant they go up a turning wipe their mouths and mistake evasion for annihilation they dont annihilate the evil they avoid it now we are here to seek and to save that which was lost and our churches must be more free to the lost than to the savedif any be saved experience proves that your pious fears have no sure warranty wesleyan schismatics have performed watchnight services for more than a century anglican schismatics have done the same and in later years they have celebrated their mysteries at midnight on christmas eve we ourself have assisted at these functions the temples were open and free and we never saw or heard a sign of the profanation of which you speak sots and harlots undoubtedly were present but they were not disorderly they were cowed they were sleepy they were curious but they made no noise even though they had shouted it only would have been in protest against some human ordinance and a human ordinance must give way the moment it becomes a barrier between one soul and that souls creator supposing means of grace to be obtainable in a church who durst deny them to those who chiefly need them the position which you clergy take up is an essentially false one we are not here to establish conventions or to enforce conformity we are here to serveonly to serve we especially disapprove of any system which bars access to the church or which makes it difficultthis admissionfee for example holy father the clergy must live you lead us to infer that they cannot live without these sixpences we are so poor we have no endowments the fee is no more than a pewrent for a single service lord cardinal be accurate you have endowments not equal to those of which you are thinking the stolen property enjoyed by the churchofenglandasbylawestablished but you have endowments you mean that they are meagre but pewrents are abominable so are pews for that matter abolish them both i am bound to obey your holiness but i must say that this quixotic impossible idealism will be the ruin of the church that is impossible because her founder promised to be with her always even unto the end of the world god helps those who help themselves but not those who help themselves out of other peoples pockets the workman is worthy of his hire perfectly but he accepts the wage he does not dictate it the builder of londons new concerthall in denambrose avenue did not let his masons domineer he offered work at a certain wage they took it or left it you confuse the functions of the buyer with those of the seller as the clergy always do besides as you seem fond of scripture provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses and take no thought for the morrow this is simply tolstoy no we never have read a line of tolstoy we studiously avoid doing so we give you the commands of christ himself as reported by st matthew lord cardinal you are all wrong your holiness speaks as though you were not one of us oh no the head looks down at the hands and says your knuckles and your nails are dirty the cardinal really was angry hadrian paused fixed him with a taming look and continued is it right or even desirable that the clergy should engage in tradeactually engage in trade look at your catholic directory and see the advertisement of a priest who with archiepiscopal sanction is prepared to pay bank interest on investments in plain words to borrow money upon usury in direct contravention of st lukes statement of the lords words on this subject look at the catholic hour and see the advertisement of a priest who actually trades as a tobacconist look in the precincts of your churches and see the tables of the fenianliteraturesellers and the seats of them that sell tickets for stageplays and bazaars where palmistry is practiced i merely interrupt to remind your holiness that your august predecessor traded as a fisherman very neat the pope applauded enjoying the retort but not neat enough a fishermans trade is an openair trade and a healthy trade by the way butdid our predecessor st peter trade as a fisherman after he had entered upon the work of the apostolature we think not no lord cardinal the clergy attempt too much they might be excellent priests as tradesmen varietyentertainers entrepreneurs they are failures as a combination they are catastrophes these two things must be kept apart the clerical and the secular god and mammon the difference must be emphasized by attempts at compromise the clergy fail in both as priests they are mocked and as for their pennyfarthing peddling but holy father do think for one minute what are the clergy to live on the freewill offerings of the faithful and one must keep the other but suppose the faithful do not give freewill offerings then starve and go to heaven as ruskin says that is what we are going to do if possible how are we to build our churches dont build them unless you have the means freely given avoid beggary that way you sicken the faithfulyou prevent generosity how shall we keep up those we have for example the cathedral yes the cathedrala futile monument of one vain mans desire for notoriety how many lives has it ruined one at least we know how many evil passions has it inspiredthe passion for advertisement by means of the farthing journalist the critical passion which is destroying our creative faculty the passions of envy and covetousness the passion of competition the passion of derisionfor you know that the world is mocking the ugly veneered pretentious monstrosity now better that it never had been as it is and in regard to the churches which exist you must do what you can if the faithful freely give you enough then let them stand if not you must let them go england never will lack altars in any case encumber yourselves with no more unpaidfor buildings accept what is given but ask for nothing and suggest nothing lord cardinal the clergy do not act as though they trusted the divine disposer of events they mean well but their whole aim and object seems to be to serve god by conciliating mammon there is nothing more criminally futile instead of winning englands admiration you secure her scornful toleration instead of consolidating the faithful multitudes have become disaffected and multitudes leave you day by day instead of improving the clerical character and by consequence the character of all who look to the clergy for example the clergy ever more and more assimilate themselves to the laity the clergy should cultivate the virtues not the vices of humanity not one of us can tell which of our actions is important or unimportant by a thoughtless word or deed we may leadastray a brother for whom christ died that is what is to be feared from your worldly clergy teach them that magna ars which st thomas of aquino says est conversari jesu teach them to rise above the world surely holy father they do some members of the clergy do no doubt we never met them the tone of the clergy is distinctly worldly here is an illustration from your own newspaper the very first thing which the slab thinks worthy of note is how monsignor cateran signally vindicated his honour and suitably punished his traducer the proprietor of the fatherland the terms of the apology which sir frederick smithers has had to publish in his own journal are set forth as a warning to evildoers it is on p you know the particulars i have read them you cannot approve of the savage triumph of the letter on p in which monsignor cateran describes his victory you cannot approve of the sneer at his enemy who could not be punished by damageshe has no means to pay or the gibe at the freemasonry of the libeller or the vicious malignant spite of the whole disgraceful document but holiness the libel was a dreadful one and grossly unjust but eminency the accused was bound by his christianity to suffer revilings and persecutions and the saying of all manner of evil falsely he forgot that in vindicating himself he behaved not as a minister of god but as a common human animal however besides the socalled triumphant vindication of monsignor cateran which the slab glorifies in three separate columns this same number bristles with improprieties on p you have dominican and jesuit controversialists calling each other liars and otherwise politely hating and abusing one another oh jesuits and dominicans the pope put down the paper and looked the cardinal collected himself for a sally in force your holiness will permit me to say that all this is extremely unusual i myself was consecrated bishop in fourteen years before you were a christian and it seems to me that you should give your seniors credit for having consciences at least dear lord cardinal if we had seen a sign of the said consciences the cardinal tottered but made one more thrust i am not the only member of the sacred college who thinks that your holinesss attitude partakes ofshall i say singularityandhaarrogance singularity oh we sincerely hope so but arrogancewe cannot call it arrogance to assume that we know more of a particular subject which we eagerly have studied from our childhood than those do who never have studied it at all eminency we began by saying that we desired to establish relations with you now have we shewn you something of our frame of mind certainly holy father you wish me to we wish you to act upon the sum of our words and conduct in order that england may have a good and not a bad example from english catholics no more than that we may call ourselves christendom till we are black in the face but the true character of a christendom is wanting to us because the great promises of prophecy still lack fulfilment the barque of peter has been trying to reach harbour muting within storms without have driven her hither and thither is she as faroff from port today as ever who knows but the new captain is trying to set the course again from the old chart his look is no longer backward but onward lord cardinal can the captain count on the loyal support of his lieutenant holy father i assure you that you may count on me it was an immense effort but when it came to so fine a point the nature and the pride of the man gave way to the grace of his divine vocation well now only one more blow from the flail and then we will take up the crook do stop your catholics from toadying the german emperor read that its perfectly absurd for them to tell him that the whole catholic world would be delighted if the protection of catholics in the orient were confided to him hes an admirable person but we are not going to confide the protection of catholics in the orient to him england is the only power which can manage orientals and what right have these erse and gaelic catholics to speak for the whole catholic world do neither england nor italy count do make these pious fatwits mind their own businessmake them understand that when they tell the kaiser that they will exert themselves to remove all misunderstandings between germany and englandengland last you notethey would be comical if they were not impertinent and entirely stupidand of course disloyal as usual hadrian collected his documents and the book of newspapercuts swept them all into a portfolio and abruptly changed the subject will your eminency be good enough to tell us the circumstances which led to our extraordinary election barely recovered from his commotion of mind and posed pointblank like this cardinal courtfield hesitated and said something about the acts of the conclave his aboriginally tardy temperament was incapable of keeping pace with the feline agility of the pontiff hadrian perceived his difficulty and intently pursued the inquiry from another footing we know all about the acts of the conclave which we shall read at our leisure but we want the more human light which your eminency can throw upon the subject perhaps it will be simpler if we use the sokratic method by what means did our name did the mere fact of our existence become known to the sacred college by my means holiness we understand that your eminency actually proposed us to the conclave that is so and we infer that you also recommended us or at least described us in such a way that the cardinals knew whom they were electing yes holy father why did your eminency propose us the pope purred the cardinal seemed to be at a loss again he appeared to have a difficulty in expression not a lack of material for expression hadrian made a dash for the rudiments there were other names before the college why were none of their owners chosen it was impossible to agree about their merits holiness several attempts no doubt were made the ways of scrutiny and access were tried seven times and then and then came a deadlock none of the candidates obtained a sufficiency of suffrages and none of the electors were willing to change their opinion and then the way of compromise was tried and through your eminencys means the compromissaries were induced to impose us on the sacred college yes holiness eminency at the time when the conclave first was immured we hardly can have been in your mind it is improbable that you could have thought of us then in this connection at what point did we come into your calculations i ought perhaps to say that your name had been brought before me some weeks before the demise of holinesss predecessor that would be in connection with the matter of which we treated in london yes precisely in what way was our name brought before your eminency it was brought before me in a letter from edward lancastera perfectly frantic letter accusing himself of all sorts of crimes your holiness perhaps is aware what a queer person he is rather inclined to be scrupulous and most impulsive yes we know him we ourself would have said unscrupulous your eminency uses the word scrupulous in the catholic sense whereas we prefer frank english i mean that he is given to tormenting himself about fancied sins and we mean that as a rule he does nothing of the kind but like a good many others is singularly successful in lulling his conscience at least for fifteen years he contrived to do so in this case however he now has made amends and there is nothing more to be said let us continue you received a selfaccusing letter from edward lancaster and then not one letter holiness a dozen at least the injustice of which you had been the victim was on his nerves he wrote me several letters and came to see me several times he is as you know a person of some importance and a great benefactor to the church and so i was obliged to take the matter up i promised to investigate the case myself yes and you did i instituted an inquisitorial process among some of the persons who had had to do with your holiness and i am bound to say that their replies gave me grounds for thought why they differed materially as to the details of your history and yet their opinion of you seemed to be fairly unanimous it was not a desirable opinion no holiness it would not be we never were able to arrange to be loved to be disagreeable was a sort of habit of ours but is your eminency able from memory to give us an idea of these differences in regard to facts opinions do not matter the cardinal pondered for a minute yes holiness i can give you three examples from oxford fr benedict bart said that he had met you twice personally but that he had heard much of you from his friends priests as well as laymen he stated that all that could be done for you had been done and that you werehayour holiness will pardon mea very incapable and ungrateful person the pope gave the little leaden weight of his pallium a swing and beamed with delight the cardinal went on fr perkins who received you into the church said im afraid hes a genius poor fellow what rank blasphemy blasphemy holiness yes blasphemy almighty god happens to make something a little out of the common and instead of praising him for the privilege of tending a singular work of his fr perkins actually bewails the fact but continue i confess i never thought of it in that light before no nor did fr perkins continue i also took the opinion of a certain dr strong who appears to be one of the superiors of the university he was senior public examiner in honour greats if you know what that means quite so well he said that you had been his intimate and valued friend for more than twenty years that you had had no influential friends to encourage you and that your abilities were no less distinguished than your moral character the pope laughed again dr strong is an experienced writer of testimonials but i should hardly think that a man in his position certainly not dr strong is one of the two honest men known to us well and how did the discrepancy between his statement and fr benedicts strike you it struck me in this way how did so many worthy priests arrive at practically the same opinion for what fr benedict said others said also when their knowledge of facts seemed to be so superficial and so doubtful i mean fr benedict and the rest spoke from an exceedingly casual acquaintance but dr strong from more than twenty years intimacy however just when i was pondering these contradictory statements your holinesss predecessor died and i was obliged to come to rome did your eminency ever note that very few clergymen are capablecapableof forming an unprejudiced proper original opinionof judging on the evidence before them and on nothing else i have excellent reason to believe that what your holiness says is correct it is so much easier to echo than to discriminate now if you please we will go back to the compromise what brought us again to your eminencys remembrance in the conclave holy father that was most strange we compromissaries were quite as unable to agree as the sacred college had been and then at the end of one of our sessions i was struck by the extraordinary likeness of cardinal della volta to someone whom i remembered having seen but whose name i had forgotten it was the merest accident but i came away wracking my brains about it another curious thing happened the same night having some papers to sign i happened to go to my dispatchbox and quite by accident i came across edward lancasters letters about your holiness we do not call these things accidents nor do i holy father now well for want of something better to do i suppose i looked over halfadozen of the letters and i determined to go further into the matter on my return to england but early the very next morning it suddenly flashed across my mind that i myself had seen your holiness in ah yes in and that cardinal della volta was your holinesss double this sent me back to the letters again and i became more and more convinced that an immense and almost irreparable wrong had been done i cannot tell you how strongly i felt that holy father but what made youwell practically impose us on the compromissaries that i cannot say although in my own mind there is very little doubt but thathowever these are the facts i was so full of the case that i narrated it at our morning conference as an instance of the fallibility of whati think it was your holiness who gave it the nameyes it wasas an instance of the fallibility of the machine i shall never forget the effect of my words upon cardinal mundo it was most extraordinary he saidi shall remember what he said as long as i livehe said my lord cardinal you owe it to that man to propose him for the paparchy yes you owe it he rather upset me i replied that your holiness was not even in sacred orders he answered whose fault is that i may say that the point was a very keen one no one could fail to perceive its relevancy to use a vulgar expression it touched the thing with a needle the others did not help me at all and i considered the matter for a few minutes mundo went on if that man had a real vocation he will have persevered if he has persevered the twenty years or more of waiting will have purified pray do not quote cardinal mundo well in short i was irresistibly moved to propose your holiness and then because no other candidate was forthcoming becausewe understand you came to us found us persistent yes holiness well shall we take a little stroll in the garden and say some office cardinal courtleigh jumped im sureif your holiness doesnt mind walking by the side of my bathchair oh but we do it is our invariable custom to walk behind bathchairs and push them indeed i could not for one moment permit no but for an hour you will submit nonsense man do you suppose that one never has pushed a bathchair before now sitdown quietly and open your breviary and read the office and we will look over your shoulder and make the responses its awfully good exercise you know chapter vii after his mornings exertions in the way of taming and domesticating a prince of the church hadrian was conscious that he required a change of emotions his thoughts went to the next thing on his listthe matter of cardinal nefski that would be an exceedingly interesting experience he did not want to intrude upon grief but he was attracted by all singular phenomena and the pathos of the pale young prelate seemed to be quite exemplary once in his secular life george arthur rose had been taken by a doctor to see a man who had severed his throat in an unusual manner using a broken penknife and cutting a jagged triangle of which the apex missed the larynx and the base the sternokleidomastoid avoiding by a hairs breadth carotid and jugular the doctor wanted a diagram of the wound made for the enlightenment of the jury which was to pronounce upon attempted suicide and george had made the sketch from the staring speechless life noted the furniture of the room and the aspect of his model quite untouched by the mans sensations or the horror of the event hadrian approached cardinal nefski with similar feelings he was curious he was psychically apart but at the same time something of subconscious sympathy in his manner elicited the desired revelation it was a ghastly one nefski cardinal archbishop had rushed to a little city in russian poland occupied by anarchists for the purpose of pleading with them he arrived at sunset there was a college there where a hundred and twenty lads of noble birth were being educated among them his own youngest brother just seventeen years old the cardinal was seized and crucified with ropes to the fountain in the marketsquare anarchists burst into the college stripped its inmates naked and flung them into the street before his eyes he absolved each one dashed from the lofty windows some instantly were smashed and killed others who fell on others were broken and shattered but not killed outright all night long nefski remained crucified the anarchists must have forgotten him for they left him and at dawn some one whom he did not know came and cut him down he remembered nothing more until he found himself paralyzed in a waggon with two priests en route for prague then he came on to rome hoping to lose the phantasm which continually occupied his sight and hearingthe heap in the dark night the growing groaning heap on red stones of white young bodies and writhing limbs like maggots in cheese the pale forms strained and curved the flying hair the fixed eyes continually falling the cutoff shrieks the thudding bounding ooze of that falling the interminable white writhing it was a ghastly tale quite unimpassionately told the young man still was in that stupor which benignant nature sends by the side of extreme pain his paralysis was passing away he could walk easily nowonly he saw and heard he spoke affectionately of his murdered brother but he did not mourn for him hadrian was moved he put all the human kindness which he had and it was not much into his voice and manner he really tried to comfort the cardinal he quoted the splendid verses of the herald in the seven against thebes being pure in respect to the sacred rites of his country blameless hath he fallen where tis glorious for the young to fall nefski seemed grateful the pontiff offered to remove him from prague and to attach him to the court of rome but he preferred to return to his archbishopric for the present at least he said until this tyranny be overpast and anon he asked permission to retire the sunlight dazzled him during the rest of the time at castel gandolfo the pope seldom was seen a boatman rowed him out on lake albano for an hour or two in the afternoon while he occupied himself in pencilling corrections on manuscript but the white figure set in the blaze of the sunny blue water did not escape the notice of passersby on the high road near the riformati and finding himself under observation he returned to the seclusion of the garden his memory flew back to the time when people used to jeer at him for his habit of writing letters letters which explained a great deal too much to blind men who could not see to deaf adders who would not hear he chuckled at the thought that those same people would read mark learn and inwardly digest every word and every dotted i of his letters nowletters which were not going to be painfully voluminously conscientiously persuasive any more but dictatorial he wrote sheet after sheet and emended them he returned to his room and burned all the rejected preliminaries and he took a fair copy with him to rome on the night of the twentyeighth of april early on the morning of the thirtieth at a secret audience in the new throneroom caerleon introduced five rather startled very dishevelled and travelstained priests five priests who had undergone a mental shock mr semphill with a white closecropped head and the face of a clean pink schoolboy contrived to remind himself that he was in the presence of the most amusing man he ever had met he buckedup and made his obeisance with an aplomb which was a combination of the service teddy hall an anglican curacy and a pictish rectory mr sterling a stalwart brown schoolmaster very handsome except for a mole on his nose hid his feelings in calm inscrutability mr whitehead a levelheaded commonsense saxon goldenhearted who never had had any wild oats for sowing observed reticence in a matter which was beyond his comprehension mr leighton plump clean curlyhaired blinked genially and waited mr carvale a lithe intense little gael with the black hair and rosewhite skin and the delicate lips and selfcontained mien of a dreamer looked upon his old collegeacquaintance with clear eyes of burning blue some of the five had the remembrance of sins of omission at the back of their minds none remembered sins of commission all were wondering what was required of themwhat the devil it all meant as semphill secularly put it if any of them expected allusion to the past they must have been disappointed hadrian gave them no sign of recognition it was the supreme pontiff who very apostolically received them and addressed them reverend sirs our will is to have such assistance in the work of our apostolature as the organs of sense can render to the mind or as the experimentalist can render to the theorist for reasons known unto ourself we have selected you believing you to be singlehearted in this one thing namely the service of god we call upon you to devote yourselves actually to the service of his vicegerent to this end we would attach you to our person in a singular and intimate connection by raising you to the cardinaldiaconate those of you who believe yourselves unable to do godservice better in this than in your present capacity can depart without forfeiting our goodwill the conscience of each man is his own sole true light far be it from us to interfere with any mans prerogative as his own director in so grave a matter the five remained standing saying nothing semphill was sincerely delighted the literary quality the topsithturfy straightforwardness of the allocution gave him the keenest joy the others felt obedience to be their plain duty for george arthur rose never had been wantonly fantastic there always had been a fundamental element of reason about his eccentricities he never had revolved at random but always round some deliberately fixed point and to plain priests the voice of the successor of st peter was a call to be answered and obeyed the pope addressed semphill your reverency quite legitimately hoped to end your days at st gowffs truehumholiness but i may be translated elsewhere by a telegraphs notice from my diocesan you are not yet a missionaryrector merely a poor masterofarts of oxford but you have been at st gowffs as long as we can remember mr semphill choked a chuckle having a little patrimony holiness i made my will in favour of the archdiocese of st gowffs and agneda and i did not omit to mention the fact to my archbishop i happened also to say that in the event of my being moved from st gowffs i should be compelled to make another will but of course i did not contemplate being moved as far as rome hadrian turned to mr sterling the last words which we said to your reverency were that you had cause to be ashamed of yourself one had cause holy father to you our invitation is a means of repairing a single small defect in a praiseworthy career it shall be repaired holy father to the others the pope said nothing for he saw their clean souls in the sacred consistory the supreme pontiff dictated to consistorial advocates a pontifical act denouncing the lord francis talacryn bishop of caerleon as cardinalpresbyter of the title of the four holy crowned onesthe lord george semphill as cardinaldeacon of st maryinbroad streetthe lord james sterling as cardinaldeacon of st nicholasinthejailoftullythe lord george leighton as cardinaldeacon of the holy angelinthefishmarketthe lord gerald whitehead as cardinaldeacon of st georgeofthegoldensailthe lord robert carvale as cardinaldeacon of st cosmas and st damian then the six were brought in and sworn of the college their heads were hatted their fingers ringed with sapphires their mouths were closed and opened by the pope and they retired in ermine and vermilion what their emotions were need not be inquired indeed they had little time for emotion seeing that during the rest of the day they sat in the secret chamber writing writing writing from hadrians dictation in the evening whitehead and carvale put on their old cassocks and posted a carriagefull of letters at san silvestro these all were sealed with the fishermans ring and as they were addressed to kings emperors primeministers editors of newspapers and heads of various religious denominations it was considered undesirable to trouble prince minimo the pontifical postmaster with material for gossip meanwhile hadrian and cardinal semphill sat in the vatican marconigraph office alone with the operators and the pope dictated while the experts fingers expressed his words in dots and dashes in london and new york by consequence what his holiness called the five decent newspapers came out on the first of may with an apostolic epistle a pontifical bull and editorial leaders thereupon the world found the epistle to all christians very piquant not on account of novelty but because of the nude vivid candour with which old and trite truths were enunciated dogmatically christianity the pope proclaimed was a great deal more than a mere ritual service it extended to every part of human life and its rules must regulate christians in all matters of principle and practice he laid great stress on the assertion of the principle of the personal responsibility of the individual it was quite unavoidable quite incapable of being shifted on to societies or servants each soul would have to render its own account to its creator in connection with the last doctrine he denounced as damnable nonsense the fashionable heresy which is crystallized in the quatrains of edward fitzgerald o thou who didst with pitfall and with gin beset the road i was to wander in thou wilt not with predestined evil round enmesh and then impute my fall to sin o thou who man of baser earth didst make and een with paradise devise the snake for all the sin wherewith the face of man is blackened mans forgiveness giveand take he described those lines as the whine of a whimpering coward pertinently inquiring whether a human father would be blameable who having taught his boy to swim should fling him into the sea that he might have the merit of fighting his own way to shore where the rope was ready at hand he condemned all attempts at uniformity as unnatural crimes because they insulted the divine intelligence which had deigned to differentiate his creatures he declared that gods servants were to be known by their broad minds generous hearts and staunch wills the church of god is not narrow nor liberal but catholic with room for all for there are diversities of gifts it was the individual soul which must be saved and it was that which was addressed in the evangel he considered the immense strength of the single verse let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind hence he would have no barrier erected between christians of the roman obedience and christians of other denominations the following passage containing his own idea of his relation to other men attracted much attention it is in no mans power to believe what he list no man is to be blamed for reasoning in support of his own religion for he only is accountable other sheep i have which are not of this fold and these deserve more care and love but not cheap pity nor insulting patronage nor irritated persecution for if as has been said a man shall follow christs law and shall believe his words according to his conscientious sense of their meaning he will be a member of christs flock although he be not within the fold and though we know that he understands christs words amiss yet that is no reason for our claiming any kind of superiority over an honest man the purpose of whose heart and mind is to obey and to be guided by christ such an one is a christian and our good brother a servant of god and if he will have us we by virtue of our apostolature are his servant also the conclusion of the epistle contained a very striking admonition addressed to members of his own communion to the effect that the being christian did not confer any title to physical or external dominion but rather the contrary perhaps the peroration is worthy of quotation persuade if ye can persuade and if the world will permit you to persuade but seek not to persuade better to live so that men will convince themselves through the contemplation of your ensample that way only satisfaction lies accept but claim not obedience seek not suffering nor avoid it but when it is deigned to you most stringently conceal it and tolerate it with jubilation remembering the words of plato where it is written help cometh through pain and suffering nor can we be freed from our iniquity by any other means scorn not the trite scorn no brotherman scorn no thing yet if ye being men must scorn then scorn the enemies of god and the king which be the devil and dishonour and death an even greater sensation than that caused by the epistle to all christians attended the simultaneous publication of the bull regnum meum it personally was addressed to the very last person in all the world by whom under ordinary circumstances a communication from the vatican might have been expected hadrian vii bishop servant of the servants of god sent greeting and apostolic benediction to his wellbeloved sonthe majesty of victor emanuel iii king of italy my kingdom is not of this world was the text of the bull which the pope began with an unwavering defence of the divine revelation the church peter and the power of the keys so far he spoke as a theologian then with lightning swiftness he assumed the rle of the historian his theme was the forged decretals or donation of constantine which first were promulgated in a breve which his holinesss predecessor hadrian i addressed to his majestys predecessor in a certain sense the emperor charlemagne he recited the wellknown facts that these decretals though undoubtedly forged had been forged merely as the intellectual pastime of an exiled archbishops idle hours and with no nefarious intent whatever he shewed how that during four centuries no doubt as to their authenticity had been entertained and how that three more centuries had elapsed before evidence had been collected sufficing to justify their being thrown overboard from the barque of peter to lighten the ship then he continued the pope was the sovereign of a patrimony of which he held no titledeeds a right more inexpugnable than prescriptive right was deemed desirable and alexander vi and julius ii bound the patrimony to peter by military conquest so it remained until the unification of italy under the house of savoy when those territories formerly known as the states of the church were absorbed by the new kingdom thus far hadrian pursued the argument and then turned to a disquisition on the worldly rights of christians the purport of which perhaps most luminously is expressed in the following sentences we use worldly things till they are wanted by the world then we will relinquish them without even so much as a backward thought for we all are clearly marked to get that which we give nothing is irrevocable on this orb of earth nothing is final for after this world is the world to come therefore let us move let us gladly move move with the times really move god always is merciful hence as supreme pontiff hadrian would practise the principle of renunciation he would renounce everything which another would take because my kingdom is not of this world and first of all in order to remove a bone of contention he made a formal and unconditional renunciation of the claim to temporal sovereignty and of the civillist provided by the law of guarantees at the same time he would not be understood as casting any slight upon his predecessors who had followed other counsels they were responsible to god they knew it he and they were the judges of their acts we on our part in our turn act as we deem best we know our responsibility and shrink not we are gods vicegerent and this is our will given at rome at st peters by the vatican on this ninth day of our supreme pontificate the formal publication of the epistle and the bull occurred in the second consistory which met at the abnormal hour of am on mayday hadrian read the two documents in that distinct minor monotone of his which was so intensely and yet so impersonally magisterial by itself the tone was aggravating the matter also was exasperating and the pontifical manner added exacerbation he seemed to be expecting opposition that came from ragna if the pope no longer was a sovereign where did the secretary of state come in was he dismissed oh dear no he certainly was not dismissed only instead of playing at statesmanship in regard to states over which he had no control at all and which were really rather commodiously managed by the secular power he was requested to turn his attention to the increase of business which inevitably now would come into his department the world is sick for the church said hadrian but she never would confess it as long as the church posed as her rival nevertheless the thing was a blow a blow that was heavy and strong half the college put on an indifferent noncommittal air the other half roared anathemas and execrations and ragna howled judas judas this shall not be in a lull hadrian coldly mewed it is and it shall be he flung down the steps of the throne a bundle of advancecopies of the roman morning journals vermilion faces stooped to them there were the epistle and the bull in the vernacular serafinovagellaio pouncedupon an announcement in il popolo romano to the effect that enabled to present to our readers these authentic and momentous acts simultaneously with the times the morning post the globe the st jamess gazette and the new york times the splendid journals of the magnanimous english to which race the sempiternal friend of italy we owe so grand and so enlightened a pontiff undoubtedly the thing was done for the world knew it and knowing it would not let it be undone there was no cardinal however infuriated who was not sufficiently serpentine to recognise the columbine as the attitude most appropriate to the circumstances the first mad idea which had seized the rebellious ones the idea of suppressing the pontifical decrees by physical force was laid aside there no doubt were other means of nullifying them later and their eminencies dispersed to say their masses with an air which made the pope feel like a very naughty tiresome little boy indeed said hadrian to cardinal leighton the question of edward lancaster worried hadrian considerably for the simple reason that while he did not want to tire himself by a renewal of relations with this individual decency demanded something he discussed the position with courtfield and talacryn neither of whom were able to appreciate his difficulty thrown back upon his own resources he made a cigarette very carefully a long fat one with the tobacco tucked into the paper cylinder with a pencil and with neatly twisted ends resembling a small white sausage and smoked it through then he wrote a letter telling lancaster that his offering had been accepted and applied assuring him of the pontifical goodwill and of a pleasant reception in case he should feel bound to present himself in rome and conferring apostolic benediction and a plenary indulgence at the hour of death this he enclosed in a gold snuffbox with a device of diamonds on the lid which the recipient might put upon his mantelpiece with other curious monstrosities orezzo and ragna appeared to have exchanged ethics for whereas the latter had been a pontifical right hand while orezzo had shutup himself in the chancery now it was orezzo who watched the pope while ragna kept aloof in vermilion sulks it was not that his occupation was gone but he wished to emphasize by withdrawing it his indispensability as for the others they wonderfully retired into their shells hadrian kept his new creatures in fairly close attendance and the nine compromissaries always were ready to make themselves agreeable when they were in rome the pope wished and tried to be on friendly terms with them and failed as he always failed he could not shew himself friendly crowds of english visitors appeared and would have been distracting they dotted themselves about the ducal hall and hadrian walked among them at one of these receptions the pontifical glance lighted on entering on a dark gaunt titan seamed with concealed pain who was accompanied by a quiet fastidious english lady wife and mother and three children two glorious girls and a proud shy english boy they were a typical group typical of all that is besttrial culture moderate success and english quality hadrian at once shook hands with them please wait till the others are gone he said and passed on to a cocky little gentleman with a pink eye and a plump barefaced party who tried to stand easily in the crosslegged pose of the male photograph of these sank to their knees but stood up again at a word well holy father who would have thought etcetera from the first and oh im sure i shall never dare to call your holiness boffin again from the second yes you do replied hadrian and gave them a blessing to which the plump one nervously responded quite so im sure as it were another couple kneeled a weird briefbodied man in a pincenez and a small suppressed woman with beautiful shortsighted eyes they were raised and the man would chatter like a hailstorm wittily and with gallic gesticulation and quite insincerely they were blessed and the pontiff wenton with some elevation of gait to the others when the audience was over a slim gentleman in scarlet with the delicate pensive beauty of a st john the divine by gian bellini conducted the english family to the apostolic antechamber here hadrian offered them some fruit and wine and shewed them the view from the windows now perhaps mrs strong would like to see the garden he presently said it was a very happy thought his holiness carried his little yellow cat and they all went down together and strolled about the woods and the boxalleys and the vineyards they picked the flowers and the children picked the fruit they admired the peacocks and rested on white marble hemicycles in the sunflecked shade of cypresses and they talked of this that and the other as well as these and those a chamberlain came through the trees and delivered a small veiled salver to the gentleman who followed the pontifical party at fifty paces at the moment of departure he came near the salver contained five little crosses of gold and chrysoberyls set in diamonds three were elaborate and two severely plain hadrian presented them to his guests you will accept a memorial of this happy day and of course with that rare dear smile of his you will not expect the pope to give you anything but popery goodbye dear friends goodbye how he has improved said the dark girl as they went out o mother and did you see the buckles on his shoes said the fair one i call him a topper said the boy he isnt a bit changed said the wife to the silent husband i think that he has found his proper niche at last the great man answered percy van kristen arrived and was brought into the secret chamber though only a little over thirty he looked as old as hadrian the glowing freshness of his oliveskin had faded but his superb eyes were as brightly expectant and his small round head as cleanly black as ever he looked tired but wholesome and he was immaculately groomed the pope said a few words of greeting and of remembrance and asked him to speak of himself van kristen was shy but not unwilling leading questions elicited that he was one of that pitiable class of men for whom the gods have provided everything but a career majority had brought him threequarters of a million sterling there was no necessity for him to go into commerce politics were impossible for respectable persons he was too old for the services the fact was he had not the natural energy which would have hewn out a careera career in the worldly sensefor himself and by consequence the world had shoved him aside on to the shelf of objects whose functions are purely decorative his mode of life was that of a man of fashion simple exquisite perhaps he read a great deal and of course his home took up most of his timebut that was a secret hadrian deftly extracted from him that he had founded and was maintaining a home for a hundred boys of his city where he provided a complete training in electrical engineering and a fair start in life his splendid eyes glittered as he spoke of this it seemed that he had kept his own world in entire ignorance of his ardent effort to be useful and one naturally enjoys talking of ones own affairs when the proper listener at last is encountered no he never had felt inclined to marry and rear a family of his own he did not think that that sort of thing was much in his line yes after leaving oxford he had had some thoughts of the priesthood but archbishop corrie had laughed him out of that he was not clever enough for the priesthood that was the real truth in his private opinion oh yes he would like it very wellas much as anything but really he hardly felt himself equal to it he didnt want to seem to push himself forward in any way yes the dynam house could get on quite well without him they were fortunate in having a capable manager whom every one liked and his own share didnt amount to much more than playing fives with the boys and paying the bills and finding out and getting all the latest dodges if he could run over and look round the place say twice a year say two months in the year he was quite willing to take up his abode with hadrian if his holiness really wanted him as a cardinaldeacon oh that would be a daisy butsorry he never did understand chaff hadrian was serious van kristens grand virginal eyes attentively considered the pontiff then with that strangely courtly gracious manner which was his natural gift and due to the perfect proportion of his skeleton contrasting so weirdly with the normal nasality of his speech he said wal i expect i wont be much good to you but youre the master and if you really want me i guess ill have a try and he went straight into retreat at the passionists on the celian hill chapter vii the key to all your difficulties present and to come is love hadrian was at his old selfanalytical games again and the aphorism which he had gleaned in the most memorable confession of his lifetime suddenly came back to him he went over a lot of things once more he was convinced that so far he did not even know what love was people seemed to like him up to a point there were certain people whom he liked but love he admitted to himself that men mostly were quite unknown to him perhaps that was his fault perhaps he could not get near enough to them to love them simply because he did not admit them to sufficient intimacydid not study them closely enough that was a fault which could be mended he summoned his fifteen cardinals to spend an hour with him in the vineyard of leo the day was a glorious roman day of opening summer the pope desired to use their eminencies for the discussion of affairs to sharpen his wits against theirs to pick their brains in order to assist in the formation of his own opinions gentilotto gently remarked that if his holiness would state a case they would do their best to help him he designated the renunciation of the temporal power and struck them dumb of course in most of their own minds they disapproved of it it had shocked them one and all of them had been brought up in the fatuous notion that the success of the church was to be gauged by the extent of her temporalities an idea of that species especially when it is inherited is not dugup by the roots and tossedout in a moment even by a pontifical bull hadrian understood that his supporters as well as his opponents disliked that audacity of his holiness we dont presume to condemn it but we dont praise it yet you must have had reasons fiamma at length said the pope had not his reasons ready on the surface they were fundamental and the temper of him used to lead him to disguise the sacrosanct with a veil of frivolity that is to say when his arcana seemed likely to be violated he was wont to divert attention by some gay paradox or witticism a little roguish glimmer lit his thin lips and a suspicion of a merry little twinkle came in the corners of his halfshut eyes once upon a time we used to know a certain writer of amatory novels the sentimental balderdash which he put into the mouths of his marionettes he only had one set of them influenced us greatly he had a living to get he thought he could get it by recommending the temporal power he was a very clever worldly catholic indeed but the arguments which he produced in so vital a matter as the earning of his living were so sterile and so curatical that we summed up the temporal power as negligible then there was the disgracefully spiteful tone of the catholic newspapersgloating over the misfortunes of hardworking wellmeaning people prophesying revolution and national bankruptcy for this dear italy and so on well our sympathy naturally went not to the malignant but to the maligned oh yes we had reasons that is enough ones hands obey ones head said sterling for my part i think that if the temporal power is worth having it is worth fightingfor lord ralph kerrison whos a british general once told me that if the pope cares to callupon catholics throughout the world and order military operations he is quite ready to throwup his commission tomorrow and enlist in the pontifical army semphill asserted no mundo with big eyes inquired fact i assure you semphill asservated but is it worth fightingfor of course holy father the possession would confer a certain status put in saviolli the pope smiled certainand status oh really talacryn was annoyed he considered the query too sarcastic his holiness perhaps leans upon the theory that the church never was more powerful than she is now della volta ventured i calculate thats fact not theory exclaimed grace well then i see in these thirtyodd years without the temporal power the church has increased in power it might be argued on that that temporal power is not essential prosecute that argument and has anyone a theory as to what precisely is the chief obstacle in our way here in italy the pope interpolated the secret societies atheism poverty socialism corrupt politicians what do we new comers know of italy asked whitehead of leighton who had made the last remark the newspapers say the newspapers carvale ejaculated dont we know how the newspapers are written has no one of us ever contributed a paragraph well then please view the question from this standpoint on the one side you have the paparchy and the kingdom church and state soul and body on the other you have the enemies of those what is necessary the destruction of the enemies or the conversion of them into friends but how how shall two walk together unless they be agreed the pope inquired the paparchy and the kingdom are not agreed said courtleigh your holiness means that they should be agreed that they should unite forces ferraio asked it is our will and our hope to be reconciled with the king of italy but is his majesty willing we know not but we have shewn that we will not block the way certainly the pope and the king together would have almost unbounded influence for good ferraio reflected then your holiness does not think the temporal power to be worth fightingfor sterling concluded hadrians eyes no longer were halfshut no he answered try venerable fathers to believe that the time has come for stripping we have added and added and yet we have not converted the world ask yourselves whether we really are as successful as we ought to be or whether on the whole we really are not abject and lamentable failures if we are the latter then let us try the other road the road of simplicity of apostolic simplicity at least let us try its an idea and for our own part we are glad to have a chance of realizing it the idea of simplicity going to the root of the matter your holiness is not afraid of going too far inquired talacryn william blake says that truth lies in extremes to the humdrum champion of the socalled golden mean which generally is a great deal more mean than golden that maxim is nothing less than scandalous all the same it is as sound as a bell eminency and nowhere does it ring more soundly than in the principle of the union of church with state as they were going in to dinner mundo whispered to fiamma have we a saint or a madman for a pope twothirds of the one and onethird of the other replied the radiant archbishop of bologna after one of the receptions of english pilgrims hadrian privately received an unusual visitor in the last antechamber she was brought in by a gentleman who remained outside one of the doors during the interview while his fellow guarded the outside of the other it was as secret an audience as ever has been deigned to a sovereign and it was accorded to a woman of the lowermiddle class about sixty years old who looked like an excessively worthy cook she flopped on her knees when the pontiff came to her mentioned her joints when assisted to rise and made bones about using the chair which he placed for her hadrians manner was absolutely divested of pontificality no one would have taken him for anything but a plain englishman perhaps of a slightly superior type and perhaps rather oddly attired he spoke kindly and easily and gradually brought his guest from a glaring twitching state of terror and obsequious joy to her honest ordinary self eeeh she burbled but i can never tell your oly majesty what i felt when i knew that you was going to let me come and see you oh thank you and god bless you sir and i always knew yould come to it and o oly father aint you very appy to think of all the good youre doing just fancy that ever i should say that to your igh oliness

how you do recollect things well now you stinted yourself then didnt you well perhaps a little now dont stint yourself any more and give away as many dinners as you like see the tears were streaming from her glaring eyes and running down her kitchenscorched cheeks she certainly was looking frowsy see i should think i did mr rose sir if i say it to your face saint was what i always said of you dear dear to think of me giving way like this well well youre too good for this world your majesty oh and ive taken the liberty of bringing you a jar of pickled samphire like what you used to fancy

seen pictures of them and i thought that the grey and the orange would brighten up a dark corner for you hadrian thanked her kindly and took her little offerings as though he prized them more than his tiara and made her infinitely happy well now i wont detain your majesty because i know there must be no end of grand people waiting about to see you and me occupying your time like this oly father so ill just ask you to pray for me and give me a blessing and thank you sir for all youve done for me and ill say a prayer for you every day as long as im spared she got on her knees and the pontiff blessed her then he said when do you go back mrs dixon well your oly majesty i was thinking of looking about a bit while im ere so as to have plenty to say to the lodgers but i cant stay more than a week longer hadrian wrote on a card the bearer mrs agnes dixon is our guest receive and assist her he signed it and gave it to her saying you know this place is full of lovely things pictures and so on and there are heaps of sacred relics in the churches well now that card will admit you to see everything will they let me see the fans which fans them they fan you with when youre glorified oh yes shew that card to the gentleman who is going to take you down stairs and tell him what you want to see will they want me to give the card up at the door no not if you want to keep it ah well ill see everything and ill keep the card till im laid out oly father oh what ever can i say youll excuse me sir and im an honest woman but i must kiss your oly majestys anointed and oh bless you my dear bless you hadrian paced through and through the apartment as soon as he was alone dear good ugly righteous creature he commented passing the safe in the bedroom he letout with his left and punched the iron door thats what use you are he said and put glycerine on his bleeding knuckles catching a glimpse of his face in the mirror beastly hypocrite he sneered at himself very disagreeable talk went on in ragnas circle the pontifical acts of hadrian were vile enough but his private ones were simply criminal a pope who asked you the hour and the date and the place of your birth drew diagrams on paper and then told you your secret vices and virtues was a practisant of arts unholy doubtless that frightful yellow cat which he took into the gardens every morning was his familiar spirit it had cursed cacciatore in a corridor almost articulately balbo the chamberlain was prepared to swear two things which he had gathered from the gentlemen of the secret chamber first that his holiness stood under a tap in his bedroom every morning and evening and sometimes during the day as well undoubtedly that was to allay the fervence of the demon who possessed him secondly that his holiness sat up half the night writing or reading and yet the pontifical wastepaper basket always was empty not even a torn shred of paper remained but then the ashes in the fireplace ah the disposition was to refer to lunacy or stupidity or knavishness or vileness whatsoever was novel to the understanding the pontiffs aggressive personality his ostentatious inconsistency his peculiarly ideal conception of his apostolic character his moral earnestness his practical and uncomfortable embodiment of his views in his conduct caused him to be as loathed by ragnas set as he was loved by the nine and the six he was accused of an anarchistical kind of enthusiasm when he heard that he said we are conservative in all our instincts and only contrive to become otherwise by an effort of reason or principle as we contrive to overcome all our other vicious propensities that was considered an additional indecorum his quaintly correct and archaic diction exasperated men who had no means of expressing their thoughts except in the fluid allusive clipped verbosity of the day objections were made to his hendecasyllabical allocutions by mediocrities who could not away with a man who discoursed in ithyphallics his autocratic dogmatism which really was due to his entire occession by his office shocked the opportunist irritated the worldlyprudent outside in the world too he was by no means a complete success people who were not of his communion thought it rather a liberty that a pope should have the authorized version at his fingers ends at first a lot of fantastic instabilities prepared to hail him as a reformer but he gave dire offence to them and to all pious fatwits by flatly refusing his countenance to any kind of scheme or society the church suffices for this life he said and his sentence cultivate and help to cultivate individuality at your own expense if possible but never at the expense of your brother was highly disapproved of where did the rights of man come in but then hadrian was quite certain that christians actually had no worldly rights at all arraigned on the question of superstition by the stolidly commonsense talacryn he said extrabelief superstition that which we hope or augur or imagine is the poetry of life and his utterance was regarded as almost heretical his utter lack of personal swagger or even dignity his habit of rolling and smoking continual cigarettes his natural and patently unprofessional manner offended many outsiders who only could think of the pope as partaking of the dual character of an immeasurably ambitious clergyman and a scarlet impossible person he had enemies at home and abroad and he remained quite alone psychically detached to a very great extent unconscious of certainly uninterested in the impression which he personally was creating and altogether uninfluenced by any other mind or any other creature a parcel of curial malcontents waitedon the pope and poured forth flocculent interrogations and sophomoric criticisms to their hearts content hadrian sat perfectly motionless except for an occasional twinkle of his earsa muscular trick which he had forced himself to learn for the disconcerting of more than usually oxymorose fools he was mute he was grave he looked with large omniscient imperscrutable eyes with the countenance open with the thoughts restrained cavillers recited grievanceshis refusal to wear the pontifical pectoralcross of great diamonds or any gems except his episcopal amethyst was oneand appended sentences beginning now surely or and the scandal or ought we not rather he was mute he was grave he was attentive his intelligent silence had its calculated effect of causing errancy from points which primarily had been deemed important anon only one objection remained an objection to the new form of pontifical stole no one complained of its colour red was canonically correct but the silk should have been satin also the pattern of the gold embroidery was uncommon a rich design of conventional foliage and grotesques enclosing armorials and keys was what custom demanded hadrian had no armorials years before while discussing heraldic blazons with an aged clergyman he had burst out with my shield is white keep it so the other replied and hadrians shield was argent but this narrow strip no wider than a ribbon severely adorned with little fylfot crosses a buddhist emblem berstein sneered in little rectangular panels with no expansive ends and a scanty fringe was hardly at all the kind of stole to inspire either the admiration or the homage of the faithful still hadrian sat immobile greateyed allabsorbent and let them furiously rage and imagine very vain things and at the end of threequarters of an hour he merely murmured your eminencies have permission to retire and stalked into the secret chamber it was felt that something ought to be done ragna put a case to vivole and cacciatore the oecumenical council of the vatican stood adjourned since but if the sacred college should demand they found the notion excellent communicated it to berstein and the french plumed themselves and went about mysteriously with their noses in the air and there were intrigues in holes and corners hadrian went up to the church on the celian hill and conferred diaconate on percy van kristen the passionists liked that one for his stately shyness which did not wear away it was the mark of a soul verisimilar to his patrons own of a soul knit to no other but whereas the soul of hadrian had been torn out of seclusion and bitterly buffeted by the world the soul of percy van kristen preserved its pristine tenderness the pope perforce went armed his deacon remained by the altar the consistory was summoned for the twentyfourth of may that morning hadrian woke just on these words of a dream oecumenical council pseudopontiff heretic a man with an active brain like his naturally suffers much unconscious cerebration very often it happened to him vividly to dream some scrap or other of something apparently unconnected with the present he used to wonder at it mentally note it generally forget it now and then an event of which it was the tip immediately followed and he scored hadrian named to the consistory the lord percy of new york as cardinaldeacon of st kyriakatthebathsofdiocletian his eminency became resplendent in vermilion tall refined reticent with dark wide dewy eyes he was admired in silence the pope by some accident turned his gaze to ragna he had such an aspect as caused his holiness to look more intently ragnas great strong jaw moved as though to munch and his glance defiantly shifted your eminency is free to address us the supreme pontiff said to him i wish rather to address the sacred college ragna answered rising hadrian had an intuition his face became austere his voice deliberate on the subject of an oecumenical council where you may denounce us as pseudopontiff and heretic ragna hurriedly sat down twitching berstein and vivole muttered of divination and necromancy that generally is done the pope continued in the tone of one merely selecting fringe for footstoolsthat generally is done by obliqueeyed cardinals he meant envious but he used the latin of horace who cannot accustom themselves to new pontiffs rovere ululated for an oecumenical council when he found our predecessor alexander antipathetic and there be other examples but lord cardinals if such an idea should present itself or should be presented to you be ye mindful that none but the supreme pontiff can convoke an oecumenical council and also that the decrees of an oecumenical council are ineffective unless they be promulgated with the express sanction of the supreme pontiff who would sanction decrees ordaining his own deposition who could if we pronounce ourself to be a pseudopontiff what would be the value of such pronunciation ye were our electors we did not force you to elect us if we be pontiff we will not and if we be pseudopontiff we cannot depose ourself we are conscious of your love and of your loathing for our person and our acts we value the one and regret the other but ye voluntarily have sworn obedience to us and we claim it subordination so the adage runs he was citing the greek to every latins disgust is the mother of saving counsel nothing must and nothing shall obstruct us let that be known and we should welcome cooperation wherefore most eminent lords and venerable fathers let not the sheep of christs flock be neglected in order that the shepherds may exchange anathemas mundo and fiamma rose by impulse went to the throne and renewed their allegiance the new cardinals mixed with the others and began to talk while the rest of the compromissaries approached the pontiff orezzo moved that way with eight italians then the seven brought each a companion when at last the benedictine struggled to his feet opposition died ragna toed the line his holiness has averted a schism said orezzo to moccolo one has to admire even where one hardly approves and to hobbleafter even when one cannot keepupwith the pace saint or madman mundo repeated to fiamma onethird saint onesixth madman onesixth genius onesixth dreamer onesixth diplomatist no all george arthur rose plus peter talacryn put in he said as much himself to me once whatever hadrian went out to take the air under his cloak he carried a pickle bottle the label of which he had washed off and destroyed as he went along he picked up a trowel left by some gardener in a flowerbed he found a solitary corner filled with roseacacias and lavenderbushes behind the leonine villa he looked up at the cupola of st peters and saw no americans levelling binoculars then he dug a little hole and buried pickles and hid the bottle a few yards away beneath the beehives by the lavenderbushes mauvebloomed very sweet to smell the solemn odour stimulated his brain and he returned to chat with his gentlemen they were engaged in physical exercises in a parlour the italian who was one of natures athletes with so tremendous a power of chestinflation that his ribs seemed unconnected with his sternum interminably floated down and up and down to the floor on one leg with the other leg and both arms extended rectangularly before him the englishman a student graceful and slim but not muscular watched him and would imitate his sinews had not the elastic force rhythmically to lower and raise him he could get down but not up he often lost balance and rolled over in frantic failure you must have thighs made of whipcord and steel to do it he was saying then they saw their visitor and attended hadrian asked what the exercise was and whence it came santit from the bersaglieri iulo responded that they do during an hour of each day for the fortification of their legs from which they run it is beautiful and are you going to emulate the bersaglieri my comrade goes to educate my mind i go to discipline the physic of him the gymnast said oh im going to help him rub up his classics as far as my poor knowledge lets me holiness thats all the student added very good indeed hadrian pronounced well now something is going to happen to you go and escort the secretary of state to the secret chamber ragna and the young men appeared within the quarterhour the pope was seated and a couple of noble guards stood behind his chair eminency he said it is our will to give these gentlemen the rank of cavalierein english knight naitah ragna repeated your eminency will cause letters patent to be prepared but this is the act of a sovereign and we having no temporal sovereignty exercise our prerogative as father of princes and kings he beckoned the gentlemen to kneel took a sword from the guard on his left and struck them on the shoulder in turn saying to the honour of god of his maiden mother and of st george we make thee knight be faithful rise sir john to the honour of god of his maiden mother and of st maurice we make thee knight rise sir iulo the cardinal retired mumbling in the first antechamber sir iulo cut a caper oh but that i should come to know such a one as this he chortled sir john went to his own room opened an interlinear crib of horace and could not see one letter chapter viii hadrian knew that he was becoming confirmed in his pose of director not that he was inflated by his exaltation to the apostolature he was conscious that people except a few enthusiasts were become indifferent to religion he knew the danger of indifference to be so great that it was no time to strain at gnats he could not trouble about rats in the ships hold while the torpedo was approaching he was thought to share the abominable heresy of tolstoy whose works he never would touch with tongs he saw that most men lived in mist and preferred it that most men durst not see clearly because their business and their social interest would not stand it he was not absolutely certain that he himself could see the remedy but he was certain that blindness was no remedy so he put forth the evangelic counsels for obedience strip and obey those appeared to be sufficient for the present and he would not fiddlefaddle with human doctrines or empirical experiments he had the big vision the seeing eye the hearing ear wit perverseness daring and the lonely heart and the contempt of the world the effect of his entire freedom of action was to inspire him physically and mentally with the thrilling vigour of a pentathlete he had the violent energy of the minute electron in the enormous atom he felt himself strong he knew that his forces were tensely strung and in their melody he was very glad sometimes he caught himself wondering how long he could maintain the pitch but from that thought he turned away it was enough that he was able he would not spare himself the night cometh when no man can work let it come he said to cardinal sterling but while day lasts we work a splendid sentence of mommsens bit into his brain csar ruled as king of rome for five years and a half in the intervals of seven great campaigns which allowed him to stay not more than fifteen months altogether in the capital of the empire he regulated the destinies of the world for the present and the future precisely because the building was an endless one the master as long as he lived restlessly added stone to stone with always the same dexterity and always the same elasticity busy at his work without ever overturning or postponing just as though there were for him merely today and no tomorrow thus he worked and created as never did any mortal before or after him and as a worker and creator he still after two thousand years lives in the memory of the nationsthe first and withal unique imperator csarand julius also had been pontifex maximus hadrian took a white umbrella for a walk as far as the blacklava fort on the appian way he considered the horrible condition of france and russia it was a menace to the world of russia he could learn nothing new thews and thought together had abolished authority and gone mad in butchery the information which he had obtained from the french cardinals was not of a rather useful nature elements of emotional sentiment and archaic conventionalism rendered their opinions well nigh worthless they were tolutiloquent in expressing horror at the impiety of mobrule which had deprived them of the right to military salutes ordained by the concordat they made the blood boil by their heartrending descriptions of holocausts of priests and nunsearnest heroic enthusiasts absolutely incapable of doing anything really practical in the way of eradicating that demoniality of which they became the victims nothing would please their eminencies better than to hasten to their distracted nativeland to offer up themselves as martyrs to the devils of their dioceses they were no cowardsif desire to rush on death be braverybut they were picturesque and dithyrambicmainly picturesque with their long hair and their rabats edged with white beads that would not do as an essential out of the mellay of matter laid before him the pontiff extracted certain points france qu france no longer was christian the devil was in power christians who were able to cross frontiers did so spain italy switzerland germany received them england america japan blockaded toulon brest cherbourg their liners tapped the coasts and carried thousands into freedom poverty afflicted the emigrants those left behind were butchers or subject to butchery dom jaime de bourbon having perished the pope sent for the duke of orleansand dismissed him with austere disgust he subsequently withered away his holiness gave audience to a score of the french nobility and spent some days picking the brains of emigrants fortuitously collected then he again convened the french cardinals and declared the pontifical will they all were deposed from their episcopal sees and nominated apostolic missionaries their charge was the cure first of the bodies second of the souls of frenchmen everywhere the cardinalmissionary of paris would go to london with the cardinalarchbishop of pimlico having powers to draw one million sterling from the pontifical treasure in the bank of england which sum in halves was to be the nucleus of two funds an english and a german for french christians in their need each cardinalmissionary also received a breve authorizing him and persons delegated by him to collect money in every christian country for the said funds it was not to be a clerical charity the lord mayor of london and the german emperor were willing to administer it each independently further their eminencies were to use their own discretion about adventuring themselves in the diabolical dominion if they best could serve god there then in gods name and with gods vicegerents benediction let them go but they most straitly were bidden to keep one only object before them viz the service of god through the relief and comfort of his servants nothing was to prevent them in that the world began to concentrate the corner of its eye on hadrian holland and belgium fell into the arms of anarchical france the vigorous bold brilliant young sultan ismail having failed to win morocco to his panislamic scheme was intriguing for an alliance with the other great muhammedan power england his majestys murdered predecessor by the aid of germany had formed an army of a million and a half full of fanatical valour and the wonderful natural adaptability of the turk the rawest recruit of which had a greater fightingvalue than was possessed by the conscripts of any other nation this force was available for active service at fifteen minutes notice the turkish alliance was worth anyones while and was coveted germany had trained the ottoman squadrons but was not to profit thereby teutonic stolidity had been outwitted by the wily oriental islam could only and only would mate with islamas might have been foreseen the rest of the continent of europe ringed frontiers under arms each nation feared the other and all feared france and russia hadrian watched the diplomatic processes with interest he knew that england was quite capable of taking care of herself with or without the mussulman he grasped the theory that muhammedanism arising six hundred years after christ justified the wisdom of god in judaism proving that the oriental mind could bear nothing more perfect and he conceived a sort of sympathy with islam his conversations with ambassadors became known in courts the king of prussias legate wrote amazing things to the german emperor from courts descriptions of opinions tastes habits descended until they were discussed in clubs and miscellaneous congeries hadrians custom of walking about unattended lookingat the excavations in the forum visiting the sick in hospitals sensuously delighting himself with the glories of sunset seen from the pincian hill were the themes of common conversation and when one evening he gotin a left hander from the shoulder on a socialist who spat at him in borgo nuovo and then on the filthy beasts bursting into tears and collapsing with the effects of the blow upon semistarvation pressing upon him his pectoral cross and chain his gold spectacles and all the coins left in his pocket after a couple of hours in romethen the english race began to find the pope observable and english newspapers started columns called rome day by day how the special correspondents spread themselves she of the pall mall gazette got the usual exclusive information of the borgo nuovo affair and split nine infinitives in describing the myopic pontiff narrowing his eyes to slits groping his way along the colonnades with his fainting assailant his passionate denunciation of the farce of organized charity which had let a man become so degraded his agitation until cardinal carvale came running with his spare pair of spectacles his strangely pathetic thankfulness for the gift of sight which they afforded his anguish at the defilement of his garment and his tender invitation to the starving socialist to be his guest in vatican all this suited the english temper to a tbeing english but there was created a profound and perdurable impression the king of prussias legate wrote more amazing things to the german emperor hadrian became regarded in cabinets and chancelleries as one who cared or strove neither for loss nor gain neither for life nor deathas the one potentate who rightly or wrongly knew his own mindas a power with whom a reckoning might have to be made after all it merely was the effect of simplicity upon complexity of felinity upon caninity he was sitting alone thinking and carefully unravelling a woollen antimacassar it had been crocheted in five bossy strips three of orange hue and two of grey alternately arranged he had unravelled two orange and two grey strips and had the wool neatly rolled in four balls beside him the next time he should go into the city some little girl would be made happy with two nice balls of grey wool and a lira to buy knitting needles and the time after that another little girl would have three balls of orange wool and a lira also and pontifical eyes would not be scorched by ghastly antimacassars any more nor would the kind heart of anyone be wounded he finished the job and went to talk to his socialist that one turned out to be a goldsmith with the ideals and the brains and the fingers of cellini but not the acquisitiveness hence straits socialism sophistries starvation they walked about the sculpturegalleries for coolness and spoke of beautiful things hadrian revelled his guest was a man of taste and talkedonatrot with wonderful gestures making and moulding ideal images which the minds eye could see they came to the apoxyomenos stood raved and became dumb feasting on the lithe majesty of perfect proportion the artificer first spoke holiness he said can you see that body and those limbs crucified hadrians mind caught the idea the splendid forms of the marble seemed to rearrange themselves in the new pose his eyes came slowly round to his questioner yes he answered but soaring and triumphing reigning from the tree not drooping and dyingand not the head and bust he took the goldsmiths arm and hurried him to the antinous of the belvedere and began to speak very quickly sir he said you will be pleased to stay here and with the materials which will be provided you will make a new cross for us the cross will be of the kind called potent elongate the figure will combine the body and limbs of the apoxyomenos with the head and bust of the antinous but posed as we have described on the completion of this masterpiece you will be offered an appointment as goldsmith in the pontifical household ah padrone hadrian returned to the secret chamber happy in anticipation of an emblem which would not offend his taste true he was glad in a way that a tangled life so easily could be made straight but it was the visionary ideal of beauty which really inspired joy chapter ix that aggregation of intellectually purblind and covetous dullards who formed the socialistic sect of the king of englands subjects presently began in their rough rude way to perpend the pope of rome it had been a moot point with these discontented sentimentalists whether it would or would not be profitable to unite with french and russian anarchy and attain their ends that way but one julia in the salpinx screamed such excruciating tales about slaughtered french babies that that was off also it was remembered that a certain comrade dymoke the only capable fighting man ever possessed by socialism had been spunged upon for fifteen years by socialistic cadgers sucked dry ruined and cast out a victim of socialistic jealousy and treachery in the plans laid for a social revolution towards the end of the nineteenth century that man had been named commanderinchief now he was not available and his place was vacant for a military expert rarely errs into the purlieus of socialism but one thing had been done the social democratic federation had been induced at the national liberal club to coalesce with the independent labour party the coalition called itself the liblab fellowship the salpinx and reynardss were its organs and a parcel of bobs and bens and bills and bounders its prophets it concluded that it would score by toadying the supreme pontiff the brainless monster of socialism always was hunting for a brain to direct its forces by some perverted process it arrived at the feeling that a pope who could indite the epistle to all christians would be likely to lend himself to the furtherance of its crude designs on other peoples property a week later cardinal whitehead called hadrians attention to the current issue of the aforenamed journals which contained an open letter to the pope praising the enlightened humanitarianism of his holinesss recent utterance inviting him to have courage of his opinions and to bring his epistle to what was called a logical conclusion by a formal authoritative declaration of the doctrine of equality popes as a rule do not notice open letters hadrian however had learned from the pall mall gazette that the fashion was for copious artists in words to lecture the roman pontiff he anticipated the being told by that elegant journal that he knew as much about the true inwardness of catholicism as a cow knows of a clean shirt but he privately was of opinion that more harm may be done by leaving some things unsaid but love was it possible that he could love could like even hyenas who screeched such ditties as this on the same page they will tax the baked potatoes they will tax our blessed swipes they will tax our blooming hot peasoup the leather and the tripes they will tax the costers donkey they will tax the derby orse and theyre going to tax the devil when he lives at charing crorse ouf no it was quite impossible yet there were people whom he could like if not love people in his own environment these he would make easy happy to these he could set an example they in turn would do as much for the rank below them and so on and so on thus perhaps by natures own method might love be brought down among men so with a stern and trenchant rebuff he rebuked presumption on the following sunday a pontifical breve was read from every catholic pulpit in the kingdom of england at home and beyond the seas it proclaimed the dogma of equality as scientifically historically and obviously false and impracticable as a diabolical delusion for the ruin of souls hadrian did not soar away in metaphysical intricacies but confined his argument to the broad highway whereon the ordinary man might walk at ease infinite difference he said was the note of the divine creators scheme not equality but diversity of physique of intellect of condition was mans birthright one man was not as good as another he generally was a great deal betteras every man well knew the claim to equality was so indecently unjust that it only could emanate from inferiors who hoped to gain by degrading their superiors socialists who claimed equality solely were actuated by the lust of improving their own condition at the expense of their brother that was selfishness and unchristian and by consequence damnable heresy the servants of god were bidden to avoid it the vicar of christ repeated christs commands love one anotherlove your enemies only by love could be attained the happiness which all desired that the classes did care for the masses futile and indolent though their method might be was undeniable but the attitude of the masses to the classes was unmitigated hatred the accident of birth to poverty or wealth was not a fault for it was inevitable the principle of aristos the best was to be upheld the strength of aristos was incalculable because it acted through the relations of private life which were permanent whereas the political excitement of socialism was essentially ephemeral rights inherited meritorious conferred by legitimate authority were sacred only the holders of such rights of their own free will could depose themselves or abdicate their rights and as christians they were expected to behave themselves christianly but to deprive them of such rights at the will of those who did not confer them would be an outrage the socialistic idea which suggested such iniquity was essentially selfish and venal hadrian severely denounced the newspapers in which the open letter to the pope appeared he said that the thoughtful reading of a newspaper was one of the most solemn and painful studies in the world for it was little more than a category of sin and suffering of incitements to sin of efforts to acquire filthy lucre honestly and dishonestly he copiously quoted the advertisements the cyclorama page the motor notes page the stageland the womans letter and the leaders of the one in order to show that the socialistic outcry by no means was the bitter groan of oppressed poverty but rather the grumbling vituperation of envious discontented mediocrity anxious to affect an appearance which was sham and not its own and to wallow in luxurious conditions which it had not earned especially he noted the socialistic programme we suggest that the nation should own all the ships all the railways all the factories all the buildings all the land and all the requisites of national life and defence as a plain declaration that robbery of private property created by individual industry and geniusrobbery pure and unadulterated was the basis of the socialistic scheme he denounced the paper as being written for amateur agnostics by dilettante atheists he pungently derided attempts made by pseudoscientists of the obsolete school of haeckel to popularize among mistaken but serious secularists the science of yesterday and the destructive criticism of the day before that as for the other paper he likened it to a cloaca wherein filth of all kinds is committed and collected the news of the day was reported only in so far as it was susceptible of filthy presentation pages were devoted to diffusing refuse from policecourts and under the head of secret history to calumnious inventions or distortions of fact connected with any and every man or woman who was not of the dregs of humanity as a method of earning a living by journalism this pandering to the basest passions was disgraceful and damnable in the full sense of the word not by such means were the bodies and souls of men to be improved or profited not by such means could happiness here or hereafter be attained let men raise themselves if they will and let each man help himself by helping his brother to the utmost there shall be no limit to your resurrection wellbeloved sons if ye rise not on other men but upon your own dead selves the pope concluded in accordance with instructions the cardinalprefect of the congregation of sacred rites presented to the pontiff certain completed processes and petitions for the beatification of the venerable servants of god alfred the great king and confessorhenry vi of lancaster king and confessormary stewart of england france and scotland queen and martyr assent was deigned to these petitions and pictures each with a golden nimbus were unveiled in the vatican basilica the bull of beatification decreed the addition of the following words to the roman martyrology the official roll of sanctity this day in england is kept the festival of the blessed alfred king and confessor who by the acclamation of his own people is named great memorable as a father of his fatherland a lover of his brother a true servant of god this day in england is kept the festival of the blessed henry vi of lancaster king and confessor memorable for meekness for suffering for purity of heart for the gift of prayer this day in scotland is kept the festival of the blessed mary stewart queen and martyr memorable for womanly fragility for nineteen years atonement in prison for choosing death rather than infidelity semphill and carvale had urged hadrian to impose the proper office and mass of the last upon england as well as scotland his holiness would know why because her majesty was the rightful queen of england as well as of scotland semphill responded with the air of one who has invented a new sauce display your premisses lord cardinal said the pope they are simply historical facts known to everyone but the conclusions which may be drawn from historical facts mainly depend upon the sequence or method of arrangement of the said facts display yours lord cardinal the blessed mary stewart was heiress of james v who was heir of margaret tudor wife of james iv of scotland and daughter of henry vii of england henry viis heir was his son henry viii who married katherine of aragona and had issue mary tudor subsequently failing to obtain annulment of this marriage from your holinesss predecessor clement vii henry viii lived in sin with anne bullen and jane seymour by whom he had issue elizabeth and edward canonically this prince and princess were illegitimate and incapable of succession therefore on the death of henry viii the crown of england demised to his sole legitimate issue mary tudor but parliament had passed an act hen viii c giving the english sovereign power to limit the crown by letterspatent or by his last will to such person or persons as he should judge expedient surely holiness that ought not to count however on the death of mary tudor without issue i argue that the crown of england demised de jure though not de facto to the next legitimate tudor who was mary stewart heiress of margaret tudor hadrian turned to carvale of course most holy lord i feel with cardinal semphill i thinkhis beautiful blue eyes blazed with the fire of his dreamsi think that the time has come for doing justice to the memory of that predestined victim of uncounted treasons of unnumbered wrongs wrongs which warped and maddened and bewildered her noble nature but never quenched her courage never deadened her gratitude to a servant never shook her loyalty to a friend never made her false to her faith o think holiness of all that the stewarts have suffered hadrian himself had a very tender and romantic feeling of attachment towards the stewarts but he responded our office is not to stir up strife we englishmen happen to have made an ideal of elizabeth with that delightful capability for making our own ideals and maintaining them in the teeth of realities we have chosen to forget the fact that no sovereign of ordinary intelligence could have helped being gilded by the really abnormal galaxy of talent which illumined the age of elizabeth it was those gigantic geniuses who made the glory of england then england happened to be personified by elizabeth therefore in english eyes elizabeth was great and glorious and all the rest no one he turned to semphill can quarrel with your statement of blind and naked fact and no one who is rightminded will but we desire to reconcile not to exasperate though we never will refuse to exasperate upon an apt occasion therefore we will not assert now that which need not be asserted be content that we raise your lovely martyred queen to the honours of the altars of your country ask almighty god to look upon your land with favour for his sons sake and for the sake of her who in the strength of that son was faithful unto death call upon mary in heaven to add her prayers to those which ye offer to god on earth precious in the sight of the lordif it be his will to confirm with signs and wonders these your invocations their eminencies gazed at the pope with ecstasy that he whom they had known before not always agreeably that heoh really said semphill to carvale as they left the presence i dont know whether im sleeping or waking and hadrian alone rolled a cigarette saying to another than himself is that what you wish me to do in this case simultaneously with the beatificatory bull laudemus insignes was issued the epistle to the english the pope affirmed that the english race naturally was fitted to give an example to humanity in particular he categorically distinguished its solid worth its dignified good sense its deliberate tenacity its imperturbable habit its superb impassiveness in reverses its stoical firmness under the most cruel deceptions its unshaken determination to conquer under any circumstances in general he noted its faculties of selfrestraint of construction of administration and among the upper and middle classes of altruism he indulged no vain regrets but dealt entirely with the present and the future he addressed the race as the race would wish to be addressed with perfect sincerity in spite he said of the scum which floats and is called smart in spite of the dregs which goes amafficking and is called hooligan the english people at heart were as sound as ever millions rich and not rich gentle and simple in town and country led clean and wholesome lives no newspaper paragraphs proclaimed that these good souls were bringingup their children to be ladies and gentlemen were solicitous for the welfare of their inferiors had respect unto themselves no flaming headlines screeched announcing that they were paying their way marrying and giving in marriage rejoicing and sorrowing like the brave honest commonplace people that they were no society gossip told of robert and william and nicholas and james and frederick and herbert and percy and alfred daylabourers for a too scanty wage who never drank nor fought nor swindled nor yelled for their rights but who led decent noble lives under circumstances often cruelly unjust and always rigorously hard of such as these said hadrian was the english race composed he reminded england that she had received more from the latin church than any other nation that her gains had been direct before indirect after that date when her natural enemies were dragged down by the corruptions of rome he thought they would enjoy that point he assumed nothing not even a prejudice he advised without commanding he directed without trespassing the latter half of the epistle concerned those who owed him spiritual allegiance to these he spoke with all authority he blamed their phrenetic anxiety to enter into worldly competition he pointed out that the penal laws which from to had deprived them of that culture which contact with a wider world alone can give had rendered the catholic aborigines corporeally effete and intellectually inferior to the rest of the nation he did not blame noluntary defects but facts were facts and only fools would refuse to face them these defects would find their remedy in the influx of new and vigorous blood and unexhausted brains he quoted the words of a great critic who said that the religious movement of our day would be almost droll if it were not from the tempers and actions which it excited so extremely irreligious it had taken four centuries to produce the present position of catholics in england and as no man has a right to expect miracles it might take four centuries more to restore them to a corporeal and intellectual equality with the average of their fellowcountrymen to this end he bade them to welcome and to comfort accessions to their number not as was the present custom with slavering sentimentality giving place to slights snubs slanders and sneers but with brotherly love putting in practice the faith which they professed and letting their light shine instead of advertising comparatively paltry efforts at illumination he reminded them that god made man right but he had sought out many abstruse reasonings and for a society of christians to pretend to be the world or of the world was an incongruous monstrosity he warned them that the kind of conscience which they cultivated the conscience which descends from its high personal plane which consents to haggle and discuss how far resistance to temptation must be carried which deigns to consider consequences to weigh possibilities and to guard against disaster was the proximate occasion for the wellfounded charges of hypocrisy and humbug brought against all religion by lewd fellows of the baser sort as for those of the clergy whose comportment elicited from outsiders testimonials to the effect that they were thorough men of the world having nothing clerical about them except their collars or thoroughly good chaps who take their glass and enjoy a smutty story like ordinary beingshis holiness assured their right reverencies their very reverencies and their reverencies that they completely misconceived their sacred character our citizenship is in heaven if then in very truth ye look for a city which is an heavenly ye must esteem yourselves as being in the world as strangers or resident aliens and so ye ought not to be curiosi in aliena republica he ordained that married anglican clergy whose wives were alive and who possessed the grace of a divine vocation on resuming allegiance to the see of peter should be admitted to the priesthood and serve secular churches but faculties for hearing confessions were not to be disposed to married priests and each such priest having charge of a mission must nominate and maintain at least one regular as curate whose sole duty should be the administration of the sacrament of penance finally the supreme pontiff commanded the sacrifice of that phantom uniformity which had been the curse of catholicism for four centuries and the retention and cultivation of national and local rites and uses and he commended england to st george protector of the kingdom the archsocialists were bitterly chagrined by the pontifical denunciation of their open letter but the epistle to the english made them gnash their teeth in print they gibbered at first and vomited after their manner in congress each one suspected his neighbour of being a traitor to the cause whose treachery had taken the form of urging his comrades corporately to attract the pontifical fulmination there was a dreadful scene at west ham and a free fight at battersea comrade pete quillet threatened to ave comrade bill meggins blighted ear and had as much of the left one as twentyseven unclean gorgonzolacoloured fangs could tear off before he succumbed to six boots a bottle and a harnessbuckle at head quarters the demagogues did behave with outward decency not disguising their disappointment but casting about for a new lead the curious thing was that not one of them now but was more than ever anxious for alliance with the power which disdained and damned them it was the power which they covetedand admired in the first intention of the word their attitude to the pope was that of those who lick the hand that lashes them the pope was not a penrhyn against whose liberty they could invoke the laws at which otherwise they girded he was to them something immense intangible potent detestableand most desirable while they were debating as to the precise posture in which they next should cringe comrade jerry sant communicated startling news he was a delegate from the north by profession first a haberdashers bagman secondly a socialist socialism appearing to him an easy way of selfaggrandisement as a rule he did not push forward working in the background anonymously writing for the papers watching for a chance to snatch he whispered a word to his neighbour at the table rot said the latter rot yersel jerry retorted the other fellowshipper guffawed here i say mr chairman this comrade says he used to know that old pope jerry sant became observed he had the haggard florid aspect the redlidded prominent eyes the pendulous lip of a sorry sort of man he stood up and began to speak sometimes dragging a sandy rag of moustache or fingering shiny conical temples but generally holding on by the lapels of a shortskirted broadcloth frockcoat protruding blacknailed thumbs through the buttonholes in a manner acquired during a week in paris his style was geological so to speak consisting of various strata deposited at various periods the surface stratum representing the kainozoic time consisted of the platitudinous bombast characteristic of the common or oratorical demagogue below that corresponding to the mesozoic time came the ridiculous obsequious slang of the bagman of commerce below that again corresponding to the paleozoic time appeared the gelded english which muscleless feckless unfitforhandicraft little sciolists acquire in schoolboard spawningbeds and these rested on stratum of the azoic time to wit the native pictish presbyterian jargon of mr sants sententious pettifogging spiteful self these different strata occurred as irregularly as natural strata they ran one into the other like veins in a fissure causing displacements resembling those which technically are called faults and the tracing and stripping of the same is a task for the ingenious geophilologist its a gospeltruth comrades i had used to fhat ye might call know the pope a few years ago fhen he was just george arthur rose and not a poundnote in his purse i was running the social standard oot o my own pocket and manys the bit o work ive let him have he was trying his hand at journalism then and gey glad to get it i may take this opportunity of saying that he owes his footing to me and most ungrateful he has treated me comrades as is the nature of him proud aristocrat as he is not that i look for gratitude in such but ive often thought when ive heard of him getting oni mean before as he was fhat he is nowas perhaps he might like to remember him as gave him his first leg up but no not a bit of it though i advised him of as much once and he rounds on me and cheeks me cruel and im not the only one neither i can tell you something else about him theres a ladyfriend of mine here stop a bit the chairman interrupted youre getting on a bit too fast what did you let him write for the social standard for was he a comrade ilp or sdf or fabian praps he seems to be rather a high sort from what you say a comrade tits man ma pairsonal opeenion is that he was nothing bit a tory spy i always thought he was a jesuit in disguise and now of course i know it fhen i knew him first he was pals with the traitor dymoke dymoke teeth gritted and the social equivalent for the roman anathema sit was snarled comrades it wasnt me that was to blame there you know wait a minute before we meaninglessly divide oursels i have some most important developments to lay before the meeting as youll all cordially endorse dont someone remember i was the one that stopped the traitors letters and give information of his treachery if it hadna have been for me he would have bought the bally show with his tory gold it was me as put my spoke in his wheel and got him expelled in time well as i was remarking fhen i knew rose he was gey thick with dymoke fhat for did i let him write for us wy because he could write the verra blusterous epithets whichld make the enemy wince of course i went over all that he wrote though just to see that he was economically correct if i hadna have done that i might just as well have shut up shop but i was going to say comrades theres a ladyfriend of mine hes treated shamefulmade love to her while her man was alive borrowed twentypound notes of her had to be forbid the hoose and then fhen she was left a widdywumman with a family he cuts her dead at a picturegallery thats fhat i mean by ungrateful the swine fit to make a man retch with his mumping cant what i was about to observeno shes

submit to him heres my plan comrades and if anyones got a better let him out with it or else for ever after hold his peace and stand out of the way of them that has comrades the hour has struck when tyranny will be no more for ive got the tyrant between ma legs and am going to squeeze him off my own bat supposing as im properly supported cautious though very cautious we must be for rose fhen i knew him was fine and slippery artful eeeeeeh dinna ye talk about his artfulness aye and proud too he was the most haughty dont care sort of chap ye can think i mind his eyes were like lowin coals

and a brush up and go out of an afternoon looking as smart as you please in his old clothes and with a fag always in his mouth like the masher he is that fag ill let ye know it was aye the same fag he hadna used to light it ever he lit it once and put it out directly after and then he used to stick it in his face every afternoon and shew himself as usual so that no one should know he hadna had a bit fhite fish na naething to ca a moothfu o fleshers meat wi his piece the week past he felled it me himsel when i got to know him and now comrades theres that feller sitting on the seven hills of rome with three gold crowns on his head as has been put in the papers damning us for all hes worth comrades fhat i wish to call the attention of this meeting to this evening isill just speir if ye think that rose should like to have his past life gave away by me and my ladyfriend mrs crowe her name is jerry paused for a reply and realized that he had possession of the meetings ear he mopped the lumps on his forehead helped himself out of the chairmans whiskeybottle gulped a dram and continued his assumption of the rhetorical manner was consciously enormous now comrades as in the east when the golden light of dawn shews that sunrise is about to come so this poor feeble voice of mine shews that the tyrants thrones are tottering to their overthrow but comrades we maun beware snares beset our path once we have let oursels be caught by his infernal jesuitical machinations and he has scornfully crrrushed us to the earth this is how labor is treated and thus shall labor be treated as long as we go cap in hand and ask for our rights instead of demanding them and taking them as comrade matchwood says in the salpinx comrades this time we maun conquer or expire if we want the former we must fight our enemy with his own tools fhat are his tools comrades his tools are jesuitical tory tools his emissaries are everywhere his spies beset our path on every hand i should say infest our road even in this hall tonight a tory eye may be upon us a jesuitical ear may be protruded to catch these whispers falling from this feeble tongue and pass them on to that archpariah in rome who is drunk with the blood of workingmen and battened on unearned increment comrades we maun take a leaf out of his book we maun hoist him up on his own jesuitical petard we oursels maun become jesuitical for the sake of the cause comrades there in rome sits the abominable desolation and ill let ye know yell find him fhat ye may call a fikey customer day by day his satellites prostrate their forms before his socalled holy toe and let him know a things which theyve found out by base and underhand sneaking means that is whit way he is so powerful his slaves tell him so much that he knows everything look fhat with an entire lack of consistency he said about the salpinx could he have said that if he hadna been informed no i repeat a thousand times no comrades we maun do the same he knows our secrets and uses them against us most unfair we maun worm his out too and use them to bend his proud knee to the peoples will comrades i me know his secrets i am the man and mrs crowe is the woman fhat shall shame him before all his silken harems and cardinals and potentatesupset his applecart if i may use a colloquious impression we only have got to show the despot our two faces and ill let ye know hell quail as sures death we shant need say a word at the mere sight of me and my ladyfriend the monsterll howl for mercy then we will be able to have our revenge for his recent most insulting remarks we will dictate fhat he shall have to do to win our favour all the starch and haughtiness shall go out of him like steam out of a toddyjug when he sees us two and he shall pay any price to gain our smile and then ill let you know what my plans are comrades were agreed arent we that the only way in which the cause can triumph over capital is by having a labor majority in the house of commons fhat i mean by that is this at that magnificent demonstration of labors irresistible electoral might in the words of the salpinx we can make the tories and our friends the liberals pass our bills to pay us our proper salaries and we will wrestle from the reluctant rich the mines and the railways and the mills and all the paying industries and we shall even nationalize the land itself which our bloated aristocracy have robbed us of and mafficked in and wallowed in our gore comrades i shall not detain you much longer for i see the hour is getting on fhat i mean to say is this is the point there are in this great britain and ireland of ours the night no less than deluded papists with parliamentary votes i obtained those figures carefully from statistics you have to be careful about details like this if you mean to do yersel any good at a now comrades all those papists shall gladly drop their votes into candidates ballot boxes which will be put forward by the liblab fellowship they shall do it at one word from their pope at one penstroke of his such is the besotted state of slavery in which they exist refuse they dare not or they should languish in the horrors of the spanish inquisition or light the fires of smithfield and the massacres of the socalled saint bartholomew comrades it is that one word and penstroke which the sight of me and mrs crowe shall squeeze out of their haughty pope wed better have a proper deputation to go to wait on him with us for safetys sake and happen wed better have a sort of address to present explaining how matters stand just to make things look pleasant and polite as it were thats only a matter of form though the main thingll be to see him fall back toes over tip on his judgmentseat like him as was struck with worms when he sees whos in the deputation laugh i wont ever have laughed like i will laugh at him then well now comrades ive said my say and i say no more leaving the matter to your esteemed consideration comrades think of all the insults which he and his myrmidons has made us groan under so long revenge is now at your disposal this weak hand of mine has pointed out whit way seize it oh seize it in the name of freedom is all i ask for myself i ask nothing not a penny if you was to offer it me comrades im fighting for the cause for the cause id give my life as far as in me lies thats my aim thats my game as the poet remarks comrades i shall not detain you longer i shall now sit down and the raucous gentleman panted into the next fellowshippers chair chapter x dear mrs crowe secret and confidential please burn it when you have concluded reading referring to our numerous enjoyable conversations on the subject of socialism in which you have evinced entire acquiescence i am directed by the council of the liblab fellowship to call your attention to the advantages obtainable from comradeship as per enclosed the entrance fee is two and six and the subscription five shillings per ann payable in june and dec i may add that those are special terms which i have exerted my influence to obtain in your favour and i trust i shall meet with your esteemed approval would you decide to join kindly notify me of the same per wire for wh i enclose six stamps yes or no will answer all purposes but personally i feel sure that it shall be yes on receipt of your anticipated favour will at once propose and have you seconded at our evening meeting to take place on the night of the same day when you get this letter should your reply be in the affirmative i am to let you know that you shall at once be nominated as a member of a deputation which i have the honour to be a member of as well which is about to proceed to rome for the purpose of diplomatically interviewing our mutual friend the pope the expenses of the trip will be borne by the liblab funds so there is no need to worry on that score you are aware that travel especially to such a famous town as rome is considered advantageous in every respect the italian sky the numerous old ancient edifices and the romans themselves in their native monasteries cannot fail to amuse the eye of the beholder the excursion is entirely gratis and so that difficulty is removed but in addition to what i have said there is also the prospect of renewing our acquaintance with his socalled holiness and i may say for certain of having private interviews with him in the innermost recesses of his haunts more i shall not now add the mission of the deputation is strictly diplomatic and connected with political affairs and i am of course not at liberty to divulge the details to anyone but fellowshippers it would be hardly prudent ah would that you dear mrs crowe was one but i may without any breach of confidence inform you in the strictest confidence that rose alias hadrian is in our power and therefore putting politics out of the question it shall go hard if you and me cannot do a little private business with him on our own account hoping to hear from you soon as per enclosed blank form and thanking you in anticipation i remain yours truly in the cause i hope jeremiah sant ps now burn this without fail sants ladyfriend sat at the breakfast table pondering this letter while her kidney grew cold the four lodgers were gone to business and she was alone except for the presence of her son he was one of those beautiful speechless coweyed youths who seem born to serve as butts most people exercise some influence assert some personal note alaric crowe did neither a course of female rule had produced him with about as much individuality as a cushion he ate his breakfast in delicate silence his mother was wrapt in thought she found sants letter delectable the consuming passion of her whole life was for george arthur rose next to him she desired fame notoriety as a leader in suburban literary and artistic circles by perseverance an undeniable amount of clever organizing power a certain stock of third or fourth class talent and any quantity of push she had established a sort of salon where little lions hebdomadally roared but she never had won the faintest regard from the man for whom she burned the violence of her passion had caused her to make an irremediable mistake with him she had not realized the feline temper which had caused him to repel advances as obvious as abrupt and as shameless as a dogs he had ceased to be aware of her existence then she had blundered further still ignorant of his peculiarity she had treated him as the female animal treats the male of her desire finding him unapproachable by blandishments she had turned to persecution she would make him come to her and beg here she also failed in vain did she defame him to her followers in vain did she libel him to the publishers from whom he earned his scanty subsistence in vain did she force herself upon his few friends with stories of his evil deeds he let those who listened to her leave him he tolerated the illwill or stupidity of barabbas he never said a word in his own defence and he kept her severely and entirely at a distance giving no sign that he even knew of her manuvres it was galling to the last degree of course he was egregiously wrong neither in woes nor in welcome prosperity may i be associated with women for when they prevail one cannot tolerate their audacity and when they are frightened they are a still greater mischief to their house and their city his feeling to women was that of eteokles in the seven against thebes it caused him to make the tremendous mistake of his life a woman of this colour never can be neglected she must be takenor smashed that he knew but he would not take her ever and a certain chivalrous delicacy mingled with a certain mercifulness of heart and a certain fastidious shrinking from a loathsome object prevented him from prosecuting her with the rigour of the law wrong must thou do or wrong must suffer then grant o blind dumb gods that we rather the sufferers than the doers be expressed his attitude it annoyed himself it made her fierce and furibund and it was absolutely futileand now he had leaped at a bound from impotent lonely penury to the terrible altitude of peters throne he was famous mighty rich and the idol of her adoration despite the great gulph fixed between her insignificance and his supremacy oh what would she not givefor a curse for a blow from him the emotion thrilled and dazzled her not one hour during twelve years had she been without the thought of him it was a case of complete obcession her daughter flowed into the room in a pink wrapper finishing a florid cadenza a touch on the teapot and a glance under the dishcover revealed astringent and coagulate tepidity she rang the bell mother why arent you eating any breakfast i am eating it i only just stopped a minute to read my letters a pretty long minute i should think everythings stonecold why youve only got one letter whos it from mr sant he wants me to go to rome with him oh mother you cant you know im sure i dont know anything of the kind in fact i think i will go therell be a party of us well if its a party but whats going to become of the house im sure big ann is capable of looking after the house amelia if i cant have a fortnights holiday now and then i might just as well go and drown myself im sick to death of oriel street i want to go about a bit yes i will go and the house must get on the best way it can anybody would think you were all a pack of machines that wouldnt work if im not here to wind you up oh all right mother go and have a fling by all means if you like but what about the cost im sure i cant help you as long as i only get these threeguinea engagements and i simply cant wear that eaudenil again the bodice is quite gone under the arms youre not asked to help mr sant pays all expenses and amelia if i can do what im going to try to do you shall have as many new frocks as you can wear were going to see the pope going to see the pope yes you silly girlthe poperose what do you mean just what i say but you cant nonsense of course i can well i mean of course you can see him the same as other people do but youll be in the crowd and he i cant understand you at all this morning lets look at sants letter how vilely the man writes like a you dont mean to say youll join these people mymym yes i see the gameyesbut dyou think you really couldwell if you like the idea still its worth trying anyhowsilly little mother why i believe youre in love with rose even now ah youre blushing mother you look a dear like that amelia dont be stupid mind your own business oh im not going to interfere you neednt be jealous of me im sure i never saw anything particular in him myself they spoke as though they were alone alaric went quite unnoted he folded his napkin and rose from the table aand mother he mooed slowly with a slight hesitation in a virginal baritone voice resonant and low if you go to rome dont be nasty to mr rose both the women whirled round toward him they hardly could have been astounded if the kidneys had commented on their complexions alaric how dare you sir aand i only say if you go to rome i hope you wont be nasty to mr rose did you ever hear such nonsense amelia why not i should like to know aand he taught me to swim so he did me at least he tried to and what of that snapped the girl aand i dont think its fair i liked him aand father liked him yes indeed hes just the sort of man your father would have liked unfortunately he liked that sonnetman too a pretty kind of person all i can say is alaric if i were to let you see the letters ive got of his and the albums full but there you dont know as much as i do about your father the boy bellowed aand dont you dare say anything against father i wont stand it amelia knows i wont stand it from her and i wont from anyone not even from you mother i wont i tell you ill go right away if i have another word mother im sorry but you oughtnt aand i dont want you to be nasty to mr rose because i liked him aand father liked him concluded alaric departing mother and daughter looked at each other whod have expected alaric to burst out like that im sure its very hard after all ive gone through to have my own children turning against me i am not turning against you mother i thinkwell of course i cant see why you care for rose but if you do youd be a fool to miss a chance like this what does mr sant mean about having him in his power i dont quite know i suppose georgie must have got himself entangled with these people somehow and they think he wouldnt like it to come out thats very possible hes been mixed up with several shady characters in his time however we shall see amelia do you know what ive been thinking that mauve frock of my aunt sarahsnow i believe i could make that up for myself for evenings and save a new one you know its lovely silk you cant get anything as good as that anywhere nowadays what the one with the fringe well isnt fringe coming in again now i think i know how to use every bit of it the only difficulty ll be with the sleeves i wish someone would invent a sleeve that only covers the lower part of ones arms you see the best part of mines about the shoulders why dont you simply carry the fringe over the shoulders like straps and wear long gloves yes of course i might do that and amelia i really must have a new transformation all things considered i think i will go to du schob and hamingills for it this time im afraid theyre rather dear but when you look what a chance this is and how much depends then theres another reason why i should go people are beginning to neglect our wednesdays well now if i go to rome with these whatshisnames its sure to be in the papers and then when i come back all our old friends are sure to want to know so this precious pair of wouldbe blackmailers accompanied the deputation from the liblab fellowship to gods vicegerent much of the formality prescribed for pontifical audiences had fallen into abeyance hadrian received ambassadors or personages with various degrees of ceremony but almost every day he was to be found pacing to and fro in the portico of st peters and then he was accessible to all the world when however the socialists applied for an audience it was intimated that the supreme pontiff would deign to receive them at ten oclock on the following morning and the vatican officials were instructed that the reception would be carried out with full state it was george arthur roses birthday for twenty years no one had cared to remember it now there were scores who cared and none who dared hadrian was more remote than george arthur rose had been a nervous little group of twenty obvious plebeians male and female awaited him in the ducal hall superb chamberlains shewed them the door by which the pope would enter and instructed them to approach the throne when he should have taken his seat the great red curtains at the end of the hall were drawnback and cardinals prelates guards and chamberlains flowedin like a wave whose white crest was hadrian as the procession passed sant growled to mrs crowe does himself well dont he oh isnt he just splendid she yapped then chamberlains manuvred the liblabs into position at the foot of the throne steps jerry by common consent had been chosen spokesman and the united intellect of the fellowship had drawn up the address which he with ostentatious calmness began to read the popes ringed hand lay on his knee his left elbow rested on the crimson chair and the hand supported the keen unfathomable face he had prepared his plans but he alertly was listening lest unforeseen necessity for alteration should arise he was watching with halfshut eyes and wideopen mind for an opportunity none came his prevision had been singularly accurate the liblab fellowship really had nothing to say to him beyond turgid sesquipedalian verbosity expressive of its own disinterestedness and fulsome adulation calculated according to the fellowshippers lights to tickle the conceit of any average man it would have been funny if it had not been terribly tiresome impertinent if it had not been pitiable sants tongue clacked on his drying palate to himself his voice sounded quite strange in that atmosphere of splendid colour and fragrant odour mrs crowe quivered and wondered the others were in a torpor no one listened to the reader except the pope the curia rustled and whispered exchanging jewelled snuffboxes the guards resembled tinted statues tipped with steel we have the honour to remain in the cause of humanity concluded jerry sant reciting the commonplace names of the signatories on behalf of the liblab fellowship he refolded the foolscap sheets and drew them through his fingers looking as though he were about to hand them with a flourish to the pope a frilled blackvelvet flunkey took them from him gave them to a purple prelate who passed them to a vermilion cardinal who kneeled and presented them the stately cardinal van kristen moved from the side presenting a second manuscript hadrian unfolded it and began to read his reply it was courteous and concise distant and independent simply an allocution on the distinction necessary to be drawn between demagogues and demos the worthiness of the latter the doubtfulness of the former at the end there was a silence chamberlains discreetly made it known to the fellowshippers that homage might be rendered by any who desired to render it and gave instructions as to the customary manner twelve of the demagogues preferred a noncommittal pose having fear of the snorts of the salpinx and of these two found it convenient to glare uncompromisingly letting it be seen that they regarded their host as the man of sin but eight approached the throne five of them bowed as over the counter one kneeled on one knee and read his makers name in his hat sant held his own elbows and looked along his nose and mrs crowe laid her lips on the cross goldembroidered on the pontiffs crimson shoe that was all these people were bewildered almost inebriated by the magnificence of the scene by the more than regal ceremonial by the immense psychical distance which divided them from the clean white exquisitely simple figure under the lofty canopy by the quiet fastidious voice purring unknown words from an unimagined world by the delphic splendour of apostolic benediction waved from the sedia gestatoria retiring in a pageant of flabellifers on leaving the vatican they were thoroughly dazed they knew not whether their diplomacy had been successful or unsuccessful jerry sant had an indistinct notion that he might expect to be summoned after nightfall and surreptitiously introduced to some pontifical hole or corner in order to be bribed mrs crowe exulted in a new emotion she actually had touched him and she thrilled and she was sure that this was only a beginning when hadrian was about to descend alone into st peters to say his night prayers he observed one of his gentlemen practising a new and curious gymnastic in the first antechamber sir iulo was in solitude and he did not hear the feline footfall which came near he had a longish knife in his right hand held behind his back then with his teeth clenched and his eyes firmly fixed on an imaginary pair of eyes in front of him and every sinew of him at its tensest he suddenly whipped hand and knife facehigh to the front hiltupward down to arms length and forwardup again pointupward all with frightful force and rapidity hadrian watched him during five performances then sir iulo became aware of the presence and relaxed into upright stillness grinning and glittering what is this game the pope enquired not game but for the protection of you protection protection from what from those most horrible peoples who have been today here pursuing some vendettaccia do you mean those liblabs but yes those libberlabberersser especially a libberlabber who has read and a shelibberlabber who goes with him it is i who have seen of them both the eye from which i vibrate a knife most commodious for the bellies of those his holiness can rest secure do you mean that you are going to rip them up but yes in the manner which i have learned of the chef from naples now i watch them when i shall have seen them make a movement behold the tripes of them sliced precipitatissimamente iulo no understand no there is not of dishonour first like this i demonstrate the knifethey view the mode of their deaths there is in it nothing of sly next i give them the death which they have merit that is not the deed of a dishonourable you are commanded not to give deathnot to think of giving death it is prohibited o viniti quo vadis understand bury the knife in the garden sotterratelo nel giardino vinizio mio capisce break it first then bury it in the garden if you wish to be protector of hadrian learn to fight with fistspugni understand tell john to buy a punchingbagpunchingbagand practise on that bai a punnertchingerbagger repeated the devout murdererinposse with disappointment as the pope left him limp a sign drew cardinal van kristen to walk by hadrians side on the return from san pietro and vincula on lammas day from time to time his shy grand eyes turned to the pope as they rhythmically paced along from time to time a blessing fluttered from the apostles hand to some stranger by the roadside holiness at length he said do you remember the saint you used to worship on this day at maryvale hadrian detached himself from a reverie little saint hugh fancy your remembering that and he again dived into silence one would hardly fail to remember anything you said or did in those days holy father the pope said nothing he was thinking of something else i put the picture you painted of little saint hugh up in our refectory at dynam house no answer came the cardinals long eyelashes lifted a little as he looked at his companion he was not sure that his attempt at conversation was welcome your holiness does not care to be reminded perhaps i did not mean to intrude sorry hadrian put out a hand no percy you dont intrude we were wondering how long this king is going to be which king italy oh yes things are at a standstill for example everythingat least in italyas long as something better than sulky peace is lacking we want friendship collaboration see whether you can follow this the personal influence of his majesty is enormous although his acts are quite constitutional yet such is his magnetic force of character that he actually rules no matter which party is in power the kings majesty rules practically he is an autocrat and he so far has not made a single mistake nor done a single unjust or even ungenerous deed now we also have some power some personal influence these people seem to like us theyre charmingly polite they run about after us we do not doubt but that they would obey if we commandedif we ordained that no woman should cover her hair with a terrible handkerchief when she goes into a churchif we substituted silver sand for those abominably insane sponges in the holywater fonts for examplebut how many of them would obey us if we ordered them to cease from drying their linen at their windows or to stop spitting do you follow no holiness our influence is over particulars is sentimental is ideal the influence of the kings majesty is over universals is practical is real yes i see that well then you mean that your influence and the kings could do a great deal more for this dear delightful country than do you think that this king knows of your desire for reconciliation victor emanuel is one of the four cleverest men in the world it is impossible that he should not have understood the regnum meum besides we addressed him by name he owes us the civility of a response holiness let me have that news conveyed to him guido attendolo no we ourself have not yet seen clearly the next move we believe that his majesty of his own initiative ought to have approached usthe son to the fatherbefore now we have given him a token of our goodwill there the matter rests he cannot have a doubt as to what our purpose is buthis majesty must do as he pleases we think that we have done our part so far at present we are not moved to proceed further when we are movedand that is what occupies us now an idea seems to be forming in our mind but as yet percy do ask our friends to tea in the garden of the pinecone at halfpast sixteen oclock today the same afternoon after siesta hadrian sat at one end of the great whitemarble arcshaped seat a yard away sixteen cardinals spread their vermilion along the same seat little tables stood before them with tea goats milk triscuits and raisins the pope preferred to sit here where the pavement was of marble because lizards avoided it and their creepycrawly jerks on grass or gravel shocked his nerves he was sure that reptiles were diabolical and unclean and his taste was for the angelic and the clean he smoked a cigarette and flung a subject to his court as one flings corn to chickens was not the question of requiems for noncatholics settled two or three years ago replied courtleigh yes said talacryn it was declared impossible profane inconsistent why hadrians predilection was for the inconsistent rather than for that undevelopable fossil which goes by the name of consistency it would be inconsistent holiness for the church to proclaim by the most solemn act of her ministry as a child submissive to her one who always refused or certainly never consented to recognise her as a motherone who while alive would have rejected any such recognition as a grave insult and an irreparable misfortune talacryn responded i dont follow your eminency said whitehead its eloquentbut its only eloquence isnt cardinal talacryn rather begging the question holiness leighton enquired who spoke of proclaiming as a submissive child one who never was submissive holy mass is the public and solemn testimony of visible communion the tessera communionis if i may use the term and therefore the church can only offer publicly for those who have departed this life as members of that visible communion talacryn persisted holy mass is a great deal more than that interjected carvale yes holiness it is not for me to tell cardinal talacryn that holy mass is not only a sacrament for the sanctification of souls but a sacrificethe real sacrifice of calvary offered by our divine redeemer and pleaded in his name by us his vicars it is not another sacrifice but the sacrifice of the cross applied it is the clean oblation offered to god for all christians quick and dead for all for whom christ died would not the bonafides of the noncatholic in question come in said semphill take for instance the divine victoria divine queried della volta yes divine you say divus julius and divus calixtus meaning the late julius and the late calixtus very well then i say the divine victoria for a more thoroughly worthy woman well but that would mean that on the death of such and such a noncatholic we should have to institute a process of inquisition and adjudicate on his or her life and career ferraio ventured hadrian threw his cigaretteend at a lizard on the gravel and laughed shortly pippetypew me mammy me slew me daddy me ate me sister kate gathered a me baines he quoted with deliciously feline inconsequence how you theological people do split straws to be sure go on though youre intensely interesting the patriarch of lisbon slapped his knee holiness there are several decrees which are supposed to bear on the subject gentilotto gently put in can your eminency remember them innocent iii ruled that communion might not be held with those deceased with whom it had not been held when they were alive i concede it but it doesnt touch the point i distinguish holy mass is more than mere communion besides we dont communicate with but on behalf of the deceased its not a concession to the deceased its our duty to god and to our neighbour carvale persisted then there was the case of gregory xvi and queen caroline of bavaria gentilotto continued the argument is the same but perhaps it has been expanded a little it definitely prohibits persons who have died in the eternal and notorious profession of heresy from being honoured with catholic rites another point occurs to me talacryn went on supposing that we sing requiems for noncatholics we should imply that one religion is as good as another i guess i deny the consequence grace retorted of course people would infer all sorts of things which ought not to be inferred but i cant see that that need concern us one might imperil the salient and sacred aloofness which marks off gods work from mans work the churchs unmistakeable contrast to the whole world said the cardinal of st nicholasinthejailoftully and her complete discordance from the world by all the difference which separates the divine institution from the human the church of god from the churches of men saviolli appended all the same i think i go with the cardinal of st cosmas and st damian said mundo there would not be any real ground sterling continued for suspecting one of disloyalty to the church if one were to recognize the invincibly ignorant as the other sheep which his holiness mentioned in his first epistle one is not going to take part in their worship or frequent their services because one knows better and one is not going to accept the principle of a conglomerate church of the commonchristianity type any more than one is going to accept an olympos of gods for a divinity but one confesses that one can see no reason why one should not pray for outsiders offer mass for outsiders recognize them in short as his holiness seems to ordain they dont know us and naturally they invent a caricature of us as things are yes on the whole perhaps one ought to support carvale well if were taking sides ill follow you said semphill their eminencies rose and surrounded cardinal carvale talacryn was left alone at the other end of the seat and percy moved a few inches nearer to the pope now percy said talacryn with invitation the youngest cardinal shook his grand head in the negative and will not you yourself join the majority hadrian inquired of the single minority i shall follow your holiness talacryn answered the others looked their interest the pope smiled note please that we are not uttering infallible dogma but the fallible opinion of a private clergyman weakkneed perhaps or worldly we know no more than thisthat christ died for all men rising he began to throw on his white cloak for it was the hour before sunset and the air was cooler eminencies he continued we learn much from you this discussion was an accident due to our negligence the case which we intended to submit to you was not the case of an outsider but while you have been talking we have reached the solution of our problem by another road we request you immediately to publish the news that tomorrow at ten oclock the supreme pontiff will sing a requiem in st peters for the repose of the soul of umberto the fearless king of italy an english catholic painter came to paint the popes portrait hadrian knew him for a vulgar and officious liar detested him and at the first application had refused to sit to him his holiness was not at all in love with his own aspect it annoyed him because it just missed the ideal which he admired and he did not want to be perpetuated also he loathed the cads herkomeresquecumcamera esque technique and his quite earthy imagination from that palette the spiritual the intellectual the noble could not come but he thought of the mans pinched asking face of his dreadful nagging wife of his childrenof the rejection of all his pictures by the academy this year of the fact that he was being supplanted by younger grander minds ousted from livelihood horrible love your enemies ouf the pontiff would give six sittings of one hour each on condition that he might read all the time the privilege alone was an inestimable advertisement alfred elms looked upon himself as likely to become the fashion hadrian sat in the garden for six siestas and he read in platos phaidn which is the perfection of human language until his lineaments were composed in an expression of keen gentle fastidious rapture elmss professional efforts at conversation were annulled quietly and incisively the pope blessed him and handfuls of rosaries at the end of every sitting sometimes his holiness was so elated with the beauty of the greek of his book that he even was able with a little selfcompulsion to utter a few kindly and intelligent criticisms of the painters work that was startlingly real mirrorlike the varied whiteness of marble and flannel and vellum and the healthy pallor of flesh gained purity from the notes of the reddishbrown hair and the translucent violet of the amethyst the clean light of the thing was admirably rendered the painter could delineate and tint with his hand that which his eyes beheld with blameless accuracy what his eyes did not see the soul the mind the habit of his model he as accurately omitted hadrian made him glad with a compliment on the perfection of the connection between his directive brain and his executive fingers at the end of the last sitting also he gave him two hundred pounds and the picture and a written indulgence in the hour of death the painter went away quite happy and with his fortune made he never knew how vehemently his work was detested how profoundly he himself was scorned august was deliciously warm the pope moved the court for a few weeks to the palace on the nemorensian lake which the prince of cinthyanum lent it was a vast barrack of a palace although three sides of it actually were in the little city and a public thoroughfare pierced its central archway yet it suited hadrian admirably approached through numerous antechambers and picturegalleries there was a huge room frescoed in simulation of a princely tent here they placed a throne for receptions there was a great balcony high above the porch facing a twomile avenue of elms when the faithful congregated as they often did the pope could shew himself there were innumerable chambers of state and private suites where the curial cardinals took up their abode but high on the fourth side of the palace with no access except by several little private stairs hadrian found an apartment of five small rooms which was quite secluded from its windows the palace stood on the crest of the cliff a stone might be dropped into the fathomless lake three hundred feet below and beyond the lake the eye soared to dianas forest of oaks and the spurs of the alban mount a private stair and passage led to the incomparable and almost unknown gardens which crowned the rocks with verdure and descended by winding paths to the mirrored waters of the lake here the pontiff established himself with the noise of the world of men and its limitations on the one side and on the other quiet and illimitable space wherein the soul might spread wings and explore the empyrean halfway down the cliff a little ruined shrine stood in the garden the broken greybrown tracery of the window framed an exquisite panorama of water and distant hills brilliantly blue and green the nook stood away from the main path and was quite enclosed by sunkissed foliage and canopied with vines and ivy hadrian was spending a morning here alone with cigarettes and the epinikia of pindaros and his thoughts the air was fragrant with the perfume of southernwood and the generous sun he rested in a low canechair soaking himself in light and peace his eyes were turned to the far distant shore where the great grove of ilex cast deep tralucid shadows in the water a tiny slip of pink shot from sunlight to shade another followed two tiny splashes of silver spray arose and vanished two blueblack dots appeared in the rippled mirror hadrian envied the young swimmers he remembered all the wild unfettered boundless sensuous joy of only a little while ago was the fisherman still down there with his boat and the brown boy who rowed it he wondered what the world would say if the pope were to swim in sunlit nemior in moonlit ah the mild tepidity of moonlit water the clean cold caress of moonlit air not that he cared jot or tittle for what the world might saypersonally no but no if he were to ask for the use of the boat tongues would clack and he could not go alone with the deliberate intention stilldidnt peter swim in galilee werent the attendolo gardens private some night he might stroll down to the shore the water was fathomless at once there need be no wading with the ripples horribly creeping up ones fleshyaff but the toads on the path and the lizards and the serpents in the grassoh no then thus it must be the pope must not go to seek his pleasure if god should deign to afford his vicegerent the recreation of swimming an opportunity would be provided otherwise little footsteps pattered down the glade his retreat was about to be invaded three children burst through the shrubsand stood transfixed they were a couple of blackeyed blackhaired girls and a very palecoloured very delicatelyarticulated slim and stalwart babyboy with darkstarlike eyes and brows superbly drawn all hadrians fearful terror of children paralyzed him these limpid glances made him feel such a hackneyed old sinner but he shewed no outward tremor looking gently and genially at his visitors and wondering what in the name of all the gods he ought to say or do three nurses and an athletic tailormade lady added their presence a thousand pardons sir a nurse exclaimedo santissimo padresix knees flopped on the ground missy the boy announced i have found a white father why have i seen a white father before never his utterance was very deliberate and his english quite devoid of accented syllables the tailormade lady rose to the occasion with an intuition which only could be feminine and a selfpossession which only could be english she bowed to the pope saying your holiness will pardon the intrusion the children escaped us at the fork in the path but it is a pleasure hadrian hypocritically put in it is a pleasure he repeated seeing that she was about to withdraw her charges and it would be a greater pleasure to know the names of these little ones the prince filiberto the princess yolanda and the princess mafalda the lady replied the queen is giving a childrens picnic in lady demochedes woods and we took the liberty of trespassing here in search of wildflowers of course we had no idea missy said the boy again i wish to speak to this white father he was standing with his exquisite fair little legs wideapart his little body splendidly poised and his glance was the glance of a young lion is it permitted hadrian inquired of the governess oh surely she assented with perfection of manner i wish to ask this white father whether he can speak english words like me the youngster proclaimed keeping at a distance until he had reconnoitred the position dont be silly berto of course he can this is papa inglese i think said the princess yolanda with the daintiest air of regality she was a very stately little person and quite aware of herself and her great black eyes were wonderful her younger sister sucked a silent thumb then i wish to know whether i may kiss that ringthe big one i always kiss rings when fathers wear them her brother continued he quite ingenuously offered his little token of regard giving reasons for the same in the manner of one who is too noble to take advantage of ignorance or even of blind goodnature hadrian had not the faintest notion of what to say he never in his life had spoken to a royal highness and the childhood of the child had tied his tongue he would not have hesitated for one moment to converse with an angel indeed he would have been rather more than garrulous but with a human baby boy he extended his right hand the princelet took it looked at it looked from the great gold littlepeterinaboat to the great amethyst and pondered them i think i will kiss them both he said at length the full soft roseleaf of his lips flitted from the pontifical to the episcopal ring he lifted his bright head and boldly looked into the popes eyes with a smile disclosing the most wonderful little teethwith a gaze which told of a pact of friendship sealed god bless you little boy said the apostle oh he can speak my english words the youngster shouted with delight yolanda come and kiss these rings and hear him say god bless you little boy againnogirl i mean missy dear with a sidelook at the governess the princess came forward like a lady and paid her respects her brother intently watched god bless you princess said the apostle oh but listen the prince of naples shrieked jumping up and down he knows all the words ezattually just like my own father he said to me boy and to yolanda princess now go you too mafalda and i will listen again the tiny maid went god bless you little princess the apostle said that is right the boy cried he said little princess because there he stopped a moment then white father why for have younowhy did not you say prince to me i am prince filiberto aged five quirinale rome do you know that white father yes prince but you are a boy well i think so also i am a sailor like uncle luigi cannot you see that white father do you know what thing is a sailor he stood by the chair leaning against hadrians knee deliciously rosily maritime in white flannel oh yes we know many sailors the pope responded are they english the question possessed importance his royal highness evidently was by way of verifying certain information most of them are english my father says that all good sailors are english or like english and are you a good sailor the pope switched the argument away from the majesty of italy for reasons but yes i am very good this morning but i always am a sailoreven when i amnot quite good the candid baby said with a little hesitation do you like being not quite good oh but yesi should say sometimes i think i like it then but not now noi do not like being not quite good he settled the matter like that and nobly lifted himself upon it wont you try to be a good sailor hadrian hated himself for preaching but such a chance to make a white mark on the heir to a throne but of course i always tryexcept and there seemed to be the difficulty the child drooped a little you always do try to be a good sailorand to give no trouble give no trouble what not to father the prince inquired as though the very notion clashed with his preconceived idea of the uses of fathers no not to your father nor to missy the round face became a little longer no never to ladies on any account to whom then may i give trouble if i may not give it to father nor to missy he felt that he had put a poser dont give it what not to anybody this was a matter a dreadful matter which anyhow must be pursued to the bitter end not to anybody the childs great brave eyes considered the apostle attentively then they wandered to his sisters to the governess to the nurses and came back again hadrian returned his gaze very gently quite inflexibly the boy must learn his lesson now prince filiberto pondered the novel doctrine from all his little points of view and at last he grasped the consequence like a man ah well then i suppose i had better keep it myself i am sorry that i gave it to you missy yesterday hadrian experienced the strangestpossible rigour of the throat another moment and something in him would have spoiled all he rose blessed his visitors and passed swiftly away through the trees to the left missy i am liking that white father when shall i see him again came after him in the incomparable voice of innocence he quickly went up the winding path along the private passage up the stairs to the terrace he dragged a chair out there and sat down god he exclaimed aloud with tremendous expiration to the wide expanse of water and earth and sky which yawned before him tears welled in his eyes and the constriction of his throat was relaxed he took his handkerchief from his sleeve thank heaven he was alone and he became calm and analytical and infinitely happy verses of melagros of gadara streamed through his mind our lady of desire brought me to thee theokles me to thee and delicatesandalled love hath stripped and strewed me at thy feet a lightningflash of his sweet beauty flames from his eyes he darteth hath love revealed a child who fighteth with thunderbolts the splendour of twin fires did scorch me through and through one flame indeed was from the sun and one was love from a childs eyes his ecstasy was admiration of the lovely little person and the noble little soul the clean and vivid candour the delicate proportion the pure tint aroused in him a desire to own the frank selfhood the unerring truth the courageous tranquillity of selfrenunciation aroused in him a sense of emulation he the supreme pontiff was prostrate before the seraphic majesty of the child and as though a curtain had been lifted he had a peep into the human heart now he thought that he could see and understand one cause perhaps the chief cause of human societythe ability to say this is mine mine for i did it he began to understand that the human mind must have external as well as internal operationand much beside as for himself he was making experiment of the first personal emotion of undiluted enjoyment of human society which he could remember then i can love after all he reflected though he mixed freely and absolutely independently with all men yet in the tender inner soul of him he shrank more shudderingly than ever from the contact every single act of urbanity of courtesy was a violent effort to him his feeling for his fellowcreatures was repugnance pure and simple but in the case of this yellowhaired mannikin there was a difference he would like to own such a radiant little piece of the divinehuman as that fair prince filiberto he would appreciate the honour and the joy of tending such a treasure but he could not seek and it never had been offered perhaps he would shrink if it were offered that was his peculiar nature had he ever wished to exert for intimate relations with anyone no plainly no he was a thing apart more he was a thing to be avoided he remembered how many times he aimlessly had strolled through london watching his species gambolling in piccadilly or at the marble arch on a sunday where the fierce lanky spiky sallow anarchist raved and the coy catholic barrister cracked correct jests out of a shiny black exercisebook and the brighteyed clean churcharmy youth spoke with genuine conviction he had moved through partnerseeking mobs everywhere lazily vigilantly studiously yet no one ever had addressed him he was seen he was avoided yes he was a thing apart that was his trouble andwhat did the boy sayi had better keep it myself the content of that saying was to hadrian just like a thunderbolt it was loveyes that was quintessential love from the clear eyes and the stainless lips of childhoodto keep ones troubles oneself for in that way one relieved others and the servant of the servants of god must he continued to sit in the sunlight in a sort of rapture the lake and the hills and the turquoise sky faded from his vision he was alone with his thoughts his ideals his soul after the noonangelus he went in to his solitary meal later in the afternoon when he had slept and washed and put on fresh garments he descended to chat with his court his demeanour was observed to be more warm more human his eyes had an unusual and more usual glow he did not seem to be so very very far away i guess the air of this village suits you holy father said young cardinal percy you look like twenty cents this evening yes the air is delicious enough but it is not the air hadrian narrated the incident of the morning ending and we have recognised in ourself a new and unknown power a perfectly strange capability we have made experience of a feeling whichwell which we supposeat any rate will pass forlove he plunged again into business he had noted three men for a purpose archbishop ilario della valla was a young and exquisitely polished prelate son of an ambassador thoroughly expert in the english language and habit signor gargouille grice was one of those nondescripts devoid of divine vocation who fondly are believed to occupy an important place at the pontifical court equivalent at least to the english office of lord chamberlain but which in reality is that of a flunkey prince guido attendolo was a young italian of very generous birth who as younger son of a younger son not overburdened with wealth led an inconspicuous impotent uninteresting life with the idea of giving these three a chance the pope dispatched them to america with the red hat for the american archbishop erin whom he named cardinalpresbyter of the title of st maryofthepeople it was merely an incident intended to keep them from stagnation to give them that scope which human nature must have if it is to do itself justice if it is not to become a public nuisance at the same time he was satisfied that the sympathy of the prelate the antiquity of the decurial chamberlain and the urbanity to say nothing of the perfect greek profile of the prince would recommend them as ambassadors from the oldest power to the newest nation on the arrival of the apostolic ablegate in new york hadrian published the epistle to the americans he praised their exuberant vigour and individualistic unconventionality while he warned them of their obligations to their race and of the evils of oligarchical tyranny he begged them not to live in the desperate hurry which was instanced in their carelessness in details he advised them not to be too proud to learn from the history of other nations dwelling on the principle of the intermittent tendency of human nature he pointed out that as effect is due to cause and as the scope and quantity of human ideas is very far from being illimitable so as human types recur human ideas and the situations produced by them are bound to recur yet he continued human nature itself when inspired by divine grace being so very fine and so very potent a force is capable of immense development it has will freewill which rightly directed can rule itself can control natural laws can dispose events wherefore he admonished the americans to divest themselves of juvenile arrogance and selfishness in order that having learned the causes which produce effects they might know the rules and play the game he spoke to them not only with the authority of his apostolature but with the affection of a comrade who wished to serve them from the experience inherited and acquired of a member of the older nations he concluded with delicious slyness the young ones think the old are fools the old ones know the young ones are america was openly delighted not only by the consideration which the pope shewed in addressing her next to england but by the pungent vivid validity of his remarks she said that he had a dead cinch on things that he was on to his job that as a skypilot he suited her to a gnats bristle and she began to regard him with close attention the death of francis joseph austrian emperor and king of hungary in september had its not unexpected consequences the confusion of europe was worse confounded by conflict between hungarian national sentiment and the pangermanic league francis josephs successor did not inspire his multilingual subjects with the same respectful devotion as that which had been paid to the old emperor on account of the triple prestige of his dignity his long reign his many sorrows hungary cried for a magyar king bohemia cried for a czech king russian poland also cried aloud for a polish king and german poland would have cried with her had she dared as it was she opened longing eyes and waited the germans of austria appealed to the german emperor to come to their aid and take them into his mailed fist the habsburgh dynasty was tottering servia was a small hell turkey and roumania viewed the prospect of germanys expansion with favour turkey because she found it easy to outwit the teuton roumania because the power by whose favour she existed was possessed by devils albania montenegro and greece strongly disapproved they prized their individual national existence and the idea of being reduced to dependency upon the gothic michael did not suit them the distracted state of austria and her inability to keep her obligations to germany and italy caused the lapse of the triple alliance yet italy made no sign and germany made no sign there was an interval of intense and silent vigilance hadrian read in the times that signor panciera italian ambassador at the court of st jamess was leaving town for rome for a few weeks cardinal fiamma soughtout his excellency and brought him privately and unofficially to the popes apartment his holiness was very happy to renew acquaintances with so genial and so solid and so trusty a man it was comparatively easy to love such an one the ambassador bowed and wondered what was expected the pope put it patently he was profoundly interested in affairs he pried into no secrets he did desire to collect facts and opinions from experts and secular statesmen the six ambassadors left to the vatican were sterile if signor panciera could see his way to converse of current events without betraying his sovereigns confidence but simply as between two men whose motives were pure and patriotic he would confer a favour upon or if he preferred it the other way he would render a service to the pope his excellency bowed in reciprocation of the honour privately noting that his holiness was concealing nothing and in fact was unable to conceal he thought that there would be no difficulty this was not a matter of diplomacy or statecraft the crystalline candour of the pope made him negligible as a statesman as a mere man he was charming perfectly transparent he wanted not statesecrets but the opinion of a manofaffairs upon affairs signor panciera was quite delighted the state of europe as revealed in the newspapers was passed under review his excellency thought that germany was looking east and west rather than elsewhere what could be expected naturally she would look that way where were her two natural enemies as for austriapeuha secondary matter austria would not be touched by germany as long as danger threatened from france and russia italy well italy now was independent no longer bound to germany and austria italys attitude was that of the lion on guard in the words of the immortal dante naturally hadrian interpolated italy would watch events and direct her policy in accordance with her interest but securely the ambassador responded the pontiff spoke of spain signor panciera chopped his right wrist with his left hand spain was finished portugal portugal was english england england was england the pope and the ambassador produced a smile apiece the one meant triumphant pride of race the other boundless and intelligent admiration hadrian swooped eastwards the balkan states his excellency began to discriminate that little group of separate sovereignties was very difficult he seemed to hesitate to pick his wordsof course the subject interested him very greatly the pope was quite singularly still now and again as his massive dark guest passed him in pacing he plumped in a question the balkan states signor panciera strode on toward the window as though seeking the response there came back began a reply returned to the window came back again with a fresh halfdozen of unilluminating words hadrian went to one of his cupboards took out two little brown bagatelleballs and placed them in the royal ambassadors hands your excellencys aid to conversation he purred with a recondite smile dont be discomposed all men have some trick of this kind ours is to play with our rings or to push up our glasses your friend fiamma plaits the fringe of his sash the cardinaldean strokes the motherofpearl disk which stands on his wig for the tonsure the secretary of state munches his new teeth and you like to click a pair of bagatelleballs if we rightly remember you were saying that that little group of separate sovereignties was very difficult because of their present autonomy clickclickclick went the balls on the brown palm and the ambassador tralated their clicking yes holiness for that reason but also i think because they are racially distinct from the nations with which they expect to be incorporated russia germany austria turkey for example click i think we may neglect russia yes in the case of roumania i think that roumanian sentiment has veered round toward germany well now let us ignore opinions and go to these racial differences of which you speak i am of opinion that the roumanian people find themselves in sympathy with the german peoples signor panciera persisted bulgaria then signor panciera took two or three journeys to the window and back vigorously clicking the balls holiness you do not ask for my opinion and i only can give you the speculations of an amateur ethnologist clickclick i have click i can tell you what my studies have taught meno more but that is most interesting signore we are all students some are anxious to learn some are not but both are better off than the man who knows that he has nothing more to learn tell us what your studies have taught you i really believe that the principalities south of the danube contain the descendants of those byzantines who were pushed northward by the incursion of turks in the fifteenth century why click first from physiognomy click second from the structure of their languages wonderful and you have noted points of similarity i will go further than that holiness i ought to say that my attention was attracted to this subject by my lord the king who you know deigned to marry a montenegrin princess his majesty used to speak much at one time on this point to me and also to the minister of public instruction that is signor cabelli surely we examined the matter for his majesty and our investigations all seemed to point to the fact that the turks in coming from asia swept across the byzantine empire in a westerly and northerly direction then examining the outlets and the fringes we found byzantine characteristics all along the northern boundary of turkey that is to say not in bulgaria which is slav but in albania herzegovina bosnia and montenegro and more we found them along the adriatic coast of italy your holiness will see that these places are of a contiguity which would render them likely refuges for the christians who fled before or were expelled by the muslim yes there is one thing more we found traces of an earlier migration than the byzantine we believe that in eastern italy from taranto to ortona and also in southern albania may be seen the lineal descendants of the athenians of perikles day but greece excellency holiness the greeks of today are degenerate from the dirtyknuckled laconians crossed with the ottoman infidel their conquistators that is splendid signore and it marches with an opinion which we formed some dozen years ago at least in regard to your italian greeks we have seen those with our own eyes in apulia for instance the elgin marbles have their living counterfeits the charcoalburners and the fishermen look as though they had stepped out of the frieze of the parthenon once we heard a fisherman summon his boy by the word pddyto give it an english form an italian would have cried putto but pddywhat vocative is that but pronounced as alkibiades would have pronounced it oh we see your point and is your lord the king still interested in the subject i believe that his majesty is intensely interested i hope i may venture to repeat the corroboration which your holiness has given me i am sure that his majesty by all means of course you merely will repeat the conversation you will not intrude us before the kings majesty in our apostolic character but merely your holinesss wish shall be respected but to resumewe agree to identify those states south of the danube with the byzantines in general and montenegro and south albania with the greeks in particular what about north albania click that is turkish all albania is turkish but south albania is christian and all albania christian and muslim reverences madonnapanagia lady of all they call her how very extraordinary well now let us take their present situation suppose signore panciera that we reverse our positions instead of hearing your opinion we will state ours and you shall comment on it is that fair is that agreeable most fair most agreeable i always learn from englishmen and i shall learn from your holiness good we believe that montenegro is happy and contented under the paternal rule of prince nicholas clickclickclick that is so holiness we hear that albania is shaping well under prince ghin kastriotis click a walk to the window and back and more clicks since the murder of abdul hamid and the erection of albania into a principality progress has been astounding the beautiful country click the splendid people are a prize to any ruler sultan ismail is the only cloud in the sky he does not approve of the loss of that slice of his empire but albania will take care of herself servia and her yearning for the restoration of the servian empire impossible a nation which murders two kings in four years cannot be an empire quite impossible bulgaria a country of heretics of the most notorious and dreadful kind atrocious brigands to a man ruled or rather not ruled by a foreigner who is a contemptible cur your holiness would propose the deposition of prince ferdinandan easy task now that russia has her hands fulland the annexation of bulgaria and servia by montenegro under the protection of italy clickclickclick there holiness we come to the ground of high politics clickclickclickclick one must walk very warily yes hadrian mewed until italy and germany have made up their minds the ambassador bowed please leave the bagatelleballs excellency and accept our thanks for your very agreeable conversation said the pope in giving an account of this interview to the king the ambassador concluded and sire his holiness spoke like an englishman oh did he said victor emanuel in what way majesty he was profound and limpid he was large and particular he was bold and careful basta go again as often as you please and let me hear more of this englishman with the favour of your majesty chapter xi the liblab deputation had returned to england but jerry sant and mrs crowe hung on at a decent little hotel in two shambles street which was convenient to the english quarter their idea was to wait for an opportunity to push their scheme of blackmail most of each day mrs crowe was in the square of st peters looking up at the vatican hoping for the apparition of hadrian at his window in the evenings she saw him walking to and fro on the steps of the basilica there always was something of a crowd there the poorest of the poor by the common consent of the most courteous of nations were placed in front and she used to see the pope giving words and gold to persons whom she deemed disreputable she would have sacrificed her new wig for one of those coins once she pushed into the front row and kneeled with the riffraff she heard a blind boy tell his miserable tale she heard the apostles gentle words and saw the munificent careless gift it was her turn she felt the distant inflexible eyes on her bent head god bless you daughter go in peace dropped on her and hadrian passed on the poor girl on her left bitterly weptthe policedoctor had refused her certificateher occupation was gonehadrians kind of charity did not appeal to mrs crowe she called it disgusting and highly improper to the table dhte there were several quaint visitors at the hotel nike they chiefly were english and they listened in silence with shy strange eyes when she vented her views afterwards though she used to find herself the recipient of the confidence of weird oldmaids and wornout matrons who drew her into corners of the garden away from the cabin where sant smoked and nervously whispered my dear im sure youll excuse me addressing you but i feel bound to say i think im right in saying that i owe everything to him whom youre speaking about i hope you dont mind me saying this but i feel sure you wouldnt wish to do anyone an injustice you see i used to know him years ago and i hardly know how to put it but a certain sum was named between us which would make me safe for life and just now since last april you see that very sum a regular income all my days my dear has come to me through the bank of england and i feel sure its him for there isnt another soul in the world able to do such a thing and my dear although of course i cant approve of the indiscriminate charity youve named i thought id just mention this to you because the fact is ive come here to try and see him and let him know how thankful i am tired wan clean men with corns on their rightmiddlefingers and jackets bulging along their lower edges addressed her as madam and mentioned similar experiences and when two straightlimbed straighteyed boys of sixteen twins orphans were fierce with the same story she began to feel uncomfortable envious that he should do these things for these scarecrows and nothing for her people avoided her and she was lonely sant and the cosmopolitan bagmen with whom he fraternized were no companions for her she expected something a little more select in the way of society she conceived the notion that she would stand a better chance of coming into contact with the pope by means of some of the english in rome andwould it not be as well if she became a catholic the hotelpeople told her that very few english were in rome they began to come in october and to go away in june july august september saw no english except at the colleges and a few residents she found her way to st andrea delle fratte where she had heard of some englishwomans tomb and saw no one who looked like an englishman she had the same experience at the church by the gpo then she discerned a little english affair in little sebastian street a convent of sorts and she made herself conspicuous to the sisters those good creatures were only too happy to discover a chatty englishwoman and when mrs crowe quite accidentally let out that she had known george arthur rose they precipitately produced candied fruit and orangeade mrs crowe gossiped with discretion she won hearts by listening attentively to monasterial rhapsodies when she was permitted to slip in a word edgeways she took care that it was a telling word in all their lives the sisters never had heard anything so edifying as her description of the holy fathers former predilection for white flannel shirts white knitted socks and nightcaps they thought it heavenly of him to have refused to wear any colours but white or black while he was living in the world and the details of a black corduroy shootingsuit filled them with ecstatic rapture in the course of these improving conversations it came out that mrs crowe herself was an agnostican unwilling agnostic she whinedoh if only she could believe what her audience believed it would be such a comfort to her naturally the sisters gladly would help her to that kind of comfort they gave her an aluminium medal and promised prayers she turnedup regularly at mass and benediction and they had great hopes of her she thanked them so much now wouldnt she just like to have a little talk with father dawkinssuch a holy man she would like nothing better she had a little talk with father dawkins that is to say that frequently during the next few weeks his reverency exhorted for threequarters of an hour on end in the convent parlour and she punctuated his discourses with ah yes how true why did i never hear this before etc the sisters lent her thresholds and other violently cerulean books she pronounced them quite convincing and then she asked to be received into the church she became seen at parties at the english pensions and duly was slavered she met cardinals and prelates at receptions she was the excitement of the moment her pose of the interesting widow fond mother of the dearest little girl and boy clever writer of vers de socit in the maid and matron was much commended but it was as the woman whose dear departed had been the holy fathers most intimate friend that she chiefly scored for his holiness she always had had the highest admiration he had been a peculiar man certainly but never anything but most distinguished she remembered him in poverty going in the shabbiest of garbs but his gait and carriage always had been the gait and carriage of nobility of soul at all times she herself had predicted some extraordinary fate for him she told the most adorable little stories of his wit his humour his pathos and his dumbbells she dilated on a boil which had afflicted the back of his neck she had heard that he slept in glycerined gloves for the softening of his chapped hands yes he had been quite a friend of theirs he was so earnest so brilliant so learned that she never had been able to understand why a man of his ability should be a catholic of course that was when she herself had been in outer darkness now that she was in the inner light she perfectly could see why mrs crowe was voted to be a very charming person and became a great success sant approved of her procedure neither he nor she could see their way to another direct approach to hadrian they must bide a wee meanwhile no harm was done and much good might be done by cultivating the english quarter and perhaps it would be as well to keep socialism in the background for the present jerry would stay where he was and she had better setup for herself elsewhere they occasionally could meet to compare notes and if anything particular happed why they could write so mrs crowe took a little flat on baboon street and displayed herself at the spain square teashop and the english sisterhood at the back of her brain there was a welldefined desire she kept it there to gloat over in private and at intervals for she was far too clever a woman to let her passion master her at this stage it was the mainspring of her acts the goal of her thoughts the ultimate of her existence but she kept it well concealed and controlled now and then in the lonely depth of night it surged to her oppression but dawn and the respectability of her temper brought it within bounds she played a careful game adding to her counters as opportunity occurred she had the liblabs and their four pounds a week to support her she had what she called the secret history of the pope in her possession she was capturing the pious english and then one evening she acquired quite a priceless item of scandal which sooner or later she would use for the procuration of her georgie she had been wandering about alone in some of those new streets on the viminal hill which modern rome built in imitation of the suburban residences of british merchants streets where comfortable redbrick detached mansions stand each in a railed garden as she was passing one of these fine but homely residences the electric light sprang up in the drawingroom and she was aware of three figures seated in the baywindow an afternoonteatable was between them they were two gorgeous white women with fair hair evidently mother and daughter those she did not know but the third was george arthur rose she peered between the gilded bronze bars of the gate it was dusk no one but herself was in the street and there not twenty yards away behind a pane of glass was the man she worshipped she gave up herself to her emotions during one minute then he and the women retired to the back of the room and a decorous blackcoated lacquey closed the curtains for a moment she felt like battering at the gate her heart violently palpitated the connotation of the experience suddenly struck her what was the pope doing here she knew that he went about everywhere but they said that he never ate or drank in company and she had seen him finish a cup of tea how dainty the elevation of that left little finger was ah why was he not dressed in white as usual disguisedtaking tea in a private housewith two nameless women ah why indeed she focussed her fury the number on the gateyes she ran to the end of the street and read via morino she crossed the road and returned and found a niche where she could hide in the shadow of a pillared wall here she watched and waited as a terrier waits on and watches a kitten demure in a treeyapping and yelping almost inaudibly wellnigh bursting with suppressed impulse to pounce perhaps she waited halfanhour then a couple of lacqueys camedown to the gate opened it and obsequiously bowed to an ecclesiastic who passed out into the street flinging the right fold of his cloak over his left shoulder he swiftly walked towards via nationale and she followed him as he came into the more brilliant light he drew the fold of his cloak closer across his mouth that act decided her she knew that her georgie abhorred from every kind of muffling that he should muffle now was natural enough he did not wish to be recognised he was incognito for an evil purpose that he should have chosen openly to walk through the biggest street in rome when he might have sneaked down byeways or might have taken a cab only added to the evidence her georgie was the most frantically daring of men she knew precaution on the one hand nullified by extreme audacity on the other she had noted in him before she nearly lost him as he made his way by the austrian embassy and the ges into corso vittorio emanuele at the oratory he crossed and went by the little piazza into banchi where he left a card with the porter of the palazzo attendolo again he muffled his face and went on crossing the temporary bridge and going by borgo vecchio straight to the gate of the vatican here he was admitted and mrs crowe was left alone in agony and in hilarity she turnedout of the colonnade into the square cursing herself for not speaking to him writhing because she had caught her loved one secretly visiting another woman then she laughed at the thought that she had found his holiness the pope engaged in vulgar intrigue the barb of the one emotion lacerated her the barb of the other she would save to dilacerate him chapter xii on the night of the second of october the german emperor sat in the imperial box at the berlin schauspielhaus they were playing wilhelm tell william ii lookedon at the mummer pourtraying the audacious genius who by skill and courage delivered a people from tyranny he looked on the presented incident with a humorous sense of its coincidence with his present intention for in the imperial mindthat agile predominant mind at which inferior minds led by the pall mall gazette were used to mockwas stored certain knowledge of another scene yet to be enacted in which he himself would play the part of the deliverer an aidedecamp entered during the interval while the house gave itself up to conversation apples nuts pfefferkuchen he handed a locked portfolio to the kaiser the papers are all here yes sire the manager attends he is at the door sire he has received my commands your majestys commands have been executed good i will follow him go now to the newspaperoffices and bring the specials to me after supper mahlzeit the curtain went up for the last act the audience was stricken with sudden paralyzed amazement on the stage actors sceneshifters the whole theatre staff were grouped in an immense semicircle in the chord of the semicircle one figure stood alone grimly dominant at first it was taken for a daringly realistic caricature of the emperor and fear of the penalties of lsemajest dawned in the minds of the beholders but the figure spoke and doubt fled it was the emperor everyone knew that vigorous vocative germans the said germans were used to manifestations of their rulers omniscience and omnipresence and they automatically stood to listen he quoted the assertion of herr bebmarck in the reichstag that every speech by the kaiser against socialists meant a socialist gain of votes at the elections then he flung out a challenge he said that the insuing elections meant war to the knife not between him and his people but between him and the handful of venal demagogues unworthy to bear the sacred name of germans who led his people astray he opened his portfolio socialism he said commanded four million votes onethird of the german army was socialist socialism was the largest political party in the empire and increased each year at the expense of every other party it was a vast and important body a body needed a brain to direct its functions who after all was the head the demagogues or the kaiser at a moment like the present when the fatherland was menaced on both sides by anarchy and hereditary enemies the glorious german nation must not be harassed by intestine feuds hitherto a great part of his people had been taught to obstruct his schemes for german welfare thereby they had hurt themselves they had had the pleasure of opposing him but they had delayed their own betterment for his alone was the will which should rule germany yet he would not blame his people they had been betrayed by liars deceived by treacherous pseudophilanthropists he would not blame the tempted but the tempters the names of the tempters the human satans were august bebmarck turner grillerbergen locksmith raue bulermolken reistem saddlers varmol expostofficial steinbern lawyer volkenberg territorialmagnate singenmann capitalist he arraigned these men on a charge of having deluded the good heart of four million german people by professions of disinterestedness of benevolence by promises of universal betterment he denounced their professions and their promises as false and their practices as corrupt enough to have obtained the attention of the police the socialist demagogues were traitors to the very cause which they professed to serve their object was not the improvement of the social conditions of the people it was personal aggrandisement he brought proofs from his portfolio bebmarck grillenberger varmol had accepted bribes of m m m respectively from the communist government of france raue bulermolken reistem had accepted the post of saddlery contractors to the french army each of the foregoing had given a written promise to influence the socialist vote the kaiser read and exhibited the promises and continued steinbern had sold the minute books of various socialist committees in hanover for m the books were produced by an imperial aide volkenberg had scouted the proposal to municipalize his own vast possessions singenmann was proved to have derived his riches from illpaid sweated labour these be thy gods o socialism the emperor cried the mere possession of important private property of what is called a stake in the country has revealed their brazen faces and feet of clay the mere offer of the price of blood has revealed the iscariots of the fatherland he commanded his hearers to remember that in he himself had abrogated the laws against socialism and had dismissed the persecutor bismarck saying die social democratie berlassen sie mir mit der werdeich gang alleine fertig he said that his method had been to leave them free to work out their own salvation but in vain a bad tree does not bring forth good fruit it had not been socialism nor parliamentary majorities and resolutions which had welded together the german empire but the army and he the emperor the representative of that power in the state which not only created german unity in the teeth of those who pretended to represent the people but thereby carried into every german home the sense of national power finally he demanded did the innocent industrious greathearted dupes of the socialist demagogues intend in this crisis of german history to follow and obey the behests of lowborn traitors neversufficientlytobedamnedanddespised sweaters infamous rabagases or would they give loyal allegiance to him their divinely appointed and legitimate kaiser the heir of friedrich the noble and of wilhelm the good and of friedrich the greatto him the father of the fatherland whose whole life and energy was devoted and consecrated to deutschland deutschland ber alles with that he left the stage and the theatre the audience a typically middleclass one the very class of all others to which such an oration would appeal was stirred down to the depths of its phlegmatic teutonic soul as the kaiser departed not a hoch was uttered but multitudes of stemfaced converts poured out silently saluting him with the fire of loyalty lighted in their eyes germans are logical by nature display indefeasible premisses and it is not a german who will err from the just conclusion all night long all the newspapers except the vorwaerts issued special editions containing the emperors speech during the next few days william ii himself repeated it in the great cities of his empire at essen and breslau his reception partook of the nature of an ovation everywhere the press spread his epochmaking words to all who actually did not hear them german good sense preferred honesty vigorous masterly honesty even harebrained honesty to the base treachery which is actuated by no motive except personal gain german good sense could see that the kaiser himself was the hardestworking man in the empire that his simply amazing diligence and toil were absolutely unselfish absolutely impersonal that he gained no tangible reward whatever that his life which quite easily might have been one of irresponsible pleasure and ease was an incessant round of mental and physical exertion for the good of others german honour admired and german generosity repaid the fascinating personality of william ii at last was recognized as the chief element of the nations power his splendid and unique confidence in himself and his imperial vocation inspired his subjects with confidence in him the device of the secret ballot and the nowunfettered ability of every german to vote according to his conscience had the calculated effect the elections shewed that the enormous prestige of the emperor had won the socialist vote and the catholic vote and the votes of the right and the left in support of his paramount authority the english newspapers ceased from jeering and the pall mall gazette split subjunctives as well as infinitives in applause of success the laymajordomo of the apostolic palace found occasion to invite cardinals talacryn and semphill to inspect certain accounts i feel it my duty to call your eminencies attention to the fact said he that our most holy lord consumes about seven and sixpence worth of food and drink a week upon the average it is shocking also it is ridiculous kindly cast your eyes over these documents they are the accounts covering the past six months note how many times his dinner consists of three raw carrots and two poached eggs meat you see he eats not more than twice a week fish he refuses i understand that he will take the lean of beef the fat of pork the breast of a bird and chew them for an hour that accounts for his magnificent digestion said talacryn and i know that he eats raw carrots for the sake of his white skin but fat pork semphill could you digest fat pork when you were his age i cant even now condescend to consider the wine count piccino added his holiness quite fails to appreciate fine wine all i can say is i can remember seeing him thoroughly enjoy a teaspoonful of my peachbrandy sometimes after dinner that was twenty years ago though said semphill he used to enjoy peachbrandy eminency a thousand thanks he shall have a bottle i never thought of it until now he has taken what we give him but he has no palate whatever for superior brands hes quite content with a plain red wine from citta lavinia or cinthyanum and he drinks about as much of it in a week as another man would drink at a meal but cream and goats milki believe he bathes in those no no said semphill he drinks them day and night thats all hes got the digestion of a baby for milk shall i ever forget seeing him drink a pint of thick creama whole pintat a farmhouse once when we were out walking i thought hed die there i begged him to take some of my pills i offered to make him free of my collection no he laughed at me and goes on rejoicing but eminencies do you think his holiness can live on this meagre diet chi lo sa i couldnt he may hes a most incomprehensible creature whatever talacryn concluded armed with the allegiance of an united empire the kaiser scoured away across the continent to rome he travelled incognito as the duke of knigsberg and put up at the palazzo caffarelli the world looked on and wondered no news of his intentions were vouchsafed and as a rule journalists had the decency to refrain themselves from suppositions the exception to the rule was french of course religion is the great preoccupation of william ii beneath the spangled uniform of this emperor there is the soul of a clergyman or rather the visionary soul of an initiate of even vaguer mysteries the kaiser only waits for an opportunity to achieve in rome what he has already achieved in the east that is to say to oust france shrieked m jean de bonnefon in the paris clair la patrie instantly yelled in comment let germany take the holy see it will be the end of germany and the beginning of revenge for sedan the paparchy is an acid which will dissolve the badly cemented parts of an empire which is still too new but it was not precisely religion which dictated the kaisers movement he had the sense to know that religion is personal and though he never lost an opportunity of asserting his personal religious opinions the idea of making them the rule for all men never entered his eminently practical mind no he had other plans and he was seeking material wherewith to build he conferred long and secretly with the king of italy a man after his own heart a born ruler a natural autocrat who himself had been a slave they discussed needs william ii wanted room for a population which had increased by twenty millions in thirty years victor emanuel iii wanted money and timemoney to make easier the life of his peopletime to mature improvementsgive him those and he could laugh at italys enemies the secret societies and the clergy clergy the kaiser demurred now are you really sure that the clergy are your enemies yes in their heart of hearts dont you understand that we robbed them dont you know that this very palace of the quirinale in which i am receiving your imperial majesty is stolen property yes yes but this englishman surely he makes a difference to some extent but he cannot extirpate in a moment the hatred and envy with which my house and i are regarded by the clergy whom we dispossessed for nearly forty years to hate us has been part of the clerical education a weed of that kind cannot be rooted up at once it is ingrained perhaps in another generationbasta meanwhile meanwhile what well hasnt the pope made things easier for you yes in a way but what is his object what concession for example he doesnt seem to have left himself any opening for extorting concessions but did your imperial majesty ever hear of a priest who gave something for nothing one of my cardinals tells me that this is a madman whose pose is to be primitive apostolic ha for a primitive apostle he has a singularly dictatorial method have you read his epistles and his denunciations of the socialists for example i have i entirely approve of them they have assisted me greatly in dealing with some rebels of my own oh no one could find fault with his sentimentsso far but they are so unusual so extrapontifical that one wonders what they are concealing is your majesty sure that they conceal something no im not of course i have no means of arriving at certainty that could only be obtained from the pope himself and only from him if he were willing to give it has your majesty asked him certainly not we continue to misunderstand one another your imperial majesty knows that there is no means of communication between my government and the vatican all we get is hearsay and all they get is gossip why do you not request hadrian to receive youyou yourself i imagine that he would not refuse perhaps not i believe that he has been preparing for me some such trap as that but i distrust the greeks even when they bear gifts they say he says his prayers in greek by the bye i am about to request his holiness to receive me your imperial majestys case is different you are not likely to have fresh insults and fresh humiliations offered to you what do you mean i mean that i cherish the memory of all ecclesiastical pinpricks which formerly were administered to my father and grandfather pinpricks what do you call pinpricks for example in pio nono from his own deathbed sent to reconcile my excommunicated grandfather who was enabled to die in the embrace of the lord a little later died also pio nono my father voluntarily returned the courtesy sending his adjutant to offer condolence to the conclave leone who then was chamberlain ordered the swiss guard to refuse entrance to the royal envoy at the bronze gatesto refuse the message even very clerical the emperor said and pondered a moment then will your majesty go to the vatican with me no sire i never will go to the vatican the king replied a telegram signed wilhelm ir addressed to the princebishop of breslau brought cardinal popk to his sovereign at the german embassy in rome on hearing the kaisers intention he did his very best to persuade him away from it and curtly was required to explain himself majesty said his eminency no good can come of such a meeting and much harm may our most holy father is english and being english he has the english quality of cynicism with him it is et petro et nobis in the highest degree he is a man of strong likes and dislikes fervently patriotic and therefore fervently antigerman your eminency knows that i have no explicit information but seeing the estimation in which those islanders hold us i judge so sire i beseech you to pause i beseech you i beseech you on behalf of your loyal catholic subjects that you will not expose your imperial person to the risk of an affront an affront indeed majesty remember what happened when you first visited pope leo william ii laughed cardinal you are a very good german and awell queer roman sire i distinguish i implicitly obey hadrian as vicar of christ i dislike him as a cynical englishman i am anxious that your majesty may not have occasion to dislike this englishman who is the spiritual director of your loyal catholic subjects your eminencys solicitude is most creditable but i have met englishmen whom i immensely admire for certain qualities which they possess and which we germans lack what you have said piques my curiosity i wish to meet this particular englishman and i wish your eminency to arrange it i promise you that whether he affronts me or not i will not afflict my catholic subjects with another kulturkampfif that is what you fear however if you still hesitate to oblige your kaiser i will apply through my legation or better i will apply through the cardinalbishop of albano who used to be at munich the cardinalprincebishop of breslau went to the vatican without any more ado and the supreme pontiff consented to receive hadrian endured an hour of terror the task of dealing with an emperorhe was inclined to put it from him as being too great a thing for him but he felt inquisitive to know what the kaiser wanted he who sits upon the throne of peter looks at all the world knowing that he will see either enemiesor suitors hadrian also was inquisitive to see the person and the mind of the man whom he invariably had defended as being the only sovereign in europe whose conduct indicated belief in his own divine right to sovereignty and as being one of the few delightful persons in the world who can contemplate their own minds and behold they are very good hadrian was interested in william ii as an extremely fine specimen of the absolute type yethe hesitated to come to close relations with him becausewell for one thing because he disliked being domineered over and this military michael from the high hohenzollem hilltop was certain to smack of the barracks all the same popes had received emperors before now and it had not always been the emperors who had domineered but could he love him well at any rate he could try to save him trouble then what was the kaisers object he knew that something or other was wanted of him and he fearedfeared lest he should say as usual more than he meant to say and give as usual more than he need give that though could be prevented he would make this rule for the occasionlisten little inquire less affirm least and concede nothing now good it should be done he had a couple of easy chairs placed in the throneroom and a small table with cigarettes cigarettepapers and tobacco the crab mixture which george arthur rose had invented he satdown in one of the chairs by the window took out the little gold pyx from his bosom and held it in his hands while he awaited the emperors arrival his eyes became still and grave his lips moved swiftly a singular serenity inspired him the introducerofsovereigns announced the duke of knigsberg your majestys visit gives us great pleasure was the apostles greeting to the kaiser uttered in that clear young minor voice which was so well known in rome the two potentates took each the others measure in a glance the emperor smartly groomed in plain eveningdress with riband cross and star had that slightly conical head which marks the thinker and the singleminded obstinate man the pope a year his junior gave an impression of clean simplicity with his white habit and his keen white face there was a distance a reticence in his gaze he had remembered williams teutonic osculation of his indignant predecessor and as the kaiser approached him he took the imperial hand and shook it in the gladtoseeyoubutkeepoff english fashion springdumbbells had given the pope a grip like a vice and an arm like a steel pistonrod the emperor blinked once i am grateful to your holiness for receiving me in this informal manner the pope inclined his head motioned his guest to a chair and offered cigarettes he himself rolled one lighted it and sat down i have the pleasure of personally congratulating your holiness on your election and i trust that god will grant you many years in which to rule your section of his people wisely and well it is our sincere hope that our endeavour to feed christs flock may be acceptable i have many catholics in my empire and i may say that their virtues merit my fullest approbation the pope again inclined his head i understand that your holiness has never been in germany no our life hitherto has been an unimportant one we are almost ignorant of the world and of men except perhaps from the viewpoint of the outside observer and student my sainted mother used to quote an english proverb which says that onlookers see most of the game all english proverbs which are positive have their correspondent negativeabsence makes the heart grow fonderout of sight out of mindyour majestys proverb is contradicted by only the toad under the harrow has counted the spikes we mean that we have learned much of what is done but very little of the details of the doing ah that of course comes by heredity or by practice or by occession i fear that i do not quite follow the pope suddenly was afraid that he had been guilty of a sort of appeal for this mighty emperors pity and consideration toward his plebeian origin and inexperience was this keeping his troubles to himself he hastened to divert the conversation from himself our predecessor st peter was an illiterate plebeian of no importance but by the occession of divine grace his holiness was enabled to wield the keys of the kingdom of heaven and to win the unfading palm down there by the obelisk ah yes and i trust that your holiness may be similarly enabled i have very little doubt but that you will be the favour of the almighty seems to be with men of our nation in a preeminent degree our nation yes surely your holiness remembers that by birth i am halfenglish oh indeed yes but majesty in england you are thought of as being wholly german i am much misunderstood in england again the head inclined in silence led the emperor on and also i have been much misunderstood in germany the english suspect me of plotting mischief against england and my empire has been suspecting me of such leanings toward england as to interfere with my proper duty of attending to the interests of germany and both suspicions are equally gratuitous both as a matter of duty i think first of the interests of germany but for the sake of those very interests i am anxious to cultivate the friendship of england personally i have a great appreciation of many english qualities as my many english friends know and of course although she was a somewhat terrible person i had an immense and genuine admiration for my neversufficientlytobelauded grandmother your great queen victoria now there was a woman a queen in that matter your majestys behaviour was magnificent we ourself saw you at her exsequies we noted the signs of your countenance and your comportment and we honoured your splendid piety there only was one feeling in england toward your majesty then the kaiser was moved his left arm twitched once or twice your holinesss wordshe shook his ferocious eyesare very grateful to me but what have i done sinceto lose majesty in the english mind you are incarnate germany i am germany it is not your majesty whom england distrusts but the germans but why but why englishmen say it is all very well to dissemble your love but why did you kick me downstairs they dont believe in your majestys friendliness because they commit the common error of confounding the particular with the universal your majesty is the scapegoat they lay upon you the sins of execrable taste on the part of your journalists and of shady diplomacy on the part of your statesmen and they drive you out into the wilderness is your holiness cognizant of the difficulties which i have to contend with we are perfectly astounded at the inertia the stolidity the volatility the inconstancy of the material which rulers have to direct to curb to shape we entirely sympathize with your majesty in the matter of the difficulties which fill your life also to descend to particulars we know and approve of your masterly method of dealing with demagogues i am very glad to hear this i am pleased to know that there is one point on which i can agree with your holiness we trust that there are many points on which we cannot agree with your majesty the kaiser was taken aback i do not understand he said complete agreement signifies complete stagnation disagreement at least postulates activity and only by activity is the best made manifest and approved holiness i beg your pardon i see the point that is a very grand and atalltimestoberemembered doctrine i must try to remember your beautiful words for it is the best which i am seeking for germany and germany never will find it in the socialism which aims at that ridiculous impossibility called equality meaning the acquisition by lazy b of that which active a has won all history shews that aristos only emerges from conflict that is a truth which must be insistedon at the same time we rejoice to see that your majesty has been inspired to distinguish between the charlatans and their dupes much unrighteousness is done to suffering humanity by those who will not take the trouble to remember that when the natural man is hurt he howls and seizes the salve which is nearest the wise ruler works to benefit his subjects by going directly to the root of the matter removing the cause of injury but we are not to preach to your majesty you no doubt had some definite object in coming to us yes i certainly had a definite object but i had no idea that i was to discuss it with a pontiff who had so complete an intuition of my own imperial sentiments our office is to become in sympathy with all who strive for the best the kindness with which your holiness has received me and the nevertobeforgotten truths which you so nobly have enunciated make my task much easier i desired to consult your holiness to obtain knowledge of your feelings in certain matters at the present moment you are aware my eastern frontier is menaced by russia my western frontier by france and on my southern frontier there is a third and a more miscellaneous difficulty the germans of austria have petitioned for admission to the germanic empire can you admitannexthem will it be well for you to do that holiness i mustas german emperor i must protect germans while francis joseph lived his german subjects were content to live in austria as austrians now that bohemia and hungary are separating themselves from austria they no longer are content austria is no more the fragments which composed her are for ever disunited and poland holiness in my empire there is no poland no your majesty believes that the german austrians would be happier under your rule are you likely to meet with opposition if you annex them with tremendous opposition france and russia instantly will declare war with what chance of success with no chance of success my glorious german navy and army will conquer france and russia majesty majesty and yetyou have endeared yourself to hundreds of thousands of french refugees thanks to your holinesss gracious initiative you may take it that all christian france is willing to become germanor englishout of sheer gratitude but russiarussia is immenseimmensely powerful pardon me holiness but do you read the english newspapers nineteen studiously thirtyseven from which cuts are selected for our perusal the english newspapers are wellinformed trustworthy penny and threepenny dailies threepenny weeklies shilling and halfcrown monthlies generally are wellinformed generally are trustworthy so then i shall tell your holiness from an english penny daily that russia is not powerful in a military sense the large majority of her officers are abjectly incapable the ranks are recruited entirely from the peasantry and are on the admission of their own generals entirely unreliable they have neither intelligence nor initiative and they no more know how to obey than their officers know how to command russias defeat by japan taught her nothing also there has been for years among patriotic russians north south east and west a singular yearning for an overwhelming defeat by an european power that way only they say can they be delivered from the crushing anarchic tyranny under which the whole country labours even supposing russia to be unitedwhich she is noti say that she has no chance of ultimate success against the german navy and army i say that her numbers have inspired a wholly unfounded and exaggerated apprehension of her military power i say that bouncebounce if your holiness will permit me to say itbounce alone has served her purpose well she will continue to use bounce until she is opposed by a resolute determination which there is no possibility of mistaking fear of russia resembles the fear of a child at an ugly mask if russia were to cross my frontiers she would march to her final overthrow and best of all the russians know that as well as i do your majesty appears to have made out a case well you will conquer france and russia and then i shall annex them to my empire are you likely to meet with any opposition then i do not know i am about to proceed to discuss the point with my uncle meanwhile my ambassadors are consulting mr chamberlain and mr roosevelt and i myself am consulting my royal cousin the king of italy ahthe king of italyand what does your majesty desire from us i should be glad to know the attitude which your holiness will prescribe for the catholics of my empire as well as for other catholics in the event of my engaging in these schemes why because at present my catholic subjects are loyal i should not permit any of my subjects to be disloyal i wish to give them all freedom in religious matters but i should not tolerate opposition to my statepolicy touching the matter of poland there is no poland the pope put his hand on the tablepontifically will your majesty for the purposes of argument consent to imagine a place called poland partly russian partly german inhabited by a race which is neither german nor russian a race very tenacious of its traditions in the event of your annexation of france and russia for exampleand austria which is composed of sixteen distinct races speaking thirtytwo distinct languages the various slavonic nationalities of parthians medes and elamites parthians medes and elamites well croats slovenes dalmatians and the dwellers in bosnia and herzegovina to say nothing of the czechs and the magyarsin the event of your annexation of all these you would be obliged to have regard unto the racial characteristics of your new subjects now at the same time would you not be well advised to regard the racial characteristics of poland in what way for example would you concede to poland the polish language and a polish king and constitution under your imperial suzerainty your holiness means something of the nature of federation such as your own country so successfully has adopted concisely i had not thought of it it merits my profound consideration and what would happen to the other fragments of austria and to the balkan states i do not know the sultan would have something to say and what will he say i must tell your holiness that i am much disappointed in turkey i looked upon it as the military power whose ability to hold back russia and to prevent the political strangulation of germany in europe by keepingopen the gates of the east must be strengthened at all costs hence i practically rearmed the sultans forces and passed numbers of young turkish officers through my military schools you may say that i made the turkish army all to no purpose the new sultan has played me false i am afraid now that turkey will be more influenced by england and by italy than by me is that king blind my uncle no italy not that i am aware of why does your holiness ask the supreme pontiff stood up we thank your majesty for the sincerity of your conversation and assure you of our goodwill we will ponder the matters which you have laid before us i hoped to have had but there was no mistaking the sealed face and william ii was one of the cleverest men in the world and he also was half an englishman i should be greatly obliged if your holiness would write down that doctrine of aristos i should prize it greatly the pope went to a writing table and produced a couple of lines in his wonderful fifteenthcentury script i will make this one of the heirlooms of hohenzollern said the kaiser may god guide you wellbeloved son hadrian walked that afternoon with cardinal semphill on nomentana as far as st agnes beyondthewalls it was one of those deliberately lovely roman autumn afternoons when walking is a climax of crisp joy with the thought of a cup of tea as the fine finial they talked of books especially of novels and his eminency asserted that the novels of anthony trollope gave him on the whole the keenest satisfaction there was a great deal more in them than generally was supposed he said the pope agreed that they were very pleasant easy reading deliciously anodynic his own preference was for thackerays esmond he however would not commit himself to approval of all the works of any one writer simply because no man was capable of being always at his best as they passed through porta pia into venti settembre hadrian pointed to the palace on the left of the gate saying have you ever been there no holiness at least not since ive been wearing this he indicated his vermilion ferraiuola dont you think if we asked them very nicely they would give us a cup of tea the cardinal mischievously chuckled i am of opinion that the english ambassador would be very pleased to make your holinesss acquaintance over a cup of tea hadrian rang the bell semphill he said as they waited at the gate if there be any ladies about will you kindly talk to them and leave the ambassador to us sir francis was at home and much honoured so were two secretaries and no ladies and there was tea cardinal semphill devoted himself to the secretaries and told them funny stories about clergymen they laughed hugely at the tales which were witty and at the wittier clergyman who told them the pope mentioned to the ambassador that he had had a call from the duke of knigsberg that morning and driftedoff into an inquiry as to where reliable maps were to be procured sir francis named stanford of longacre and was much interested was there any map in particular which his holiness desired to consult they were fairly welloff for maps at the embassy perhaps the holy father would condescend no thank you sir francis they would ask questions about you in parliament if we were to borrow your maps why lady wimborne will have a fit as it is when she hears that you have entertained the tenhorned beast with tea i am not afraid of that holiness no of course not but stanford will give us all the information which we needunless you will tell us the interest concentrated what england is going to do in the present crisis i can tell your holiness one thing which she has done and which will appear in tomorrow mornings times england and turkey the two great muhammedan powers have entered into an offensive and defensive alliance today which means that englands interests lie in asia and africa and not in europe the ambassador slightly started may i know why your holiness thinks that hadrian rose and shook hands because of englands previous alliance with japan because of her conscious sympathy with the barbaric read success for sympathy in the last sentence if you prefer it and please remember that this is not an infallible utterance its an astonishingly smart one all the same said the ambassador with a genial grin thank you very much for your tea stanford you said goodbye and sir francisthere are no closed doors in the vatican hadrian chattered at large during the remainder of the evening and industriously dreamed all night first of certain portents connected with emperors knuckles then of tremendous maps on which one crawled and finally his usual and favourite dream of being invisible and starknaked and fitted with great white feathery wings flying with the movement of swimming among and above men seeing and seeing and seeing easily and enormously swooping in the morning reaction supervened he was listless he wanted to be alone they left him alone and during several days he was inaccessible writing and burning much writing the palace with its fifty separate buildings its eleven thousand rooms its fourteen courtyards hummed with the life of a population of a small town up in the series of small chambers under the eaves in the large and lovely pleasaunce on the slopes of the vatican hill he found quiet and peace he thought for hours at a stretch smoking cigarette after cigarette gazing out of the window or across autumnal lawns sometimes he remained rapt in contemplation of the perfect beauty of his new cross gently stroking it with delicate finger a portfolio of vast maps arrived from london he pinned them on his blank brown walls and pored over them in the night he often would rise and stand before them till his breast ached and his arms were stiff with the weight of the lamp he sent a holograph letter to the king of spain and received a reply which lightened his brow he concentrated his mind on the future he began to form his plans at the beginning of november he signed the decree of canonization of madame jehane de lys commonly called joan of arc and simultaneously issued the epistle to the germans very few perceived the true inwardness of the paradox those frenchmen who remained christian were so overjoyed at the honour accorded to their national heroine that they failed to appreciate the significance of the epistle the germans were so occupied with the contents of the epistle that the glorification of a frenchwoman passed unnoted in england it was thought that the pontiff was feeling his way the worldly christian asked what you would expect of a jesuit and the daily anagraph compared him to machiavelli certainly the epistle to the germans was remarkable not so much for its matter as for its suggestion it was a masterpiece of what walt whitman calls revelation by faint indirections the kaiser did not know whether to be satisfied or dissatisfied with it hadrian praised the teutonic race for its poetic in the greek sense of creative and diligent habits he dwelled with admiration upon the many benefits which civilization owes to the german constructive faculty but he indicated the want of the open air and fresh water element in all departments physical and intellectual of german life scope is what ye need free movement of mind and body stagnation breeds purulence rancorous suffocating sour brooding never can bring satisfaction nor can iron nor can blood but only the gold of love wherefore wellbeloved sons seek your salvation in love love one another first be patient knowing that love is manifest in obedience and hath exceeding great reward chapter xiii jerry sant saw mrs crowe driving in victorias with people who wore smartish bonnets professional experience enables him to recognize real ospreys three or four times he met her in her mauve going to an evening party from this he deduced that she was enjoying herself and it being quite contrary to the principles of socialism that any one should enjoy themselves except under socialist supervision he put on a red necktie and paid her a visit it was a wet day she had nothing particular to do and she was not unwilling to chat about herself looking at his florid sweaty vulgarity it soothed her vanity to tell this plebeian of the patricians whom she had captured the honble mrs this the baroness von that and lady whatshemame of the other they were so kind their kettledrums and bridgerouts were so shick you met such thoroughly nice people you know and the american millionairesses were so amusing they had such shocking manners mrs

this mr sant said a pict to an erse who called himself the before his surname the italicized question was asked at a reception in mrs ojades flat on palazzo campello about a fortnight after the previous confabulation i really dont quite know beyond that hes a friend of that mrs crowe who was converted the other day is he a convert too no not yet but they say hes likely to be theyre both liblabs you know oh yes of course i read about them in the papers what a score it will be for the church well what do you make of him oh he seems earnest enough but hes hardly got a word to say for himself and i dont think hes quite a gentleman you know hadrian sat at the end of one of his long bare tables on both sides of him were two great numbered baskets at the other end of the table was a huge leathern sack containing the pontifical mail at the sides of the table stood the two gentlemen of the apostolic chamber with stilettos the pope unlocked the sack and sir john and sir iulo in turn drew out a handful of letters and displayed them before him he scanned the handwriting of each and named a numbered basket into which the designated missive was cast when the sack was empty the contents of the baskets were dealt with all the letters in the first were addressed to his holiness the pope prefect of the holy roman and universal inquisition hadrian took the stiletto from sir iulo and slit open each envelope which sir john presented thus they were returned to the basket and sent to be perused by the cardinalsecretaryofstate the two gentlemen seated themselves at the table cutopen the envelopes of the second basketful and pushed them within the popes reach these were addressed in known handwritings hadrian read the letters and sorted them in separate heaps before him each heap was weighted by a miniature ingot of pure copper the colour of which he immensely admired two letters were placed face downwards by themselves the envelopes from the third basket were opened and the letters extracted by the gentlemen hadrian only lookedat and arranged them the fourth basket contained newspapers which sir john opened and examined for marked paragraphs if any such were found sir iulo folded the paper open and placed it otherwise the paper was torn and returned to the basket meanwhile the pope more closely inspected the letters which he had retained the gentlemen placed a couple of phonographs on the table inserted new cylinders and retired hadrian got up and locked the doors he took the little heaps of letters from under the ingots and spoke into the machine formal acknowledgments of receipt and a short blessing or definite instructions for detailed responses until all had received attention except the two letters which lay by themselves and three others he unlocked the door the gentlemen entered and carried the instruments with the articulate cylinders to cardinals sterling whitehead leighton della volta and fiamma who acted as pontifical secretaries in the ninth antechamber hadrian himself wrote to his wellbeloved son william to his beloved son edmund earl marshal of england and to his beloved son a panciera these being enclosed and addressed he was left alone he took the two remaining letters to the easychair by the window rolled and lighted a cigarette and considered them reverend and dear sir since our late esteemed interview when i had the pleasure of addressing your lordship on the subject of socialism i have been anxiously awaiting the favour of an acknowledgment of same in case the subject has slipped your memory i should remind you that i informed you previously on behalf of the liblab fellowship that we were not averse to give our careful consideration to any proposal that you may see fit to make with a view to cooperation with us against the horde of cosmopolitan goldpigs who monopolise the means of existence production distribution and exchange in order to procure a complete change in the entire social organism i am quite at a loss to understand on what grounds you have not favored me with a direct reply unless there is anything on which you would like farther explanations in that case i will be most happy to call on you per previous appointment for which i am now waiting at the above address neglecting my business at considerable expense and inconvenience to myself which a man in my humble position compared with yours cannot be expected to incur and common courtesy demands should be made good i therefore trust that in view of the not altogether pleasant facts that are in my possession your lordship shall see fit to send me a private interview at your earliest convenience hopeing that i will not have occasion to feel myself compelled to proceed farther in this matter if you leave me no option but to do so and assuring your lordship that your valued instructions as to time and place of meeting will have my fullest and promptest attention i remain sir yours truly comrade jeremiah sant lf ps perhaps i may mention by way of hint that we might be able to come to some arrangement for our mutual advantage not altogether on the above lines and i beg to advise your most reverent lordship that i would be willing to meet your wishes if the terms are suitable asking to hear from you soon and hoping that any misunderstandings may presently be cleared up js dearest dearest georgie for although you have no more the old sweet name my heart is ever faithfull and will not let me call you by any other does it not remind you of that day of long ago when the floods were out in the meadows and you and i and joseph were coming home from the bellamys and you lifted me in your strong arms and carried me through the water that covered the path how joseph laughed he never thought it worth his while to take care of me as you did but i knew that it was because you loved me and my heart went out to you then and never has been my own since if only you knew how deeply i regret the unpleasantness which arose since then i think you would pity me a little georgie do forgive me it is my love which made me mad i hate myself for what i did and would give the world to undo it i was a mad fool then i did not know what i was doing or how you would take it so seriously georgie you were always good and i was wicked but havent you punished me enough think of what i have suffered all these years apart from you every time you have refused to notice me has been like a stab in my heart georgie take pity on me do you know that i watch your window every day and watch you walk about the town several times you have brushed against me in the street without knowing it for i will do nothing to damage you any more dearest georgie i know very well that ladies are not admitted to your palace for i have had myself made a catholic in order to get a little nearer you but all priests have housekeepers georgie do let me come and be your housekeeper i promise on my word of honour that i will serve you faithfully in any and every way we might be so happy nothing would give me greater joy than to work my fingers to the bone for you georgie do believe me when you see how i am willing to humiliate myself so for you of course i never speak of our former relations except that i say i knew you slightly when joe was alive but as for love i never mention it for it was nipped in the bud by my wickedness and never has been anything but a trial to me and i should not wish my love to do you any harm dont think that last sentence means anything spiteful it is not so indeed but i know you distrust me i only mean that it would be better for both of us if you would not go on being so cruel heartless dreadful and neglectful of your devoted and distracted n ps i have a suspicion that the man who is with me is no friend of yours georgie be wise and let me see you at least and tell you what i suspect it is only your welfare i have at heart dont refuse me georgie dont hadrian read these letters through two or three times noting the yapping and the yowling of the one the panting and the whining of the other the barking of both he turned to the window and looked at nothing until he had finished his cigarette his thin lips stiffened in scorn and drew downward into the straight inflexible line his impulse was to make an end of the male animal in a tank of aquafortis if such a convenience only had formed part of the pontifical paraphernalia as for the female he remembered george merediths sentence and would have liked to squeeze all the acid out of her at one grip and toss her to the divinities who collect exhausted lemons the next minute the dogs the dirty abject obscene dogs he spat suddenly and carried the letters to the safe in the bedroom where he locked them up he prohibited himself from taking further note of them he was conscious that this course was quite wrong but there it was he had a busy afternoon before him and he diligently read in his breviary to prepare for himself a convenient frame of mind pursuing his policy of emphasizing the difference between the church and the world he had summoned the generals of religious orders to each of these he wished to say some words of admonition words which would remain in the memory and be passed from mind to mind from mystic to thyrsosbearer from general to postulant he rather enjoyed the sticking of labels on people and things now because he could do it to some purpose on the other hand he had a feeling that he only was touching surfaces still here and there the surface might be soft and capable of receiving impression or here and there might be a crevice or a gap which he could fill with a cartridge somehow anyhow his words and acts must be made to penetrate to the roots of things to influence fundamentals at fifteen oclock he mounted the small throne one by one the generals passed into the presence heard apostolic words and passed out againservites premonstratensians augustinians cistercians carthusians oblates marists passionists carmelites dominicans to the general of trinitarians he commended africa and ordained that twenty friars should preach as of old in the marketplaces of england canada and australasia for african missions to the general of the order of charity he would not say anything at present concerning the condemned forty propositions but he would say love your enemies the jesuits and turn not away thine eye from the needy and give none occasion to curse thee to the general of benedictines he gave command to keep his monks in their monasteries and to prohibit them from appearing in the correspondencecolumns of newspapers either under their religious names or their renounced secular styles he reminded the ministergeneral of capuchins of the second ministergeneral the apostate ochino who had preferred worldly things and had preached polygamy and also of the fact that playing fast and loose with worldly things continued to produce apostate capuchins to the ministergeneral of franciscans he commended asia and ordained that fifty friars should preach as of old in the marketplaces of england canada and australasia for asiatic missions then he shewed the grey scapular and cord which he was wearing next to his skin and asked that the brotherhood should name him to blessed brother francis as a little brother who was not gay but sad not lively but weary and who had but little love hadrian as brother serafino of the third order kissed the ministergenerals naked feet and begged a blessing returning to the throne the supreme pontiff imparted apostolic benediction and brother peter baptist went out into the noisy antechambers with his clean bright face allglorious and light in his serene blue eyes the prepositorgeneral of jesuits entered with ostentation of the knowledge that if hadrian the seventh was the english white pope he himself was the english black pope he had that benevolently truculent manner which women deem adorable as he made his obeisance hadrian noted a little lacquered snuffbox in his hand and a frightful bandanna oozing from the pocket of his cassock his holiness instantly carried war into the camp by reminding father st albans of the bulls of urban viii and innocent x which prohibit snufftaking on pain of excommunication no doubt those bulls are obsolete but your reverency will have the goodness to abstain from practising the filthy habit in our presence the sallow general pocketed his snuffbox and produced the stony mild smile which is used upon eccentricity the pope remarked that the company of jesus appeared to be in a verisimilar position to the wesleyans in that they had departed a very long way from the will and spirit of their founder he used his slowly biting monotone because he wished to save this general the trouble of misunderstanding him he said that with the word borgia and the word nero the word jesuit perhaps was the eponym for all that was vilest in the world that was very undesirable not that the good opinion of the world was desirable far from that but christians ought not to enjoy anything not even an evil reputation under false pretences he wished to do something to rectify the erroneous opinion which the world had formed about the company of jesus to straightenout the tangle correcting and directing and as men were wont to judge more by actions than by words he did not propose to beat the air with vain expostulations explanations expositions of virtue and so forth it had been done a thousand times before historic calumnies had been refuted from pulpits and in pamphlets with unanswerable logic but still the maninthestreet said jesuit when he meant a foxy wolf the pontiff was not going to try to persuade the world away from its nonsense he wished the company of jesus to give the world a proximate occasion of persuading itself therefore he proposed to the general in private a return to the observance of the good old rule and a cultivation of the saintly spirit of st iigo lopez de recalde he wished the jesuits to reconsider their position as it were to surcease from thenot always mortally sinfulnot always tangibly illegalbut perhapsgenerally shady transactions the general interrupted he was prepared to bully hadrian froze him with a glance of blazing supremacy make no mistake the pope said we are not intending ourself to punish your company nor to degrade your companions who so diligently degrade themselves nor to confer fictitious and unmerited importance upon you by decrees of dissolution or suppression we do not forget the badness of the agents in the goodness of the cause nor the goodness of the cause in the badness of the agents he was looking through his allobservant halfshut eyes straight at the bridge of the generals fine nose that is the most exacerbating form of regard for while it holds the hearer rigid and intense it effectually prevents retaliation much may be done with the eye in wordy warfare you may challenge you may intimidate you may quell but you may do none of these things while your opponent refuses to lend his eye to yours so this sleek general found the pontiff held him with an eye which gazed so nearly into his that he perforce was obliged to lie in wait for the flicker when his own could seize it hadrian knew the dodge he had not watched and dichotomized men and jesuits from the observatory and in the dissectingroom of his loneliness during twenty years for nothing at the end of his sentence his gaze swept right away he rose and went to the window looking out over the roofs of golden and immortal rome he continued in a milder tone we have cited your reverency only to hear our paternal chiding of your naughty ways to the end that ye may amend the same returning of your own free will to the observance of the spirit as well as of the letter of those rules of life and conduct which your father st ignatius made for you he paused the general who would have preferred wheeling manure in a barrow at the behest of a novice amdg of course to listening to this rodent exhortation took it that the audience was ended and made shift to get on to his knees but the pope went on for it is of the nature of all human things to deteriorate and ye have made yourselves a scorn and hissing among men the nouvelle revue states that ye are in great decadence the statement may be one of your own devices for distracting the attention of the world from your nefarious machinations or it may be a fact in both cases it is damnable and damnatory he paused again jube domine benedicere the general intoned with a determination to force the apostolic benediction and to get back to the via del seminario as soon as possible he felt that he had some very important things to say to his socii but the pitiless voice probed him again wherefore we admonish you that ye set your house in order while ye have time the generals oval jaw took an extra lateral crease his hands twitched and pattered down and up and down in a talpine manner suddenly the inflexible fathomless eyes flashed on him axioms like sleet tersely lashed him remember that ye only exist on sufferance dismiss delusions and see yourselves as ye really are strip man strip search out your own weaknesses lest not the father but the enemy discover the sores and the diamonds which ye are hiding for ye do not merit the reputation which is associated with your name on the strength of which ye trade the glossy black priest jerked to his feet genuflected and was backing from the white presence the pontiff whose mood had become quite pythian stepped up to him laying a firm hand on the bow of the ribbons of his ferraiuola wince not dear son threefourths of you trade upon the reputation of your company for cunning and learning onefourth of you is the christians of the world at least be frank with yourselves let us have more of the flower of your christianity let us have less of your false pretences your erudition is showy enough oh yes but it is so superficial your machinations are sly enough oh yes but they are so silly ye are not geniuses ye are not monsters either of vice or of virtue but only ridiculous mediocrities always pitifully burrowing burrowing like assiduous moles always seeing your pains misspent your elaborate schemes wrecked except sometimes whento complete the metaphorquite by accident ye chance to kill a king this is not to the greater glory of god then stop stop here and now they were by the door the black pope had one hand under the bluelinen curtain and was fumbling for the handle the white pope quickly clinched his admonition dont pretend to be superior persons dont give yourselves such airs dont gad about in hansom cabs quite so much dont play billiards in publichouses dont nurture jackals try to be honest dont oppress the poor dont adore the rich dont cheat either tell the truth or try to love all men and learn to serve and dont be vulgar father st albans had got the door open he looked like a flat female with chlorosis he was green and quite speechless but he bowed profoundly as the decurial chamberlains came forward to escort him through the antechambers benedicat te omnipotens deus go in peace and pray for us purred the supreme pontiff rubbing his left hand with his pocket handkerchief and returning to the window chapter xiv hadrian was mooning about in the treasury one morning wondering why people will persist in using diamonds by themselves instead of as a setting for coloured gems grieving at the excessive ugliness of most modern goldsmiths monstrous work turning with disgust from huge brazenly vulgar masses of bullion shaped like bad dreams of chalices pyxes staves croziers mitres tiaras dishes jugs not beds and basons he bathed in the beauty of seablue beryls corundrums catseyes and chalcedonyx a vast rosealexandrolith mysteriously changed from myrtlegreen to purple as he turned it from sunlight to candlelight he moved to a great round tablemoonstone transparent as water one way brilliantly clouded with the ethereal blue of a summermorning sky the other these two stones had not the blatant ostentation the inevitable noisy obviousness of rubies emeralds diamonds and pearls they were apart chaste recondite serene and permanent he enjoyed them his glance again passed over the flaring cupboards a plan began to crawl out of one of his braincells he took the alexandrolith and the moonstone in his two hands and sat down profoundly meditating gazing into the lovely silent mystery in the stones so he sat for halfanhour while his plan unfolded its convolutions to him entered cardinal semphill rather ruddier than a cherry carrying the daybeforeyesterdays times holiness he said with some animation i hope i dont interrupt you thank god weve got a king of england at last he read from the paper the kings majesty has been graciously pleased to send autograph letters to all the european sovereigns and prime ministers inviting them to assemble with the president of the united states and the japanese emperor at windsor castle in order to concert measures for terminating the present lamentable condition of affairs that explains the length of the japanese emperors visit to england and roosevelts arrival last week yes its very kinglike statesmanship is all very well up to a point then its force seems to fade and kingships chance comes lucky england to have a real king i thought your holiness would be pleased and now what will be the outcome who knows hadrian thought for a minute and then mounted an imaginary pulpit and preached like a purposeful literary man first theyll quarrel terribly for certain because five of them are distinct entities and the others the nonentities out of sheer terror will make themselves a nuisance secondly when the nonentities have been reassured or squashed the five entities will have to reach a common ground if they do that we shall be very much surprised thirdly supposing an agreement to have been reached their majesties and the president will have to get it constitutionally confirmed autocracy is supposed to be dead and the usual constitutional farce will have to be performed why do you say autocracy is supposed to be dead holy father oh because the euphuism constitutional monarchy has taken its place the twentieth century doesnt like the word autocrat and pretends that the thing does not exist but it does not in the old hereditary form but aristos the strong man invariably dominates its in the order of nature and demos likes him for it only the silly thing wont say so thats all semphill you might send a marconigraph to the earl marshal we require news of this congress of windsor at least once a day the pope returned the gems to the beneficiato in attendance took the times with him and went across the basilica into the gardens a tramontana bit him to the bone and he tightly wrapped his cloak round him facing the wind and the blinding glare of the sun he briskly walked a couple of miles until bloodwarmth stung his mind into activity by leo ivs ruined wall he met cardinal carvale engaged in a similar exercise his delicate cheeks fervid and flushed and his grave eyes blazing good priests generally retain their bloom through the full fiveandforty years of youth hadrian invited his companionship and conversation for the return to vatican they were a pair these two mediumsized slim athletic men the one in white and the other in vermilion both very brilliant in the sunlight with vivid aspect and vivid gait they looked like men who really were alive their discourse was just the vigorous rather epigrammatic talk of wholesome wellbred men as they turned into the court of the belvedere his eminency said oh by the bye holy father perhaps i ought to tell you that they cannot understand at st andrews college why you never have been to see them but you understand hadrian promptly put in wellyes the cardinal responded in his candid gaze there was intuition sympathyand something else the pontiff read it when did they tell you that yesterday oh do you often go there about once a fortnight holiness carvale do you like going there yes on the whole i do the youngsters are glad to see me and the older men a radiant smile disclosed his exquisite teeth as he spread an armthey like vermilion to take note of them and i think it does my soul good he spoke gravely to visit the old place i put it off as long as i could i would have been glad to forget the horrors strange to say i forgot them after i had been there a few times hadrians heart informed him he understood it all quite well carvale let us go to st andrews now we can get there in time for dinner the cardinal instantly looked happy and the two continued to walk swiftly through the city going by tordinona orso piazza colonna and the trevi fountain as they passed the crucifix at the corner of an alley hadrian bowed his eminency did not why dont you salute our divine redeemer the pope inquired well of course i always raise my hat to the lord in the tabernacle when i pass a church and you bow to us and even to our handwriting but listen carvale it is idolatry to talk about holy church and holy father to bow to fallible sinful man if you do not bend knee and lip and heart to every thought and image of god manifest as man is that explicit enough well it was a protestant parson who wrote itone arnold of rugby he was right holiness said the cardinal turning back and bowing they walked on in silence the pope was doing a thing which he could not away with it might be thought that he a former student was come to the college which had expelled him to swagger of course it would be thought let it be thought then the hateful memory of every nook and corner in which as a student he had been so fearfully unhappy surged in his mind the gaudy chapel where he had received this snub the ugly refectory where he received that the corridor where the rector had made coarse jests about his mundity to obsequious grinners the library where he had found impossible dustbegrimed books the stairs up which he had staggered in lonely weakness the dreadful gaunt room which had been his homeless home the altogether pestilent pretentious bestial insanity of the placehe knew and winced at every stone of it and wrenched himself from retrospection they were going up the narrow avigonesi fifty yards in front a double file of students in violet cassocks and black sopranos preceded them a little group of ragamuffins shouted cattivi verbi at the file and one caught hold of the conventional sleeve of a students soprano which was streaming in the wind cheap cloth rent at a tug the ragamuffin rushed off with his spoils but the bereft one furiously followed retrieved his streamer and clouted a head which howled resuming his place in the camerata all unconscious that his act had been observed history repeats itself the pope said and laughed carvale smiled in reply fancy remembering that we forget no one thing of those days said hadrian also the rape of your eminencys streamer was effected on one of the only two days when we were permitted to accompany the others to the university naturally we remember that besides carvale you were in such a blind and naked rage and we had deemed you such a virtuous little mouse was i the cardinal said one had to lie low as a rule but sometimes the old adam we owe our one moment of mirth in st andrews college to that old adam i had to keep in coll for a week though afterwards the boys father was waiting for me with a knife yes italy had not got over her taste for steel will she ever get over it holiness of course she willwhen she has killed youor us nothing but a tragedy will break a habit of centuries the pope said as he rang the bell at the door of the college the old porter aurelio opened gasped dropped on his knees hadrian and cardinal carvale entered a long corridor extended right and left in front on the right a wide stone stair ascended on the left another stair descended a little way to a glass door leading to a shabby shrubbery some students were on the stairs others were in the shrubbery two or three lingered in the corridor at the pontiffs entrance they all inquisitively turned gasped and flopped it was awfully funny they resembled violet hares on their forms rigid goggleeyed readytobound at the turn of the landing a sturdy blackavised gael fled upstairs to summon the superiors the apostle blessed the others with a shy smile which would be kind and a wave of the hand which emptied spaceexcept for an obese little spectacled sharpnosed creature like a violet sparrow who hopped about pertly obsequious down came flying the superiors as a bell began to ring and intonations sounded in the upper corridors the rector was annoyed at being taken unawares but he presented his vicerector a mild anemic of thirty with the face of a good young woman we are come to accept your hospitality monsignore without any ceremony said hadrian they passed into the refectory to the high table twentynine students followed and arranged themselves in two lines down the sides of the centre and in a third line across the end the deanofstudents intoned the grace the rest responded the pope placed himself on the rectors right with the vicerector on his own right carvale supported the rector on the left soup boiled meat vegetables bakedmeat cheese apples appeared and disappeared the rector conceded to hadrian the right of signalling to the reader in the pulpit the pope kept him reading because he did not want to talk platitudes and because he did want to look at the men he ate little the food was abundant in quantity indelicate in quality they offered him the best black wine from the collegevineyards but he preferred a students little cruet of red a coarse wine with some body and no bouquet whateveran unsophisticate wine such as fabrizio colonna might have used at the end of the fifteenth century most of the diners assiduously and emphatically dined with one eye on the high table a nose in their own plate and the other eye in their neighbours hadrian noted all their physiognomies and began to select those with whom he would have a word he passed the weak young thinnosed dean at the top of the right table the tall quiet man in black who looked already sacerdotal the old bald amiability with an air of conventionality who might have been a parsonyes he would speak to him of the othersthe blubberlipped gorger who mopped up gravy with a crumbwedge and gulched the sopno the fastidious person who ate bread and drank water and looked so hungryyes the florid giant with the fiery wiry mopno the dark man with the cruel face of a redemptoristno the sallow lath who had the manners of an attachno on the left colourless mediocritiesno across the end youngstershis holiness distinguished a blackhaired whiteskinned one with wet black eyes certainly an erse a crispbrownhaired muscular hobbledehoy with shining grey eyes and a tanned skin who would look well in a farmyard a big bloom of boyhood yellowhaired blueeyed scarlet and moistlipped ardent and modest the pope tapped on the table the reader to whom no one had listened ceased and came down to his dinner a low murmur of conversation arose everybody began to think furiously of what he would do or demand if he had a chance this is a great day for the college holy father the rector said the pope slightly bowed had we known that you intended to honour us holy father a proper reception unnecessary hadrian quietly interrupted we do not wish to disturb our children expect to see us and we are here to be seen they all shall be able to say that they have seen and heard and handled us if they please he spoke lowly and the rector perceived unwillingly but very officially they were eating windfallen apples the rector offered an enormous silver snuffbox hadrian passed it to the vicerector who took a pinch with blushing alacrity it went the round of the tables and returned on the rectors left hadrian carefully noted the takers some took snuff perfunctorily some customarily others horribly the fiery wiry giant stood up and ostentatiously absorbed it with a cringe to the high table those to whom the pope was resolved to speak took none the fastidious person disdained it the meal was finished the students ranked for grace and all proceeded to the chapel to visit the lord in the sacrament after five minutes silent prayer they emerged on the first corridor there seemed to be uncertainty the men congregated on the descent expecting directions in the ordinary course of things some would be going to propaganda for lectures others to their own rooms for study or siesta but for the next few moments perhaps a dozen would enjoy horseplay in the shabby shrubbery a group of the last collected at the stairhead by the receptionroom with the redvelvet settees and the sham venetian glass chandeliers into which the rector was endeavouring to entice the pope but hadrian was looking at the students mischievously smiling at them it is to be hoped that you are not going into the garden to murder a cat he said everybody instantly became as red as a scaldinghot capsicum some with shame one with disgust others from sheer fear churchstudents easily are frightened because there generally is less grace than nature in them and you only have to disclose a knowledge of the latter for them to desire as phrenetically as possible the predominance of the former this makes for uneasiness often for hypocrisyin both cases for mental and corporeal effort and a sudden flux of blood to the extremities to murder a cat holy father the vicerector ejaculated he was responsible for discipline yes they used to murder stray cats here just to pass the time we have seen it the one thing which we remember in connection with your shrubbery is a rush of ramping infuriated boys with spades and pitchforks chasing and smashing a poor stray cat we can see the horror now with its broken back and one eye hanging out on its whiskers we can hear its dreadful heartrending yells boys dont do such thingsto cats of all creatures he spoke with fervence some savages wondered what the blazes he was driving at there was a little silence no one seemed to know how to break it then the sparrowlike student appeared with a red chair which he had taken the liberty of extracting from the receptionroom and dragged it behind the pontiff at the stairhead it was a welcome interruption hadrian sat down and dismissed cardinal car vale with the superiors he was going to have the college to himself for halfanhour the improvised throne stood alone in the bare corridor the students clustered up the stairs below it hadrian perceived the inevitable odour of hot boy he produced a sentence wherewith to address them dear children he said feeling as old as methuselah for the moment do learn to love dont be hard dont be cruel to any living creature and that was all he beckoned the dean who came and kneeled before him laid his hand on the young mans head and blessed him the others followed in rotation in a secret voice he invited each one to ask a favour most asked him to pray for them and held up their beads for a blessing some asked for the apostolic benediction in the hour of death for themselves and their relations the fastidious person asked for nothing nothing the pope whispered nothing nothing very tenderly everything o sanctity the stoic responded with a sob and a stony glare hadrian inquired for the number of his room and put a similar question to the other four whom he had noted when he had blessed all he sent them away and sat alone for a minute or two then he went to visit the big boy who looked at him bravely with tearful innocent eyes to hadrian it was wonderful to see this great virile virgin of nineteen he elicited a not unusual and simple tale a little gaelic farm always catholic through all persecutions the third of eight sons the vocation at twelve years of age the mother wanted to confess to her own son it was idyllic it would come exquisitely in the objective bucolic manner of theokritos the long shapely limbs trembled before him the grand shoulders bowed he gave the boy his own white sash as a present for his mother bade him be a good priest and left him wallowing in happiness hadrian stopped in the corridor disappointed because the lad came from a farm he had placed him beside the sea and had conceived a mental image of him barelegged in a blue guernsey at the rudder of a fishingsmack but the next the muscular hobbledehoy really did come from a farm his skin had the unmistakable tan of the sun on a wheatfield and his front was bovine so was his manner he was so frightened by the importance of his visitor that he spoke with surliness and in the voice of a child of thirteen hadrian was astonished at the discrepancy between the voice and the speaker he made him less uncomfortable by substituting an official manner for his friendly one which the hobbledehoy could not understand asking his name and ordinary questions about his status and addressing him as mr macleod it was a magnificent animal incapable of the finer sentimental emotions likely to conceal fat in a cassock or in corduroy if on a farm before the age of thirty privately the pope wondered what in the world was the sign of this ones vocation he himself could perceive none but then he was inexperienced and the youth was secretive hadrian tried to draw him out was he happy oh yes did he want anything oh no to what diocese did he belong to devana when did he expect the priesthood a look of wild terror came into the grey eyes hadrian perceived a clue and pressed on repeating his inquiry i never will be the creature shrilled why not no answer but a rush to the bedside and a face hidden hadrian took him by the shoulders and made an act of will why not i cannot and then the fountains of the great deep were discovered his veneer of english peeled off he spoke with the sibilate dental the clipped deliberation of the gael no one ever had told him he did not know till a month ago no one knew he had not mentioned it to his confessor because it was not a sin he read of it in lehmkuhl and togni he would be obliged to go back and work on his uncles farm where he had been brought up they belonged to the free kirk there he was an orphan it was his uncle by marriage hadrian looked steadily into his eyes is this the truth as though you were speaking before kings it wass the truth ass though she wass speaking pefore kings the response came in the strongest form of asseveration known to a gael deliberately selected and offered by him who knew so little and so much of so many little things hadrian comforted him and bade him pack his bag his secret was safe vatican was the place for him until some sort of useful happy life could be planned for him the pope very slowly wentup the last two flights of stairs to the top corridor no man can come into a human tragedy without some vibrance of sentiment and hadrians senses keen by nature were intensified by art he entered the room of the blackhaired erse who most certainly had kissed the blarneystone och blessins on the howly forthers blessid head and might the howly saints receive him into glory the pope wrote a blessing in a garish birthday book and got out of the room as quickly as possible that such a lovely bit of colour and litheness should be so abject on the floor his holiness shutdown the lid on memory and knocked at another door come he entered a large bare square room with a window which displayed the city from the quirinal to st peters he noted the bed the chest of drawers whose top was arranged as a dressingtable the writing table book case and two chairs a bath stood under the bed and there were two large tin cans of water against the wall the fastidious inmate offered a chair and remained standing in the presence hadrian signed to him to be seated also dear son you are one of the unhappy ones will you tell us your grief sanctity i have not complained no but complain i will not complain the pope liked him for that and for an air of distinction which was not breeding dialectic should be tried how old are you twentynine in which month were you born in july in england in england a rapid horoscopical calculation let hadrian know the lines on which to proceed you find your environment disagreeable all environments are more or less disagreeable to me all which you have tried up to the present perhaps perhaps the future may be more propitious sanctity i earnestly hope so but i do not expect it why not i do not know dont you find that your circumstances influence your conduct dont you find that they prevent you from doing yourself justice always in this college you have found no kindred spirit that may be my fault more likely your misfortuneand misfortunes are not faults no matter what fools say note that note also that misfortunes may be overcomebut they do not understand you here no they mock you they do why did they mock you today they did not mock me today yesterday because i carry those two cans full of water up twohundredandtwo steps every day do you mean to say that there are no baths in this college yet we may have footbaths once a week if we apply to the infirmarian there is nothing else and i like to tub decently no doubt they say that you must be a very unclean person to need so much washing sanctity you are quoting the rector the pope abruptly laughed have they ever put a snakea snakein your watercans no they have not done that they did in ours the distance between the two now became considerably lessened the fastidious person began to feel more at ease his fastidy evidently was only a chevaux de frise for the discomfiture of intruders and this delicate tender inquisitor was no intruder but a very welcomeapostle the pope continued isnt it very absurd it is very absurd also it is very disconcerting of course you try not to let it disconcert you i try but i fail my heart always is on my sleeve and the daws peck it at present i am trying to contain myself and to use myself in isolation that they call sulkiness yes how much longer must you remain here perhaps one year perhaps two can you persecute can you hold out so long oh i will hold out nothing shall deter me sanctity it is not that which makes me afraid dear son what makes you afraid the afterwards these people are to be my superiors or equalscolleagues for life i am not afraid of poverty or wickedness among the people to whom i am to minister but my brotherpriestsi shall be at the orders of some of these people my rectors my diocesans even that makes me afraid did you not know what kind of people yes i did know but i did not realize it till i came here yet you choose to persevere sanctity i must i am called you are sure of that it is the only thing in all the world of which i am sure do you always live on bread and water yes why i think the food beastly i have been into the kitchen and i have seenthings i am afraid to eat anything except boiled eggs they cannot depositsputum inside the shells of boiled eggs but the servants complained of the extra trouble in boiling eggs especially for me the bread is not made in the college in order not to be singular i eat and drink what i can eat and drink of that which is set before me and i am deemed more singular than ever have you said this to the rector yes do you like bread and water i think them both exceedingly nasty does it affect your health not in the least it makes my head ache but i am as strong as a panther why panther i really dont know it seemed to be the just word and you believe that you are able to go on i intend to go on you know that this college is not the place for you i suppose not but my diocesan sent me here and i intend to serve my sentence dear son what is your ambition priesthood with a small patrimony you would be on a more satisfactory footing here and afterward you need not take the mission oath the mere fact of the possession of a patrimony would purchase courtesy and consideration for you during your collegelife and would give you an opportunity of cultivating your individuality independently when you reach the priesthood oh yes but i am a churchstudent so were we and your sanctity persevered yes so will i what is your name william jameson hadrian took a sheet of paper and wrote the apostolic benediction to william jameson you will like to have this persevere dear son and pray for us as for your brotherinthelord anddo you know cardinal sterling well come to vatican whenever you please and make his acquaintance he will expect you goodbye god bless you the pope went down to the bald old amiability who was correct and mild enough in expressing a profound sense of the honour hadrian spoke to him of himself and found that a publicschool university and anglican parsonage had dulled what capability of emotion he ever had had or had taught him the rare art of selfconcealment he was a capital specimen of the ordinary man stinted limited one whose instinct prevented him from asserting an individuality but he was a gentleman and a christian of a kind actuated by the best intentions paralysed by the worst conventions we wish to speak to you of jameson at length the apostle said ah poor fellow now why do you say that mr guthrie well holiness im afraid hes in a most uncomfortable position im sure this is not the place for him you see he doesnt get on with the men does he quarrel with them oh dear me no but he avoids them perhaps he has his reasons well im afraid he has but then it doesnt do to shew them i often tell him sotry to chaff him into a more comeatable frame of mind you know holy father that hardly would be the way no im afraid it wasnt hes so very sensitive you see why he actually got quite angry with me what did he say well he said that he really did think i ought to have known better and what did you say then oh i called him abut i couldnt possibly tell you what i called him holy father why not well really it was too dreadful ive been regretting it ever since what did you call him oh its quite impossible that i should repeat it to you holy father i should never be able to hold up my head again nonsense mr guthrie we desire to know it im sure i dont know what youll think of me holy father but the fact is i went so far as to call him ano really i cannotwellim sure i cant think what possessed me to use such an opprobrious term but i was excessively annoyed you see at the moment and the word slipped out before i was quite conscious of what i was saying what did you call him well really if you must have it holy father i called him a goose oh and what did he do to you burst into a roar of laughter and shut his door in my face did you feel pained well perhaps just a little at the time but not when i came to think it over you see i really cant help feeling sorry for him why well because really he must be very unhappy you know holy father in your opinion mr guthrie he himself is the cause of his own unhappiness quite so holy father you see he doesnt seem to be able to rub along with the other men he cant come down to their level so to speak he keeps himself too much to himself wont or cant conciliate the least little bit of course they all think its pride on his part and they pay him out with practical jokes of a rather doubtful kind im afraid hes good and kind and clever and all that sort of thing but he hasnt the slightest idea of making himself popular as a churchstudent should be among churchstudents you see hes what i may call if i may be quite frank about him such a beastly fool the rector doesnt like it im sure then perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the fault is not so much in the man as in his environment thats what ive always said holy father his present environment is quite unsuitable for a man of that kind he must find it extremely unpleasant mr guthrie wont you try to make it more pleasant for him bear with him defend him dont seem to form a party with him against the others but dont give the others the idea that you approve of their attitude to him will you do as much as that im sure ill do anything in my power holy father that at least is in your powergod bless you the pope went on to the reception room to fetch cardinal carvale not to neglect the superiors although he was very tired he allowed them to show him rather dubious and very ugly treasures and tolerated halfanhour of vapid conversation they thought him so nice he was bored to death after conferring the usual favours he obtained a whole playday for the college notified the rector that he was carrying off a student arranged for mr jameson to visit cardinal sterling and took his departure he put his acquisition into a victoria and bade him drive to the obelisk in st peters square dreadful place hadrian ejaculated to carvale as they turned down tritone do you think you could make it decent if you were rector i would try holiness well we do not see how we can make you rector because of monsignor whatshisname but you might do something as protector gentilotto is protector holiness st andrews is subject to the cardinalprefect of propaganda only for the present carvale you will find that dear old gentilotto is quite willing and you yourself are a kelt yes thats right a keltic college should have a keltic protector carvale you are protector of st andrews college from this moment and you shall have your breve directly we get back to vatican now first of all go to oxford and ask dr strong to put you up for a week in coll and keep your eyes open do that with your first spare fortnight then come back and turn your rivers peneios and alpheios through that aygeian stable give them baths and sanity for goodness sake and try to get them into cleanly habits you might make that shrubbery into a gymnasium and swimming bath with a lovely terrace on the top and o carvale do make friends with them and see what you can do to take that horrible secretive suppressed look out of their young eyes understand i think so holiness we give you a year if we live as long as this day twelvemonth we will go again to mark your progress remember you have a free hand now heres something else tell sterling that abut nowe ourself will tell him at the obelisk they picked up hamish macleod hadrian marched him straight up to the quarters of the gentlemen of the secret chamber sir john and sir iulo stripped to the buff were punching a bag john said the pope mr macleod will be your guest for the present get him a room near your own and make him comfortable he drew the young man outside while sir iulo was lavishing his lovely english on the visitor and john reorganize his wardrobe on the scale of your own and teach him your business to cardinal sterling who came to the secret chamber hadrian explained the case of william jameson you have your opportunity he said to his eminency and one will not repeat ones previous mistake holiness was the remarkable and thankful reply no for mercys sake dont and now listen the treasurer will pay you on this order the sum of you will invest it in the bank of england on these terms the transaction is to be secret the interest on is to be paid quarterly to william jameson as long as he lives on his death the capital is to revert to the treasurer for the time being of the apostolic see instruct the bank instantly to send and the vouchers to jameson with a statement that it is his patrimony and to give him no further information then hadrian shutup himself and rested smoking and reading the reviews of unwritten books in some old numbers of the monthly review one of them caused him to think it was called thucydides report of pericles oration at the incoronation of king edward the seventh chapter xv jerry sant gnawed his rag of a moustache for a fortnight or so till it was dripping and jagged he began to have a notion that mrs crowe would like to have him elsewhere that did not disturb him for he knew that he always could compel her services when he wanted them by means of a pull on the pursestrings the mildly elegant exiguity of the circle in which she moved had no attraction for him there were not many saxpences there and he felt out of his depth in a company which he could not lead by the nose in the kingdom of the blind the oneeyed man is king he knew himself to be a oneeyed man and in the kingdom of the liblabs he naturally had been one of the kings here among the english and keltic catholics in rome he was no more than toleratedand awfully worried by people who offered him tracts of which for the life of him he could make neither head nor tail further he really seriously was annoyed that the pope had not accepted his handsome offerhad not even answered his letter he thought it most rude it is a fatal and futile thing to leave letters unanswered especially impertinent letters silence does not choke off in ninetynine cases out of a hundred it breeds bile which is bound to be spurted sooner or later it is a poor kind of a man who cannot indite a letter which is a guillotine a closure about which there can be no possible mistake by this means uncertainty and its vile consequences are prevented hadrian perfectly knew how to deliver himself his faculty for findingout other peoples thumbscrews had provided him with blasting powder if he had desired to be dynamic and he possessed bishop bagshawes celebrated threeline formula which never has been known to fail of throttling an importunate correspondent but he no more could have touched sant even with a letter than he could have touched tripe with tongs his feeling for the man was ultimate antipathy which led him to commit the common error of ignoring what ought to have been annihilated hence sants sense of spleen finally jerry had the liblabs to keep quiet those extraordinary persons were asking for something definite in the shape of news and he had no news at all to give them that was the worst of it soon some treachery or other would be hatched against him behind his back in the most approved liblab manner he would be asked for explanations for a statement of accounts he would be hauled over the coals and so onoh he obviously could not let it come to that he must make a fresh effort the time had come for playing his next card and for three days he sat at the hotel nike writing presscopy it was the cardinalsecretaryofstate who did himself the pleasure of acquainting the holy father with the result of jerry sants manuvre his eminency on the whole never had had a more congenial duty to perform in all his life he swirled into the presence one evening at dusk when hadrian was waiting for the lamps sitting by the undraped window watching the dark figures passing over the grey square and the specks of yellow light springing in the houses of the borgo ragna brought a newspaper which he thrust into the popes hands see what a scoundrel you are he truculently snarled fly all is discovered the catholic hour is exposing you finely oh said hadrian unimpassionately turning from the window and speaking with extreme frigidity light some candles please he took the paper put up his left hand to shade his eyes and looked at the sheet as he read his pontifical name and his secular name his blood began to tingle for he still loathed publicity as he read on his blood began to boil it was a frightful tale which he was readingfrightful because he saw at a glance that it was quite unanswerable it was unanswerable because there are some things of which the merest whisper suffices to destroywhose effect does not depend on truthfulness it was unanswerable because it was anonymous it was unanswerable because he never could bring himself to condescend who could have attacked him with such malignant ingenuity the names of half a dozen filthy hounds occurred to him in as many seconds but he was not able to recognise any particular paw he read on he was conscious that his face was aflame with indignation but it was in shadow coming to a clear chronological error he chuckled that taught him that his voice was under control and he remembered that the invidious eyes of ragna were upon him from time to time thereafter he produced a short contemptuous word or laugh by way of commentary as he came to excessive absurdities and so gradually he possessed himself again thus he skimmed the article at the end he looked up at the cardinal yes he said we appear to be a very disreputable character now we will go through the thing again and note the actual errors of fact he returned to the top of the first column and began to read more analytically in progress he counted aloud one twoup to thirtythree absolute and deliberate lies exclusive of gratuitous or ignorant mispresentations of fact in a column and threequarters of printwell he inquired with a full straight gaze at the attendant cardinal what are you going to do now we will ponder the matter which your eminency has submitted to us and at a convenient time we will declare our pleasure the paper may be left with us your eminency has permission to retire ragna strode towards the door at the threshold he turned and bayed abdicate no we will not abdicate said hadrian the secretaryofstate rushed away as he went swishing snarling at all and sundry through the antechamber where the gentlemen were in waiting sir iulo suddenly shotout his arms straight and rectangularly level with his shoulders swungup a stiff right leg in a verisimilar fashion rigidly sank on his left toes till he sat on his left heel recovered his first position with a jerk changed legs and repeated the performance with the right it was done in a second of time and his white teeth glittered in a grin as his muscles relaxed there are few more nerveshattering spectacles than this of a lithe and graceful young gentleman in scarlet behaving without any warning whatever exactly like a monkey on a stick manifesting the same startling descendent and ascendent angularity the same imperturbable inevitable intolerable agility cardinal ragna denounced him as a devil where he stood and swirled away in a vermilion billow of wateredsilk as soon as he was left alone hadrian made the very firmest possible act of will determining neither to bend nor to break this done he ate his supper with careful deliberation sentaway the tray and ordered a large potfull of black coffee then he locked all doors and allowed himself a period of disintegration preparatory to redintegration a period of slackness preparatory to intensification now he severely suffered he read the article on the strange career of the pope again and again till his head swam with the horror of it this was the worst thing which ever had happened to him his previous experience of newspaper libels was as nothing in comparison all through the bitter bitter years of his struggle for life he had known himself for a fighter as a fighter he had expected blows in return for those which he gave and when all was said and done his fighting had not been to him a source of unmitigated pain for one thing he had had pleasure in knowing that he scrupulously fought unscrupulous foes that he fought a losing battle that he fought a million times his weight that he fought barehanded against armed champions all the time that knowledge it wasthe knowledge that he had contended not as a hero but as heroes have contendedwhich alone had upheld him and now but this it depicted him as simply contemptible inspection of the image of himself which the catholic hour with such ferocious flocculence delineated brought him to the verge of physical nausea but it was not true real it was not himself no no it was an atrocious caricature oh yes it was an atrocious caricature everybody would know it for that would they how many had known the previous libels for libels how many had dared to proclaim the previous libels for libels oneout of hundreds oh how beastly how beastly he read the thing againand dashed the paper to the ground if it only had made him look wickedor even ridiculous but no he categorically was damned as despicable low vulgar abject mean everything which merited contempt only a strenuous effort kept him from shrieking in hysteria god god am i really like that he moaned aloud with his palms stretched upward and outward and his eyes intent in agony he lost faith in himself perhaps he was such an one perhaps his imagination after all had been deluding him and he really was an indefensible creature it was possible oh have i ever been such a dirtybeast have i he moaned again and then all the being of him suffusedand whirledand outraged nature took him in hand the blow to his selfrespect the shattering onslaught on his sensibilities were more than even his valid virile body could bear he lay back in his low chair and swooned into oblivion after the lapse of an hour he began to revive it would appear that he instantly knew what had happened for he staggered to the open window that the cold night air might reinvigorate him full consciousness by slow degrees returned and with it some measure of serenity he took up the argument at the point where he had left it no he was not like that before jesus in the pyx on his breast he was not like that so he gradually calmed himself he had done desperate deeds and foolish deeds but never ignoble deedsstayoncethat had nothing whatever to do with the present matter nor was that one ignoble deed ignoble in the esteem of anyone except himself it was smart or clever in mundane phraseology no one had been injured by it it had been atonedfor but according to the ideal code which he had made for his own guidance it was ignoble however it was not known except to himself and god and his angelguardian it was not even known to his confessor for it was not even a venial sin well then no no he had not merited the gibbet of the worlds contempt who had gibbeted him he very carefully read the paper again who in the world could have collected such a mass of apparently convincing evidence he was beginning to study the question from his usual standpoint of personal unconcern his own written words were cited in proof of the allegations here made against him he knew them for his own written words who in the world so ingeniously could have distorted their signification so skilfully could have mispresented him at some time in his life he perhaps inadvertently must have trodden upon some human worm and the worm now had turned and stung him he sought for a sign a traceand found it of courseand the motive simultaneously leaped to light it was payment of a grudge owed to him by a detected letterthief a professional infidel whom he had scathed with barbed sarcasms about ten years ago there was something more than that again he studied the paper for corroboration how came the catholic hour of all papers to publish a denunciation of him he noted that the catholic hour pretended its denunciation as being copied from the devana radical and the letterthief resided at devana and engaged in jobjournalism also he had access to more than much of the information here misused not to all of it though here and there in the article hadrians literary faculty enabled him to perceive a change of touch here and there were technical opinions and technical modes of expression which could not have emanated from that one who was responsible for these the pope of all men on gods fair earth was qualified to recognize the fine roman handthe fine roman hand at least of one of his own contemporaries at st andrews college whom he had afflicted with a ridiculous label a harmless jibe simply composed of the mans own initial and surname joined togetherthe fine roman hand of a pseudonymous editor with whom he had refused to have dealings yes and there too was the obscene touch of the female spretae injuri formae over again at last he summed up material cause information possessed the gods knew by what means by the detected letterthief and the female opinions collected from perhaps proffered by spite desirous of stabbing scorn in the back formal cause calumny that is to say slander which is false efficient cause the pontifical treatment of the representatives of the liblab fellowship now in the city final cause a intimidation b revenge it was as clear as daylight hadrian sat back in his chair and blamedhimself his mind went straight to the root of the matter it was his own fault he had not loved his neighbour he had been hard unkind austere he had cultivated his natural faculty for rubbing salt upon his neighbours rawest and most secret soresalt in the shape of biting words satire sarcasm corrosive irony labels which adhered but he had done this when fighting starknaked and alone against long odds no matter it was part of the struggle for life no matter but he would have been killednot metaphorically butliterally killed long ago how did he know thatlike all men he had been trusting in himself not in the maker of the stars as a matter of fact he did not and could not knowin his own eyes as his own judge each point of his defence failed he pleaded guilty he had not loved his neighbour his soul fled up to the divinities who severely sit upon the awful bench but there was no solace to be obtained from them he took the beautiful crucifix from his neck the pyx from his breast laid them on the table and kneeled before the sovereign of the seraphim he made an act of contrition he acknowledged his sin acknowledged that he had merited condign punishment he very humbly thanked god for giving him his punishment in this world o that my lot might lead me in the path of holy innocence of thought and deed the path which august laws ordain laws which had their birth in the highest heaven neither did the race of mortal man beget them nor shall oblivion ever put them to sleep for the power of god is mighty in them he prayed in the verses of sophokles he sent for his confessor it had been a dreadful experience he was conscious of having been shaken seriously he felt quite old his youth and strength his nerve seemed to have been tornout of him the world seemed to have slippedaway from under him yesthe world how should he meet the worldwith equanimity and fortitude what should he say and do nothing nothing his confessor arrived and he confessed that since his last confession on the previous day he had been guilty of the sin of anger also he renewed his sorrow for a sin of his past life he had not loved his neighbour the barefooted friar absolved him and commanded him to say for his penance one mass for the present and eternal welfare of all whom he had offended hadrian laidopen the catholic hour on a table where it was not concealed and whence it would not be removed tried to turn away his thought and to leave the incident behind him that the effect of it would become manifest that the memory of it would recur he knew but neither memory nor effect ever should delay his progress he spent the rest of the evening in meditation on the future at bedtime he did not go down to st peters but said his prayers by his bedside with childlike simplicity and feebleness and caredispersing sleep lit on his eyelids unwakeful very pleasant the nearest like death chapter xvi in the morning hadrian summoned gentilotto sterling whitehead carvale della volta semphill van kristen he fancied that the gentlemenofthechamber curiously eyed him that was so he guessed in a moment that now he always would have to stand the fire of curious eyes to overhear the ostentatious whispers of people who wished to be known for nasty thinkersof people who wished to see the roman pontiff wriggling on a whitehot gridiron very well he would stand fire perhaps up to a certain point he would answer questions of general but not of particular interest but there should be no merely human contortuplications their eminencies came into the throneroom where the pope was sitting rather rigidly in a hieratic attitude his hands on the arms of the chair his feet and knees closed his back straight and his head erect he was a shade more pallid than usual they each paid their respects in a different manner gentilottos mild pure visage expressed compassion mingled with a sense of personal injury the assailants of the pope also had wounded him sterlings dark face was lockedup with the look of one who is determined to be righteous under all circumstances while willing to forward to the proper quarter a recommendation to mercy on behalf of the prisoner at the bar the cardinal of st georgeofthegoldensail contained himself in personal innocence which precluded him from prancing to believe in the guilt of others della voltas pose indicated ordinary but sympathetic curiosity carvale was white and semphill was red with impatient indignation like gentilotto they both were hurt by the attack on their superior but they were up in arms van kristen was very very sad his great melancholy eyes swam in a mist of commiseration and hadrian noted that his lips rested just an instant longer than usual on the cold pontifical hand chamberlains placed stools for the cardinals and retired the pope began to speak in his usual swift and concise tone by way of emphasizing the essential difference between the church a purely missionary association and the world he had determined to disperse the vatican treasures this was not at all what their eminences had expected to hear and they were rather taken aback hadrian gave them a moment and then wenton does anyone know whether dear old cabelli is minister of public instruction now della volta gave a negative so much the better because he will be at leisure to do us a favour and now his holiness directly addressed the last speaker we place this matter in your eminencys hands you shall have a breve of commission and this is what you will do first you will collect cabelli and longhi and manciani as your board of advisers secondly with their assistance you will procure the services of the chief experts of the worldsay five thirdly you will cause these five experts to estimate the maximum and minimum values of each separate piece in the treasury this list of values you will submit to us fourthly you will have the pieces arranged and the arrangement must be indicated on the list of values in three divisions the historic the artistic and the merely valuable on account of weight or character fifthly you instantly will publish everywhere a note to the effect that the sale at fixed prices of these things will take place here from the first to the sixth of january following he paused for he saw that people wanted to speak he conceded the word to gentilotto has your holiness considered said the red pope that most of the treasures are consecrated to the service of the church yes we also have considered that the church exists for the service of god in his creatures that she does not serve either by keeping pretty and costly things shutup in cupboards that the church which set these things apart by consecration also can restore them to usefulness by desecration technically things consecrate can become desecrate by tapping them with intent to desecrate we soon will descend to the treasury and will tap all the sacred things into gems and bullion that can be done the cardinalprefect of propaganda said his heart pulled him one way heredity and ecclesiastical prejudice the other there is one thing which i think it right to mention put in della volta the present officials of the treasury and the buildingswhat will become of them the officials will continue to enjoy the stipends of their benefices they will have other and more useful occupation than the furbishing of plate provided for them as for the buildingwhen the cupboards are empty they will be removed and the treasury being no longer there the building will remain the sacristy i should like to get a word in edgeways if i may said semphill doesnt your holiness think that the italian government will interfere isnt there some law which prevents worksofart from going out of italy we should like to see the italian government interfere with us hadrian responded with a strong and illuminating smile the italian government is neither a fenian nor a fool no but the cardinal pursued your eminency need fear no opposition from that quarter is nothing to be exempted from this sale sterling thoughtfully asked there will be some exemptions the pope turned to cardinal della volta you will reserve one silvergilt chalice and paten for every priest in the palace one silvergilt pyx for every tabernacle and one plain set of pontifical regalia which we will indicate to you nothing more hereafter the court can use ornaments which are the private possessions of individuals i must say that i think the pontifical regalia deserves a better fate than conversion into bullion and gems said gentilotto nonsense the pope sharply retorted the pontifical regalia is not sacrosanct like the carthaginian zamph the frayed edges of his nerves shewed themselves i concede it the cardinal admitted hadrian rose we have summoned the sacred consistory for tomorrow morning when we will issue our decrees in this matter semphill no longer could contain himself he exploded with of course your holiness has seen the catholic hour hadrian thought that he particularly liked this cardinal today for some reason yes of course his eminency looked better during advent the ordinary vermilion made his chubby rubicundity appear too blue that was the reason oh yes the pontiff replied well really i never read anything more abominable in my life nor did we all the cardinalitial eyes were directed toward the pope he remained standing on the step of the throne and seemed to be changing into alabaster semphill lashing himself to fury continued i should like to think that something will be done about it so should we semphill prolapsed and stared but surely your holiness will do something no what not answer them no one would have thought that there would be some canonical means of bringing the catholic hour to book for aspersions against the pope sterling said there is the bull exsecrabilis of pius ii but it is not the pope who is aspersed it is george arthur rose imperturbably said hadrian thats drawing it rather fine whitehead said looking up for the first time fine enough carvale put in with appreciation of the distinction excommunicate the editor printer and publisher by name i say ejaculated semphill sterling went on one finds it difficult to understand what can have persuaded the catholic hour to insert hadrian interrupted just ask yourself this is it likely that an erse periodicaland when we say an erse periodical we mean a clerical periodical for according to mccarthy the erse clergy hold the catholic press in the hollow of their handis it likely that an erse periodical which has the infernal cheek to dub itself the organ of catholic opinion and which once called cardinal semphill awhat was it eminencyah yes a scented mashercould be expected to forego an opportunity of increasing its circulation at the expense of the vicar of christ oh very good indeed exclaimed semphill with a hearty reminiscent shout of laughter but holiness sterling gravely continued one knows that the statements are not true one knows that the article mispresents you entirely they are not wholly true and the article entirely mispresents us one would recommend that that should be made known it is known hundreds know it they are not prevented from saying what they knowif they dare hadrian came down from the throne a grey shadow hardened the sharpness of the face the brows and the eyes were drawn into parallels the latter halfshut and the thin lips were straight and cruel their eminencies mindfully retired van kristen lingered till the others were gone holy father he said i guess that youre feeling it about as bad as the next man hadrian pressed the slim brown hand on which the cardinalitial sapphire looked so absolutely lovely perhaps percy he said i think i wont go back to dynam house this fall the cardinal continued they can do without me holiness if im any good to you here im no quitter so long as my eyes remain black you always are good and useful to us venerable father the pope very stiffly said as he quickly passed through the curtains of the secret antechamber now the world had something to talk about beside the chances of universal war and the inferiority of the present pope when the dispersal of the treasures of the vatican was announced in the sacred consistory five cardinals walked straight out to swear four burst into tears eight spoke their minds quite freely and in the case of two at the top of their voices and the rest were dumb ragna berstein cacciatore and vivole came to the conclusion that hadrians new move was a pontifical redherring intended to divert the scent from the newspapercalumnies against george arthur rose they went about trying to make people see the thing from their point of view kelts and catholics throughout the world set up howls and compared hadrian to honorius to the advantage of the latter from a catholic point of view wrote one clerical gentleman who in youth as an attach in paris had been known as la belle anthropophage it is impossible to blame hadrian too severely he was ruined they said with unctuous rectitude and he was going to sell the vatican treasures in order to provide an iniquitous provision for a disreputable and private old age naturally they judged by their own standard all catholics do the liblab fellowship congratulated itself on the possession of such a fellowshipper as sant his diplomacy was thought cute socialists hourly expected to hear that the scarlet unutterable in sheer despair had asked to be allowed to seek a refuge in their ranks jerry sant satup all night at the hotel nike in case the pope should be moved to escape from a throne which had been made too hot for him in the event of such an escape of course his most reverent lordship would come and try and make peace with them as he had put to so much unnecessary trouble and expense so the liblab cut and dried his plans he would administer the oaths to gods vicegerent take his entrancefee and annual subscription in advance and admit him as a fellowshipper then as his senior comrade he would order him back to vatican to use his popery for carrying out the schemes of labor against capital incidentally he would take the opportunity of transferring some of the pontifical capital from a man as didnt to a man as did deserve it however jerry gave himself two sleepless nights for nothing he would have been better though perhaps not quite so comely in bed and then on the third day mrs crowe rushed in displaying a tantrum which was a blend of joy and hate and fear i suppose this is your work mr sant she said bringing a cutting from the catholic hour out of her chainbag imphm jerry grinned like an oblong gargoyle oh how could you say such things about him i do think it shocking of you wumman hae ye nat telled me maist o they things yersel yes of course but i never thought youd put it all in the papers a havena pit them a theres a plenty moreif he hasna had his paiks yet o but im sure he has i expect youve simply stunned him maybe i have havent you heard from him yet a havena am expecting to hear the now mr sant if youve killed my george illi dont know what ill do but ill never forgive you hech wumman that wont kill him but it may make him a bit sore and ill let you know that hell come here for his plaster i dont mind him being sore he deserves it after the way hes behaved to me but now just you tak yersel away i cant have you messing about here when rose comes when im through with him ill forward him to you so you be off with you clumsy beast said mrs crowe to herself when she stood in two shambles street again youd much better have left it to me to arrange i shouldnt be surprised if georgie did something desperate now it ld be just like him and i believe i could have coaxed him she hailed a victoria and drove to st peters square to have another look at the window the pope gave the holy order of priesthood to cardinal van kristen on innocents day his holiness felt that the sacerdotal prayer of so innocent a one would benefit all the english and american invasion of rome beat the record for the winter season at a carpandpunch supper at palazzo caffarelli on christmas eve it was remarked that the city just then contained all the worlds multimillionaires if war had been carried on in the antique manner ie for ransoms and spoils and if any power had possessed a sufficient military equipment a new sack of rome would have been an exceedingly lucrative undertaking however as it was rome sacked the multimillionaires despite the fact that the coming spring was likely to see the dawn of armageddon an astonishing number of people was unable to resist the temptation to purchase the treasures of the vatican the list of prices assigned by the experts had been submitted to hadrian who struck the mean between maximum and minimum greatly to the disgust of curialists who when once the idea was grasped were anxious to drive good bargains they suggested an auction which the pope incontinently refused saying that he was going to compete neither with tradesmen nor with brigands he made it easy for museums to acquire historic specimens the merely artistic chiefly went to private collectors and the world acquired the valuables the collection of lace alone fetched and the total takings amounting to fourandthirty millions sterling were deposited in the bank of italy signor panciera made it a great deal more than convenient to accept another invitation to the vatican this time it was a short visit which he paid and a fairly momentous one the pope did all the talking his holiness spoke dryly and concisely from a sheet of manuscript which he afterwards handed to the ambassador and seemed to be consumed by some internal fire the signs of which appeared in his white paindrawn face he said that he had noted with approbation the scheme of signor gigliotti by which innoculated convicts were employed in the reclamation of malarious apulia and calabria he wished italy to establish and endow farmcolonies in eucalyptus groves on the roman campagna where a wholesome and industrious life could be found for inoculated boys and girls he wished italy to establish and endow almshouses for old people and free schools where handicrafts would be taught to children he wished italy to establish and endow scholarships for the study of italian archology the idea being to foster a spirit of enthusiastic patriotism by excavating and studying and preserving the buried cities and monuments and treasures of antiquity with which the sacred and glorious and inviolate soil of italy simply teems lastly he wished italy to give rewards say of a thousand lire in cash to every man and woman between twenty and thirty years of age who had served one master or secular firm since ladyday and who cared to claim such a reward to give effect to his four wishes he handed to signor panciera an order on the bank of italy payable to the prime minister of italy for the time being the value of the order was thirtythree millions sterling it was an offering in honour of the thirtythree years during which god as man had laboured for the love of men it was to be the nucleus of a national fund which was to be called the household of christ this fund was to be administered on the lines stated by one male member of the royal family of italy the prime minister and the minister of the interior for the time being and by nine trustees drawn in rotation from the list of nobles in the golden book the first of these twelve was to hold his trusteeship for life and was to be nominated by the kings majesty within one year from the present date the second and third were to be exofficio trusteeships of the nine nobles three would retire each year and the next three on the roll would succeed them no ecclesiastics were to be concerned with the fund in any way unless they were nobles eligible for trusteeship or unless they were paid servants appointed as chaplains by the trustees hadrians particular desire was that the household of christ should become in every sense a department of the government of italy signor panciera came out reeling and furiously drove in the direction of monte citorio here he picked up signor zanatello and the two carried their little basketful of news to the queenregent in the quirinale eleven minutes in her majestys musicroom sufficed to send the three quickly through the hall of birds and upstairs to the marconigraph office by which means they announced the scheme to victor emanuel at windsor castle the sovereigns reply was characteristically italian and therefore splendid i add a million the queen adds a million the prince of naples adds a million all sterling the prime minister sent the nations thanks and asked his majesty to nominate himself as trustee he got this gorgeous answer the trustees will be nicknamed the popes twelve apostles the voce della verit and the osservatore romano instantly would assign to me the rle of judas signor panciera sent this message sire there was a thirteenth apostle the king retorted but he was an afterthought that made queen elena laugh the king continued zanatello take this money give a receipt in the name of italy the queenregent will issue a royal decree constituting the household of christ as a government department i nominate the duke of aosta as the royal trustee this scheme is just what italy wants at this moment give it effect at once zanatello implored his majesty to become trustee no came the final response i will assist most strenuously in an unofficial capacity when there is room for a thirteenth apostle i will perpend meanwhile i engage to double the fund within one year the king of england will assist hadrian first read about the acceptance of the gift to italy in the next days populo romanoone of the most respectable papers in the world he used to say he felt that he had achieved another step and instantly proceeded to the next he summoned the syndic of rome and made over to him as a free gift to the city all the moveable sculpture paintings tapestry and archological specimens then present in the vatican simultaneously he canonized dom bosco and dante alighieri and published the epistle to the italians this document was mainly hortatory and directed against disbelief and secret societies he bade italy to consider herself as the temple of art in europe and to set herself by the contemplation of masterpieces of human workmanship already in her possession or to be added to her possession by future discovery to produce herself as a country and a people prepared for the lord who is altogether lovely he spoke of the mafia with admiration and with horror it was a brotherhood rather than a society he said it was a brotherhood of individualists each devoted to the service of his brother its essential virtues were honesty mutual help selfrestraint nothing could be better but the devil had distorted the operation of so excellent a scheme his iniquity tempted the mafiosi not only to help each other in good deeds but in evilchiefly in evil deeds they murdered and screened murderers and forgot thou shalt do no murder they robbed and screened robbers and forgot thou shalt not steal they alleged that mazzini had welded them into a corporate body for political purposes and had given them for a motto mazzini autorizza furti incendi avvelenamenti from the initials of which phrase they drew their corporate name in place of that wicked and abominable sentence he gave them madonnina applaude fraternit individualita amore let the mafia flourish with that motto for its ruling principle italy was seeing the burden of poverty removed from her children was seeing her youth enabled to cultivate talents was seeing the honest labour of her manhood and womanhood rewarded was seeing refuge and provision prepared for old age rome set herself nobly to work at housing the treasures of art which hadrian had given immense and splendid palaces were planned for them and began to rise on the esquiline and celian hills and the gracious forms of the old gods were to stand beneath arcades of marble white and pure as lilies without mosaic of bright gold within amid the groves upon janiculum honest men came by their own there were no unemployed consequently no hearts were soured while hands were used and anarchy began to fade away into the obscurity of bad old rubbish rejected the epistle to the italians too they were in the mood to listen to anything and everything from that dear little piece of omniscient omnipotent omnipresent aloofness whom they called papa inglese to the strong and simple italian temper his words carried conviction by reason of their own essential simplicity and strength he speaks like ones own conscience said caio and tizio and also sempronio hearken and obey him then invected maria and elena and also margherita chapter xvii italy was not first in the heart of hadrian she was third he served her because he saw her instant need the second of his loved lands did not know herself to be in need of him hence he offered her no more than courtesy he did not want america to tell him not to monkey with the buzzsaw and england was first and what could he do for england the thought that he might do something alone sustained him now life among the millions of articulatelyspeaking men had become an everpresent horror to him he frequently wondered what prevented him from hurling himself from the windows on to the stones of rome he actually sent for a case of safetyrazors and banished knives from the pontifical apartments o for the wings for the wings of a dove then far away far away would i fly there was a boy named roebuck who sang that in new college chapel in commemoration week five and twenty years before the golden voice the incomparable young voice came back to him in golden rome where he was longing to be at rest a scarlet arm held back the bluelinen curtain of the door and cardinal leighton entered i think we missed this holy father he said and offered a morethanamonthold copy of the catholic hour hadrian in a moment dragged himself erect physically and psychically he took the paper and read we have received a long letter from dj taking us to task for exposing george arthur rose in a way which he calls savagely cruel he says i thank god that i cannot appreciate the humour which speaks gaily of a man enduring eighteen months of semistarvation and at the same time struggling hard to earn a livelihood by his penfor the honesty of his strugglings i can vouch whatever his past may have beenand i believe that your article is in the main erroneoussurely it is better to leave it as past as a convert he had to endure for the faith that is in him once before in his chequered career at a moment when he had a means of living by his own hands within his grasp a gratuitous newspaper attack snatched from him the support which he had made himself to lean on at the present time he is leading an existence which is bitter enough to himself and quite harmless not to say beneficial to others and i feel compelled to tell you that i look upon your onslaught as both criminal and disgraceful another correspondent writes i was much grieved at your article called strange career etc in your issue of nov th because i am a great admirer of some books which george arthur rose published before he was made pope those books did more to convert me to catholicism than any others and i am very sorry to read the account that you have printed of their author yet another correspondent writes it may be well to inform your readers that the austin white who wrote the very offensive letters headed rhypokondylose religion in the jecorian courier some few years back is the george arthur rose alias the pope of rome about whom your readers were so amply enlightened in the columns of your issue of th november in reply to dj we may say that we hold in our hand a letter which rose addressed to an excellent priest in it concludes i regret for your sake the exposure which inevitably must take place when her brotherinlaw the bishop becomes cognizant of the undue influence which you use in order to embezzle these sums from lady mostingham i beg you to make amends and to withdraw from such degrading transactions before it is too late if our correspondent dj still thinks it was not advisable for us to savagely and cruelly denounce the author of that last letter we can only say we differ from him hadrian read the screed with indignant scorn it was the beastly english of the vulgar thing more than the vile sentiments expressed which put him into such a violent rictus of contempt he looked out of the window at nothing for a moment to conceal his disgust finding that cardinal leighton waited he controlled himself and turned round with a gaze of frigid inquiry yes he said would to heaven that you would grant me a trifling favour his eminency quoted in greek it was a most artful and invariably successful dodge to approach the pontiff in his favourite tongue he recognized the quotation and capped it with the succeeding verse tell me as quickly as you can and i at once shall know may i ask a question did you write that letter holy father which the last yes what did you know everything may i say that the amount of knowledge of men which you seem always to possess is quite extraordinary said the cardinal blinking no it is not to those who indeed suffer righteousness bringeth knowledge the pontiff quoted from aischylos again the greater the detachment from the world over worldly things the greater power is gained some true poet sings we never were a man among men we had five senses and we used them and all the men whom we ever met habitually and voluntarily came and told us their secrets we never sought them they were laid bare before us and our senses perceived them that is all the pontifical voice was hard and cruel the face was harder and more cruel and also more terrible the very presence was like a candent flame good honest innocent leighton looked at him as at something inhuman but he persevered holiness i want to go on do you know who wrote the other letters oh yes dj was another excellent priest he was in philosophy when we were in theology at maryvale why you know him too leightonhe took his ba with ambrose what gionde yes of course i knew him thats the man we have not heard from him for years but he evidently thought it right to defend us poor chap a snub rewards him the catholic hour differs from him a tipsy publican wrote the second and the third was written by a jesuit jackal in return for the custom of and most likely at the dictation of the very detestable scoundrel to whom we wrote the last what became of him the bad priest i mean he ruined himself as we predicted he persisted in his career of crime till his bishop found him out then he was broken and disappearedmaison de sant or something of that sort for a time hes in one of the colonies now and he might have been lord cardinal we have said too much it is not our will and pleasure to move in this matter but the advantage i derive from hearing your holinessif it is not impertinentholiness i venture to assure you of my eternal fidelity leighton stammered with emotion hadrian shewed him no face turned to the window which displayed the panorama of intangible rome and presently was alone god god he exclaimed shaking the paper with terrific violence do you see this brutal cynical unrighteousnessprejudgedcondemnedthe mere suggestion of defence derided and fleeredatin england fairminded englandengland the land of the free no it was not england but just a handful of the vicious vermin which infest her englandthe word summoned him to his apostolature again what was the mind of england now that question occupied him he wished that england would declare her mind to him through ambassadors the mind of the statesmen of england he had no official acquaintance with any one of them he could not ask for englands confidence for being english he knew that asking slams the door humanly speaking he had nothing to guide him in the cosmic crisis of the present the crisis in which he was certain to be consultedas a last resortbut certain to be consulted of that he was convinced a short calculation displayed jupiter passing through aries which signified immense benefit to england oh very good then what should be his course of action he got up and went round the room looking at the maps and noting them until it seemed that his mental horizon expanded and enlarged and he had the whole of the orb of the earth within his vision what should he say or do for england when she was too shy too proud to give him a sign as to what she wanted him to say or do england englandland of hope and gloryhow shall we extol thee who are born of theewider still and wider shall thy bounds be set god who made thee mighty make thee mightier yet he would say and do that which was given to him to say or do as an englishman he had his intuitions and he required no confidences england the shy the proud should be served by her shy proud son the servant of the servants of god the divine afflatus of patriotism inspired him brightening his eyes erecting his head he sat down again took his writingboard on his knees and wrote anon he rang the bell and gave some orders also he sent some written slips of cyphers to the operators in the vatican marconigraph office on the twentysecond of january the supreme pontiff descended to the basilica of st peterbythevatican and sang mass for the repose of the soul of queen victoria the great the good the same day the english newspapers announced that his holiness had sent a cardinalablegate to place the golden rose the pontifical tribute to virtuose queens on her majestys tomb in the mausoleum at frogmore chapter xviii the italian socialists having been won for italy and the german socialists by the german emperor the british socialists began to wonder where they themselves came in the predilection for forming societies which is to be metwith among all the degenerate and hysterical may assume different forms criminals unite in bands as lombroso expressly establishes hence the british socialists in their quandary held fatuous meetings hoping to generate a policy in an atmosphere of hot envious man they really did want to know their exact position for in some indefinable way they were beginning to feel that they were by no means as necessary to the universe as they had imagined themselves to be it seemed as though this planet for one were moving quite easily without them and what was more annoying on a path which was quite strange to them a comfortable path and a desirable they felt that they were being left out in the cold and as their nature was they looked about for some safe person on whom to void their spleen they began with the roman pontiff that an archaic potentate of his calibre should prove to be fresh and actual and vigorous struck them as something of a nuisance they had deemed him hardly worth consideration a decayed relic of antiquity useful perhaps as a monument of the bad old days when the world was drowned in damnable idolatry but nothing more that any man whose reputation so publicly had been besmirched as his had been should dare to hold up his head to live and move and have his being to dispose of millions of money and of the minds of nations struck them as simply atrocious he had refused the honour of their alliance had scorned their overtures with contemptuous silence they would return him scorn for scorn they would shew him what he had lost if he flattered himself that his so called epistles to this that and the other would have any influence the sooner he was undeceived the better the liblab fellowship soon would let an unhappy old drawler of platitudinous flapdoodle like hadrian know his place quoth the blameless comrade bob matchwood all the same amid all the rhapsodic rhodomontade of sound and fury signifying nothing there remained among the fellowshippers just enough intellect to perceive one thing comrade frank conollan put on his pincenez and with a spasm of jerks and twitches was delivered of the opinion that the liblab fellowship could not hope to recover anything like a respectable position in the popular estimation as long as it remained where it was he said that to blink the fact that liblabbery had taken a false step in approaching the pope of rome was not a bit of good liblabbery had courted a snub and had been smitten with the snubbiest of snubs if he might use a metaphorical expression he would say that liblabbery had been enticed into a bog and made to look unspeakably silly if he might use a poetical expression from shakespeare he would say like unbackd colts they pricked their ears advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses and calflike followd through toothd briers pricking goss and thorns which enterd their frail skins into the filthy mantled pool where dancing up to the chins the foul lake oerstunk their feet it began to dawn upon the liblabs that the comrade was doing the very thing desired he was leading up to the customary denunciation of some traitor he was about to provide them with the name of the usual scapegoat they prolonged pleased ears in his direction he would go further he would say still using the expressions of the immortal bard of avon your fairy which you say is a harmless fairy has done little better than played the jack with us this was something like the meetings ears positively flapped and then being unable to keepon his pincenez any longer by reason of a steamed nose he brought his climax to an abrupt term by demanding the instant and public expulsion of comrade jerry sant that was voted nem con the liblab fellowship shookoff the dust of its dirty feet at the traitor and comrade mat matchwood said some very slighting things about him in the salpinx no one is so facile and energetic about believing evil as a pessimist that is to say a socialist and when one traitor is detected what could be more natural than for others to be suspected it happened so the mutual jealousy the flaring incompetency the sordid selfishness which always infected the socialist demagogues and of course the essentially sandy foundation upon which the socialist system was based led to further and more fatal dissensions suspicion mated with baffled purpose recrimination was the offspring of the match the fellowshippers who had connived at the scheme of jerry sant found themselves accused as his accomplices and denounced and expelled in turn from dissension it was no more than one step to disunion each demagogue fearful lest he should have to take up an honest trade for a livelihood devoted persuasive loquacity to the attracting of personal supporters burnson battened on battersea west ham went awhoring after strange bills glasgow got into the galley of kerardy and devana succumbed to a splitthumbnailed and anarchistic plumber schisms within schisms insued dens and caves received the remnants of the liblab fellowship mutual damnation was the order of the day the socialists were almost christian the ranks were thinned by internecine war then came desertions socialism didnt pay and socialists openly asked conservative agents for tory gold when it was refused they swore after their kind labor without the u looked about for the patronage of capital and british socialism was in a fair way to perish of its own radical fatuity and instability hadrian watched the process of disintegration from his tower in rome watched the natural absorption of the more respectable socialists by the more respectable community and he was glad very soon now the silly obscene heresy would die and disappear with the obsolete delusions of gymnosophists anabaptists picards adamites and turlupins hadrian was glad then came the times announcing that australia canada and south africa had armed all healthy males between the ages of and and that england was mobilizing the seaandlandforces of her empire now the whole world was in battle array he took out his pyx again and prayed the prayer of the danaides o king of kings most blessed of the blessed most perfect mighty one of the perfect be persuaded and let this come to passavert from thy race the insolence of men who for a reason hate it and plunge the blackbenched pest into the dark abyss it was a pagan enough prayer for a pope to utter it was a fierce enough sentiment for an altruist to express it was an entirely comprehensible suggestion of a misanthrope and misogynist tired by impatient of armed against the tiresome divarication of little silly people the thing which troubled him most was the irreconcilability of the king of italy he had tried hard to give victor emanuel to understand that not rebuff but welcome waited for him he knew the benefits which cooperation of pope and king would bring yet the expression of the persian fatalist in herodotus the bitterest of all griefs to see clearly and yet to be unable to do anything might have stood as the motto of his whole mind as often before in his life so most emphatically now he recalled the cardinal of caerleon the blameless sant and his companion were in a pretty pickle expulsion from the liblab fellowship included not only the withdrawal of funds but also a threat of prosecution on a charge of obtaining money on false pretences the last they could afford to laugh at no english court of law could or would convict upon the evidence producible the first was tiresome but of course they had a little put by and with regard to the future mrs crowe now was quite certain that jerry had made a mess of things she began to think with longing of her lodginghouse what was the good of staying on in rome yes and who was going to pay her expenses she would like to know she impatiently put that point before her paymaster he didon a forensic air and asked for time to advise himself of the matter she demanded how long he would require he remarked on the feminine propensity for kicking a man who has been knocked down and ramped and raved till he thoroughly frightened her your pict is a truly awesome figure when he is red with damp rage she shrank into a corner whimpering for she thought he was going to strike her instead of that he cooled to sudden wheedling and anon he cuddled her she permitted it was better than nothing and she felt as though she really needed something of the sort how could she so misunderstand him of course he was not going to desert her they both were in the same boat and must sink or swim together for his part he intended to swim she might have known that he was not the man to give up when matters had proceeded so far but she urged what could they do do they could do a fair lot of things to begin with they could go and wait on a lot of they old cardinals and mak theirsels a nuisance they went to ragna and told him very pretty stories their statements were as a treat of almonds to him but he gave no sign of that he was suave polite said that he would see what could be done and bowed them away they went to whitehead and got no satisfaction caerleon thought that they had better let matters rest carvale denied himself to them sterling listened to them with judicial gravity and gave them no response semphill blazed at them and dismissed them shattered as to their nerves they returned to the hotel nike to wait for ragna the cardinals discussed them with the pope the secretary of state was insinuatory he spoke of the terrible scandal and let it be understood that in his opinion payments should be made to stop it he hinted at the impossibility of defending the indefensible better to use that million the balance of the sale of the vatican treasure that million had paid the expenses of the sale and of the restoration of the sacristy and had endowed st georges college of historical researchers under the presidency of dr richard barnett it was accounted for in della voltas balancesheet hadrian put in carvale added that payment never stopped scandal caerleon earnestly hoped that nothing would be done it would rake up the past and involve so many people semphill yearned for the good old days faggots tonguetearing handchopping earcropping headcutting eyegouging maiming and stoning and the groaning with much wailing of those impaled by the spine and all that sort of thing out of the eymenides he loudly said so and was silenced by a look from the pontiffs scornful anguished face discussion languished then hadrian said bring them here sir iulo pitpitpitpitted across the city on a motorbicycle and burst into via due macelli a scarlet hermes with the annunciation you are summoned to attend our most holy father in the vatican mrs crowe hiccoughed at last and bolted upstairs to put on her most fetching hat jerry sant grinned spikily through a tattered moustache the two got into a hired victoria and followed the gentlemanofthesecretchamber hadrian received them in the throneroom he did not occupy the throne but the central chair of a semicircular group of five ragna sterling leighton and caerleon used the others the latter had a pigskin portfolio on his knee in front of the ecclesiastics were two chairs of equal importance the man and woman lounged there it was quite a family gathering but between the church and the world sir john stood by a little table furnished with the pontifical phonographs we have summoned you in order that ye may speak your minds to us the supreme pontiff said but ye shall know that we will not hold any communication with you except our utterances and yours be recorded by these instruments his voice was very frigid but there was neither menace nor offence in it his quiet tone totally was at variance with the furious defiance of the matter of his words the paradox disconcerted his hearers sant went magenta with wrath remembered how much he had at stake and was canny enough not to demur with an attempt at an easy laugh he said that it was a little unusual not quite what he expected but he didnt want to be unpleasant to his lordship and so he had no objection he was sure and he lolled in his armchair as who should say am fair easy mrs crowe bit her upper lip but said that she had no objection either hadrian waved his hand and the pontifical gentleman sat down and set the machines in motion the pope put the woman to the question madam what do you want face to face with that she failed to put her want in words it was an acrid pungent permanent want nottobenamed she bit at her upper lip again and looked at jerry for a lead he proceeded i think reverend sir that it will be more advantageous for all parties if i was to speak for mrs crowe we will concede the point sir what do you want the pontiff said then the virtuous jerry also began to flounder want eh but he wanted several things name them the pope commanded wellreparationdamages for what the pope inquired for ma loss of time whiles ive had to be here and for ma business which ye may says gone ta th dogs and for the loss of ma liblab fellowship to what extent have you suffered to fhat extent well ill let ye know ive been here since last july say eight months say forty weeks say three hundred days and i take ordinarily a poundnote per day on journeys for expenses but its cost me a heap more than that this trip ye can call it five hundred pounds for outofpocket expenses then theres ma business which ive had to neglect eight months better say a year at onefifty for salary and commissionssay another fifty theres eight hundreds then theyve had the cheek to expel me as a fellowshipper as i suppose yeve heard of course thats very damaging to ma prestige say to the extent of a couple of thousands fhats that come to two thousands eight hundredsmay as well call it three thousands and of course theres fhat old krooger named moral and intellectual damagei dont know fhat tae pit that at im surebut ye might tot it all up together and call it twenty thousands and your companion aweel yed better double it and well both ca quits forty thousands cash the pope cast a slight look round upon his cardinals they returned it you are demanding that we should pay you forty thousand pounds he said to the expectant jerry thats correct why do you demand this sum of us why why because weve run into all these expenses on your account if ye hadna have been here neither would we have come and have had all this fuss and bother whos to indemnify us for that but yersel im asking ye ill let ye know weve fair ruined oursels the bald she interrupted if i could have a private word with your holiness the motive did not escape hadrians notice daughter your conduct and your notorious proclivities debar you from a private interview with any clergyman except in the open confessional then in the confessional the pope rose and beckoned her to follow he beckoned sir john to stop the machines and remain the others to follow they descended into st peters there he turned out the english confessor and took his place while the woman kneeled at the left side just out of earshot the four cardinals stayed with sant who fumed in his inward parts fhat blathers was this going on under their very noses the halfdoor and the window both were open only the lateral partition divided the priest from the penitent the grating was between their faces and though they were perfectly visible they were visible apart and separate hadrian in a low tone recited may the lord be in thine heart and on thy lips and put himself to listen through the grating there came a whine georgie my child there is no georgie here but only your judge confess your sins if you willonly to almighty god shew contrition and by his authority committed to me his minister i will absolve then the devil entered into her she incoherently spluttered i have no sinsif i had i wouldnt tell youyou reject meoh ill make you regret itill make you suffer as i haveill shew you up for what you are she stiffened and rushed across to jerry now do your worst she said and her face was livid sant gripped the lapels of his grotesque frockcoat and approached the white figure which emerged from the central compartment of the confessional i should like to mak an end of this matter he said hadrian led the way to the throneroom the phonographs were set to work and the conference was resumed now said jerry im thinking that your right reverence had better let us know definitely fhat ye intend to do the pope spoke rather more slowly and with more singular mildness than before you demand that we should pay you forty thousand pounds in reparation for damage which you say we have caused thats so it is useless to point out to you that we did not ask you to waste your time in rome i should have been surprised if ye had have and that we did not force you or induce you to neglect your business nae ye never thought id have dared to face ye as i have and that we were in no wise concerned with your expulsion from the liblab fellowship but ye were if yed have had the civility to give the deputation a satisfactory answer or even to have satisfied the fellowshippers afterwards or to have made it all right with me so as i could have settled them then there wouldnt have been all this trouble and unpleasantness my lord some men are gifted with an abnormal capability for making the greatest possible fools of themselves for the credit of the human race it must be said that indecent exhibitions of this kind are rare mr sant does it not occur to you that you are engaging in a very foolish and a very dirty business dirty business yersel whore ye talking to ma hands are as clean as yours any day who owes twenty pound notes to this lady im brought with me we do not know imphm well suppose i was to say it was yersel you would tell an officious lie mr sant the pope turned to the woman madam do we owe you twenty pounds you owe me a great deal more than that she barked mr sant alludes to a specific sum of twenty pounds odd which was due to this ladys deceased husband for books newspapers and stationery supplied some years ago when he kept a shop the pope explained to the cardinals with a gesture to talacryn the cardinal of caerleon extracted a slip from the portfolio and read a receipt for the amount named plus per cent interest this document was dated the thirtyfirst of the previous march the pope continued you know madam that we paid this bill the moment we were in a position to pay it you also know that payment was long delayed solely because you yourself by calumniating and libelling us to our employers and to those who called themselves our friends prevented us from earning more than a bare sustenance jerry burst in well if yeve paid her why shouldnt ye pay me because we do not owe you anything then ye mean me ta pit some more about ye in the papers listen mr sant we look upon you as a deeply injured man hech now thats something like we look upon you as a deeply injured man injured by himself you have been your own enemy you have suffered loss and damage simply because you have allowed yourself to persist in doing silly things and wicked things now is it useless to ask you to change all that will you turn over a new leaf and begin your life again you shall not be left alone you shall be helped a want ma money if you wish to do well for yourself if you wish honestly to earn a better living than you ever have earned you shall have the opportunity an appeal to a goodness which is not in him is to a vain and sensitive soul a stinging insult jerrys face became wetter and redder and fhat about damages for the past he barked you shall have a chance for the future then ye willna pay ye want me to shew ye up in the papers again you may put what you please in the papers we will not pay even a farthing to prevent you mr santnot one farthing then im not to get anything at a threat no nothing defiance hurled denial at the brute fhat are we waiting here for wumman sant snarled at mrs crowe here lets get out of this he makes me fair sick with his holy preaching at the door he turned round bragging boldly like a cock beside his partlet and waved his bowler hat eeeh but all mak ye squirm ye inseck he foamed ragna was furious holiness why dont you shoot them at once you are sovereign within these walls give order for their arrest before they leave the palace holiness and have them shot it is our will that they be left to the common executioner the pope disdainfully ordained sitting very hieratically in his chair young rigid and terrific as the flamen virbialis the audience had been a fresh phase of agony to him he had tried to merge his humanity in his apostolature and had failed and the failure was torment physical poignant he was indignant and he was dangerous their eminencies inquiringly looked at him leighton blinked and thought it a dreadful pity talacryn was for running out and trying to persuade the blackmailers even at some costanything was better than scandal he said the pope told him not to be a stupid fool with his infernal hankerings after compromise fancy paying for silence his holiness scornfully adjoined no but holy father i think if you were to leave them to me i could find some way of silencing them silence is what we want indeed whatever your eminency is well skilled in the art of silencing people bad and good it is by no means an honourable art and you are prohibited from practising it we believed that you had ceased to practise it in were we in error no indeed no indeed holiness it was merely a suggestion of mine indeed the cardinal burbled drop it then the pontiff slammed at him indeed i do holiness indeed i do whatever one would hardly have believed that such blatant wickedness could have existed in the world sterling gravely meditated holy father it will all begin again leighton sadly sighed let it begin again hadrian challenged whiteflaming irate retiring to the secret chamber their eminencies went out through the other door they were not at all pleased with the pope in the first antechamber several cardinals were congregated anxious for news orezzo and courtleigh each in a sedanchair percy fiamma della volta semphill carvale and whitehead ragna was of opinion that the charges ought publicly to be answered that is to say if they could be answered but could the accusations satisfactorily be disposed of no one put the question but the aroma of the idea of it was in the air there was so much mystery about his holiness orezzo said there always has been he is a most incomprehensible creature indeed talacryn pronounced one might expect anything everything of him the height and depth of good and bad extreme virtue extreme vice one almost could believe him to be capable of anything sterling adjudicated oh yes until you have heard him explain little carvale put in did none of your eminencies ever watch him in his talk i have shall i tell you the difference between our holy father and ourselves we see things from a single viewpoint he sees things from several we decide that the thing is as we see it but he has seen it otherwise and he presents it as a more or less complete coaction of its qualities see this sapphire well you see the face of it underneath if i take it off my finger there are a number of facets to be seen and a number more which are hidden by the gold of the setting now my meaning is that our holy father has seen all the facets as well as the table of the sapphire or the thing consequently he knows a great deal more about the sapphire or the thing than we do you must have noted that in him you must have noted how that every now and then when he deigns to explain he makes mysteries appear most wonderfully lucid but if one might venture to ask how often does he condescend to explainexcept to his cat sterling interjected im bound to admit that he opened my eyes considerably during that fortnight we spent together in town just before his election courtleigh threw out of his chair ragna went to him and spoke of the desirability of capital punishment well anyhow i believe in him whitehead murmured yes leighton energetically blinked youll excuse me if im shoppy but i say with st anselm neque enim quro intelligere ut credam sed credo ut intelligam nam et hoc credo quia nisi credidero non intelligam the gong in the secret chamber loudly and suddenly sounded the scarlet limbs of sir john and sir iulo darted towards it talacryn was shaking an unwilling dubious head van kristen gave him a tall look of disgust well i guess your eminency will feel pretty small some day if you dont believe in him too there are no flies on hadrian and he stalked away with the dignity of a grand boy honourably enraged no no percy said talacryn running after him of course i believe in him but just for that reason i dont want him to defend himself i want to keep him quiet i think it unwise to rake up the past there would be so many frightful scandals whatever have you told him that have i not indeed and what did he say talacryn once more shook his head well then i advise your eminency to go way back and sit down as we say in the states newspaper tirades did begin again the previous attacks on the pope almost were forgotten horribly pungently palatetickling though they were at a time when mens minds were filled with wars and rumours of wars but the fleet street fishers who knew their business were aware that the public appetite is capricious and must be tempted with a variety of bait even wars and rumours of wars are apt to pall one must not cry wolf too often tired of blackgnats trout must be tried with mayflies for newspapers must be sold or the soapandcocoa people will quake and newspapers will not sell unless their news are new so when the editor of the daily anagraph received a couple of letters from jerry sant and mrs crowe proffering certain tasty information and asking for an offer for same he consulted his proprietors the subject certainly was not entirely novel but what had gone before merely had been so to speak an appetizer this was the strong meat the pice de rsistance in the banquet of garbage sant was in possession of exclusive information the publication of it would mean a boom for the paper editors cannot afford to be curious about the morals of their contributors or indeed of anything bar the quality of their contributions neither proprietors nor editor were actuated by any sort of malice personal or professional in defaming the pope their motive was merely commercial therefore they offered apiece to sant and his accomplice and they invested a similar sum in amateur investigations at intervals during the next few weeks the daily anagraph published articles reflecting on the character of gods vicegerent and two columns daily were set apart for anonymous exparte statements concerning his career oh it all began again the points insisted on were that he was and never had been anything but a lazy luxurious the second intention was debauched jesuitical machiavellian and falsepretentious ignoramusoh it all indubitably began again mediocrities entrusted with power over their fellowcreatures invariably develop into tyrants all history proves it the tyranny of the clergy was bad enough but it was as nothing in comparison with the sordid tyranny of the press which we now complacently tolerate calumny culminated with a concoction of the calvous crowes it was admitted that the highwater mark was reached hitherto the very virulence of the assaults had engendered a certain amount of unexpressed sympathy among stockbrokers naval varsity and other thoughtful men our representative had called at archbishops house had interviewed monsignor this and monsignor canon that inviting the candid expression of opinion on the subject of pontifical infallibility as viewed in the fight of recent journalistic enterprize and research the distinction between infallibility and impeccability had been impressed upon our representative but that was all no defence was offered either by the pope or by his poor benighted papists then by slow degrees the elect the intelligent began to persuade themselves that after all the early misdemeanours of george arthur rose if they were as stated were altogether apart from the pontifical acts of hadrian the seventh the latter distinctly were admired throughout the world the formerwell they were a pity so public opinion was and then came mrs crowe she had a song to sing oh of secret debauchery on the part of hadrian the seventh she was concise in the matter of names and dates and places she alleged that at dusk on a certain evening in september the th she herself had seen the pope disguised in black like an ordinary priest taking teahe who never ate in publicwith two nameless women far too beautiful to be respectable in her opinion in a house on via morino she was in the street his socalled holiness and his female companions were by the lighted window presently the blinds were closed and she knew not what went on behind them she watched the house for an hour and a half and then the pope came out muffling his face a thing he never at any other time had been known to do but necessary on this occasion to complete his disguise he walked away and she followed him saw him stop at the attendolo palace and finally enter the vatican saluted by the guards at the bronze gates she related the incident with such particularity and in such a manner that a great many people fancied that they thoroughly understood in a sort of way the good lady did more than most people have done towards effecting the reunion of christendom for the cliff deliriously discursed from revelations of a great red dragon and seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and of a beast rising out of the sea and seven heads and ten horns and ten crowns on his horns and the catholic hour simultaneously washed its hands in innocency advertizing unctuous rectitude in a leading article entitled the third borgia chapter xix while the dwarves were diverting themselves as aforesaid their rulers were in council together and one day sir francis bertram found no closed doors at the vatican he was granted an audience which was friendly and unofficial and secret so secret in fact that no news of it transpired it was treated as the return visit of an englishman to an englishman he came in an electric brougham quite unattended no one noted that he brought a small dispatchbox with him or that he did not carry it away with him but some of the senior cardinals who kindly came to discuss the latest effusions of the daily anagraph with hadrian in the evening found his holiness brimful of gaiety they remarked that the visit of the ambassador had done him no end of good his bearing was vivid serene and youthful his conversation was witty limpid facile no one would have taken him for the person described in the newspapers he read those which obligingly were handed to him but shewed no emotion whatever although very eager expert eyes searched for some trace from which to lead theories and hypotheses nor did he utter any comment he read he laid down the paper and resumed the conversation before their eminencies withdrew he summoned the sacred consistory to meet at noon on the morrow and that was the only noteworthy event of the evening hadrian mounted the throne and the vermilion college displayed itself before him a pigskin kitbag which a gentlemanofthesecretchamber had placed by the pontifical footstool before the doors were locked did not escape the notice of the more observant the pontiff himself was in singularly good form and this was incomprehensible for he carried in his hand a copy of the very newspaper which everyone had read and retchedover that he should be so aggressively cheerful so vividly dominant with that in his hand was considered hardly decorous even among those who firmly were determined to force themselves to believe in him that he should not bend his neck to the smiter now did not tally at all with conceptions of propriety with these sentiments their eminencies composed themselves to listen after the formal opening of the session a consistorial advocate in garments of a violet colour and furred with ermine about the neck was commanded to read aloud from the daily anagraph the account of the popes visit in disguise to the house on via morino he was to read it first in english then in latin it was not a long lection for journalistic instinct had perceived that the facts stated would be more damnatory in their nakedness with that inscrutable incomprehensible vivid gleam of hilarity irradiating his face hadrian checked the consistorial advocate from time to time preventing him from drifting into the monotonous gabble which is used for the formal reading of documents whose contents already are known informally and if his object was to cause each deadly detail of the charge against himself to come out clearly with all the contours definite and all the tints brilliantly varnished it must be admitted that his method was pontifically successful ebbene dunque muttered cardinal ragna hadrian darted a word at the cardinalprefectofpropaganda will your eminency have the goodness to describe to the sacred college your acts of the afternoon and evening of the festival of st michael archangel the naming of the festival of michaelmas was like a touch on the latch of the red popes memory his pure and gentle face lighted up for he perceived the connotation and that inspired him with a joy so delectable that he paused to pick his words tasting them deliberately lingering over them after siesta on the festival of st michael archangeland that would be about hours of the clock not lateri came to vatican and was received by your holiness i was admitted to the secret chamber i sat opposite to your holiness by the window i remember that for a reason i spoke to your holiness on the subject of removing england from the control of propaganda i said that i had pondered your holinesss proposition i said that it appeared to me as it already had appeared to your holiness that the necessity for treating england as a barbarous uncivilized savage country in which the faith is preached by missionaries no longer existed i added my own opinion that to continue to treat england as a savage uncivilized barbarous country now amounted to perennial insult i received your holinesss thanks i am giving only the heads of this conversation which was prolonged until the seventeenth hour then the pontifical pages brought in a tray containing fruit and triscuits and some english tea i told your holiness that tea astringed my nerves remarking on the difference between english nerves and italian i was permitted to make a few jokes in the midst of these very diverting burlesques i ate a little fruitperhaps a fig and a halfand i drank a little wine of cinthyanum afterwards i proceeded to discuss another case with your holiness that case was the removal from the spiritual rule of propaganda of the other countries which are under the secular rule of the excellent king of england it was a complication and the discussion of it occupied some hours i said in sum that sufficient information as to the nature and character and national history of the natives of those countries especially scotland ireland and wales officially had not been laid before me i requested your holiness to afford me longer time for the collection of information and investigation of the subject i permitted myself to note that while we were talking your holiness made and smoked nineteen cigarettes i remember that when at length i rose to pay my respects your holiness drew me nearer to the window by which we had been sitting and deigned to indicate the image of st michael archangel which poises itself on the summit of the mola the metal of which the said image is formed appeared to be burnished owing to radiance from the lights of the city i said that it resembled an angelic apparition in the obscure sky of night i remember that your holiness said may the prince of the angels who do service in heaven succour and defend us on earth i responded amen your holiness added some words in the greek tongue which you deigned to explain as signifying o god of the golden helm look upon look upon the city which thou once didst hold wellbeloved to that prayer i also responded amen and i was permitted to retire at the same moment when the pages were bringing in your holinesss supper which was at hours of the clock cardinal gentilotto sat down and the eyes of the sacred college twinkled like talc the pope who had receded to his more usual distant reticent gravity gave them a silent moment for appreciation and then darted a verisimilar word to cardinal della volta will your eminency have the goodness to describe to the sacred college your acts of the afternoon and evening of the festival of st michael archangel the exmajordomo of the apostolic palace hemmedand prayed for permission to send for his diary then he bravely proceeded mymymym twentyninth september at oclock i drove by the fort of monte mario to the milvian bridge and walked a little in the fields the sky was cloudy afterwards i drove by via flaminia and pincio to countess demochedes villino and sent away my carriage i obtained news of the german emperor her excellencys daughter the princess neri was there tea and very agreeable conversation the princess expatiated on the virtues of pedestrianism she and her beautiful mother derided me when i said that i was about to walk to vatican i went to palazzo attendolo to inquire for don umberto he had bought a new horse a strawberryroan and was gone to cinthyanum to try him that young man always is buying horsesmymym returned to vatican at oclock said mattins and lauds wrote tomymymwrote four letters holiness supper capretto ai ferri and zuppa inglese gave my news of the german emperor to our most holy lord read chap ix of matthew arnolds literature and dogma with semphill conversed with that deacon about it till bedtime he says that it is not a book to fear in my opinion it is a wonderful book but shocking and likely to cause misunderstanding except among the english but it is not damnable though many will think so sancte francisce ora pro me he was about to sitdown and the college was about to open twentythree mouths but hadrian with the left hand signed him to approach the throne and with the right simultaneously beckoned a masterofceremonies in a red habit and a violet cloak cardinal berstein interpolated with a recondite sneer the phenomenon of bilocation as exemplified in the case of st philip neri is wellknown but this is not the case of a saint hadrian wiped the floor with the sneerer nor was the case of samian pythagoras divine goldenthighed if your eminency ever heard of him the case of a saint yet inasmuch as pythagoras was heard to lecture at metapontion and tayromenion on the same day and at the same hour he would appear to have been an exemplification of the phenomenon of bilocation however this is neither the case of a saint as you so acutely have observed nor a case of bilocation as you so hilariously would pretend he flung the retort at the cardinal with such force that berstein sought his seat with not innocuous concussion lord cardinals the voice of the snake and the voice of the goose are one and the same they both hiss the pope added before moving again a feeling that his holiness was dynamic picric dangerous pervaded the assembly each most eminent lord wondered who would be the next victim of that quiet shrill velvet claw which tore the brain the pontiff bent his head to the masterofceremonies signifying that he should remove the mitre also he unclasped the morse of his cope and addressed cardinal della volta can your eminency remember what habit you wore during the afternoon and evening of the twentyninth of september yes holy father i wore the plain habit which we commonly wear like this hadrian stooped and opened the kitbag and drew from it a black cassock with red buttons a red sash and a black cloth cloak and a black threecornered beaverhat with thin red cord and tassels but yes precisely like that would your eminency do us the extreme favour of putting on these garments now della volta smiled but he made the change and stood on the thronesteps pulling out the folds stretching his arms in the new sleeves the pope took another and a similar suit from the kitbag and changed his own white for black then he descended to the cardinals side and faced the college they were as like each other as two blots of ink and the college roared of course everyone instantly remembered courtleighs allegation that della volta was the popes double but no one until now had seen the two side by side and garbed alike and the college roaredroared chiefly with delight at dismissal of tragedy by comedy the pope and the cardinal resumed their proper habits and hadrian again enthroned himself his aspect had become very cold very hard he spoke a few words in the dry incisive tone which slapped like sleet from the far distance of his misanthropic soul snatched away to that remote place shared with wounded beasts who creep to die alone he began swiftly and intensified the value of his words by the gradual monotonous deceleration which marked their close lord cardinals he said know that if we desire to intrigue our experience of the extreme stupidity of intriguers has taught us to avoid their pitifully trite folly know also that intrigues disguises tricks artifices stratagems and deceptions are repugnant to us and finally know this that we never will derogate our pontifical paraphernalia or authority to another after a moment he changed his manner and in a formal tone announced that the congress of windsor had invited the intervention of the roman pontiff as supreme arbitrator it was the appeal of csar to peter he made known the contents of the dispatch which sir francis bertram had brought and read the names of sovereign and presidential signatories and without waiting for comment he uttered the ceremonial form which closed the consistory and was borne away acclamations followed him vermilion tumbled over ermine in an effort to get at him what a number of things everybody urgently desired to know what was he going to do would he not take this magnificent opportunity of reclaiming peters patrimony he could not be denied it now that was ragnas notion the two vagellaii agreed with it italy could be compensated by the cession of italia irredenta said serafino little minds expatiated on an infinity of little things then some began about the calumnies what was he going to do about them oh for certain he had disproved the charge made against hadrian the seventh and most likely he could disprove the others could he berstein cynically guffawed well was he going to publish this disproval who knows asked fiamma the english and american cardinals energetically asseverated that for their part they neither were going to consult his holiness on the subject nor to consider themselves bound to secrecy in regard to the refutation which they had heard and witnessed it was carvale who hurriedly collected and expressed the opinions of his colleagues what dye mean neighed the long faced capuchin ill tell you what we mean said semphill with the help of my friends here well have an authentic copy of the acts of this consistory sent to every newspaper on earth and you can bet right now van kristen cried the cardinalarchdeacon and nine italians vociferated approval of the scheme talacryn trumpeted with the others gambolling gaily along then he put down an elephantine foothe was not quite sure that it was advisable down at the back of his heart he felt the old distrust of hadrianhe did not want to be involved by seeming to supporthis holiness was a most difficult man to get rid of if one wanted to get rid of him whatever but still the cardinal of caerleon trampled along with the others their eminencies surged upstairs chattering like a tygendis of magpies and flowed along galleries screeching like a muster of peacocks until they reached the approach to the pontifical antechambers the approach was closed guarded by skewbald harlequins of swiss with halberds before it stood the two gentlemenoftheapostolicchamber who formally responded to inquiry our most holy lord is in secret they had to make what they could of that those with sense went about their business without ado some however lingered to resent rebuff or in the hope of obtaining quasiaccidental admission by bribery ragna panted up to four thousand lire in sir johns ear and departed cursing the door was barred by our most holy lord is in secret in secret hadrian was kneeling upright in his chapel god i am very worldly i have enjoyed the triumph that was the confession which he made not precisely with sorrow but with a consuming contempt for himself he had done such an ordinary deed he despised himself for doing it he remained in contemplation of his disgusting humanity for some time by degrees his mind detached itself from that and attached itself to the next subject which he had prepared he went into his workshop covered the chairs around his armchair with sheets of ms notes drew the writingboard on his knees laid out blank paper rolled and lighted a cigarette and began to read and amend his notes from time to time he sat back in his chair gazing out of the window at nothing working at problems in his brain now and then he scribbled a note a word a phrase a sentence at length he began to cover sheet after sheet he wrote for hours and hours together day after day burning most of what he wrote amending more rewriting much anon an acrid torpor astringed and benumbed his right arm from elbow to fingertip announcing the advent of scriveners palsy it was evening about two hours after the angelus he putdown his pen and summoned the first gentlemanofthesecretchamber sir john sat in front of him rolledup the sleeve and gave the arm and hand a gentle friction hadrian silently watched his busy hands they were beautiful hands very white very slim very softyes singularly soft and soothing yet they were strong hands firm and lissome they did not tire with that continued searching movement moulding and defining tired muscles and aching sinews working the fatigue and ache gradually downward to dismissal at the fingertips also the bent head was a good head small and round covered with closecropped hair blackpurple hyacinthine and the healthy pallor of the face the delicately cloven chin the extremely fine grey eyes the vigorous form the exquisitely chaste and intelligent aspectfancy expecting such an one to roll pills and fill capsules for ever in a chymists shop no he was better as he was john the pope inquired how do you get on with macleod oh very well i think i like him very much is he comfortable oh i think so he seems so at any rate has he got anything to say for himself oh yesnow he was a bit frightened at first but hes got over that now to whom does he talk most freely oh to me not but what he has plenty to say to iulo too but hell tell me anything what do you mean by anything oh everything about himself john lookup into these eyes a moment the shy grey eyes readily soared into the shy brown eyes how much has he told you about himself oh everything thats all everything a fine flush tinged the fresh ivory face with coral but the grey eyes did not waver oh yes everything can he sing oh no not a notethank heaven hadrian withdrew his gaze and you think you like him very much oh yesi dont think i know im so awfully sorry for him and pity is akin to oh but its not pity and its not love its something else altogether it makes me in such a rage i dont think i can make you understand thats all try oh welldo you remember max alvary the singerman yes why oh dont you know what i said when i saw him in siegfried you see first i saw the splendour of his beauty and then when it came to the idyll i got into a rage and i said and that voice too what did you mean oh it seemed so abominably unrighteousall that beauty and all that voice as well that he should have two giftsand that othersi for instanceshould have not one what has this to do with macleod oh a lot in a topsyturvy kind of way look what a fine chap he is to look atjust like that lovely figure on your cross and hes clever too well youd think him fortunate enough wouldnt you then comes fate and spoils himspoils him completely thats what makes me furious to have to class him with mustafa i wonder he doesnt kill himself go gently with that wrist please have you told him that oh no i should hope not sorry i want to do everything in the world to keep him from knowing what i thinkto keep him from hitting on that line of thought by accident by himself even it would drive the poor chap mad thats all john youre a brick now listen to this thoughts you know are things if you think such thoughts theyll be in the air about you and its as likely as not that macleods senses will perceive them so youd better extirpate them hic et nuncif you like him and want to help him oh do you think so well i will then because i really do want to help him good and now whats to be done with him oh but why should anything be done with him hes very happy here thanks to your goodness john silence but first of all we must give him a reason for being here and then we must remember that here we have no continuing city now listen attentively when you have finished that hand you will go to the secretary of state and tell his eminency to issue a patent to mr macleod as third gentleman of the chamberemolument half yoursno knighthood will that do oh finely good well now lets go back a bit suppose macleod wasnt here where in your opinion would he be best oh i hardly know what to say to that you know your meredith well then favour us with the outline of your ideas pour them out pellmell intelligibly or not no matter we undertake to catch hold of something oh well i think hed do well in a garden hes quite learned about flowers and if you ever saw him handle one youd wonder however a chap with a chest and arms like a blacksmith as his are could be so tender theres a lot more force and theres a lot more gentleness in him than youd think same with trees he looks at them as we look at other chapsjust as though he could speak to them and make them understand him if he wanted to hed do well at anything out of doors farming perhaps i did think at first of the sea because of his wonderful eyes oh yes i suppose that was the reason did ever you see such a blue a blue that makes you want to strip and divejust the eyes for a sailor arent they thats simply my romance though but i havent talked to him much about the sea do you know what i should like to do i should like to go a long seavoyage with him in one of those old sailingships and take the pliny and the sophokles which you gave me and a lexicon and a dictionary and read them with him right away fromof course i dont mean what you think i mean no of course you dont and then when you come back from your long seavoyage in a sailing ship you think that macleod could be useful and happy on a flowerfarm with orchards and all that sort of rot while you could sit in the shade of medlartrees and rosebushes and look after him so that no one should insult him and read books write them too perhaps and dream dreams and certainly write those and live happily in a dear oldfashioned farmhouse ever after oh youre laughing at me now not at all the bright brown eyes became grave john what are you going to do with yourself when hadrian is dead oh but youre not going to die how do you know answer the question oh i havent thought about it i dont want to think about it thats all nonsense think about it and be done with it john when we are dead if you have a place like that and means to work it means to move about and use yourselfwill you use yourself and will you take macleod and be a brothernot a real but the ideal brother to him oh of course i would but will you promise oh yes i promise you most faithfully but i hope to god ill never have the chance well no one knows when you will have the chance but you shall have it bring the pen here and the writingboard hadrian pulled down his sleeve and stroked the cat for a minute or two thoughtfully lookingout of the window then he wrote putting what he wrote into an envelope which he gave to the shaking sprig of virtue who stood before him you will take this to plowden after you have been to ragna you will obtain his formal acknowledgment see that it is made out in your name and keep it secretly till the time comes for using it on our death you will present it and plowden will pay you five thousand pounds and take your receipt for it with that sum you will buy and stock such a place as we have described as long as you and macleod live plowden will pay you a regular income so that you never can come to want and always can have something to give away every quarterday he will pay a hundred pounds to you and fifty to macleod and you can make as much more as you like out of your farm that remember is yours and you may do what you please with it when you both die the capital which provides your incomes will return to the pontifical treasury so if you want to marry and beget a family and leave something more than real propertythe farmbehind you you must earn it we give you a chance and perfect freedom do you follow oh i never shall forget a single word holy father i cant take it what have i done to deserve it what could i ever do to deserve it boy you have done this to deserve it you have wished to bear or to share anothers burden you shall have your wish and you shall have a little reward here and a very great rewardthereif you carry out your wish thats what you have done and what you can do you are good and you are trusted and thats all now go away at once because we have a lot of writing yet to do john cried hadrian just before the door closed by the bye you had better tell macleod of his appointment and see about his uniforms at once but keep the other matter to yourself tillyou know when ohand please make him understand that we shall call him james that gaelic hamish is a little too much and he had better be mr james to the others outside the closed door sir john struck his own hands together and the maddening thing is that there is nothing in the whole world that i can do for him if i were to give him a little present like a baccypouch ten to one it wouldnt be precisely to his tasteanyhow it ld only be like giving him a calf of his own cow oh damn its like a wax match offering a light to the sun he suddenly faced to the door again and his words came in the form of a solemn pledge lord i promise he remained entranced for several moments and anon went on his way with steadfast brow chapter xx the cardinaldeacon of st cosmas and st damian did it the acts of the consistory in so far as they related to the calumny against the pope duly appeared in the times and the globe and the new york times as news which was fit to print innumerable other papers lifted them with acknowledgments no comment was made the collaredpuppyinthetube and the spectacledpersoninthemotorcar and the femalewiththeloafcolouredhatatthebargainsale forgot all about george arthur rose paid no attention whatever to the pope and violently sat up on their hindlegs regarding the supreme arbitrator france and russia emitted caricatures and howls and prepared to invade belgium and sweden with the intention of descending on germany from three sides mrs crowe became conscious that she had lost rather than had gained by her connection with jerry sant the english catholics treated her as they are wont to treat converts after the first three months and shewed her the cold shoulder the refutation of her latest calumny had made her look foolishand something dirtier than foolish she was mortified she was angry with herself and she naturally yearned to tear and mangle everybody else she thought that the best thing which she could do would be to pose as a much deceived woman to break that disastrous connection with the liblabs and to return if possible to the status quo ante so she went and fell upon jerry vituperating him for the accented failure of his schemesfor leading an innocent lady astray with his nastiness and his pigheaded stupidity and all that she frankly told him that he had gone too far the precious pair had words and finally separated jerry remained at his hotel dumb and dangerous brooding as for the lady respectable mediocrity allured her by the prospect which it offered of a not unfamiliar obscurity where she might try to piecetogether the shreds and tatters of her reputation she had a little money leftand with economyshe would stay just a little longer who knew what might happen one by one cardinals received summons to the secret chamber their brains were picked and their opinions heard nefski of the ashen pallor and the haunted eyes admitted that poland might be happier as a constitutional monarchy and a member of a federation pushed to it he promised to use all his influence to persuade mundo cleanly rotund and sparkling spoke of portugals long and illustrious alliance with the lord of the sea his compact vivid nation had no grievances grace looked silently vigorous and praised the munroe doctrine if only the french cardinals chattered were aghast sobbed were quite limp and became picturesquely and dithyrambically resigned oh they were so excellentand so futile courtleigh pleaded age infirmity circumstances had become more than he could manage he had begun to think that he never had been anything but a decorative figurehead that he never once had gripped the rudder of affairs since the prince of wales had been sowell rude to him he was old he was garrulous craving for greetings he begged leave to go and end his days in the college which he had founded if the holy father would but deign to relieve him of his archbishopric hadrian did deign and summoned talacryn to whom he said we are about to fulfil the ambition of your eminencys life by preconizing you to the archbishopric of pimlico the cardinal said something about being unworthy of the honour that of course the pontiff responded but we place you there because you know or ought to know more of our mind than any man and your task is to make that known to england it at least never can be said if you should err that you erred through ignorance of our will you have health you have youth you have a dominant presence people will listen to you your danger and your fault are due to your national habit of suspicion that can be conquered act up to your name be frank suspect no one be ready to renouncebut your heart should tell you all that we would say now for caerleon whom would you like to succeed your eminency there talacryn said something about the right of the clergy to elect but that was swept aside then he dwelled on the difficulty of finding a suitable priest who could speak the native language the last is not essential said hadrian you yourself cannot speak and cannot even learn that frightful jargon although you are a native of the dreadful place and after your habit of suspecting people andyes it had better be saida slight tendency to the habit of officious lyingthe cardinal went purplethere it is said and done with you have had your lesson and you know better nowafter those things the only reason why your episcopate has not been a very brilliant one is that you started with the false idea of the necessity of speaking that corrupt and obsolete dialect but does not your holiness think that a foreigner no england is the dominant race her language is the language of all her colonies why a triplet of little conquered countries should refuse to learn englishshould be permitted to insist on their barbarous and unliterary languages we never could understand they are conquered countries annexed to their conqueror they have lost their national existence for centuries they have no national existence or any kind of existence apart from england no nationality does not come into the question of your successor at all that is where the church of christ differs from all religions rome can do and does do what no other ecclesiastical power durst do our predecessors sent an italian to canterbury and even a greek theodore and we are sending a kelt to pimlico as for caerleondo you remember john jennifer the priest of selce you dohe was a white man at mary valeand since good he is bishop of caerleon he speaks the language holy father said talacryn laughing the merest accident we selected him for his steadfast sturdy goodness under great difficulty at maryvale oh we remember and the popes gaze went far away into the past cardinal talacryn mentioned that the secretary of state desired to know whether his holiness would require the services of the patriarch of byzantion at the present juncture the patriarch of byzantion it was thought that as he had negotiated with england during the reign of your holinesss predecessors oh then no the services of the patriarch of byzantion are not required when his grace is not smirking in black drawingrooms or writing defamatory letters to duchesses defamatory letters holy father yes defamatory letters such as this one which he wrote in the pope got up took off his episcopal ring unlocked and dived into an alphabetical lettercase and handed a most ingeniously suggestive and lethific note to the cardinal well when his grace is not engaged in these disedifying pastimes he has his patriarchate to attendto in fact unless he can see his way to become a resident patriarch in byzantion within the month he may look for a decree of deposition the supreme pontiffs aspect was austere your eminency will convey that response to cardinal ragnas obliging suggestion talacryn made haste to kneel give me a blessing holy father and i will immediately proceed to my new see whatever hadrian smiled god bless you son but do not go yet pimlico has been in the hands of the vicargeneral and the coadjutor for years and the vicarcapitular can manage for the present stay here a little while we shall need you we shall not need you long and talacryn went out from the presence glad yet grave during a few days questions and answers incessantly passed between the vatican and windsor castle hadrian consulted sovereigns discussed difficulties with statesmen baron de boucert expressed the opinion that it would be futile to oppose the inevitable expansion of germany signor barconi himself officiated at an instrument installed in the apostolic antechamber until he was carried away in nervous collapse hadrian envied him and forced himself to resist temptation he had much to do yet messages messages study of maps collation of ms notes filled a score of each twentyfour hours there was need of profound thought so that the clairvoyant undazzled eye like a diver might reach the bottom of deeppreserving thought the four hours which remained chiefly were spent at the tomb of st peter in the basilica the arbitrator slept not at all in these days he ate while at work and only sought refreshment under the icecold tap in the bathroom a squadron of english cruisers escorted a procession of royal yachts and battleships which conveyed the congress of windsor to golden and immortal rome then came the issue of the epistle to the princes in which the apostle reiterated the evangelic counsels predicating a scheme of utter selfsacrifice and nonresistance in imitation of the sweet reasonableness of christ this would mean said he the deliberate loosening and casting away of all conventions which bound society together it was right it was straight it was the most direct road to heaven but it was not in accordance with the human will it would be called utopian and unconventional and it would be derided more than followed it would cause confusion inconceivable if it were attempted on the grand scale truth more quickly emerges from error than from confusion men being what they are ie bound to err would be better for having their errancy guided they would diverge from the road but they should not leave it out of sight and properly guided their movement at least could be made to tend towards the point desirable individuality so long had been suppressed that its efforts required administration therefore the pontiff shewed as well as an unconventional a conventional way of approaching that point desirable he maintained the aristocratic and monarchic principle in strict integrity a rebel was worse than the worst prince and rebellion was worse than the worst government of the worst prince that hitherto had been he proclaimed the anarchy of france and russia to be a manifestation of diabolic ebullience which ought to be restrained and stamped out by all right means even the most stringent france and russia having forfeited the right of being deemed capable of ruling themselves henceforth must submit to be ruled satan finds mischief for idle hands to do occupation and scope for occupation alone will enable individuals and nations to work out their own salvation humanly speaking men must use themselvesfor good or ill most human ills were caused by the lack of scope for energy sitting on or screwing down the safety valve invariably was fatala doctrine which he enforced on the attention and obedience of the clergy these principles involved a rearrangement of various spheres of influence the ruler of the world peter the supreme arbitrator decreed that the only nations in which the facultas regendi survived in undiminished energy were england america japan germany italy some of the old monarchies however had not yet reached that point of decay when their extinction would become desirable they were norway sweden denmark the german kingdoms and principalities and duchies spain portugal greece roumania albania montenegro the republics of switzerland and san marino these were to be maintained as sovereign states and to preserve their national characters some also of the old monarchies which had tolerated unmerited suppression were to be given an opportunity of proving themselves worthy of corporate existence these were hungary bohemia and russian and german poland they were revived as kingdoms and required to provide themselves with constitutions after the manner of england and to elect their respective monarchical dynasties switzerland and san marino were confirmed as republics the sultan at the instigation of england his ally would move his capital to damascus in order to concentrate the main force of islam in asia servia was added to the principality of montenegro turkeyineurope and bulgaria would become merged in the kingdom of greece so far for particulars hadrian denounced as bad and idle dreams the plans of recent political schemers who had adumbrated ideas of a federation of the englishspeaking and the teutonic races he dwelled upon the essential differences which divided germany from america and both from england no blend was possible between the english and the germans and americans were not qualified for bonds each one of the three was unique and each would stand alone three such enormous powers must have each its own separate and singular existence and sphere of action three such spheres must be found in which the three nations independently might thrive it was room for independent development which must be sought out and assigned he stated the case of the continent of europe belgium had inhabitants to the squarekilometre holland germany austria france russia was so sparsely populated that only a migration of people from the rest of europe would raise her to the european average hence the pope proclaimed the instauration of the roman empire under two emperors a northern emperor and a southern emperor and confirmed the same to the king of prussia and the king of italy as representatives of the dynasties of hohenzollern and savoy respectively he ordained that this instauration should not be deemed the ghost of the dead roman empire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof but its legitimate heir and successor justified by the ancient virtues of the romans the beneficence of their rule and the vigorous aspiration to welldoing which characterized their present representatives the northern emperor william would nominate sovereign dynasties for belgium and holland he might replace the present exiled monarchs on their respective thrones or he might depose them and substitute members of his imperial family he then would extend the borders of germany eastward to the ural mountains by the inclusion of russia westward to the english channel and bay of biscay by the inclusion of france southward to the danube by the inclusion of austria at the same time he would federate the constitutional monarchies of norway and sweden denmark holland belgium hungary bohemia poland roumania and the republic of switzerland with the other sovereign states already under his suzerainty while the southern emperor victor emanuel would federate the constitutional monarchies of portugal spain the extended kingdom of greece the principalities of montenegro and albania and the republic of san marino with the kingdom of italy which last now was to include italia redenta the frontier dividing the northern empire from the southern was to be formed by the pyrenees alps danube and black sea the case of america was defined the united states were to be increased by the inclusion of all the states and republics of the two americas from the present northern frontier of the united states to cape horn the japanese empire was authorized to annex siberia all asia except siberia africa canada australia new zealand and all islands were erected into five constitutional kingdoms and added to the dominions of the king of england ireland wales and scotland the title emperor being antipathetic to the english race on account of its primary significance warlord the official style of the majesty of england ireland wales scotland asia africa canada australia new zealand and all islands henceforth would be the ninefold king thus the supreme arbitrator provided the human race with scope and opportunity for energy the provisions of the epistle to the princes were drawn up in the form of treaty dividing the world till midnight gt of december st ns of the year of the fructiferous incarnation of the son of god into the ninefold kingdom the american republic the japanese empire and the roman empire this treaty was signed in the square of st peters at rome by the pontiff the sovereigns and the presidents on the festival of the annunciation of our lady the virgin and the armies and navies of the signatories instantly set about the pacification of france and russia by martial law chapter xxi april brought to hadrian an experience of one of those periods of psychical disturbance which are incidental to the weakness of humanity and inevitable by a man of his particular temper things lost their significance to him persons lost their personality events their importance and time was not he kept a straight face and forced himself to courteous demeanour but he was living in a world in which he felt himself to be just off the floor and floating a world in which everything was strange and everybody was quite strange a world where nobody and nothing mattered the least little bit he had the sense at the beginning to include himself in secret behind guarded doors and also to hold his tongue when his attendants were in the presence he simply sat and wonderedwondered who he was how he came there who dressed him like that and whenand decided that it did not matter he nursed his cat cooing and mewing and talking catlanguage in a most enjoyable manner when the creature went awayit did not matter he used to gaze at his cross by the hour together planning combinations of lights and shades and backgrounds of bookbacks placing the golden symbol there and revelling in the supple splendour of the form its dignity its grace the majestic youth of the face noble and grave he would close his eyes and learn the lovely planes and contours with delicate reverent touch it pleased him to think that he had created a type of incarnate divinity which neither was the orpheys of the catacombs nor the tragic mask of the vernicle nor the gross sexless indecencies wherewith pious catholics in their churches insult the one among ten thousand the altogether lovely that thought brought him back to space and time indignation at images at least eleven heads long proportioned like female fashionplates visaged like emasculate noodles whom you would slap in the face on sight simply for their tepid attenuate silliness if you met them in the fleshthis drew down hadrian to realities and lifehe felt utterly exhausted an exposition of sleep seized him he was always drowsy and would fall asleep in the daytime over the writing and reading which he put himself to do in his armchair by the window in his favourite seat by the old wall in the garden where he spent the vivid afternoons of spring only toward nightfall was he able to write that beautiful clear script of his to bring any of his usual alertness to bear upon affairs even then that alertness was extraordinarily diluted his intellect was nebulous uncertain he could not select saliencies could not concentrate his thoughts his constructive faculty was in abeyance his imagination was in chains he spent a long time over his scanty meals chewing chewing reading reading and remembering nothing which he read in an inert perfunctory way he blamed himself for waste of time and continued to waste it no doubt it was divine natures will let it be understood that he was not slothful in the confessional sense of the word he was merely lethargic dulled blunted listless eager for nothing except to flee away and be at restat rest from this stupor he awoke in panic as though nympholeptose lymphatic driven to phrenzy by some unknown external agency he became inspired with an appalling consciousness of the absolute necessity for instant active continuous exertionif he were to continue alive upon this earth he felt that if he were to permit himself to relax for one instant if for one instant he were to abdicate command of his physical forces to let himself gothat instant would be his last with this in his mind he prepared for momentary unconscious lapses from violent activity he posed with care so that if death should seize him unawares he might not present a disedifying or untidy spectacle to the finders of his corpse he carefully avoided postures from which when he should be reft from the body his form would fall indecorously he did not trouble his confessor more often than twice a week as usual but his one prayer his incantation always was on his lips dear jesus be not to me a judge but a saviour he was losing hold of the world continually through every hour of the day and night his head rang with the reverberating boomboomboomboom of his strong hearts beating the rhythm was maddening he used to count the pulsations wondering after fourteen whether he would be able to say fifteen after ninetyseven whether he would be in rome to say ninetyeight expecting the sudden wrench of self from body conjecturing the nature of that unique experience once he put himself to the question was he afraid he answered no because he dared to hope and yes because he had not been there before but sokrates had said that death was our greatest possession on earth and seneca said that death was the best of the inventions of life and senecas friend saint paul said to die is gain on the whole he was not afraid afraid of death but he did not dare to goto goto sleep now at night he used to lie in bed first on his right side then at full length on his back with the pillow under his neck and his hands crossed on the breast which had been tattoed with a cross when he was a boy and his ankles crossed like a crusader rigid as he wished to lie in his coffinand his brain active active counting physical pulsations meditating on the future scheming planning counting each breath and waiting for the lastand death sometimes he wondered whether it was all worth while whether it was in accordance with gods will that he should be so willfull he decided to risk an affirmative to that on the ground of the existence of his will he knew that he tried rightly to use it he hoped for mercy on account of lapses one point he determined with all due respect to sokrates and seneca death came by sin and sin was gods enemy and gods friends must fight gods enemies to the bitter end to relax was suicide and suicide was sin and tired with conflict as he was eager for rest and peace as he was it certainly was not worth while to add to his tale of sin it was not worth while to exchange tiresome earth for untiring hell to lose what petrarch calls the splendour of the angelic smile he had no steel in his possession except safetyrazors knives and scissors he had abolished long ago and now he had light strong gratings fixed to all his windows he would not go into temptation i am fawned upon by hope ah would that she had a voice which i could understand a voice like that of a herald that i might not be agitated by distracting thought he said to himself in the words of elektra at the tomb of agamemnn had he been trained in boyhood at a publicschool in adolescence at an university had his lines been cast in service he would not have had to put so severe restraint upon himself the occasion would not have arisen a simple and perhaps a stolid character would have been formed of his temper potent and brilliant enough to distinguish him from the mob but incapable of hypersensation instead his frightfully selfconcentrated and lonely life denied the ordinary opportunities of action had developed this heartrending complexity had trained him in mental gymnastics to a degree of excellence which was inhuman abominable in the first intention of the words in its facile flexible solert dexterity he was not restrained by any sense whatever of modesty or of decorum he had no sense of those things he knew it and regretted it he was himself he distrusted that self rejoiced in it and determined to deal well and righteously with it dr guido cabelli at length summoned found him positively furious with the pain of physical and intellectual struggles the physician exhibited pot brom tinct valerian am tinct zinzil sp chlorof aq menth pip once every three hours it made the pontiff conscious that he stank like a male cat in early summer but he heard no more boombooming in his ears it strungup his nervous system for the time he put on his pontifical mask and addressed himself from the ideal to the real he put the affairs of nations on one side they the nations all were tumbling over one another in their eagerness to rearrange themselves upon the pattern which he had devised for them if he adopted the pythagorean rle of an uninterested spectator either he would be annoyed by something ugly or something silly or he would have a chance of glorifying himself on account of some success and he wished to do otherwise than that in this world god and his angels only may be spectators the affairs of religion as far as he could see amounted to the service of others and the cultivation of personal holiness the correspondence with divine love someone had told him thatyes talacryn in confession of coursethat the key to all his difficulties present and to come was love that was all very pretty and theological on the part of the bishop the cardinalarchbishop but it was the baby who had taught him the secret of the method he would he really would keep his troubles to himself his office was the office of leader and exemplar nothing must interfere he put himself to review the first year of his pontificate and a black enough tale it seemed to him without surprize without emotion he noted the blurs of impatience pridepridehumanityretrospection was the most wearisome most fatuous banality onward leader and exemplar one thing was clear he must come down among the led and following he must be seen of men and he was not seen no peculiar personal preference kept him apart mysterious he rather enjoyed not the being misunderstood but the not being understood and at the same time he had been doing a lot of people the gross injustice of crediting them with the possession of intelligence similar to his own of perspicacity equal to his own of the ability to keep up with his rapid pace and abrupt manuvres that was unrighteous no doubt it had been all very fine and noble and so forth to sit down silent under calumny for example one could afford to do that when one was innocent but when millions of people to give the devils their due actually wanted to believe one innocent and would be grieved and perhaps injured because the opportunity to believe innocence was withheld was it righteous to refuse to condescend no such a pose was mere pride the servant of the servants of god must not fear to soil the whiteness of his robe in any kind of ordure also to save others was the best way of retrieving oneself he sent for the nearest cardinals ragna saviolli semphill sterling talacryn carvale van kristen gentilotto leighton whitehead responded to the summons hadrian received them in the throneroom but without formality and contrived to give them an easy and genial greeting they thought him to be looking seriously ill there was the dead whiteness of a gardenia in the hue of his face and hands his reddishbrown hair was going grey over the left ear his intense and rigid mask was the sign of pain his whole aspect also was diaphanous wasted but his manner was vivid he was not inaccessible their eminencies gave him their attention and wondered what he was going to bringout of the dispatch box by his side he was extremely glad to see the secretary of state for he knew how antipathetic he was to that one and now he was going to try to give him satisfaction at least it should not be his fault if ragnas ordinary attitude of discreet and convulsive brutality remained unmitigated lord cardinals the supreme pontiff said it has occurred to us that ye have many things to say that there be many things which ye desire to know we on our part are ready to hear and we are willing to respond to questions questions instantly were born in each mans brain ragna was the first to deliver himself of his holiness will you answer a question about the epistle to the princes yes ragna collected himself i am curious to know why the rights of france in egypt were not even named i can see that the very nature of your holinesss counsels demanded that africa as a whole should pass to england but i cannot understand why germany in taking over france should not also have takenover the condominium of egypt why did that fall to england and why did germany consent to its falling to england hadrian made an effort to conquer his natural incapacity for coming near a subject at the first attempt and put himself to be concise your eminency knows that sincewe forget the exact datebut since a very short time ago no international obligations have existed which could restrain egypt from legitimate attempts at emancipation nothing but ottoman firmans held her very well we discovered that when the king of england and the sultan last october made alliance the latter issued a firman in which england was named protector of egypt then the speaker slightly smiled when the task of arbitration was submitted to us we found that the german colonies in africa not only did not pay their way but required a yearly subsidy of and therefore taking one thing with another we arranged to give germany sufficient employment for a century nearer home she promptly recognized that megli fringuello in man che tordo in frasca the fact is that she was only too glad to be rid of her own parasitic colonies which had severed their connection from the parent stem and derived their nutriment from other states while the colonies of france which were epiphytic having no existence apart from the source from which they sprang were wiped out as french colonies when france was wiped out and no doubt germany in her pretty gothic way was in such a desperate hurry to grab france that she forgot all about egypt dye know they say shes going to call her conquest gallia again semphill put in with a sniff and now ill ask a question holy father may i smoke but smoke hadrian assented with pleasure and heldout his own hand for a cigarette some of the others did likewise and the gear began to run much more easily van kristen expressed joy that the germans were not to have chances of doing more monkey business on the erechtheion and the akropolis at athens yes ragna meditatively continued i suppose i ought to have understood all that but now holiness theres another thing why did the sultan consent to evacuate europe simply because with all the examples which he has had lately he goes in mortal terror of assassination he has managed to persuade himself that he only can be warranted against that as long as he is under the gis of england well seeing england and turkey allied we moved england and england moved ismail the former had sense the latter sentiment but ismail really is not half bad in fact hes rather decent if we only had another dear charming childlike naked christian like blessed brother francis what said carvale with animation he happened to have noted that when hadrian rioted in superlatives it meant no more than positives but when he negligently drawled comparatives not half bad or rather decent the ultimate of praise was signified what the cardinal repeated we would send him to give points to ismails mollahs and dervishes st francis has innumerable sons holiness saviolli put in and we only know one who in the slightest degree resembles his father the pope responded waving away the subject one would like to know said sterling whether your holiness is not really of the opinion that the epistle to the princes was perhaps a trifle too sentimental and sentimental yes the ruler who rules sentiment out of his calculations ignores one of the most potent forces in human affairs too sentimental no and what else was your eminency about to saya trifle too sentimental and one would have said perhaps a trifle too arbitrary dear man the pope gleefully began but ragna interrupted nothing of the kind that particular epistle was replete with pontifical dignity it was the finest thing hadrian stopped him we were about to remind cardinal sterling that when the ruler of the world geographically rules the world he is accustomed to do his ruling with a ruler our predecessor alexander vi used a ruler on a celebrated occasion on the atlantic ocean everybody burst out laughing laughed for a few moments and returned to a serious demeanour there was a question an important question which sat upon all tongues wingpreened ready to fly but his holiness already had refused to discuss it those who had tried to persuade so seriously had been hurt by his icy reticence or by his blunt aloofness that no one now was temerarious enough to attempt the reopening of so unsavoury and so personal a matter except upon explicit invitation knowing what he did of men hadrian had expected hesitation but seeing that his purpose was likely to fail of completion and being determined that it should not fail he slowly and significantly drewoff the pontifical ring from his first finger and put it in his pocket gentlemen he said with quite a change of manner some of you would like to put george arthur rose to the question they would indeed they would whatever they would like it so much that they all spoke in unison the sum of their words amounted to a request that george arthur rose would give them some sort of statement concerning newspaper calumnies some sort of statement by way of support to their contention that he had been grossly wronged and mispresented it was george the digladiator who responded he seemed to step down into the arena naked lithe agile with bright open eyes and ready to fight for life very well he saidi will give that statement to you but understand that i will not defend myself in the newspapers if i were a layman i should have whipped in a writ for libel and have given my damages to nazareth house i should have preferred to trust my reputation rather to an english judge and jury than to the nameless editors of erse or radical newspapers fancy having ones letters edited by the catholic hour for example fancy having ones letters which are ones defence nefariously garbled by a nameless creature who is ones prosecutor and ones judge and ones jury all in one however not being a layman i cannot go to law and i will not condescend to have dealings with those newspapers understand also that i tell you what i am about to tell you not because i have been provoked abused calumniated traduced assailed with insinuation innuendo mispresentation lies not because my life has been held up to ridicule and to most inferior contempt not because the most preposterous stories to my detriment have been invented hawked about believed no please understand that i am not going to speak in my own defence even to you i personally and of predilection can be indifferent to opinions but officially i must correct error so i will give you some information you may take it or leave it believe it or disbelieve it you shall have as photographic a picture as i can give you of my life and of the majestic immobility by which you clergy tire outassassinate a mans bodyperhaps his soul you are free to use it or abuse it when i shall have finished speaking i never will return to this subject of course we shall believe what you say semphill rather nervously intercalated im sure we believe it unsaid we take it as said you know but if you could see your way to give us details say on half a dozen points that would be quite enough the daily anagraph has not apologized for its latest slander carvale put in why should it george inquired well i sent an authenticated account of what happened in the last consistory the other papers printed it and i should have thought the least the daily anagraph could have done would be carvale youre making a mistake the daily anagraph has no personal grudge against me although the last editor had because i once innocently asked him whether historical accuracy came within the scope of a radical periodical that was years ago at the time of the second dreyfus case i know that he was furious because bertram blighter the novelman told me that that editor in revenge was going to put me on the newspaper blacklist whatever that may be no it is not a personal matter a matter in which an apology is customary its simply an example of the ethics of commercial journalism the man wanted to increase the sale of his paper i happened by chance to be before the world just then and he took the liberty of increasing his circulation at my expense actually that is all you cant at least i dont expect an editor who is capable of doing such a thing to apologize for doing it the case of the other papers is verisimilar except of course the catholic hour that simply exists on sycophanty by sycophants for sycophantophagists as semphill knows yes i know said semphill and i dont allow the thing to enter my house but the othersin their case its not lurid malignance but legal malfeasance did you say that they apologized no none of those which printed the calumnies apologized they just kept silence but all the respectable papers which had not calumniated you printed my refutation of the daily anagraph george made a gesture of scorn of satisfaction of dismissal then the pope is clear he said now i will try to tell you as briefly as possible what you want to know about the other person he produced a sheaf of newspapercuts he was in such a white rage at having to do what he was about to do that he wreaked his anger on those who listened to him piercingly eyeing them speaking with swift fury as one would speak to foes the catholic hour states that in i was under an undermaster at grandholme school that i had to leave my mastership because i became catholic that is true in substance and absolutely false in connotation i was an undermaster but as i also had charge of the schoolhouse i was called the housemaster you also perhaps may be aware that there is only one headmaster in a school and that all the rest are undermasters but when slander is your object undermaster is a nice disgraceful dab of mud to sling at your victim for a beginning well i resigned my housemastership of my own free and unaided will for the reason alleged and i have yet to learn that the becoming catholic is an extraordinarily slimy deed further note this far from my resignation being the dishonourable affair which the catholic hour implies the headmaster of grandholme school remained my dear and intimate and honoured friend through thick and thin for more than twenty years and is my only dear and intimate friend at this moment semphill and carvale looked up and then down sterling looked down down van kristen looked up the others anywhere talacryn looked annoyed the taunt was flung out and the flying voice wenton the catholic hour thus casts its diatribe in a key of depreciation next i am said to have gone to a school for outcasts to have quarrelled with the two priestchaplains and presently to have been again out the idea being to infer evil it is rather cleverly done in that statement of the case but here are the facts the school perhaps might be called a school for outcasts but i a young inexperienced catholic of six months was lured by innumerable false pretences on the part of the eccentric party who offered me the post to accept what he called the headmastership of a cathedral choir school he did not tell me that he was forcing the establishment on the bishop of the diocese nor that the headmastership had been refused by several distinguished priests simply on account of the impossible conditions i bought my experience that i quarrelled with the chaplains is quite true i did not quarrel effectually though they were a belgian and a frenchman they drank themselves drunk on beer out of decanters chased each other round the refectory tables in a tipsy fight defied my authority and compelled the ragamuffins of the school to do the same i naturally resigned that post as quickly as possible then follows a pseudohistory of the beginning of my ecclesiastical career at maryvale talacryn knows all about that and can tell you at your leisure afterwards i came across i am quoting came across a certain pictish lairdie and was maintained by him for three or four months and i know all about that semphill interrupted you gave a great deal more than you got the fallacies connected with my career at and expulsion from st andrews college are known thoroughly assented semphill talacryn and carvale in a breath the statement that i contracted large debts there what about those debts ragna asked carvale told him they all were contracted under the personal supervision of the vicerector they were quite insignificant besides that they would not have been contracted but for the promise of archbishop smithson and the advice of canon dugdale and the advice of me semphill added in a low tone oh you at length acknowledge it george fiercely thrust at him yes i acknowledge it well then were quits now george quietly and mysteriously mewed one confesses that the question of the pseudonym interests one sterling judicially said i had halfadozen you see when i was kicked out from college without a farthing or a friend at hand i literally became an adventurer thank god who gave me the pluck to face my adventures i was obliged to live by my wits thank god again who gave me wits to live by cardinal leighton was standingup blinking and blushing with indignation which distorted his honest placid features holy father dont say another word he twitched round towards his fellowcollegians how can you torture the man so he cried cant you see what youre doing wracking the poor soul like this pulling him in little pieces all over again shame on yeholy father dont say another word oh if i had only known cried van kristen you did i told you myself and you didnt believe me george fulminated the youngest cardinal wept into his handkerchief shaking with sobs george neither saw nor noted anyone he was glaring like a python demurrers to leightons remarks arose no one wanted to wrack anybody questions had been invited of course no one believed but it would be so much more satisfactoryragna added george sat violently still in his chair while they talked let them talk and prepared to resume if your holiness would condescend carvale began there is no holiness here george interrupted in that cold white candent voice which was more caustic than silver nitrate and more thrilling than a scream if you would do us the favour of just noticing a few heads as you please george chucked at him agree among yourselves as to those heads and you shall have bodies and limbs and fingernails and teeth to fit them their eminencies began agreeing george meanwhile went into the secret chamber for ten minutes or so and returned with his cat on his neck and his own tobaccopouch he was beginning a cigarette and his gait was the gait of a challenged lion sterling presented him with a pencilled slip of paper he read aloud pseudonym begging letters debts luxurious living idleness false pretences as to means and position i think it right to say that i myself am perfectly satisfied on all those points said semphill ive read the calumniesand i call them dastardly calumniesin the light of my own knowledge of the facts and i can only say that the worst thing which theyve alleged against you is that youve been used to goabout bilking landlords all the rest is excusable not to say harmless gracious heavens george exclaimed in a rictus of rage do you suppose that a man of my description goesabout bilking landlords for the sake of the fun of the thing its no such deliriously jolly work i can tell you however ive never bilked any landlords if thats what you want to know never they saw that i worked like nineteen galleyslaves and they offered to trust me i voluminously explained my exact position and prospects to them i was foolish enough to believe that you catholics would keep your promises and pay me for the work which i did at your orders so i accepted credit i wish i had died when at length i was defrauded legally mindfor as my employers were catholics and sometimes priests i trusted to their honour and obtained no stamped agreementwhen i was defrauded of my wages my landlords lost patience poor thingsi dont blame them harried me reproached me at length turned me out and so prevented me from paying them i dug myself out of the gutter with these bare hands again and again and started anew to earn enough to pay my debts debts they never were off my chest for twenty years no matter what these vile liars say debts they say that i incurred them for luxurious living unjustifiably his passionate voice subsided he became frightfully cool and tense and terse analytical quite merciless to himself their eminencies never before had seen a surgical knife at work in a human heart and brain they sat all vigilant and attentive as selfdissection proceeded they say that i gorged myself with sumptuous banquets at grand hotels once after several days absolute starvation i got a long earned guinea and i went and had an omelette and a bed at a place which called itself a grand hotel it wasnt particularly grand in the ordinary sense of the term and my entertainment there cost me no more than it would have cost me elsewhere and it was infinitely cleaner and tastier they say that i ate daintily and had elaborate dishes made from a cookery book of my own the recipes there may have been a score of them were cutout of a penny weekly current among the working classes the dishes were lentils carrots anything that was cheapest cleanest easiest and most fillingnourishingat the price each dish cost something under a penny and i sometimes had one each day as i was living on credit i tried to injure no one but myself thats the story of my luxurious living let me add though that i was extravagant in proportion to my means in one thing whenever i earned a little bit i reserved some of it for apparatus conducing to personal cleanliness soap baths tooththings and so on im not a bit ashamed of that why did i use credit because it was offered because i hoped because that i did not abuse it you may see actually see by my style of livinghere are the receipted billsand by the number and quantity and quality of the works of my hands i never was idle i worked at one thing after another the catholic hour admits my skill and mispresents that as a crime at the same time i myself dont claim my indefatigability as a virtue nothing of the kind its something lower than that its comical to say it but my indefatigability was nothing but a purely selfish pose puton solely to make philanthropists look unspeakably silly to give the lie direct to all their idiotic iniquitous shibboleths it wasnt that i couldnt stop working but that i wouldnt the fact is that i long i burn i yearn i thirst i most earnestly desire to do absolutely nothing i am so tired i have such a genius for elaborate repose but convention always alleges idleness or drunkenness or lechery or luxury to be the causa causans of scoundrelism and of poverty thats a specimen of the eidola specus the systematizing spirit which damns half the world people never stop to think that there may be other causesthat men of parts become rakes or scoundrels or paupers for lack of opportunity to live decently and cleanly look at franois villon and christopher marlowe and sir richard steele and leo di giovanni and heaps of others well i resolutely determined that you never righteously should allege those things of me simply to deprive you of that excuse for your failure to do your duty to your neighboursimply to deprive you of the chance of classifying me among the ruck which your neglect has madei courted semistarvation and starvation i scrupulously avoided drink i hardly ever even spoke civilly to a woman and i laboured like a driven slave no i never was idle but i was a most abject fool i used to think that this diligent ascetic life eventually would pay me best i made the mistake of omitting to give its due importance to the word own in the adage virtue is its own reward i had no other reward except my unwillingly cultivated but altogether undeniable virtue a diabolic brute once said to me if i had your brains i would be earning a thousand a year i replied take them tell me what to do give me orders and i implicitly will obey you then take that thousand a year and give me two hundred and ill bless you all my days he said nothing and he did nothing he was just a fatuous liar i mocked him caught him stealing my correspondencethere is his written confessionand he wrote these anonymous calumnies in long cherished revenge the dreadful lambent voice flickered for a momentand more rapidly flashedon i repeat i never was idle i did work after work i designed furniture and fireirons i delineated saints and seraphim and sinners chiefly the former a series of rather interesting and polyonomous devils in a period of desperate revolt i slaved as a professional photographer making from french prints a set of negatives for lanternslides of the holy land which were advertised as being from original negativesmessing about the catholic hour elegantly denominates that portion of my purgatory well i admit it was messy and insanitary within the meaning of the act toobut then you see i was working for a catholic i did journalism reported inquests for eighteen pence i wrote for magazines i wrote books i invented a score of things experts used to tell me that there was a fortune waiting for me in these inventions that any capitalist would help me to exploit them they were small people themselves these expertssmall in that they were not obliged to pay income tax they had no capital to invest but they recommended me and advised me to apply to lots of people who hadgave me their names and addresses dictated the letters of application which i wrote i trusted them for they were business men and i knew that i was not of that species i quieted my repugnance and i laid invention after invention scheme after scheme work after work before capitalist after capitalist i was assured that it was correct to do so i despised and detested myself for doing it i scoured the round world for a patron these were my begging lettersat that time i was totally ignorant of the fact that there are thousands of people who live by inviting patronage and that most of them really have nothing to be patronized while the rest are cranks i knew that i had done such and such a new thing that i had exhausted myself and my resources in doing it that my deed was approved by specialists who thoroughly knew the subject i was very ashamed to ask for help to make my invention profitable but i was quite honestgenerous i always offered a share in the profitsalways i did not ask for and i did not expect something for nothing i had done so much and i wanted so little but i did want that littlefor my creditorsfor giving ease to some slaves of my acquaintance i was a fool a sanguine ignorant abject fool i never learned by experience i still kept on a haggard shabby shy priestlyvisaged individual such as i was could not hope to win the confidence of men who daily were approached by splendid plausible cadgers my requests were too diffident too modest i made the mistake of appealing to brains rather than to bowels to reason rather than to sentiment i wanted hundreds or thousandssay two others wanted and got tens and hundreds of thousands a cottonwaste merchant could not risk fifteenhundred on my work although he liked me personally and said that he believed in the value of my inventions but at the same time he cheerfully lost twelvethousand in a scheme for ventilated boots i myself was wearing ventilated boots then but the ventilatedboot man wore resplendent patent leather cardinals secretaries could live at the rate of twothousandtwohundredandninety pounds a year and borrow threethousandandsixty pounds on a salary of twohundred pounds a year and they could become bankrupt for fourthousandonehundredandtwenty pounds with onehundredandeighty pounds worth of assets but ii could not get my due from that man one of whose secretaries wrote his business to me on the franked notepaper of the late queen of englands treasury while the other the bankrupt gave me a winter of starvation because his lord had altered his mind quoth he about the job on which i was working and had determined to put his money into a cathedral no i never accomplished the whole art and mystery of mendicity i perfectly could see what was required of him who would be a successful swindler i was not that one i was playing another kind of gameunfortunately an honest one take that unfortunately for irony please i meanbut you perfectly know what i meani made nothing of my inventions by degrees i had the mortification of seeing others arrive at the discovery which i had made years before they contrived to turn it into gold and fame that way one after another of my inventions became nulled to me i think i am right in saying that there are only four remaining at the present moment finance them now engage in trade like a monk or a nun no no i shall give them tothat doesnt matter it shall be done todayidle idle when i think of all the violently fatuous frantic excellent things ive done in the course of my struggles for an honest livingouf it makes me sick oh yes i have been helped god forgive me for bedaubing myself with that indelible blur i had not the courage to sitdown and fold my hands and die a brute once said that he supposed that i looked upon the world as mine oyster i did not i worked and i wanted my wages when they were withheld people encouraged me to hope on and offered me a guinea for the present i took the filthy guinea god forgive me for becoming so degraded not because i wanted to take it but because they said that they would be so pained at my refusal but one cant pay all ones debts and lead a godly righteous sober life for ever after on a guinea i was offered help but help in teaspoonfuls just enough to keep me alive and chained in the mire never enough to enable me to raise myself out of it i asked for work and they gave me a guineaand a tacit request to go and agonize elsewhere my weakness my fault was that i did not die murdered at maryvale at st andrews college the normal man treated as i was illtreated would have made no bones whatever about doing so but i was abnormal i took help when it was offered gently im thankful to say that i flung it back when it was offered charitably as the bishop of claughton offered it and monsignoryou know whom i mean talacrynand john newcastle of the weekly tabule ill tell you about the last he said that being anxious to do me a good turn he had deposited ten pounds with a printerman who would be a kind friend to me and would consult me as to how that sum could be expended in procuring permanent employment for me i took seven specimens of my handicraft to that printerman he admired them offered me a loan of five pounds on their security with that i fulfilled a temporary engagement then i consulted the printerman the kind friend he proposed to give me a new suit of clothes i was to do without shirts or socks to accept my services at no salary and to teach me the business of a printers reader for three months and then to recommend me for a situation as reader to some other printer but i said why waste three months in learning a new trade when i already had four trades at my fingers ends but i said what was i to live on during those three months but i said what certainty was there at the end of those three months but he said that he would have none of my lip for he knew all my capers and he bade me begone and take away my drawings those were ruined he had let them lie on his dirty office floor for months oh i admit that i have been helpedquite brutally and quite uselessly helped yes once when they told me at the hospital that i was on the verge of a nervous collapse a jesuit offered to help me he would procure my admission to a certain house of rest if i would consent to go there by the mercy of god i remembered that it was a licensed madhouse where they imprisoned you by force and tortured you fact there had been a fearful disclosure of their methods in the pmg well i refused to go rather than add that brand to what i had incurred through being catholic i made an effort of will and contrived to escape that danger contrived to recover my nerves and i continued my battleregarding my pseudonymsmy numerous pseudonymsthink of this i was a tonsured clerk intending to persist in my divine vocation but forced for a time to engage in secular pursuits both to earn my living and to pay my debts i had a shuddering repugnance from associating my name the name by which i certainly some day should be known in the priesthood with these secular pursuits i think that was rather absurd but i am quite sure that it was not dishonourable however for that reason i adopted pseudonyms i took advice about adopting them for in those days i used to take advice about everything not being man enough to act upon my own responsibility also the idea of using pseudonyms was suggested to me and the first one was selected for me as time went on and catholic malfeasance drove me from one trade to anotherfor you knowtalacryncarvalesemphillsterlingthat two excellent priests declared in so many words that they would prevent me from ever earning a livinglegal assassination you see definitely was contemplatedi say as catholic malfeasance drove me from one trade i invented another and another and i carried on each of these under a separate pseudonym in fact i split up my personality as rose i was a tonsured clerk as king clement i wrote and painted and photographed as austin white i designed decorations as francis engle i did journalism there were four of me at least i always have thought it so inexplicable that none of the authoritiesyou talacryn with your pretended confidence in me and your majestic immobility towards methat none of you ever realized the tremendous amount of energy which was being expended misdirected if you like certainly no one of you ever made a practical attempt to direct that energy i was a like a wild colt careering round and round a large meadow you all looked on and sneered erratic of course i was erratic for you all did your very best by stolidity hints insinuations commands to create obstacles over which i had to jump through which i had to tear a way and there was no one to bit and bridle me to ride me and to share his couch with me and of course my pseudonymity has been misunderstood by the stupid as well as mispresented by the invidious most people have only half developed their single personalities that a man should split his into four and more and should develop each separately and perfectly was so abnormal that many normals failed to understand it so when false pretences and similar shibboleths were shrieked they also took alarm and howled but there were no false pretences i told my name to everyone whom it concerned i am not the only person who has traded under pseudonyms or technikryms take for example the man whose shop i am said to have offered to buy he himself used a tradename he begged for my acquaintance when i was openly living as a tonsured clerk about a couple of years before my first pseudonym even was thought of take for another example those priests fr aleck of beal and the order of divine love who are alleged to have charitably maintained me by the way they never did that they always were paid for my entertainment in hard coin and their own pricealways and the fathers of divine love refused me shelter for one night in at the very time when they are said to have charitably maintained me they did suggest a common lodginghouse at fourpence though and i flung back the suggestion in their faces and walked the streets all night but all these people knew all about me and my pseudonyms in fact the very priest who suggested the common lodginghouse was the man on whose advice i adopted my first pseudonym it was invented by an old lady who chose to call herself my grandmother she was that priests patron and penitent it was approved by him and adopted by me and there you have the blind and naked truth on that point it now is pretended that king clement was a jesuitical machiavellian device of mine implying royalty dominions wealth and interminable nonsense i think that the pretension is due to malice and imbecillity it is malignant now but i firmly believe that it began by being imbecile i confess that the name taken together with my domineering manner my pedantic diction my austere and shall i say exclusive habit was liable to misconstruction by the low coarse halfeducated uncultured boors among whom i lived its an example of the eidola fori the strange power of words and phrases over the mind i think it really was believed in some vague way that i was an exiled sovereign or some rot of that sort i believe that i perceived it and laughed to myself about it but i did my best to disabuse the fools of their foolery that made things worse liars themselves they could not conceive of a man speaking truth to his own detriment my disclaimer was taken for a lie and they honoured me the more for it and chuckled at the thought of their own perspicacitythat is to say when what i said was intelligible to them you see i used to be a great talker i have had many experiences and i used freely to talk of them it amused and instructed and i like to amuse and to instruct you will understand that my voice and my manner of speech did not resemble the voice and the manner of speech of the ruffians with whom i worked and lived live as poorly as i would dress as shabbily as i would the moment i opened my mouth i was discovered to be different to those people they perceived it and i never could disguise my speech also im quite sure that they could not understand my speechfollow my argument i used words which were strange to them to express ideas unimagined by them while their halfdeveloped minds were more than half occupied not in listening to me but in contemplating me and in trying to form their particular idea of me by the aid of the vulgi sensus imperiti the imperfection of undisciplined senses at their disposal i called that imbecillity perhaps ignorance is the apter term the malice is to be found among people who ought to know better people to whom i have told the exact truth about myself exact at the time of telling people who being possessed by a desire to think evil think evil people who read between instead of on the lines people prone to folly whom i have not helped to avoid their predilection i tried to be simple and plain to sulk if you like in my own corner by myself it was no good anyhow i told no tales of realms or wealth as mine i made no false pretences i myself was grossly deceived barbarously manwomanandpriesthandled i was foolish to try to explain myself i was foolish to try to work with to live with to equal myself in every respect with verminous persons within the meaning of the act i ought to have died but i did not die that is all it is not half now you know make what you please of it tell me gentilotto instantly said why did you never go to the trappists because i went to something worse to something infinitely terribly more ghastly trappists live in beautiful silent solitude they have clean water beds regular meals and peace i went to live in intellectual silence and solitude in an ugly obscene mob where clean water was a difficulty food and a bed an uncertainty and where i had the inevitable certainty of ceaseless and furious conflict he hurled the words like javelins and drew back in his chair the old bitter feeling of disgust with himself inspired him he feared lest perhaps he might have seemed to be pleading for sympathy so he angrily watched to detect any signs of a wish to insult him with sympathy but he really had gone far far beyond the realm of human sympathy there was not a man on the earth who would have dared to risk rebuff to persist against rebuff to soar to him with that blessed salve of human sympathyfor whichunderneath his armourand behind his warlike mienhe yearned pity perhaps horror perhaps dislike perhaps might have met him but he only had emphasized his own fastidious aloofness he had clearedoff the mire but he had disclosed the cold of marble not the warmth of human flesh the cardinals remained silent for a minute then ragna said an enemy hath done this who is it george blazed with vigorous candid delight that is the first genuine word which i have had from the heart of your eminencyhe returned to his repellent manner i gave the names of my calumniators to cardinal leighton jerry sant the liblab aided by the woman and a clot of worms who had turned leighton said to ragna let them be smothered in the dunghill anathema sint ragna growled again there was an exposition of silence in the throneroom george was frozen hard and white ragna and leighton continued to look at each other carvales eyes had the blue brilliance of wet stars saviolli semphill talacryn whitehead were as though they had seen the saxificous head of the medoysa stirling gazed straight before him in the manner of the sphinx carven of black basalt george was watching them with halfshut eyes from the illimitable distance of his psychic altitude presently the pure pale old face of gentilotto and the pure pale young face of van kristen simultaneously were lifted and their eyes met his he blushed slowly drew out the pontifical ring and put it on his finger lord cardinals it is our will to be alone the supreme pontiff said they came one by one and kissed his ring and retired in silence chapter xxii when the door was shut hadrian remained quite motionless on the throne and set himself to review what he had said he wondered whether he for once had gotdown to and laidbare the root of the matter whether he for once had made his argument clear and convincinggood god who even could hope to be convincinghe flung the thing away from him and for ever closed that volume of the book of his life he rose and went straight into the bedroom here he stripped and stood erect knees and feet close gripped a pair of tenpound dumbbells and swung them with the alternating gesture of a right and left overhand bowler rhythmically swaying from the hips he counted up to a hundred and went to another movement a full round overhead sweep of both arms together expanding the longbreathing lungs quickening the pulses brightening the eyes his skin became moist and warm he washed his face and hands in oatmealwater with no soap and went into the bathroom turning on the high tap and letting the cold soft water raindown upon him until he was numbed he quickly dried himself and put on completely clean clothes rolling up those which he had discarded and thrusting them into a linen bag then he emerged all flushed and white and fresh and summoned sir iulo to the secret chamber and so you are thinking of marriage carino hadrian said putting the young man into a chair and bestowing fumificables sir iulo went almost as scarlet as his uniform his eyes and teeth gleamed hadrian handed to him a sheet of paper containing six stanzas of passionate expression in rhyme under the heading vorrei che tu ascoltassi la mia voce dont leave your sonnets about and dont be so terrified you silly boy well is it true the lovers face twitched rather i love her he said with an enormous vocal expansion of the middle word but i will not to abandon you santit he added with fixed eyes who is she is she good has she any money she is the little daughter of the dentist but good but yes but no money was the categorical reply does she love you oh but how she loves me how long have you known her since christmas santit when the father of that has scaled the my tooths have you spoken to the father of that about that oh but not yet santit nothing of less he knows i gave him to know without the word and he didnt drive you out of the house but no for behold me not the assassin of that dentist hadrian laughed can you describe her oh that i might to describe her to one who is so dear so wise describe her is named evnica is example of goodness of intellectuality for example yesterday with the favour of the most holy i make a visit i am entering the saloon in the manner of cat softly softly behold in a book reads the signorina evnicanot book of novels not journal of don chisciotte no i look over her shoulder reading titles behold book of piety entitled office to the proximate office to the proximate what book of piety is that sir iulo repeated the title in italian ah yes the duty towards our neighbour yes a very good sign in a girl go on sir iulo fixed his bright green eyes upon a mental image and described

santit and you do it very well you are one of the few men now alive who perceive the right moment for pressing the button understand i see with eyes but there is something beside seeing with eyes there is a mind which ponders and selects too much of honour no no honour at all a stated fact well now think of negatives they are dense in places clear in places and in other places more or less dense understand under the negative you put a certain paper and expose it to light light goes through the clear places and stains the paper black it partly goes through the more or less dense places and stains the paper grey in various gradations of tint it fails to go through the dense places and leaves the paper white there is your photograph a little black a little white and many different greys understand yes santit your photograph is an image of the form the contours the modelling the morbidezza of the object before your lens it lacks one thing it has not colour the process has tralated colour into monochrome do you see that yes santit now white means a blend of all colours and black means the absence of all colours then grey should mean some colours of this quality or that of this quantity or that according to the clarity or the density of the grey understand yes santit your negative is black and white and many greys yes santit then understand that all colours lie hidden in the black and white and greys of the negative in the black lie all colours it produces the positive white in the white lie no colours it produces the positive black in the various greys lie various colourswhy are you jumping about keep still and listen wriggling lizard that you are what do you want to do to liberate those poor colours so does everybody at least everybody wants to photograph in colours so they paint on the backs of the films and they play the fool with triplycoloured negatives only one man in the world knows that the colour already is therealready is there my

stay here till you feel betterptleebl ptleebl ptleebl hadrian mewed to his delighted and excited and persequent cat chapter xxiii it was the festival of st george protector of the ninefold kingdom hadrian noted with pleasure that it was what the italians call one of his fortunate days his head was clear his limbs were supple his body lithe he felt young exuberant potent his soul seemed balanced elevated his whole poise was one of gentle incisive simplicity he had that upright rather dominant gait by no means arrogant which marks the happy able man the sacred college came early in the morning directly after his mass to congratulate him on the anniversary of his pontificature and ragna took occasion to whisper that the northern emperor left palazzo caffarelli for the quirinale at dawn everyone knew what that meant when later hadrian descended in state to the sala regia he was on the alert the introducerofsovereigns announcedthe ninefold kingthe president of the united states of americathe northern emperorthe japanese emperorand a posse of subsidiary kings princes and sovereigndukes who came with the worlds congratulations the pontifical paraphernalia lay on the high red throne but hadrian stood at its foot to receive his guests his garb was white absolutely simple and fresh and his pose was apostolic frank and genial these enormous potentates towered above him in the splendour of their grandeur and as cardinal carvale the fantastic dreamer said to cardinal van kristen they radiated from him as from a source of light after the ceremony of reception was finished their majesties augustitudes highnesses and honours lingered chatting with the pontifical court some of them had a few words with the supreme pontiff the northern emperor came and said i know that your holiness will felicitate me on a dispatch which i have just received from my brother prince henry who announces that my glorious german navy has taken kronstadt hadrian replied and added be merciful augustitude william then did a politely ferocious scowl intended to indicate imperial impatience and continued in a lower tone i am also anxious to assure your holiness that i myself deeply regret the absence of my cousin and imperial brother victor emanuel all that i could say has been said to persuade his augustitude to join me on this auspicious and nevertobeforgotten occasion i wish that to be known it only is a personal obstacle not a political which prevents the southern emperor from coming here most holy lord it is not even a personal obstacle victor emanuel has the most profound and muchtobeadmired and preeminentlywellmerited veneration and reverence for your person it iswell really it seems almost childishbut he has persuaded himself that that the roman pontiff owes the king of italy a visit precisely holy father there is some history of an approach which his augustitudes royal and martyred father made to the conclave of and for a mere idea victor emanuel will continue alienate from us yet ideas are very fine things to be respected to be cultivated in this material age they are so rare so singular and constancy fidelity to an idea above all things is singular and rare in this age of compromise from which the world only now emerges victor emanuel is not to be blamed but praised suddenly a bright light came in the apostles eyes well then the next step is obvious if the son will not come to the father then the father must go to the son and an impulse to instant movement appeared to urge him onward the northern emperor splendidly rose to the occasion it would be one more grand deed added to your holinesss many grand deeds i trust that i may have the neversufficientlytobevalued honour of accompanying you but we walk said hadrian i also will gladly walk said william the pope darted a rapid glance round the hall the king of portugal was talking to the japanese emperor and the basil of the hellenes was listening to the prince of montenegroandnewservia the ninefold king with one arm paternally resting on the shoulder of the young king of spain was telling as his own an extremely funny story which he had heard five minutes before from cardinal semphill to the president of america cardinals and sovereigns clustered round them ploding with laughter at each admirably detailed jocosity we can escape this way the pope said to the emperor outside the hall a pontifical page ran for the white threecornered hat and the two descended the scala regia with its ionic columns flanked by pontifical guards and made their way into the square of st peters there was a cleared roadway and they quickly walked between long lines of magnificent italian soldiery rome occupied the sidewalks and sank to its knees as the supreme pontiff shedding benedictions went swinging lightly and swiftly by the german gentleman made no attempt to take salutes until hadrian said oh do notice these dear romans they will be pleased and you know that you profoundly admire the bersaglieri the emperor responded i am as proud to salute the romans as i am to salute the noblest roman of them allto use the words of your holinesss divine shakespeare and he strode on saluting while the pontiff blessed as they passed the palazzo venezia hadrian said victor emanuel really behaves extremely well threequarters of his army are in the field and here is a parcel of foreign sovereigns practically occupying his capital inno not homagein courtesy to us and also out of respect holiness out of respect then and courtesy to our apostolature it is no affair of his and yet he lines the streets with troops while he himselfoh its really very decent of him victor emanuel is a truly great man the emperor commented the pope assented they entered the palace of the quirinale and went straight through the ambassadors hall to the southern emperors study william remained in the antechamber victor emanuel in a lightgrey flannel suit was reading proofs of his numismatic catalogue he stood up pale and stiff when his groomofthechambers came in and whispered a word hadrian followed on the instant entering with candid gentle dignity extending an english hand not a word was said victor emanuel shining with the light of the purple which he had not yet worn took the outstretched hand held it felt his own gripped and held he bent his headthen his knee reconciliation was complete may i have the honour and the happiness of presenting my wife to your holiness he said a minute later he went along the corridor and gave two raps on a further door darling he cried please come the exquisite empress elena appeared she started slightly at first but bravely came on imperially mysteriously pale and radiant as the chorus of nightly stars and the bright powers which bring summer and winter to mortals conspicuous in the firmament hadrian at once won her with and the lovely children oh yes the kiddies victor emanuel said do you know that we owe one immense emotion to your boy and hadrian narrated the incident in prince attendolos garden mother and father proudly laughed yes we heard about that of course and i wondered what would happen if ever we ourselves should meet your holiness by accident as the children did the empress said well we have met and now your augustitudes know laughed hadrian filiberto is a queer little chap victor emanuel continued he says the most extraordinary thingscame running into the stables the other morning crying because some dog had barked and startled him stamp at em i said and after all you can run faster than a dog said i to hearten him yes says he but you see father when i do run im always putting out one leg at the back for the dog to bite but i can tell you something better than that the empress put in he was a bad boy in the chapel at benediction on sunday im afraid holiness that this is rather a naughty story tell it instantly and relieve your sinful soul daughter the haughty pontiff commanded how the three roared she continued he persisted in trying to balance a pile of prayerbooks on the ledge of his chairback and every now and then they came down with a crash at last i took him on my knee and told him that the holy angels were looking at him and that they would go and tell the lord god what a wicked little ruffian he was and then he saidhe said dirty little sneaks oh oh the exquisite boy hadrian shouted with laughter well ill go and fetch him said the southern emperor runningout of the door just as the northern emperor camein by the other prepared to play the part of peacemaker that now was not necessary and england germany and italy chattered like children till the children came their father did not return his men were having a bad time trying to beat the record for getting a sovereign into his habit of ceremony the fair prince filiberto solemnly approached the pope are you the white father which formerly i have seen in somebodys forest yes said hadrian are you quite good now the boy continued with great black basilic eyes no said hadrian feeling the horror of the end of youth confronted with the flower of innocence are you truly contrite for having been a naughty boyno man i mean yes said hadrian are you sitting on my fathers sofa because he has forgiven you yes said hadrian thinking what a frightful old fool he must appear i liked you when i saw you in that forest and i like you now but mother told me that the white father was not my fathers friend mother made a mistake little son said the empress leaning forward in sudden confusion the white father is fathers best friend oh how i am glad for that because now you can be also my friend the prince cried scattering his deliberate english to the four quarters of the globe most willingly said hadrian taking the rosebrown hand and drawing the child towards him innocence put up its pretty lips the apostle lost one breathand stooped and kissed the stainless brow then he turned to greet the girls this child once asked my husband a very awkward question the mother said presenting the princess yolanda the king of england was coming here and victor was shewing her his majestys incoronation portrait ah but how she admired it and she said father why dont you wear a hat like that king the supreme pontiff looked at the blushing child you would not call it a hat princess now that you are grown up no papa inglesea crown you would like your father to have a crown tell him that there are two waiting for him one at monza and another in the lateran the roman emperors escorted the pope returning to vatican on the way carriages met them and disgorged sovereigns statecoaches met them and emitted cardinals courtiers alighted from horseback and emerged from motorcars the return became a procession of the powers led by the power of the keys they had crossed the ponte santangelo and were about to turn to the left by the castle when a dishevelled man in black contrived to break out from the ranks of the people he got through the bersaglieri and stepped into the middle of the road pointed a revolver at hadrian and fired the bullet struck his holiness high up on the left breast piercing the pulmonary artery just above the lung the slim white figure stoppedwaveredand sank down the whole world seemed to stand still while the human race gasped once a frantic woman in a foxcoloured wig pitched out of the opposite crowd and grovelled love love she howled hideously oh and i loved him so oh oh i really did love him yes i did i did i did i did she yelped to the sun in the firmament of heaven the discord resembled the baying of a dog which breaks the cadence of handels largo on archlutes gods vicegerent movedlooked at her from a distance gently even curiously daughter go in peace he said and turned away she remained there grovelling longing to touch him forlorn gorgonized the roman emperors also kneeled to right and left fiercely looking among their aides for the help which did not come which could not come from man the assassin was in a hundred tearing hands screeches shot out of his gullet when they silently and inevitably began to tear him to pieces roman knives flashed over the parapet and slid into tiber hooked hands like the curving talons of griffins were the weapons for this work but the supreme pontiff beckoned him and the gesture was unmistakeableuniversally authoritative shaken and violently shaking jagged lacerated a disreputable wreck of pictish readymade tailoring jerry sant staggered forward staggered like one fascinated cardinals and sovereigns drew away from him and the mob hemmed him in for they know not the apostle raised himself a little supported by imperial hands how bright the sunlight was on the warm grey stones on the ripe roman skins on vermilion and lavender and blue and ermine and green and gold on the indecent grotesque blackness of two blotches on apostolic whiteness and the rose of blood augustitudes our will and pleasure is speak it most holy father augustitudes we name you both the ministers of this our will and to the murderer he said son you are forgiven you are free down borgo nuovo came guards chamberlains curial prelates cardinals from vatican the english and american cardinals took their vermilion on their arms and ran like lithe longlimbed schoolboys the faithful young sir john outran them all he kneeled to hadrian who said dear john take this crossand flavio the southern emperor unclasped the chain and rosy pectoral cross and handed them to the gentlemanoftheapostolicchamber who took them and fainted away out of santo spirito came one with the stocks of sacred chrism cardinals van kristen and carvale panting kneeled before the ruler of the world percy drew out the hidden pontifical pyx took the sacred host therefrom and held it the profession of faith most holy lord he bravely whispered i believe all that which holy mother church believes i ask pardon of all men dear jesus be not to me a judge but a saviour cardinal sterling gravely intoned the commendation of a christian soul the splendid company of angels the senate of apostles the army of whiterobed martyrs the lilied squadron of shining confessors the chorus of joyful maids patriarchs hermits stephen and lawrence silvester and gregory francis and lucy and mary magdalene marygods own mother all the saints of god who daily are invited to attend the passing of the poorest christian soul were invoked for the father of princes and kings and mild and cheerful may the aspect of christ jesus seem to thee the singers voice failed cardinal carvale went on with no interval imparted absolution and the sacrament of the dying saints of god advance to help him angels of the lord come to meet him receiving his soul offering it in the sight of the most high the splendour of mortal words reverberated from the ancient fortress wall in the great silence of immortal rome when the earthly vicar of jesus christ had received extreme unction and viaticum when he had had done for him all that which christs church can do he required to be lifted on his feet the roman emperors rose raising him the vehement ferocity of their aspect terribly contrasted with their tender movement the torments of powerless power of intimidation inflicted in the supreme moment of exultation rent these grand strong menand graced them the bloodstain streamed down the popes white robes with the red stole of universal jurisdiction the slender hand with the two huge rings ascended the shy brown eyes fluttered and were wide and very glad then the tired young voice rang like a quiet bell may god omnipotent father son and holy ghost bless you it was the apostolic benediction of the city and the world the hand and the dark eyelashes drooped and fell the delicate fastidious lips closed in the ineffable smile of the dead who have found out the secret of love and are perfectly satisfied so died hadrian the seventh bishop servant of the servants of god and some say martyr so died peter in the arms of caesar the world sobbed sighed wiped its mouth and experienced extreme relief the college of cardinals summed him up in the brilliant epigram of tacitus capax imperii nisi impersset he would have been an ideal ruler if he had not ruled religious people said that he was an incomprehensible creature and the man on the motor said that the pace certainly had been rather rapid pray for the repose of his soul he was so tired feliciter billing and sons ltd printers
