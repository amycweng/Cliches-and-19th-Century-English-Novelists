illustration the siren of our street our street by mr m a titmarsh illustration london chapman and hall strand mdcccxlviii our street illustration our street from the little nook which i occupy in it and whence i and a fellow lodger and friend of mine cynically observe it presents a strange motley scene we are in a state of transition we are not as yet in the town and we have left the country where we were when i came to lodge with mrs cammysole my excellent landlady i then took second floor apartments at no waddilove street and since although i have never moved having various little comforts about me i find myself living at no a pocklington gardens why is this why am i to pay eighteen shillings instead of fifteen i was quite as happy in waddilove street but the fact is a great portion of that venerable old district has passed away and we are being absorbed into the splendid new white stuccoed doric porticoed genteel pocklington quarter sir thomas gibbs pocklington mp for the borough of lathanplaster is the founder of the district and his own fortune the pocklington estate office is in the square on a line with waddil with pocklington gardens i mean the old inn the ram and magpie where the market gardeners used to bait came out this year with a new white face and title the shield c of the pocklington arms such a shield it is such quarterings howard cavendish de ros de la zouche all mingled together even our house a which mrs cammysole has had painted white in compliment to the gardens of which it now forms part is a sort of impostor and has no business to be called gardens at all mr gibbs sir thomass agent and nephew is furious at our daring to take the title which belongs to our betters the very next door no the honourable mrs mountnoddy is a house of five stories shooting up proudly into the air thirty feet above our old high roofed low roomed old tenement it belongs to captain bragg not only the landlord but the son in law of mrs cammysole who lives a couple of hundred yards down the street at the bungalow he was the commander of the ram chunder east indiaman and has quarrelled with the pocklingtons ever since he bought houses in the parish he it is who will not sell or alter his houses to suit the spirit of the times he it is who though he made the widow cammysole change the name of her street will not pull down the house next door nor the bakers next nor the iron bedstead and feather warehouse ensuing nor the little barbers with the pole nor i am ashamed to say the tripe shop still standing the barber powders the heads of the great footmen from pocklington gardens they are so big that they can scarcely sit in his little premises and the old tavern the east indiaman is kept by braggs ship steward and protests against the pocklington arms down the road is pocklington chapel rev oldham slocum in brick with arched windows and a wooden belfry sober dingy and hideous in the centre of pocklington gardens rises st waltheofs the rev cyril thuryfer and assistants a splendid anglo norman edifice vast rich elaborate bran new and intensely old down avemary lane you may hear the clink of the little romish chapel bell and hard by is a large broad shouldered ebenezer rev jonas gronow out of the windows of which the hymns come booming all sunday long going westward along the line we come presently to comandine house on a part of the gardens of which comandine gardens is about to be erected by his lordship farther on the pineries mr and lady mary mango and so we get into the country and out of our street altogether as i may say but in the half mile over which it may be said to extend we find all sorts and conditions of people from the right honourable lord comandine down to the present topographer who being of no rank as it were has the fortune to be treated on almost friendly footing by all from his lordship down to the tradesman our house in our street we must begin our little descriptions where they say charity should begin at home mrs cammysole my landlady will be rather surprised when she reads this and finds that a good natured tenant who has never complained of her impositions for fifteen years understands every one of her tricks and treats them not with anger but with scorn with silent scorn on the th of december for instance coming gently down stairs and before my usual wont i saw you seated in my arm chair peeping into a letter that came from my aunt in the country just as if it had been addressed to you and not to m a titmarsh esq did i make any disturbance far from it i slunk back to my bed room being enabled to walk silently in the beautiful pair of worsted slippers miss penelope j s worked for me they are worn out now dear penelope and then rattling open the door with a great noise descended the stairs singing son vergin vezzosa at the top of my voice you were not in my sitting room mrs cammysole when i entered that apartment you have been reading all my letters papers manuscripts brouillons of verses inchoate articles for the morning post and morning chronicle invitations to dinner and tea all my family letters all eliza townleys letters from the first in which she declared that to be the bride of her beloved michelagnolo was the fondest wish of her maiden heart to the last in which she announced that her thomas was the best of husbands and signed herself eliza slogger all mary farmers letters all emily delameres all that poor foolish old miss macwhirters whom i would as soon marry as in a word i know that you you hawk beaked keen eyed sleepless indefatigable old mrs cammysole have read all my papers for these ten years i know that you cast your curious old eyes over all the manuscripts which you find in my coat pockets and those of my pantaloons as they hang in a drapery over the door handle of my bed room i know that you count the money in my green and gold purse which lucy netterville gave me and speculate on the manner in which i have laid out the difference between to day and yesterday i know that you have an understanding with the laundress to whom you say that you are all powerful with me threatening to take away my practice from her unless she gets up gratis some of your fine linen i know that we both have a pennyworth of cream for breakfast which is brought in in the same little can and i know who has the most for her share i know how many lumps of sugar you take from each pound as it arrives i have counted the lumps you old thief and for years have never said a word except to miss clapperclaw the first floor lodger once i put a bottle of pale brandy into that cupboard of which you and i only have keys and the liquor wasted and wasted away until it was all gone you drank the whole of it you wicked old woman you a lady indeed i know your rage when they did me the honour to elect me a member of the poluphloisboiothalasses club and i ceased consequently to dine at home when i did dine at home on a beefsteak let us say i should like to know what you had for supper you first amputated portions of the meat when raw you abstracted more when cooked do you think i was taken in by your flimsy pretences i wonder how you could dare to do such things before your maids you a clergymans daughter and widow indeed whom you yourself were always charging with roguery yes the insolence of the old woman is unbearable and i must break out at last if she goes off in a fit at reading this i am sure i shant mind she has two unhappy wenches against whom her old tongue is clacking from morning till night she pounces on them at all hours it was but this morning at eight when poor molly was brooming the steps and the baker paying her by no means unmerited compliments that my landlady came whirling out of the ground floor front and sent the poor girl whimpering into the kitchen were it but for her conduct to her maids i was determined publicly to denounce her these poor wretches she causes to lead the lives of demons and not content with bullying them all day she sleeps at night in the same room with them so that she may have them up before daybreak and scold them while they are dressing certain it is that between her and miss clapperclaw on the first floor the poor wenches led a dismal life my dear miss clapperclaw i hope you will excuse me for having placed you in the title page of my little book looking out of your accustomed window and having your eye glasses ready to spy the whole street which you know better than any inhabitant of it it is to you that i owe most of my knowledge of our neighbours from you it is that most of the facts and observations contained in these brief pages are taken many a night over our tea have we talked amiably about our neighbours and their little failings and as i know that you speak of mine pretty freely why let me say my dear bessy that if we have not built up our street between us at least we have pulled it to pieces illustration a street courtship baker how them curl papers do become you miss molly miss molly git long now baker do the bungalow captain and mrs bragg long long ago when our street was the country a stagecoach between us and london passing four times a day i do not care to own that it was a sight of flora cammysoles face under the card of her mammas lodgings to let which first caused me to become a tenant of our street a fine good humoured lass she was then and i gave her lessons part out of the rent in french and flower painting she has made a fine rich marriage since although her eyes have often seemed to me to say ah mr t why didnt you when there was yet time and we both of us were free propose you know what psha where was the money my dear madam captain bragg then occupied in building bungalow lodge bragg i say living on the first floor and entertaining sea captains merchants and east indian friends with his grand ships plate being disappointed in a project of marrying a directors daughter who was also a second cousin once removed of a peer sent in a fury for mrs cammysole his landlady and proposed to marry flora off hand and settle four hundred a year upon her flora was ordered from the back parlour the ground floor occupies the second floor bed room and was on the spot made acquainted with the splendid offer which the first floor had made her she has been mrs captain bragg these twelve years you see her portrait and that of the brute her husband on the opposite side of the page bragg to this day wears anchor buttons and has a dress coat with a gold strap for epaulets in case he should have a fancy to sport them his house is covered with portraits busts and miniatures of himself his wife is made to wear one of the latter on his sideboard are pieces of plate presented by the passengers of the ram chunder to captain bragg the ram chunder east indiaman in a gale off table bay the outward bound fleet under convoy of her majestys frigate loblollyboy

bragg his telescope and speaking trumpet on the poop captain bragg presenting the officers of the ram chunder to general bonaparte at st helena titmarsh this fine piece was painted by me when i was in favour with bragg in a word bragg and the ram chunder are all over the house illustration captain and mrs bragg of our street although i have eaten scores of dinners at captain braggs charge yet his hospitality is so insolent that none of us who frequent his mahogany feel any obligation to our braggart entertainer after he has given one of his great heavy dinners he always takes an opportunity to tell you in the most public way how many bottles of wine were drunk his pleasure is to make his guests tipsy and to tell everybody how and when the period of inebriation arose and miss clapperclaw tells me that he often comes over laughing and giggling to her and pretending that he has brought me into this condition a calumny which i fling contemptuously in his face he scarcely gives any but mens parties and invites the whole club home to dinner what is the compliment of being asked when the whole club is asked too i should like to know mens parties are only good for boys i hate a dinner where there are no women bragg sits at the head of his table and bullies the solitary mrs bragg he entertains us with stories of storms which he bragg encountered of dinners which he bragg has received from the governor general of india of jokes which he bragg has heard and however stale or odious they may be poor mrs b is always expected to laugh woe be to her if she doesnt or if she laughs at anybody elses jokes i have seen bragg go up to her and squeeze her arm with a savage grind of his teeth and say with an oath hang it madam how dare you laugh when any man but your husband speaks to you i forbid you to grin in that way i forbid you to look sulky i forbid you to look happy or to look up or to keep your eyes down to the ground i desire you will not be trapesing through the rooms i order you not to sit as still as a stone he curses her if the wine is corked or if the dinner is spoiled or if she comes a minute too soon to the club for him or arrives a minute too late he forbids her to walk except upon his arm and the consequence of his ill treatment is that mrs cammysole and mrs bragg respect him beyond measure and think him the first of human beings i never knew a woman who was constantly bullied by her husband who did not like him the better for it miss clapperclaw says and though this speech has some of clapps usual sardonic humour in it i cant but think there is some truth in the remark illustration a studio in our street levant house chambers mr rumbold ara and miss rumbold when lord levant quitted the country and this neighbourhood in which the tradesmen still deplore him no known as levantine house was let to the pococurante club which was speedily bankrupt for we are too far from the centre of town to support a club of our own it was subsequently hired by the west diddlesex railroad and is now divided into sets of chambers superintended by an acrimonious housekeeper and by a porter in a sham livery who if you wont find him at the door you may as well seek at the grapes public house in the little lane round the corner he varnishes the japan boots of the dandy lodgers reads mr pinkneys morning post before he lets him have it and neglects the letters of the inmates of the chambers generally the great rooms which were occupied as the salons of the noble levant the coffee rooms of the pococurante a club where the play was furious as i am told and the board room and managers room of the west diddlesex are tenanted now by a couple of artists young pinkney the miniaturist and george rumbold the historical painter miss rumbold his sister lives with him by the way but with that young lady of course we have nothing to do i knew both these gentlemen at rome when george wore a velvet doublet and a beard down to his chest and used to talk about high art at the caf greco how it smelled of smoke that velveteen doublet of his with which his stringy red beard was likewise perfumed it was in his studio that i had the honour to be introduced to his sister the fair miss clara she had a large casque with a red horse hair plume i thought it had been a wisp of her brothers beard at first and held a tin headed spear in her hand representing a roman warrior in the great picture of caractacus george was painting a piece sixty four feet by eighteen the roman warrior blushed to be discovered in that attitude the tin headed spear trembled in the whitest arm in the world so she put it down and taking off the helmet also went and sat in a far corner of the studio mending georges stockings whilst we smoked a couple of pipes and talked about raphael being a good deal overrated i think he is and have never disguised my opinion about the transfiguration and all the time we talked there were claras eyes looking lucidly out from the dark corner in which she was sitting working away at the stockings the lucky fellow they were in a dreadful state of bad repair when she came out to him at rome after the death of their father the reverend miles rumbold george while at rome painted caractacus a picture of non angli sed angeli of course a picture of alfred in the neat herds cottage seventy two feet by forty eight an idea of the gigantic size and michael angelesque proportions of this picture may be formed when i state that the mere muffin of which the outcast king is spoiling the baking is two feet three in diameter and the deaths of socrates of remus and of the christians under nero respectively i shall never forget how lovely clara looked in white muslin with her hair down in this latter picture giving herself up to a ferocious carnifex for which bob gaunter the architect sat and refusing to listen to the mild suggestions of an insinuating flamen which character was a gross caricature of myself none of georges pictures sold he has enough to tapestry trafalgar square he has painted since he came back to england the flaying of marsyas the smothering of the little boys in the tower a plague scene during the great pestilence ugolino on the seventh day after he was deprived of victuals c for although these pictures have great merit and the writhings of marsyas the convulsions of the little prince the look of agony of st lawrence on the gridiron c are quite true to nature yet the subjects somehow are not agreeable and if he hadnt a small patrimony my friend george would starve fondness for art leads me a great deal to this studio george is a gentleman and has very good friends and good pluck too when we were at rome there was a great row between him and young heeltap lord boxmoors son who was uncivil to miss rumbold the young scoundrel had i been a fighting man i should like to have shot him myself lady betty bulbul is very fond of clara and tom bulbul who took georges message to heeltap is always hanging about the studio at least i know that i find the young jackanapes there almost every day bringing a new novel or some poisonous french poetry or a basket of flowers or grapes with lady bettys love to her dear clara a young rascal with white kids and his hair curled every morning what business has he to be dangling about george rumbolds premises and sticking up his ugly pug face as a model for all georges pictures miss clapperclaw says bulbul is evidently smitten and clara too what would she put up with such a little fribble as that when there is a man of intellect and taste who but i wont believe it it is all the jealousy of women illustration some of our gentlemen some of the servants in our street these gentlemen have two clubs in our quarter for the butlers at the indiaman and for the gents in livery at the paddington arms of either of which societies i should like to be a member i am sure they could not be so dull as our club at the poluphloisboio where one meets the same neat clean respectable old fogies every day but with the best wishes it is impossible for the present writer to join either the plate club or the uniform club as these runions are designated for one could not shake hands with a friend who was standing behind your chair or nod a how dye do to the batter who was pouring you out a glass of wine so that what i know about the gents in our neighbourhood is from mere casual observation for instance i have a slight acquaintance with thomas spavin who commonly wears the above air of injured innocence and is groom to mr joseph green of our street i tell why the brougham oss is out of condition and why desperation broke out all in a lather osses will this eavy weather and desperation was always the most mystest hoss i ever see i take him out with mr andersons ounds im above it i allis was too timid to ride to ounds by natur and colonel sprigs groom as says he saw me is a liar c c such is the tenor of mr spavins remarks to his master whereas all the world in our street knows that mr spavin spends at least a hundred a year in beer that he keeps a betting book that he has lent mr greens black brougham horse to the omnibus driver and at a time when mr g supposed him at the veterinary surgeons has lent him to a livery stable which has let him out to that gentleman himself and actually driven him to dinner behind his own horse this conduct i can understand but i cannot excuse mr spavin may and i leave the matter to be settled betwixt himself and mr green the second is monsieur sinbad mr clarence bulbuls man whom we all hate clarence for keeping mr sinbad is a foreigner speaking no known language but a mixture of every european dialect so that he may be an italian brigand or a tyrolese minstrel or a spanish smuggler for what we know i have heard say that he is neither of these but an irish jew he wears studs hair oil jewellery and linen shirt fronts very finely embroidered but not particular for whiteness he generally appears in faded velvet waistcoats of a morning and is always perfumed with stale tobacco he wears large rings on his hands which look as if he kept them up the chimney he does not appear to do anything earthly for clarence bulbul except to smoke his cigars and to practise on his guitar he will not answer a bell nor fetch a glass of water nor go of an errand on which au reste clarence dares not send him being entirely afraid of his servant and not daring to use him or to abuse him or to send him away adams mr champignons man a good old man in an old livery coat with old worsted lace so very old deaf surly and faithful that you wonder how he should have got into the family at all who never kept a footman till last year when they came into the street miss clapperclaw says she believes adams to be mrs champignons father and he certainly has a look of that lady as miss c pointed out to me at dinner one night whilst old adams was blundering about amongst the hired men from gunters and falling over the silver dishes fipps the buttoniest page in all the street walks behind mrs grimsby with her prayer book and protects her if that woman wants a protector a female acquaintance remarks heaven be good to us she is as big as an ogress and has an upper lip which many a cornet of the life guards might envy her poor dear husband was a big man and she could beat him easily and did too mrs grimsby indeed why my dear mr titmarsh it is glumdalca walking with tom thumb this observation of miss cs is very true and mrs grimsby might carry her prayer book to church herself but miss clapperclaw who is pretty well able to take care of herself too was glad enough to have the protection of the page when she went out in the fly to pay visits and before mrs grimsby and she quarrelled at whist at lady pocklingtons after this merely parenthetic observation we come to one of her ladyships large men mr jeames a gentleman of vast stature and proportions who is almost nose to nose with us as we pass her ladyships door on the outside of the omnibus i think jeames has a contempt for a man whom he witnesses in that position i have fancied something like that feeling showed itself as far as it may in a well bred gentleman accustomed to society in his behaviour while waiting behind my chair at dinner but i take jeames to be like most giants good natured lazy stupid soft hearted and extremely fond of drink one night his lady being engaged to dinner at nightingale house i saw mr jeames resting himself on a bench at the pocklington arms where as he had no liquor before him he had probably exhausted his credit little spitfire mr clarence bulbuls boy the wickedest little varlet that ever hung on to a cab was chaffing mr jeames illustration why our nursemaids like kensington gardens holding up to his face a pot of porter almost as big as the young potifer himself vill you now bigun or vont you spitfire said if youre thursty vy dont you say so and squench it old boy dont ago on makin fun of me i cant abear chaffin was the reply of mr jeames and tears actually stood in his fine eyes as he looked at the porter and the screeching little imp before him spitfire real name unknown gave him some of the drink i am happy to say jeamess face wove quite a different look when it rose gasping out of the porter and i judge of his dispositions from the above trivial incident the last boy in the sketch need scarcely be particularized doctors boy was a charity boy stripes evidently added on to a pair of the doctors clothes of last year miss clapperclaw pointed this out to me with a giggle nothing escapes that old woman as we were walking in kensington gardens she pointed me out mrs braggs nursery maid who sings so loud at church engaged with a life guardsman whom she was trying to convert probably my virtuous friend rose indignant at the sight thats why these minxes like kensington gardens she cried look at the woman she leaves the baby on the grass for the giant to trample upon and that little wretch of a hastings bragg is riding on the monsters cane miss c flew up and seized the infant waking it out of its sleep and causing all the gardens to echo with its squalling ill teach you to be impudent to me she said to the nursery maid with whom my vivacious old friend i suppose has had a difference and she would not release the infant until she had rung the bell of bungalow lodge where she gave it up to the footman the giant in scarlet had slunk down toward knightsbridge meanwhile the big rogues are always crossing the park and the gardens and hankering about our street illustration a street ceremony what sometimes happens in our street it was before old hunkingtons house that the mutes were standing as i passed and saw this group at the door the charity boy with the hoop is the son of the jolly looking mute he admires his father who admires himself too in those bran new sables the other infants are the spawn of the alleys about our street only the parson and the typhus fever visit those mysterious haunts which lie couched about our splendid houses like lazarus at the threshold of dives those little ones come crawling abroad in the sunshine to the annoyance of the beadles and the horror of a number of good people in the street they will bring up the rear of the procession anon when the grand omnibus with the feathers and the fine coaches with the long tailed black horses and the gentlemens private carriages with the shutters up pass along to saint waltheofs you can hear the slow bell tolling clear in the sunshine already mingling with the crowing of punch who is passing down the street with his show and the two musics make a queer medley not near so many people i remark engage punch now as in the good old times i suppose our quarter is growing too genteel for him miss bridget jones a poor curates daughter in wales comes into all hunkingtons property and will take his name as i am told nobody ever heard of her before i am sure captain hunkington and his brother barnwell hunkington must wish that the lucky young lady had never been heard of to the present day but they will have the consolation of thinking that they did their duty by their uncle and consoled his declining years it was but last month that millwood hunkington the captain sent the old gentleman a service of plate and mrs barnwell got a reclining carriage at a great expense from hobbs and dobbss in which the old gentleman went out only once it is a punishment on those hunkingtons miss clapperclaw remarks upon those people who have been always living beyond their little incomes and always speculating upon what the old man would leave them and always coaxing him with presents which they could not afford and he did not want it is a punishment upon those hunkingtons to be so disappointed think of giving him plate miss c justly says who had chests full and sending him a carriage who could afford to buy all long acre and everything goes to miss jones hunkington i wonder will she give the things back miss clapperclaw asks i wouldnt and indeed i dont think miss clapperclaw would somebody whom nobody knows that pretty little house the last in pocklington square was lately occupied by a young widow lady who wore a pink bonnet a short silk dress sustained by crinoline and a light blue mantle or over jacket miss c is not here to tell me the name of the garment or else a black velvet pelisse a yellow shawl and a white bonnet or else but never mind the dress which seemed to be of the handsomest sort money could buy and who had very long glossy black ringlets and a peculiarly brilliant complexion no pocklington square i say was lately occupied by a widow lady named mrs stafford molyneux the very first day on which an intimate and valued female friend of mine saw mrs stafford molyneux stepping into a brougham with a splendid bay horse and without a footman mark if you please that delicate sign of respectability and after a moments examination of mrs s ms toilette her manners little dog carnation coloured parasol c miss elizabeth clapperclaw clapped to the opera glass with which she had been regarding the new inhabitant of our street came away from the window in a great flurry and began poking her fire in a fit of virtuous indignation shes very pretty said i who had been looking over miss cs shoulder at the widow with the flashing eyes and drooping ringlets hold your tongue sir said miss clapperclaw tossing up her virgin head with an indignant blush on her nose its a sin and a shame that such a creature should be riding in her carriage forsooth when honest people must go on foot subsequent observations confirmed my revered fellow lodgers anger and opinion we have watched hansom cabs standing before that ladys house for hours we have seen broughams with great flaring eyes keeping watch there in the darkness we have seen the vans from the comestible shops drive up and discharge loads of wines groceries french plums and other articles of luxurious horror we have seen count wowskis drag lord martingales carriage mr deuceaces cab drive up there time after time and having remarked previously the pastry cooks men arrive with the trays and entres we have known that this widow was giving dinners at the little house in pocklington square dinners such as decent people could not hope to enjoy my excellent friend has been in a perfect fury when mrs stafford molyneux in a black velvet riding habit with a hat and feather has come out and mounted an odious grey horse and has cantered down the street followed by her groom upon a bay it wont last long it must end in shame and humiliation my dear miss c has remarked disappointed that the tiles and chimney pots did not fall down upon mrs stafford molyneuxs head and crush that cantering audacious woman but it was a consolation to see her when she walked out with a french maid a couple of children and a little dog hanging on to her by a blue ribbon she always held down her head then her head with the drooping black ringlets the virtuous and well disposed avoided her i have seen the square keeper himself look puzzled as she passed and lady kicklebury walking by with miss k her daughter turn away from mrs stafford molyneux and fling back at her a ruthless parthian glance that ought to have killed any woman of decent sensibility that wretched woman meanwhile with her rouged cheeks for rouge it is miss clapperclaw swears and who is a better judge has walked on conscious and yet somehow braving out the street you could read pride of her beauty pride of her fine clothes shame of her position in her downcast black eyes as for mademoiselle trampoline her french maid she would stare the sun itself out of countenance one day she tossed up her head as she passed under our windows with a look illustration the lady whom nobody knows of scorn that drove miss clapperclaw back to the fire place again it was mrs stafford molyneuxs children however whom i pitied the most once her boy in a flaring tartan went up to speak to master roderick lacy whose maid was engaged ogling a policeman and the children were going to make friends being united with a hoop which master molyneux had when master rodericks maid rushing up clutched her charge to her arms and hurried away leaving little molyneux sad and wondering why wont he play with me mamma master molyneux asked and his mothers face blushed purple as she walked away ah heaven help us and forgive us said i but miss c can never forgive the mother or child and she clapped her hands for joy one day when we saw the shutters up bills in the windows a carpet hanging out over the balcony and a crowd of shabby jews about the steps giving token that the reign of mrs stafford molyneux was over the pastry cooks and their trays the bay and the grey the brougham and the groom the noblemen and their cabs were all gone and the tradesmen in the neighbourhood were crying out that they were done serve the odious minx right says miss c and she played at picquet that night with more vigour than i have known her manifest for these last ten years what is it that makes certain old ladies so savage upon certain subjects miss c is a good woman pays her rent and her tradesmen gives plenty to the poor is brisk with her tongue kind hearted in the main but if mrs stafford molyneux and her children were plunged into a cauldron of boiling vinegar i think my revered friend would not take her out the man in possession for another misfortune which occurred in our street we were much more compassionate we liked danby dixon and his wife fanny dixon still more miss c had a paper of biscuits and a box of preserved apricots always in the cupboard ready for dixons children provisions by the way which she locked up under mrs cammysoles nose so that our landlady could by no possibility lay a hand on them dixon and his wife had the neatest little house possible no opposite and were liked and respected by the whole street he was called dandy dixon when he was in the dragoons and was a light weight and rather famous as a gentleman rider on his marriage he sold out and got fat and was indeed a florid contented and jovial gentleman his little wife was charming to see her in pink with some miniature dixons in pink too round about her or in that beautiful grey dress with the deep black lace flounces which she wore at my lord comandines on the night of the private theatricals would have done any man good to hear her sing any of my little ballads knowst thou the willow tree for instance or the rose upon my balcony or the humming of the honey bee far superior in my judgment and in that of some good judges likewise to that humbug clarence bulbuls ballads to hear her i say sing these was to be in a sort of small elysium dear dear little fanny dixon she was like a little chirping bird of paradise it was a shame that storms should ever ruffle such a tender plumage well never mind about sentiment danby dixon the owner of this little treasure an ex captain of dragoons and having nothing to do and a small income wisely thought he would employ his spare time and increase his revenue he became a director of the cornaro life insurance company of the tregulpho tin mines and of four or five railroad companies it was amusing to see him swaggering about the city in his clinking boots and with his high and mighty dragoon manners for a time his talk about shares after dinner was perfectly intolerable and i for one was always glad to leave him in the company of sundry very dubious capitalists who frequented his house and walk up to hear mrs fanny warbling at the piano with her little children about her knees it was only last season that they set up a carriage the modestest little vehicle conceivable driven by kirby who had illustration the man in possession been in dixons troop in the regiment and had followed him into private life as coachman footman and page one day lately i went into dixons house hearing that some calamities had befallen him the particulars of which miss clapperclaw was desirous to know the creditors of the tregulpho mines had got a verdict against him as one of the directors of that company the engineer of the little diddlesex junction had sued him for two thousand three hundred pounds the charges of that scientific man for six weeks labour in surveying the line his brother directors were to be discovered nowhere windham dodgin mizzlington and the rest were all gone long ago when i entered the door was open there was a smell of smoke in the dining room where a gentleman at noon day was seated with a pipe and a pot of beer a man in possession indeed in that comfortable pretty parlour by that snug round table where i have so often seen fanny dixons smiling face kirby the ex dragoon was scowling at the fellow who lay upon a little settee reading the newspaper with an evident desire to kill him mrs kirby his wife held little danby poor dixons son and heir dixons portrait smiled over the sideboard still and his wife was up stairs in an agony of fear with the poor little daughters of this bankrupt broken family this poor soul had actually come down and paid a visit to the man in possession she had sent wine and dinner to the gentleman down stairs as she called him in her terror she had tried to move his heart by representing to him how innocent captain dixon was and how he had always paid and always remained at home when everybody else had fled as if her tears and simple tales and entreaties could move that man in possession out of the house or induce him to pay the costs of the action which her husband had lost danby meanwhile was at boulogne sickening after his wife and children they sold everything in his house all his smart furniture and neat little stock of plate his wardrobe and his linen the property of a gentleman gone abroad his carriage by the best maker and his wine selected without regard to expense his house was shut up as completely as his opposite neighbours and a new tenant is just having it fresh painted inside and out as if poor dixon had left an infection behind kirby and his wife went across the water with the children and mrs fanny she has a small settlement and i am bound to say that our mutual friend miss elizabeth c went down with mrs dixon in the fly to the tower stairs and stopped in lombard street by the way so it is that the world wags that honest men and knaves alike are always having ups and downs of fortune and that we are perpetually changing tenants in our street illustration the lion of the street the lion of the street what people can find in clarence bulbul who has lately taken upon himself the rank and dignity of lion of our street i have always been at a loss to conjecture he has written an eastern book of considerable merit miss clapperclaw says but hang it has not everybody written an eastern book i should like to meet anybody in society now who has not been up to the second cataract an eastern book forsooth my lord castleroyal has done one an honest one my lord youngent another an amusing one my lord woolsey another a pious one there is the cutlet and the cabob a sentimental one timbuctoothen a humorous one all ludicrously overrated in my opinion not including my own little book of which a copy or two is still to be had by the way well then clarence bulbul because he has made part of the little tour that all of us know comes back and gives himself airs forsooth and howls as if he were just out of the great libyan desert when we go and see him that irish jew courier whom i have before had the honour to describe looks up from the novel which he is reading in the ante room and says mon maitre est au divan or monsieur trouvera monsieur dans son serail and relapses into the comte de montechristo again yes the impudent wretch has actually a room in his apartments on the ground floor of his mothers house which he calls his harem when lady betty bulbul they are of the nightingale family or miss blanche comes down to visit him their slippers are placed at the door and he receives them on an ottoman and these infatuated women will actually light his pipe for him little spitfire the groom hangs about the drawing room outside the harem forsooth so that he may be ready when clarence bulbul claps hands for him to bring the pipes and coffee he has coffee and pipes for everybody i should like you to have seen the face of old bowly his college tutor called upon to sit cross legged on a divan a little cup of bitter black mocha put into his hand and a large amber muzzled pipe stuck into his mouth by spitfire before he could so much as say it was a fine day bowly almost thought he had compromised his principles by consenting so far to this turkish manner bulbuls dinners are i own very good his pilaffs and curries excellent he tried to make us eat rice with our fingers it is true but he scalded his own hands in the business and invariably bedizened his shirt so he has left off the turkish practice for dinner at least and uses a fork like a christian but it is in society that he is most remarkable and here he would i own be odious but he becomes delightful because all the men hate him so a perfect chorus of abuse is raised round about him confounded impostor says one impudent jackass says another miserable puppy cries a third id like to wring his neck says bruff scowling over his shoulder at him clarence meanwhile nods winks smiles and patronises them all with the easiest good humour he is a fellow who would poke an archbishop in the apron or clap a duke on the shoulder as coolly as he would address you and me i saw him the other night at mrs bumpshers grand let off he flung himself down cross legged upon a pink satin sofa so that you could see mrs bumpsher quiver with rage in the distance bruff growl with fury from the further room and miss pim on whose frock bulbuls feet rested look up like a timid fawn fan me miss pim said he of the cushion you look like a perfect peri to night you remind me of a girl i once knew in circassia ameena the sister of schamyle bey do you know miss pim that you would fetch twenty thousand piastres in the market at constantinople law mr bulbul is all miss pim can ejaculate and having talked over miss pim clarence goes off to another houri whom he fascinates in a similar manner he charmed mrs waddy by telling her that she was the exact figure of the pacha of egypts second wife he gave miss tokely a piece of the sack in which zuleikah was drowned and he actually persuaded that poor little silly miss vain to turn mahometan and sent her up to the turkish ambassadors to look out for a mufti illustration the dove of the street the dove of our street if bulbul is our lion young oriel may be described as the dove of our colony he is almost as great a pasha among the ladies as bulbul they crowd in flocks to see him at saint waltheofs where the immense height of his forehead the rigid asceticism of his surplice the twang with which he intones the service and the namby pamby mysticism of his sermons has turned all the dear girls heads for some time past while we were having a rubber at mrs chauntrys whose daughters are following the new mode i heard the following talk which made me revoke by the way going on in what was formerly called the young ladys room but is now styled the oratory the oratory miss chauntry miss isabel chauntry miss de laisle miss pyx rev l oriel rev o slocum in the further room miss chauntry sighing is it wrong to be in the guards dear mr oriel miss pyx she will make frank de boots sell out when he marries mr oriel to be in the guards dear sister the church has always encouraged the army saint martin of tours was in the army saint louis was in the army saint waltheof our patron saint witikind of aldermanbury saint wamba and saint walloff were in the army saint wapshot was captain of the guard of queen boadicea and saint werewolf was a major in the danish cavalry the holy saint ignatius of loyola carried a pike as we know and miss de laisle will you take some tea dear mr oriel oriel this is not one of my feast days sister emma it is the feast of saint wagstaff of walthamstow the young ladies and we must not even take tea oriel dear sisters i said not so you may do as you list but i am strong with a heart broken sigh dont ply me he reels i took a little water and a parched pea after matins to morrow is a flesh day and and i shall be better then rev o slocum from within madam i take your heart with my small trump oriel yes better dear sister it is only a passing a weakness miss i chauntry hes dying of fever miss chauntry im so glad de boots need not leave the blues miss pyx he wears sackcloth and cinders inside his waistcoat miss de laisle hes told me to night he is going to to ro o ome miss de laisle bursts into tears rev o slocum my lord i have the highest club which gives the trick and two by honours thus you see we have a variety of clergymen in our street mr oriel is of the pointed gothic school while old slocum is of the good old tawny port wine school and it must be confessed that mr gronow at ebenezer has a hearty abhorrence for both as for gronow i pity him if his future lot should fall where mr oriel supposes that it will and as for oriel he has not even the benefit of purgatory which he would accord to his neighbour ebenezer while old slocum pronounces both to be a couple of humbugs and mr mole the demure little beetle browed chaplain of the little church of avemary lane keeps his sly eyes down to the ground when he passes any one of his black coated brethren there is only one point on which my friends they seem agreed slocum likes port but who ever heard that he neglected his poor gronow if he comminates his neighbours congregation is the affectionate father of his own oriel if he loves pointed gothic and parched peas for breakfast has a prodigious soup kitchen for his poor and as for little father mole who never lifts his eyes from the ground ask our doctor at what bedsides he finds him and how he soothes poverty and braves misery and infection the bumpshers no pocklington gardens the house with the quantity of flowers in the windows and the awning over the entrance george bumpsher esquire mp for humborough and the beaustalks kent for some time after this gorgeous family came into our quarter i mistook a bald headed stout person whom i used to see looking through the flowers on the upper windows for bumpsher himself or for the butler of the family whereas it was no other than mrs bumpsher without her chesnut wig and who is at least three times the size of her husband the bumpshers and the house of mango at the pineries vie together in their desire to dominate over the neighbourhood and each votes the other a vulgar and purse proud family the fact is both are city people bumpsher in his mercantile capacity is a wholesale stationer in thames street and his wife was daughter of an eminent bill broking firm not a thousand miles from lombard street he does not sport a coronet and supporters upon his london plate and carriages but his country house is emblazoned all over with those heraldic decorations he puts on an order when he goes abroad and is count bumpsher of the roman states which title he purchased from the late pope through prince polonia the banker for a couple of thousand scudi it is as good as a coronation to see him and mrs bumpsher go to court i wonder the carriage can hold them both on those days mrs bumpsher holds her own drawing room before her majestys and we are invited to come and see her sitting in state upon the largest sofa in her rooms she has need of a stout one i promise you her very feathers must weigh something considerable the diamonds on her stomacher would embroider a full sized carpet bag she has rubies ribbons cameos emeralds gold serpents opals and valenciennes lace as if she were an immense sample out of howell and jamess shop she took up with little pinkney at rome where he made a charming picture of her representing her as about eighteen with a cherub in her lap who has some liking to bryanstone bumpsher her enormous vulgar son now a cornet in the blues and anything but a cherub as those would say who saw him in his uniform jacket i remember pinkney when he was painting the picture bryanstone being then a youth in what they call a skeleton suit illustration venus and cupid as if such a pig of a child could ever have been dressed in anything resembling a skeleton i remember i say mrs b sitting to pinkney in a sort of egerian costume her boy by her side whose head the artist turned round and directed it towards a piece of gingerbread which he was to have at the end of the sitting pinkney indeed a painter a contemptible little humbug and parasite of the great he has painted mrs bumpsher younger every year for these last ten years and you see in the advertisements of all her parties his odious little name stuck in at the end of the list im sure for my part id scorn to enter her doors or be the toady of any woman illustration jolly newboy esq mp how different it is with the newboys now where i have an entre having indeed had the honour in former days to give lessons to both the ladies and where such a quack as pinkney would never be allowed to enter a merrier house the whole quarter cannot furnish it is there you meet people of all ranks and degrees not only from our quarter but from the rest of the town it is there that our great man the right honourable lord comandine came up and spoke to me in so encouraging a manner that i hope to be invited to one of his lordships excellent dinners of which i shall not fail to give a very flattering description before the season is over it is there you find yourself talking to statesmen poets and artists not sham poets like bulbul or quack artists like that pinkney but to the best members of all society it is there i made the sketch in the frontispiece while miss chesterforth was singing a deep toned tragic ballad and her mother scowling behind her what a buzz and clack and chatter there was in the room to be sure when miss chesterforth sings everybody begins to talk hicks and old fogy were on ireland bass was roaring into old pumps ears or into his horn rather about the navigation laws i was engaged talking to the charming mrs short while charley bonham a mere prig in whom i am surprised that the women can see anything was pouring out his fulsome rhapsodies in the ears of diana white lovely lovely diana white were it not for three or four other engagements i know a heart that would suit you to a t newboys i pronounce to be the jolliest house in the street he has only of late had a rush of prosperity and turned parliament man for his distant cousin of the ancient house of newboy of shire dying fred then making believe to practice at the bar and living with the utmost modesty in grays inn road found himself master of a fortune and a great house in the country of which getting tired as in the course of nature he should he came up to london and took that fine mansion in our gardens he represents mumborough in parliament a seat which has been time out of mind occupied by a newboy though he does not speak being a great deal too rich sensible and lazy he somehow occupies himself with reading blue books and indeed talks a great deal too much good sense of late over his dinner table where there is always a cover for the present writer he falls asleep pretty assiduously too after that meal a practice which i can well pardon in him for between ourselves his wife maria newboy and his sister clarissa are the loveliest and kindest of their sex and i would rather hear their innocent prattle and lively talk about their neighbours than the best wisdom from the wisest man that ever wore a beard like a wise and good man he leaves the question of his household entirely to the woman they like going to the play they like going to greenwich they like coming to a party at bachelors hall they are up to all sorts of fun in a word in which taste the good natured newboy acquiesces provided he is left to follow his own it was only on the th of the month that having had the honour to dine at the house when after dinner which took place at eight we left newboy to his blue books and went up stairs and sang a little to the guitar afterwards it was only on the th december the night of lady sowerbys party that the following dialogue took place in the boudoir whither newboy blue books in hand had ascended he was curled up with his house of commons boots on his wifes arm chair reading his eternal blue books when mrs n entered from her apartment dressed for the evening illustration the street door key mrs n frederic wont you come mr n where mrs n to lady sowerbys mr n id rather go to the black hole in calcutta besides this sanitary report is really the most interesting he begins to read mrs n piqued well mr titmarsh will go with us mr n will he i wish him joy at this puncture miss clarissa newboy enters in a pink palett trimmed with swansdown looking like an angel and we exchange glances of what shall i say of sympathy on both parts and consummate rapture on mine but this is by play mrs n good night frederic i think we shall be late mr n you wont wake me i daresay and you dont expect a public man to sit up mrs n its not you its the servants cocker sleeps very heavily the maids are best in bed and are all ill with the influenza i say frederic dear dont you think you had better give me your chubb key this astonishing proposal which violates every recognised law of society this demand which alters all the existing state of things this fact of a woman asking for a door key struck me with a terror which i cannot describe and impressed me with the fact of the vast progress of our street the door key what would our grandmother who dwelt in this place when it was a rustic suburb think of its condition now when husbands stay at home and wives go abroad with the latch key the evening at lady sowerbys was the most delicious we have spent for long long days thus it will be seen that everybody of any consideration in our street takes a line mrs minimy takes the homopathic line and has soires of doctors of that faith lady pocklington takes the capitalist line and those stupid and splendid dinners of hers are devoured by loan contractors and railroad princes mrs trimmer comes out in the scientific line and indulges us in rational evenings where history is the lightest subject admitted and geology and the sanitary condition of the metropolis form the general themes of conversation mrs brumby plays finely on the bassoon and has evenings dedicated to sebastian bach and enlivened with handel at mrs maskleyns they are mad for charades and theatricals they performed last christmas in a french piece by alexandre dumas i believe la duchesse de montefiasco of which i forget the plot but everybody was in love with everybody elses wife except the hero don alonzo who was ardently attached to the duchess who turned out to be his grandmother the piece was translated by lord fiddle faddle tom bulbul illustration a scene of passion being the don alonzo and mrs roland calidore who never misses an opportunity of acting in a piece in which she can let down her hair was the duchess alonzo you know how well he loves you and you wonder to see alonzo suffer cunegunda ask if the chamois suffer when they feel plunged in their panting sides the hunters steel or when the soaring heron or eagle proud pierced by my shaft comes tumbling from the cloud ask if the royal birds no anguish know the victims of alonzos twanging bow then ask him if he suffers him who dies pierced by the poisoned glance that glitters from your eyes he staggers from the effect of the poison the duchess alonzo loves alonzo loves and whom his grandmother o hide me gracious tomb her grace faints away such acting as tom bulbuls i never saw tom lisps atrociously and uttered the passage you athk me if i thuffer in the most absurd way miss clapperclaw says he acted pretty well and that i only joke about him because i am envious and wanted to act a part myself i envious indeed but of all the assemblies feastings junkettings djeunes soires conversaziones dinner parties in our street i know of none pleasanter than the banquets at tom fairfaxs one of which this enormous provision consumer gives seven times a week he lives in one of the little houses of the old waddilove street quarter built long before pocklington square and pocklington gardens and the pocklington family itself had made their appearance in this world tom though he has a small income and lives in a small house yet sits down one of a party of twelve to dinner every day of his life these twelve consisting of mrs fairfax the nine misses fairfax and master thomas fairfax the son and heir to twopence halfpenny a year it is awkward just now to go and beg pot luck from such a family as this because though a guest is always welcome we are thirteen at table an unlucky number it is said this evil is only temporary and will be remedied presently when the family will be thirteen without the occasional guest to judge from all appearances early in the morning mrs fairfax rises and cuts bread and butter from six oclock till eight during which time the nursery operations upon the nine little graces are going on we only see a half dozen of them at this present moment and in the present authentic picture the remainder dwindling off upon little chairs by their mamma the two on either side of fairfax are twins awarded to him by singular good fortune and he only knows nancy from fanny illustration the happy family by having a piece of tape round the formers arm there is no need to give you the catalogue of the others she in the pinafore in front is elizabeth goddaughter to miss clapperclaw who has been very kind to the whole family that young lady with the ringlets is engaged by the most solemn ties to the present writer and it is agreed that we are to be married as soon as she is as tall as my stick if his wife has to rise early to cut the bread and butter i warrant fairfax must be up betimes to earn it he is a clerk in a government office to which duty he trudges daily refusing even twopenny omnibuses every time he goes to the shoemakers he has to order eleven pairs of shoes and so cant afford to spare his own he teaches the children latin every morning and is already thinking when tom shall he inducted into that language he works in his garden for an hour before breakfast his work over by three oclock he tramps home at four and exchanges his dapper coat for that dressing gown in which he appears before you a ragged but honourable garment in which he stood unconsciously to the present designer which is the best his old coat or sir johns bran new one which is the most comfortable and becoming mrs fairfaxs black velvet gown which she has worn at the pocklington square parties these twelve years and in which i protest she looks like a queen or that new robe which the milliner has has just brought home to mrs bumpshers and into which she will squeeze herself on christmas day miss clapperclaw says that we are all so charmingly contented with ourselves that not one of us would change with his neighbour and so rich and poor high and low one person is about as happy as another in our street
