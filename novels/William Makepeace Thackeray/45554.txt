provided by the internet archive doctor birch and his young friends by mr m a titmarsh london chapman and hall illustration illustration illustration doctor birch the doctor and his staff there is no need to say why i became assistant master and professor of the english and french languages flower painting and the german flute in doctor birch's academy at rodwell regis good folks may depend on this that there was good reason for my leaving lodgings near london and a genteel society for an under master's desk in that old school i promise you the fare at the usher's table the getting up at five o'clock in the morning the walking out with little boys in the fields who used to play me tricks and never could be got to respect my awful and responsible character as teacher in the school miss birch's vulgar insolence jack birch's glum condescension and the poor old doctor's patronage were not matters in themselves pleasurable and that that patronage and those dinners were sometimes cruel hard to swallow never mind my connexion with the place is over now and i hope they have got a more efficient under master jack birch rev j birch of st neot's hall oxford is partner with his father the doctor and takes some of the classes about his greek i can't say much but i will construe him in latin any day a more supercilious little prig giving himself airs too about his cousin miss baby who lives with the doctor a more empty pompous little coxcomb i never saw his white neckcloth looked as if it choked him he used to try and look over that starch upon me and prince the assistant as if we were a couple of footmen he didn't do much business in the school but occupied his time in writing sanctified letters to the boys' parents and in composing dreary sermons to preach to them the real master of the school is prince an oxford man too shy haughty and learned crammed with greek and a quantity of useless learning uncommonly kind to the small boys pitiless with the fools and the braggarts respected of all for his honesty his learning his bravery for he hit out once in a boat row in a way which astonished the boys and the bargemen and for a latent power about him which all saw and confessed somehow jack birch could never look him in the face old miss z dared not put off any of her airs upon him miss rosa made him the lowest of curtsies miss raby said she was afraid of him good old prince many a pleasant night we have smoked in the doctor's harness room whither we retired when our boys were gone to bed and our cares and canes put by after jack birch had taken his degree at oxford a process which he effected with great difficulty this place which used to be called birch's dr birch's academy and what not became suddenly archbishop wigsby's college of rodwell regis they took down the old blue board with the gold letters which has been used to mend the pig stye since birch had a large school room run up in the gothic taste with statuettes and a little belfry and a bust of archbishop wigsby in the middle of the school he put the six senior boys into caps and gowns which had rather a good effect as the lads sauntered down the street of the town but which certainly provoked the contempt and hostility of the bargemen and so great was his rage for academic costumes and ordinances that he would have put me myself into a lay gown with red knots and fringes but that i flatly resisted and said that a writing master had no business with such paraphernalia by the way i have forgotten to mention the doctor himself and what shall i say of him well he has a very crisp gown and bands a solemn air a tremendous loud voice and a grand and solemn air with the boys' parents whom he receives in a study covered round with the best bound books which imposes upon many upon the women especially and makes them fancy that this is a doctor indeed but law bless you he never reads the books or opens one of them except that in which he keeps his bands and a dugdale's monasticon which looks like a book but is in reality a cupboard where he has his almond cakes and decanter of port wine he gets up his classics with translations or what the boys call cribs they pass wicked tricks upon him when he hears the forms the elder wags go to his study and ask him to help them in hard bits of herodotus or thucydides he says he will look over the passage and flies for refuge to mr prince or to the crib he keeps the flogging department in his own hands finding that his son was too savage he has awful brows and a big voice but his roar frightens nobody it is only a lion's skin or so to say a muff little mordant made a picture of him with large ears like a well known domestic animal and had his own justly boxed for the caricature the doctor discovered him in the fact and was in a flaming rage and threatened whipping at first but in the course of the day an opportune basket of game arriving from mordant's father the doctor became mollified and has burnt the picture with the ears however i have one wafered up in my desk by the hand of the same little rascal and the frontispiece of this very book is drawn from it the cock of the school i am growing an old fellow and have seen many great folks in the course of my travels and time louis philippe coming out of the tuileries his majesty the king of prussia and the reichsverweser accolading each other at cologne at my elbow admiral sir charles napier in an omnibus once the duke of wellington the immortal goethe at weimar the late benevolent pope gregory xvi and a score more of the famous in this world the whom whenever one looks at one has a mild shock of awe and tremor i like this feeling and decent fear and trembling with which a modest spirit salutes a great man well i have seen generals capering on horseback at the head of their crimson battalions bishops sailing down cathedral aisles with downcast eyes pressing their trencher caps to their hearts with their fat white hands college heads when her majesty is on a visit the doctor in all his glory at the head of his school on speech day a great sight and all great men these i have never met the late mr thomas cribb but i have no doubt should have regarded him with the same feeling of awe with which i look every day at george champion the cock of dr birch's school when i say i reflect as i go up and set him a sum that he could whop me in two minutes double up prince and the other assistant and pitch the doctor out of window i can't but think how great how generous how magnanimous a creature this is that sits quite quiet and good natured and works his equation and ponders through his greek play he might take the schoolroom pillars and pull the house down if he liked he might close the door and demolish every one of us like antar the lover of ibla but he lets us live he never thrashes anybody without a cause when woe betide the tyrant or the sneak i think that to be strong and able to whop everybody not to do it mind you but to feel that you were able to do it would be the greatest of all gifts there is a serene good humour which plays about george champion's broad face which shows the consciousness of this power and lights up his honest blue eyes with a magnanimous calm he is invictus even when a cub there was no beating this lion six years ago the undaunted little warrior actually stood up to frank davison the indian officer now poor little charley's brother whom miss raby nursed so affectionately then seventeen years old and the cock of birch's they were obliged to drag off the boy and frank with admiration and regard for him prophesied the great things he would do legends of combats are preserved fondly in schools they have stories of such at rodwell regis performed in the old doctor's time forty years ago champion's affair with the young tutbury pet who was down here in training with black the bargeman with the three head boys of doctor wapshot's academy whom he caught maltreating an outlying day boy of ours c are known to all the rodwell regis men he was always victorious he is modest and kind like all great men he has a good brave honest understanding he cannot make verses like young pinder or read greek like lawrence the prefect who is a perfect young abyss of learning and knows enough prince says to furnish any six first class men but he does his work in a sound downright way and he is made to be the bravest of soldiers the best of country parsons an honest english gentleman wherever he may go illustration like all great men george is good humoured and lazy there is a particular bench in the play ground on which he will loll for hours on half holidays and is so affable that the smallest boys come and speak to him it is pleasant to see the young cubs frisking round the honest lion his chief friend and attendant however is young jack hall whom he saved when drowning out of the miller's pool the attachment of the two is curious to witness the smaller lad gambolling playing tricks round the bigger one and perpetually making fun of his protector they are never far apart and of holidays you may meet them miles away from the school george sauntering heavily down the lanes with his big stick and little jack larking with the pretty girls in the cottage windows george has a boat on the river in which however he commonly lies smoking whilst jack sculls him he does not play at cricket except when the school plays the county or at lord's in the holidays the boys can't stand his bowling and when he hits it is like trying to catch a cannon ball i have seen him at tennis it is a splendid sight to behold the young fellow bounding over the court with streaming yellow hair like young apollo in a flannel jacket the other head boys are lawrence the captain bunce famous chiefly for his magnificent appetite and pitman sur named roscius for his love of the drama add to these swanky called macassar from his partiality to that condiment and who has varnished boots wears white gloves on sundays and looks out for miss pinkerton's school transferred from chiswick to rodwell regis and conducted by the nieces of the late miss barbara pinkerton the friend of our great lexicograplier upon the principles approved by him and practised by that admirable woman as it passes into church illustration representations have been made concerning mr horace swanky's behaviour rumours have been uttered about notes in verse conveyed in three cornered puffs by mrs buggies who serves miss pinkerton's young ladies on fridays and how miss didow to whom the tart and enclosure were addressed tried to make away with herself by swallowing a ball of cotton but i pass over these absurd reports as likely to affect the reputation of an admirable seminary conducted by irreproachable females as they go into church miss p driving in her flock of lambkins with the crook of her parasol how can it be helped if her forces and ours sometimes collide as the boys are on their way up to the organ loft and i don't believe a word about the three cornered puff but rather that it was the invention of that jealous miss birch who is jealous of miss raby jealous of everybody who is good and handsome and who has her own ends in view or i am very much in error the little school room what they call the little school room is a small room at the other end of the great school through which you go to the doctor's private house and where miss raby sits with her pupils she has a half dozen very small ones over whom she presides and teaches them in her simple way until they are big or learned enough to face the great school room many of them are in a hurry for promotion the graceless little simpletons and know no more than their elders when they are well off illustration she keeps the accounts writes out the bills superintends the linen and sews on the general shirt buttons think of having such a woman at home to sew on one's shirt buttons but peace peace thou foolish heart miss raby is the doctor's niece her mother was a beauty quite unlike old zoe therefore and she married a pupil in the old doctor's time who was killed afterwards a captain in the east india service at the siege of bhurtpore hence a number of indian children come to the doctor's for raby was very much liked and the uncle's kind reception of the orphan has been a good speculation for the school keeper it is wonderful how brightly and gaily that little quick creature does her duty she is the first to rise and the last to sleep if any business is to be done she sees the other two women go off to parties in the town without even so much as wishing to join them it is cinderella only contented to stay at home content to bear zoe's scorn and to admit flora's superior charms and to do her utmost to repay her uncle for his great kindness in housing her so you see she works as much as three maid servants for the wages of one she is as thankful when the doctor gives her a new gown as if he had presented her with a fortune laughs at his stories most good humouredly listens to zoe's scolding most meekly admires flora with all her heart and only goes out of the way when jack birch shows his sallow face for she can't bear him and always finds work when he comes near how different she is when some folks approach her i won't be presumptuous but i think i think i have made a not unfavourable impression in some quarters however let us be mum on this subject i like to see her because she always looks good humoured because she is always kind because she is always modest because she is fond of those poor little brats orphans some of them because she is rather pretty i dare say or because i think so which comes to the same thing though she is kind to all it must be owned she shows the most gross favouritism towards the amiable children she brings them cakes from dessert and regales them with zoe's preserves spends many of her little shillings in presents for her favourites and will tell them stories by the hour she has one very sad story about a little boy who died long ago the younger children are never weary of hearing about him and miss raby has shown to one of them a lock of the little chap's hair which she keeps in her work box to this day the dear brothers a melodrama in several rounds the doctor mr tipper uncle to the masters boxall boxall major boxall minor brown jones smith robinson tiffin minimus b go it old boxall j give it him young boxall r pitch into him old boxall s two to one on young boxall enter tiffin minimus running tiffin minimus boxalls you 're wanted the doctor to mr tipper every boy in the school loves them my dear sir your nephews are a credit to my establishment they are orderly well conducted gentleman like boys let us enter and find them at their studies enter the doctor and mr tipper grand tableau a hopeless case let us people who are so uncommonly clever and learned have a great tenderness and pity for the poor folks who are not endowed with the prodigious talents which we have i have always had a regard for dunces those of my own school days were amongst the pleasantest of the fellows and have turned out by no means the dullest in life whereas many a youth who could turn off latin hexameters by the yard and construe greek quite glibly is no better than a feeble prig now with not a pennyworth more brains than were in his head before his beard grew those poor dunces talk of being the last man ah what a pang it must be to be the last boy huge misshapen fourteen years of age and taken up by a chap who is but six years old and can't speak quite plain yet illustration master hulker is in that condition at birch's he is the most honest kind active plucky generous creature he can do many things better than most boys he can go up a tree jump play at cricket dive and swim perfectly he can eat twice as much as almost any lady as miss birch well knows he has a pretty talent at carving figures with his hack knife he makes and paints little coaches he can take a watch to pieces and put it together again he can do everything but learn his lesson and there he sticks at the bottom of the school hopeless as the little boys are drafted in from miss raby's class it is true she is one of the best instructresses in the world they enter and hop over poor hulker he would be handed over to the governess only he is too big sometimes i used to think that this desperate stupidity was a stratagem of the poor rascal's and that he shammed dulness so that he might be degraded into miss raby's class if she would teach me i know before george i would put on a pinafore and a little jacket but no it is a natural incapacity for the latin grammar if you could see his grammar it is a perfect curiosity of dog's ears the leaves and cover are all curled and ragged many of the pages are worn away with the rubbing of his elbows as he sits poring over the hopeless volume with the blows of his fists as he thumps it madly or with the poor fellow's tears you see him wiping them away with the back of his hand as he tries and tries and can't do it when i think of that latin grammar and that infernal as in praesenti and of other things which i was made to learn in my youth upon my conscience i am surprised that we ever survived it when one thinks of the boys who have been caned because they could not master that intolerable jargon good lord what a pitiful chorus these poor little creatures send up be gentle with them ye schoolmasters and only whop those who won't learn the doctor has operated upon hulker between ourselves but the boy was so little affected you would have thought he had taken chloroform birch is weary of whipping now and leaves the boy to go his own gait prince when he hears the lesson and who cannot help making fun of a fool adopts the sarcastic manner with master hulker and says mr hulker may i take the liberty to inquire if your brilliant intellect has enabled you to perceive the difference between those words which grammarians have defined as substantive and adjective nouns if not perhaps mr ferdinand timmins will instruct you and timmins hops over hulker's head i wish prince would leave off girding at the poor lad he's an only son and his mother is a widow woman who loves him with all her might there is a famous sneer about the suckling of fools and the chronicling of small beer but remember it was a rascal who uttered it a word about miss birch the gentlemen and especially the younger and more tender of the pupils will have the advantage of the constant superintendence and affectionate care of miss zoe birch sister of the principal whose dearest aim will be to supply as far as may be the absent maternal friend prospectus of rodwell regis school this is all very fine in the doctor's circulars and miss zoe birch a sweet birch blossom it is fifty five years old during two score of which she has dosed herself with pills with a nose as red and a face as sour as a crab apple may do mighty well in a prospectus but i should like to know who would take miss zoe for a mother or would have her for one illustration the only persons in the house who are not afraid of her are miss flora and i no i am afraid of her though i do know the story about the french usher in but all the rest tremble before the woman from the doctor down to poor francis the knife boy and whom she bullies into his miserable blacking hole the doctor is a pompous and outwardly severe man but inwardly weak and easy loving a joke and a glass of port wine i get on with him therefore much better than mr prince who scorns him for an ass and under whose keen eyes the worthy doctor writhes like a convicted impostor and many a sunshiny afternoon would he have said mr t sir shall we try another glass of that yellow sealed wine which you seem to like and which he likes even better than i do had not the old harridan of a zoe been down upon us and insisted on turning me out with her miserable weak coffee she a mother indeed a sour milk generation she would have nursed she is always croaking scolding bullying yowling at the housemaids snarling at miss raby bowwowing after the little boys barking after the big ones she knows how much every boy eats to an ounce and her delight is to ply with fat the little ones who can't bear it and with raw meat those who hate underdone it was she who caused the doctor to be eaten out three times and nearly created a rebellion in the school because she insisted on his flogging goliah longman the only time that woman is happy is when she comes in of a morning to the little boys' dormitories with a cup of hot epsom salts and a sippet of bread boo the very notion makes me quiver she stands over them i saw her do it to young byles only a few days since and her presence makes the abomination doubly abominable as for attending them in real illness do you suppose that she would watch a single night for any one of them not she when poor little charley davison that child a lock of whose soft hair i have said how miss raby still keeps lay ill of scarlet fever in the holidays for the colonel the father of these boys was in india it was anne raby who tended the child who watched him all through the fever who never left him while it lasted or until she had closed the little eyes that were never to brighten or moisten more anny watched and deplored him but it was miss birch who wrote the letter announcing his demise and got the gold chain and locket which the colonel ordered as a memento of his gratitude it was through a row with miss birch that frank davison ran away i promise you that after he joined his regiment in india the ahmednuggar irregulars which his gallant father commands there came over no more annual shawls and presents to dr and miss birch and that if she fancied the colonel was coming home to marry her on account of her tenderness to his motherless children which he was always writing about that notion was very soon given up but these affairs are of early date seven years back and i only heard of them in a very confused manner from miss raby who was a girl and had just come to rodwell regis she is always very much moved when she speaks about those boys which is but seldom i take it the death of the little one still grieves her tender heart yes it is miss birch who has turned away seventeen ushers and second masters in eleven years and half as many french masters inconsolable i suppose since the departure of her favourite m grinche with her gold watch c but this is only surmise and what i gather from the taunts of miss rosa when she and her aunt have a tiff at tea but besides this i have another way of keeping her in order whenever she is particularly odious or insolent to miss raby i have but to introduce raspberry jam into the conversation and the woman holds her tongue she will understand me i need not say more note th december i may speak now i have left the place and don't mind i say then at once and without caring twopence for the consequences that i saw this woman this mother of the boys eating jam with a spoon out of master wiggins's trunk in the box room and of this i am ready to take an affidavit any day a tragedy this drama ought to be represented in about six cuts the school is hushed lawrence the prefect and custos of the rods is marching after the doctor into the operating room master backhouse is about to follow illustration master backhouse it's all very well but you see if i don't pay you out after school you sneak you master lurcher if you do i 'l tell again exit backhouse the rod is heard from the adjoining apartment hwish hhwish hwish hwish hwish hwish hwish re enter backhouse briggs in luck enter the knife boy hamper for briggses master brown hurray tom briggs i'll lend you my knife if this story does not carry its own moral what fable does i wonder before the arrival of that hamper master briggs was in no better repute than any other young gentleman of the lower school and in fact i had occasion myself only lately to correct master brown for kicking his friend's shins during the writing lesson but how this basket directed by his mother's housekeeper and marked glass with care whence i conclude that it contains some jam and some bottles of wine probably as well as the usual cake and game pie and half a sovereign for the elder master b and five new shillings for master decimus briggs how i say the arrival of this basket alters all master briggs's circumstances in life and the estimation in which many persons regard him illustration if he is a good hearted boy as i have reason to think the very first thing he will do before inspecting the contents of the hamper or cutting into them with the knife which master brown has so considerately lent him will be to read over the letter from home which lies on the top of the parcel he does so as i remark to miss raby for whom i happened to be mending pens when the little circumstance arose with a flushed face and winking eyes look how the other boys are peering into the basket as he reads i say to her isn't it a pretty picture part of the letter is in a very large hand that is from his little sister and i would wager that she netted the little purse which he has just taken out of it and which master lynx is eyeing you are a droll man and remark all sorts of queer things miss raby says smiling and plying her swift needle and fingers as quick as possible i am glad we are both on the spot and that the little fellow lies under our guns as it were and so is protected from some such brutal school pirates as young duval for instance who would rob him probably of some of those good things good in themselves and better because fresh from home see there is a pie as i said and which i dare say is better than those which are served at our table but you never take any notice of these kind of things miss raby a cake of course a bottle of currant wine jam pots and no end of pears in the straw with this money little briggs will be able to pay the tick which that imprudent child has run up with mrs ruggles and i shall let briggs major pay for the pencil case which bullock sold to him it will be a lesson to the young prodigal for the future but i say what a change there will be in his life for some time to come and at least until his present wealth is spent the boys who bully him will mollify towards him and accept his pie and sweetmeats they will have feasts in the bed room and that wine will taste more deliciously to them than the best out of the doctor's cellar the cronies will be invited young master wagg will tell his most dreadful story and sing his best song for a slice of that pie what a jolly night they will have when we go the rounds at night mr prince and i will take care to make a noise before we come to briggs's room so that the boys may have time to put the light out to push the things away and to scud into bed doctor spry may be put in requisition the next morning nonsense you absurd creature cries out miss raby laughing and i lay down the twelfth pen very nicely mended yes after luxury comes the doctor i say after extravagance a hole in the breeches pocket to judge from his disposition briggs major will not be much better off a couple of days hence than he is now and if i am not mistaken will end life a poor man brown will be kicking his shins before a week is over depend upon it there are boys and men of all sorts miss r there are selfish sneaks who hoard until the store they daren't use grows mouldy there are spendthrifts who fling away parasites who flatter and lick its shoes and snarling curs who hate and envy good fortune i put down the last of the pens brushing away with it the quill chips from her desk first and she looked at me with a kind wondering face i brushed them away clicked the pen knife into my pocket made her a bow and walked off for the bell was ringing for school a young fellow who is pretty sure to succeed if master briggs is destined in all probability to be a poor man the chances are that mr bullock will have a very different lot he is a son of a partner of the eminent banking firm of bullock and hulker lombard street and very high in the upper school quite out of my jurisdiction consequently he writes the most beautiful current hand ever seen and the way in which he mastered arithmetic going away into recondite and wonderful rules in the tutor's assistant which some masters even dare not approach is described by the doctor in terms of admiration he is mr prince's best algebra pupil and a very fair classic too doing everything well for which he has a mind he does not busy himself with the sports of his comrades and holds a cricket bat no better than miss raby would he employs the play hours in improving his mind and reading the newspaper he is a profound politician and it must be owned on the liberal side the elder boys despise him rather and when champion major passes he turns his head and looks down i don't like the expression of bullock's narrow green eyes as they follow the elder champion who does not seem to know or care how much the other hates him no mr bullock though perhaps the cleverest and most accomplished boy in the school associates with the quite little boys when he is minded for society to these he is quite affable courteous and winning he never fagged or thrashed one of them he has done the verses and corrected the exercises of many and many is the little lad to whom he has lent a little money it is true he charges at the rate of a penny a week for every sixpence lent out but many a fellow to whom tarts are a present necessity is happy to pay this interest for the loan these transactions are kept secret mr bullock in rather a whining tone when he takes master green aside and does the requisite business for him says you know you'll go and talk about it everywhere i don't want to lend you the money i want to buy something with it it's only to oblige you and yet i am sure you will go and make fun of me whereon of course green eager for the money vows solemnly that the transaction shall be confidential and only speaks when the payment of the interest becomes oppressive thus it is that mr bullock's practices are at all known at a very early period indeed his commercial genius manifested itself and by happy speculations in toffey by composing a sweet drink made of stick liquorice and brown sugar and selling it at a profit to the younger children by purchasing a series of novels which he let out at an adequate remuneration by doing boys exercises for a penny and other processes he showed the bent of his mind at the end of the half year he always went home richer than when he arrived at school with his purse full of money nobody knows how much he brought but the accounts are fabulous twenty thirty fifty it is impossible to say how many sovereigns when joked about his money he turns pale and swears he has not a shilling whereas he has had a banker's account ever since he was thirteen years old at the present moment he is employed in negotiating the sale of a knife with master green and is pointing out to the latter the beauty of the six blades and that he need not pay until after the holidays illustration champion major has sworn that he will break every bone in his skin the next time that he cheats a little boy and is bearing down upon him let us come away it is frightful to see that big peaceful clever coward moaning under well deserved blows and whining for mercy duval the pirate jones minimus passes laden with tarts illustration duval hullo you small boy with the tarts come here sir jones minimus please duval they ain't mine duval o you abominable young story teller he confiscates the goods i think i like young duval's mode of levying contributions better than bullock's the former's at least has the merit of more candour duval is the pirate of birch's and lies in wait for small boys laden with money or provender he scents plunder from afar off and pounces out on it woe betide the little fellow when duval boards him there was a youth here whose money i used to keep as he was of an extravagant and weak disposition and i doled it out to him in weekly shillings sufficient for the purchase of the necessary tarts this boy came to me one day for half a sovereign for a very particular purpose he said i afterwards found he wanted to lend the money to duval the young ogre burst out laughing when in a great wrath and fury i ordered him to refund to the little boy and proposed a bill of exchange at three months it is true duval's father does not pay the doctor and the lad never has a shilling save that which he levies and though he is always bragging about the splendour of freenystown co cork and the fox hounds his father keeps and the claret they drink there there comes no remittance from castle freeny in these bad times to the honest doctor who is a kindly man enough and never yet turned an insolvent boy out of doors the dormitories master hewlett and master nightingale rather a cold winter night hewlett flinging a shoe at master nightingale's bed with which he hits that young gentleman hullo you get up and bring me that shoe illustration nightingale yes hewlett he gets up hewlett don't drop it and be very careful of it sir nightingale yes hewlett hewlett silence in the dormitory any boy who opens his mouth i'll murder him now sir are not you the boy what can sing nightingale yes hewlett hewlett chaunt then till i go to sleep and if i wake when you stop you 'll have this at your head master hewlett lays his bluchers on the bed ready to shy at master nightingale's head in the case contemplated nightingale timidly please hewlett hewlett well sir nightingale may i put on my trowsers please hewlett no sir go on or i ' nightingale through pleasures and palaces though we may roam be it ever so humble there's no place like home home home sweet sweet home there's no place like ho ome there's no place like home da capo a capture and a rescue illustration my young friend patrick champion george's younger brother is a late arrival among us has much of the family quality and good nature is not in the least a tyrant to the small boys but is as eager as an amadis to fight he is boxing his way up the school emulating his great brother he fixes his eye on a boy above him in strength or size and you hear somehow that a difference has arisen between them at football and they have their coats off presently he has thrashed himself over the heads of many youths in this manner for instance if champion can lick dobson who can thrash hobson how much more then can he thrash hobson thus he works up and establishes his position in the school nor does mr prince think it advisable that we ushers should walk much in the way when these little differences are being settled unless there is some gross disparity or danger is apprehended for instance i own to having seen the row depicted here as i was shaving at my bed room window i did not hasten down to prevent its consequences fogle had confiscated a top the property of snivins the which as the little wretch was always pegging it at my toes i did not regret snivins whimpered and young champion came up lusting for battle directly he made out fogle he steered for him pulling up his coat sleeves and clearing for action who spoke to you young champion fogle said and he flung down the top to master snivins i knew there would be no fight and perhaps champion too was disappointed the garden where the parlour boarders go noblemen have been rather scarce at birch's but the heir of a great prince has been living with the doctor for some years he is lord george gaunt's eldest son the noble plan tagenet gaunt gaunt and nephew of the most honourable the marquis of steyne illustration they are very proud of him at the doctor's and the two misses and papa whenever a stranger comes down whom they want to dazzle are pretty sure to bring lord steyne into the conversation mentioning the last party at gaunt house and cursorily remarking that they have with them a young friend who will be in all human probability marquis of steyne and earl of gaunt c plantagenet does not care much about these future honours provided he can get some brown sugar on his bread and butter or sit with three chairs and play at coach and horses quite quietly by himself he is tolerably happy he saunters in and out of school when he likes and looks at the masters and other boys with a listless grin he used to be taken to church but he laughed and talked in odd places so they are forced to leave him at home now he will sit with a bit of string and play cats cradle for many hours he likes to go and join the very small children at their games some are frightened at him but they soon cease to fear and order him about i have seen him go and fetch tarts from mrs ruggles for a boy of eight years old and cry bitterly if he did not get a piece he cannot speak quite plain but very nearly and is not more i suppose than three and twenty of course at home they know his age though they never come and see him but they forget that miss rosa birch is no longer a young chit as she was ten years ago when gaunt was brought to the school on the contrary she has had no small experience in the tender passion and is at this moment smitten with a disinterested affection for plantagenet gaunt next to a little doll with a burnt nose which he hides away in cunning places mr gaunt is very fond of miss rosa too what a pretty match it would make and how pleased they would be at gaunt house if the grandson and heir of the great marquis of steyne the descendant of a hundred gaunts and tudors should marry miss birch the schoolmaster's daughter it is true she has the sense on her side and poor plantagenet is only an idiot but there he is a zany with such expectations and such a pedigree if miss rosa would run away with mr gaunt she would leave off bullying her cousin miss anny raby shall i put her up to the notion and offer to lend her the money to run away mr gaunt is not allowed money he had some once but bullock took him into a corner and got it from him he has a moderate tick opened at the tart woman's he stops at rodwell regis through the year school time and holiday time it is all the same to him nobody asks about him or thinks about him save twice a year when the doctor goes to gaunt house and gets the amount of his bills and a glass of wine in the steward's room and yet you see somehow that he is a gentleman his manner is different to that of the owners of that coarse table and parlour at which he is a boarder i do not speak of miss r of course for her manners are as good as those of a duchess when he caught miss rosa boxing little fiddes's ears his face grew red and he broke into a fierce inarticulate rage after that and for some days he used to shrink from her but they are reconciled now i saw them this afternoon in the garden where only the parlour boarders walk he was playful and touched her with his stick she raised her handsome eyes in surprise and smiled on him very kindly the thing was so clear that i thought it my duty to speak to old zoe about it the wicked old catamaran told me she wished that some people would mind their own business and hold their tongues that some people were paid to teach writing and not to tell tales and make mischief and i have since been thinking whether i ought to communicate with the doctor the old pupil as i came into the play grounds this morning i saw a dashing young fellow with a tanned face and a blonde moustache who was walking up and down the green arm in arm with champion major and followed by a little crowd of boys they were talking of old times evidently what had become of irvine and smith where was bill harris and jones not squinny jones but cocky jones and so forth the gentleman was no stranger he was an old pupil evidently come to see if any of his old comrades remained and to revisit the cari luogi of his youth champion was evidently proud of his arm fellow he espied his brother young champion and introduced him come here sir he called the young 'un wasn't here in your time davison pat sir said he this is captain davison one of birch's boys ask him who was among the first in the lines at sobraon pat's face kindled up as he looked davison full in the face and held out his hand old champion and davison both blushed the infantry set up a hurray hurray hurray champion leading and waving his wide awake i protest that the scene did one good to witness here was the hero and cock of the school come back to see his old haunts and cronies he had always remembered them since he had seen them last he had faced death and achieved honour but for my dignity i would have shied up my hat too with a resolute step and his arm still linked in champion's captain davison now advanced followed by a wake of little boys to that corner of the green where mrs buggies has her tart stand hullo mother buggies don't you remember me he said and shook her by the hand lor if it ain't davison major she said well davison major you owe me fourpence for two sausage rolls from when you went away davison laughed and all the little crew of boys set up a similar chorus i buy the whole shop he said now young 'uns eat away then there was such a hurray hurray as surpassed the former cheer in loudness everybody engaged in it except piggy duff who made an instant dash at the three cornered puffs but was stopped by champion who said there should be a fair distribution and so there was and no one lacked neither of raspberry open tarts nor of mellifluous bull's eyes nor of polonies beautiful to the sight and taste the hurraying brought out the doctor himself who put his hand up to his spectacles and started when he saw the old pupil each blushed when he recognised the other for seven years ago they had parted not good friends what davison the doctor said with a tremulous voice god bless you my dear fellow and they shook hands a half holiday of course boys he added and there was another hurray there was to be no end to the cheering that day how's how's the family sir captain davison asked come in and see flora's grown quite a lady dine with us of course champion major come to dinner at five mr titmarsh the pleasure of your company the doctor swung open the garden gate the old master and pupil entered the house reconciled i thought i would just peep into miss raby's room and tell her of this event she was working away at her linen there as usual quiet and cheerful you should put up i said with a smile the doctor has given us a half holiday i never have holidays miss raby replied then i told her of the scene i had just witnessed of the arrival of the old pupil the purchase of the tarts the proclamation of the holiday and the shouts of the boys of hurray davison who is it cried out miss raby starting and turning as white as a sheet i told her it was captain davison from india and described the appearance and behaviour of the captain when i had finished speaking she asked me to go and get her a glass of water she felt unwell but she was gone when i came back with the water i know all now after sitting for a quarter of an hour with the doctor who attributed his guest's uneasiness no doubt to his desire to see miss laura birch davison started up and said he wanted to see miss raby you remember sir how kind she was to my little brother he said whereupon the doctor with a look of surprise that anybody should want to see miss raby said she was in the little school room whither the captain went knowing the way from old times a few minutes afterwards miss b and miss z returned from a drive with plantagenet gaunt in their one horse fly and being informed of davison's arrival and that he was closeted with miss raby in the little school room of course made for that apartment at once i was coming into it from the other door i wanted to know whether she had drunk the water illustration this is what both parties saw the two were in this very attitude well upon my word cries out miss zoe but davison did not let go his hold and miss raby's head only sank down on his hand you must get another governess sir for the little boys frank davison said to the doctor anny raby has promised to come with me you may suppose i shut to the door on my side and when i returned to the little school room it was blank and empty everybody was gone i could hear the boys shouting at play in the green outside the glass of water was on the table where i had placed it i took it and drank it myself to the health of anny raby and her husband it was rather a choker but of course i wasn't going to stop on at birch's when his young friends re assemble on the st of february next they will have two new masters prince resigned too and is at present living with me at my old lodgings at mrs cammysole's if any nobleman or gentleman wants a private tutor for his son a note to the rev f prince will find him there miss clapperclaw says we are both a couple of old fools and that she knew when i set off last year to rodwell regis after meeting the two young ladies at a party at general champion's house in our street that i was going on a goose's errand well well that journey is over now i shall dine at the general's on christmas day where i shall meet captain and mrs davison and some of the old pupils of birch's and i wish a merry christmas to them and to all young and old boys the play is done the curtain drops slow falling to the prompter's bell a moment yet the actor stops and looks around to say farewell it is an irksome word and task and when he 's laughed and said his say he shows as he removes the mask a face that's anything but gay one word ere yet the evening ends let's close it with a parting rhyme and pledge a hand to all young friends as fits the merry christmas time on life's wide scene you too have parts that fate ere long shall bid you play good night with honest gentle hearts a kindly greeting go alway good night i'd say the griefs the joys just hinted in this mimic page the triumphs and defeats of boys are but repeated in our age i 'd say your woes were not less keen your hopes more vain than those of men your pangs or pleasures of fifteen at forty five played o'er again i'd say we suffer and we strive not less nor more as men than boys with grizzled beards at forty five as erst at twelve in corduroys and if in time of sacred youth we learned at home to love and pray pray heaven that early love and truth may never wholly pass away and in the world as in the school i 'd say how fate may change and shift the prize be sometimes with the fool the race not always to the swift the strong may yield the good may fall the great man he a vulgar clown the knave be lifted over all the kind cast pitilessly down who knows the inscrutable design blessed be he who took and gave why should your mother charles not mine be weeping at her darling's grave we bow to heaven that will'd it so that darkly rules the fate of all that sends the respite or the blow that's free to give or to recall this crowns his feast with wine and wit who brought him to that mirth aud state his betters see below him sit or hunger hopeless at the gate who bade the mud from dives' wheel to spurn the rags of lazarus come brother in that dust we ' kneel confessing heaven that ruled it thus c b ob nov set so each shall mourn in life's advance dear hopes dear friends untimely killed shall grieve for many a forfeit chance and longing passion unfulfilled amen whatever fate be sent pray god the heart may kindly glow although the heart with cares be bent and whitened with the winter snow come wealth or want come good or ill let young and old accept their part and bow before the awful will and bear it with an honest heart who misses or who wins the prize go lose or conquer as you can but if you fail or if you rise be each pray god a gentleman a gentleman or old or young bear kindly with my humble lays the sacred chorus first was sung upon the first of christmas days the shepherds heard it overhead the joyful angels raised it then glory to heaven high it said and peace earth to gentle men my song save this is little worth i lay the weary pen aside and wish you health and love and mirth as fits the solemn christmas tide as fits the holy christmas birth be this good friends our carol still be peace on earth be peace on earth to men of gentle will the end
