and honesty which a work more elaborate might lose in his constant communication with the reader the writer is forced into frankness of expression and to speak out his own mind and feelings as they urge him many a slip of the pen and the printer many a word spoken in haste he sees and would recall as he looks over his volume it is a sort of confidential talk between writer and reader which must often be dull must often flag in the course of his volubility the perpetual speaker must of necessity lay bare his own weaknesses vanities peculiarities and as we judge of a mans character after long frequenting his society not by one speech or by one mood or opinion or by one days talk but by the tenor of his general bearing and conversation so of a writer who delivers himself up to you perforce unreservedly you say is he honest does he tell the truth in the main does he seem actuated by a desire to find out and speak it is he a quack who shams sentiment or mouths for effect does he seek popularity by claptraps or other arts i can no more ignore good fortune than any other chance which has befallen me i have found many thousands more readers than i ever looked for i have no right to say to these you shall not find fault with my art or fall asleep over my pages but i ask you to believe that this person writing strives to tell the truth if there is not that there is nothing perhaps the lovers of excitement may care to know that this book began with a very precise plan which was entirely put aside ladies and gentlemen you were to have been treated and the writers and the publishers pocket benefited by the recital of the most active horrors what more exciting than a ruffian with many admirable virtues in st giless visited constantly by a young lady from belgravia what more stirring than the contrasts of society the mixture of slang and fashionable language the escapes the battles the murders nay up to nine oclock this very morning my poor friend colonel altamont was doomed to execution and the author only relented when his victim was actually at the window the exciting plan was laid aside with a very honorable forbearance on the part of the publishers because on attempting it i found that i failed from want of experience of my subject and never having been intimate with any convict in my life and the manners of ruffians and jailbirds being quite unfamiliar to me the idea of entering into competition with m eugene sue was abandoned to describe a real rascal you must make him so horrible that he would be too hideous to show and unless the painter paints him fairly i hold he has no right to show him at all even the gentlemen of our agethis is an attempt to describe one of them no better nor worse than most educated meneven these we can not show as they are with the notorious foibles and selfishness of their lives and their education since the author of tom jones was buried no writer of fiction among us has been permitted to depict to his utmost power a man we must drape him and give him a certain conventional simper society will not tolerate the natural in our art many ladies have remonstrated and subscribers left me because in the course of the story i described a young man resisting and affected by temptation my object was to say that he had the passions to feel and the manliness and generosity to overcome them you will not hearit is best to know itwhat moves in the real world what passes in society in the clubs colleges newsroomswhat is the life and talk of your sons a little more frankness than is customary has been attempted in this story with no bad desire on the writers part it is hoped and with no ill consequence to any reader if truth is not always pleasant at any rate truth is best from whatever chairfrom those whence graver writers or thinkers argue as from that at which the storyteller sits as he concludes his labor and bids his kind reader farewell kensington nov th pendennis chapter i shows how first love may interrupt breakfast illustration one fine morning in the full london season major arthur pendennis came over from his lodgings according to his custom to breakfast at a certain club in pall mall of which he was a chief ornament as he was one of the finest judges of wine in england and a man of active dominating and inquiring spirit he had been very properly chosen to be a member of the committee of this club and indeed was almost the manager of the institution and the stewards and waiters bowed before him as reverentially as to a duke or a fieldmarshal at a quarter past ten the major invariably made his appearance in the best blacked boots in all london with a checked morning cravat that never was rumpled until dinner time a buff waistcoat which bore the crown of his sovereign on the buttons and linen so spotless that mr brummel himself asked the name of his laundress and would probably have employed her had not misfortunes compelled that great man to fly the country pendenniss coat his white gloves his whiskers his very cane were perfect of their kind as specimens of the costume of a military man en retraite at a distance or seeing his back merely you would have taken him to be not more than thirty years old it was only by a nearer inspection that you saw the factitious nature of his rich brown hair and that there were a few crowsfeet round about the somewhat faded eyes of his handsome mottled face his nose was of the wellington pattern his hands and wristbands were beautifully long and white on the latter he wore handsome gold buttons given to him by his royal highness the duke of york and on the others more than one elegant ring the chief and largest of them being emblazoned with the famous arms of pendennis he always took possession of the same table in the same corner of the room from which nobody ever now thought of ousting him one or two mad wags and wild fellows had in former days and in freak or bravado endeavored twice or thrice to deprive him of this place but there was a quiet dignity in the majors manner as he took his seat at the next table and surveyed the interlopers which rendered it impossible for any man to sit and breakfast under his eye and that tableby the fire and yet near the windowbecame his own his letters were laid out there in expectation of his arrival and many was the young fellow about town who looked with wonder at the number of those notes and at the seals and franks which they bore if there was any question about etiquette society who was married to whom of what age such and such a duke was pendennis was the man to whom every one appealed marchionesses used to drive up to the club and leave notes for him or fetch him out he was perfectly affable the young men liked to walk with him in the park or down pall mall for he touched his hat to every body and every other man he met was a lord the major sate down at his accustomed table then and while the waiters went to bring him his toast and his hot newspaper he surveyed his letters through his gold double eyeglass he carried it so gayly you would hardly have known it was spectacles in disguise and examined one pretty note after another and laid them by in order there were large solemn dinner cards suggestive of three courses and heavy conversation there were neat little confidential notes conveying female entreaties there was a note on thick official paper from the marquis of steyne telling him to come to richmond to a little party at the star and garter and speak french which language the major possessed very perfectly and another from the bishop of ealing and mrs trail requesting the honor of major pendenniss company at ealing house all of which letters pendennis read gracefully and with the more satisfaction because glowry the scotch surgeon breakfasting opposite to him was looking on and hating him for having so many invitations which nobody ever sent to glowry these perused the major took out his pocketbook to see on what days he was disengaged and which of these many hospitable calls he could afford to accept or decline he threw over cutler the east india director in bakerstreet in order to dine with lord steyne and the little french party at the star and garterthe bishop he accepted because though the dinner was slow he liked to dine with bishopsand so went through his list and disposed of them according to his fancy or interest then he took his breakfast and looked over the paper the gazette the births and deaths and the fashionable intelligence to see that his name was down among the guests at my lord soandsos fete and in the intervals of these occupations carried on cheerful conversation with his acquaintances about the room among the letters which formed major pendenniss budget for that morning there was only one unread and which lay solitary and apart from all the fashionable london letters with a country postmark and a homely seal the superscription was in a pretty delicate female hand and though marked immediate by the fair writer with a strong dash of anxiety under the word yet the major had for reasons of his own neglected up to the present moment his humble rural petitioner who to be sure could hardly hope to get a hearing among so many grand folks who attended his levee the fact was this was a letter from a female relative of pendennis and while the grandees of her brothers acquaintance were received and got their interview and drove off as it were the patient country letter remained for a long time waiting for an audience in the antechamber under the slopbasin at last it came to be this letters turn and the major broke a seal with fairoaks engraved upon it and clavering st marys for a postmark it was a double letter and the major commenced perusing the envelope before he attacked the inner epistle is it a letter from another jook growled mr glowry inwardly pendennis would not be leaving that to the last im thinking my dear major pendennis the letter ran i beg and implore you to come to me immediatelyvery likely thought pendennis and steynes dinner todayi am in the very greatest grief and perplexity my dearest boy who has been hitherto every thing the fondest mother could wish is grieving me dreadfully he has formedi can hardly write ita passion an infatuationthe major grinnedfor an actress who has been performing here she is at least twelve years older than arthurwho will not be eighteen till next februaryand the wretched boy insists upon marrying her hay whats making pendennis swear nowmr glowry asked of himself for rage and wonder were concentrated in the majors open mouth as he read this astounding announcement do my dear friend the griefstricken lady went on come to me instantly on the receipt of this and as arthurs guardian entreat command the wretched child to give up this most deplorable resolution and after more entreaties to the above effect the writer concluded by signing herself the majors unhappy affectionate sister helen pendennis fairoaks tuesdaythe major concluded reading the last words of the lettera dd pretty business at fairoaks tuesday now let us see what the boy has to say and he took the other letter which was written in a great floundering boys hand and sealed with the large signet of the pendennises even larger than the majors own and with supplementary wax sputtered all round the seal in token of the writers tremulousness and agitation the epistle ran thus fairoaks monday midnight my dear uncle in informing you of my engagement with miss costigan daughter of j chesterfield costigan esq of costiganstown but perhaps better known to you under her professional name of miss fotheringay of the theaters royal drury lane and crowstreet and of the norwich and welsh circuit i am aware that i make an announcement which can not according to the present prejudices of society at least be welcome to my family my dearest mother on whom god knows i would wish to inflict no needless pain is deeply moved and grieved i am sorry to say by the intelligence which i have this night conveyed to her i beseech you my dear sir to come down and reason with her and console her although obliged by poverty to earn an honorable maintenance by the exercise of her splendid talents miss costigans family is as ancient and noble as our own when our ancestor ralph pendennis landed with richard ii in ireland my emilys forefathers were kings of that country i have the information from mr costigan who like yourself is a military man it is in vain i have attempted to argue with my dear mother and prove to her that a young lady of irreproachable character and lineage endowed with the most splendid gifts of beauty and genius who devotes herself to the exercise of one of the noblest professions for the sacred purpose of maintaining her family is a being whom we should all love and reverence rather than avoidmy poor mother has prejudices which it is impossible for my logic to overcome and refuses to welcome to her arms one who is disposed to be her most affectionate daughter through life although miss costigan is some years older than myself that circumstance does not operate as a barrier to my affection and i am sure will not influence its duration a love like mine sir i feel is contracted once and for ever as i never had dreamed of love until i saw heri feel now that i shall die without ever knowing another passion it is the fate of my life it was miss cs own delicacy which suggested that the difference of age which i never felt might operate as a bar to our union but having loved once i should despise myself and be unworthy of my name as a gentleman if i hesitated to abide by my passion if i did not give all where i felt all and endow the woman who loves me fondly with my whole heart and my whole fortune i press for a speedy marriage with my emilyfor why in truth should it be delayed a delay implies a doubt which i cast from me as unworthy it is impossible that my sentiments can change toward emilythat at any age she can be any thing but the sole object of my love why then wait i entreat you my dear uncle to come down and reconcile my dear mother to our union and i address you as a man of the world qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes who will not feel any of the weak scruples and fears which agitate a lady who has scarcely ever left her village pray come down to us immediately i am quite confident thatapart from considerations of fortuneyou will admire and approve of my emily your affectionate nephew arthur pendennis jr when the major had concluded the perusal of this letter his countenance assumed an expression of such rage and horror that glowry the surgeonofficial felt in his pocket for his lancet which he always carried in his cardcase and thought his respected friend was going into a fit the intelligence was indeed sufficient to agitate pendennis the head of the pendennises going to marry an actress ten years his seniora headstrong boy going to plunge into matrimony the mother has spoiled the young rascal groaned the major inwardly with her cursed sentimentality and romantic rubbish my nephew marry a tragedy queen gracious mercy people will laugh at me so that i shall not dare show my head and he thought with an inexpressible pang that he must give up lord steynes dinner at richmond and must lose his rest and pass the night in an abominable tight mailcoach instead of taking pleasure as he had promised himself in some of the most agreeable and select society in england and he must not only give up this but all other engagements for some time to come who knows how long the business might detain him he quitted his breakfast table for the adjoining writingroom and there ruefully wrote off refusals to the marquis the earl the bishop and all his entertainers and he ordered his servant to take places in the mailcoach for that evening of course charging the sum which he disbursed for the seats to the account of the widow and the young scapegrace of whom he was guardian chapter ii a pedigree and other family matters illustration early in the regency of george the magnificent there lived in a small town in the west of england called clavering a gentleman whose name was pendennis there were those alive who remembered having seen his name painted on a board which was surmounted by a gilt pestle and mortar over the door of a very humble little shop in the city of bath where mr pendennis exercised the profession of apothecary and surgeon and where he not only attended gentlemen in their sickrooms and ladies at the most interesting periods of their lives but would condescend to sell a brownpaper plaster to a farmers wife across the counteror to vend toothbrushes hairpowder and london perfumery for these facts a few folks at clavering could vouch where peoples memories were more tenacious perhaps than they are in a great bustling metropolis and yet that little apothecary who sold a stray customer a pennyworth of salts or a more fragrant cake of windsor soap was a gentleman of good education and of as old a family as any in the whole county of somerset he had a cornish pedigree which carried the pendennises up to the time of the druidsand who knows how much farther back they had intermarried with the normans at a very late period of their family existence and they were related to all the great families of wales and britanny pendennis had had a piece of university education too and might have pursued that career with great honor but that in his second year at cambridge his father died insolvent and poor pen was obliged to betake himself to the pestle and apron he always detested the trade and it was only necessity and the offer of his mothers brother a london apothecary of low family into which pendenniss father had demeaned himself by marrying that forced john pendennis into so odious a calling he quickly after his apprenticeship parted from the coarseminded practitioner his relative and set up for himself at bath with his modest medical ensign he had for some time a hard struggle with poverty and it was all he could do to keep the shop and its gilt ornaments in decent repair and his bedridden mother in comfort but lady ribstone happening to be passing to the rooms with an intoxicated irish chair man who bumped her ladyship up against pens very doorpost and drove his chairpole through the handsomest pinkbottle in the surgeons window alighted screaming from her vehicle and was accommodated with a chair in mr pendenniss shop where she was brought round with cinnamon and salvolatile mr pendenniss manners were so uncommonly gentlemanlike and soothing that her ladyship the wife of sir pepin ribstone of codlingbury in the county of somerset bart appointed her preserver as she called him apothecary to her person and family which was very large master ribstone coming home for the christmas holidays from eton overate himself and had a fever in which mr pendennis treated him with the greatest skill and tenderness in a word he got the good graces of the codlingbury family and from that day began to prosper the good company of bath patronized him and among the ladies especially he was beloved and admired first his humble little shop became a smart one then he discarded the selling of toothbrushes and perfumery as unworthy of a gentleman of an ancient lineage then he shut up the shop altogether and only had a little surgery attended by a genteel young man then he had a gig with a man to drive him and before her exit from this world his poor old mother had the happiness of seeing from her bedroom window to which her chair was rolled her beloved john step into a close carriage of his own a onehorse carriage it is true but with the arms of the family of pendennis handsomely emblazoned on the panels what would arthur say now she asked speaking of a younger son of herswho never so much as once came to see my dearest johnny through all the time of his poverty and struggles captain pendennis is with his regiment in india mother mr pendennis remarked and if you please i wish you would not call me johnny before the young manbefore mr parkins presently the day came when she ceased to call her son by the name of johnny or by any other title of endearment or affection and his house was very lonely without that kind though querulous voice he had his nightbell altered and placed in the room in which the good old lady had grumbled for many a long year and he slept in the great large bed there he was upward of forty years old when these events befell before the war was over before george the magnificent came to the throne before this history indeed but what is a gentleman without his pedigree pendennis by this time had his handsomely framed and glazed and hanging up in his drawingroom between the pictures of codlingbury house in somersetshire and st bonifaces college cambridge where he had passed the brief and happy days of his early manhood as for the pedigree he had taken it out of a trunk as sternes officer called for his sword now that he was a gentleman and could show it about the time of mrs pendenniss demise another of her sons patients likewise died at bath that virtuous woman old lady pontypool daughter of reginald twelfth earl of bareacres and by consequence great grand aunt to the present earl and widow of john second lord pontypool and likewise of the reverend jonas wales of the armageddon chapel clifton for the last five years of her life her ladyship had been attended by miss helen thistlewood a very distant relative of the noble house of bareacres before mentioned and daughter of lieutenant r thistlewood r n killed at the battle of copenhagen under lady pontypools roof miss thistlewood found a comfortable shelter as far as boarding and lodging went but suffered under such an infernal tyranny as only women can inflict on or bear from one another the doctor who paid his visits to my lady pontypool at least twice a day could not but remark the angelical sweetness and kindness with which the young lady bore her elderly relatives insults and it was as they were going in the fourth mourning coach to attend her ladyships venerated remains to bath abbey where they now repose that he looked at her sweet pale face and resolved upon putting a certain question to her the very nature of which made his pulse beat ninety at least he was older than she by more than twenty years and at no time the most ardent of men perhaps he had had a love affair in early life which he had to strangleperhaps all early love affairs ought to be strangled or drowned like so many blind kittens well at threeandforty he was a collected quiet little gentleman in black stockings with a bald head and a few days after the ceremony he called to see her and as he felt her pulse he kept hold of her hand in his and asked her where she was going to live now that the pontypool family had come down upon the property which was being nailed into boxes and packed into hampers and swaddled up with haybands and buried in straw and locked under three keys in greenbaize platechests and carted away under the eyes of poor miss helenhe asked her where she was going to live finally her eyes filled with tears and she said she did not know she had a little money the old lady had left her a thousand pounds indeed and she would go into a boardinghouse or into a school in fine she did not know where then pendennis looking into her pale face and keeping hold of her cold little hand asked her if she would come and live with him he was old compared toto so blooming a young lady as miss thistlewood pendennis was of the grave old complimentary school of gentlemen and apothecaries but he was of good birth and he flattered himself of good principles and temper his prospects were good and daily mending he was alone in the world and had need of a kind and constant companion whom it would be the study of his life to make happy in a word he recited to her a little speech which he had composed that morning in bed and rehearsed and perfected in his carriage as he was coming to wait upon the young lady illustration perhaps if he had had an early lovepassage she too had one day hoped for a different lot than to be wedded to a little gentleman who rapped his teeth and smiled artificially who was laboriously polite to the butler as he slid up stairs into the drawingroom and profusely civil to the ladysmaid who waited at the bedroom door for whom her old patroness used to ring as for a servant and who came with even more eagerness who got up stories as he sent in draughts for his patients amusement and his own profit perhaps she would have chosen a different manbut she knew on the other hand how worthy pendennis was how prudent how honorable how good he had been to his mother and constant in his care of her and the upshot of this interview was that she blushing very much made pendennis an extremely low courtesy and asked leave toto consider his very kind proposal they were married in the dull bath season which was the height of the season in london and pendennis having previously through a professional friend mrcs secured lodgings in hollesstreet cavendish square took his wife thither in a chaise and pair conducted her to the theaters the parks and the chapel royal showed her the folks going to a drawingroom and in a word gave her all the pleasures of the town he likewise left cards upon lord pontypool upon the right honorable the earl of bareacres and upon sir pepin and lady ribstone his earliest and kindest patrons bareacres took no notice of the cards pontypool called admired mrs pendennis and said lady pontypool would come and see her which her ladyship did per proxy of john her footman who brought her card and an invitation to a concert five weeks off pendennis was back in his little onehorse carriage dispensing draughts and pills at that time but the ribstones asked him and mrs pendennis to an entertainment of which mr pendennis bragged to the last day of his life the secret ambition of mr pendennis had always been to be a gentleman it takes much time and careful saving for a provincial doctor whose gains are not very large to lay by enough money wherewith to purchase a house and land but besides our friends own frugality and prudence fortune aided him considerably in his endeavor and brought him to the point which he so panted to attain he laid out some money very advantageously in the purchase of a house and small estate close upon the village of clavering before mentioned words can not describe nor did he himself ever care to confess to any one his pride when he found himself a real landed proprietor and could walk over acres of which he was the master a lucky purchase which he had made of shares in a coppermine added very considerably to his wealth and he realized with great prudence while this mine was still at its full vogue finally he sold his business at bath to mr parkins for a handsome sum of ready money and for an annuity to be paid to him during a certain number of years after he had forever retired from the handling of the mortar and pestle arthur pendennis his son was eight years old at the time of this event so that it is no wonder that the latter who left bath and the surgery so young should forget the existence of such a place almost entirely and that his fathers hands had ever been dirtied by the compounding of odious pills or the preparation of filthy plasters the old man never spoke about the shop himself never alluded to it called in the medical practitioner of clavering to attend his family when occasion arrived sunk the black breeches and stockings altogether attended market and sessions and wore a bottlegreen coat and brass buttons with drab gaiters just as if he had been an english gentleman all his life he used to stand at his lodgegate and see the coaches come in and bow gravely to the guards and coachmen as they touched their hats and drove by it was he who founded the clavering book club and set up the samaritan soup and blanket society it was he who brought the mail which used to run through cacklefield before away from that village and through clavering at church he was equally active as a vestryman and a worshiper at market every thursday he went from pen to stall looked at samples of oats and munched corn felt beasts punched geese in the breast and weighed them with a knowing air and did business with the farmers at the clavering arms as well as the oldest frequenter of that house of call it was now his shame as it formerly was his pride to be called doctor and those who wished to please him always gave him the title of squire heaven knows where they came from but a whole range of pendennis portraits presently hung round the doctors oak diningroom lelys and vandykes he vowed all the portraits to be and when questioned as to the history of the originals would vaguely say they were ancestors of his you could see by his wifes looks that she disbelieved in these genealogical legends for she generally endeavored to turn the conversation when he commenced them but his little boy believed them to their fullest extent and roger pendennis of agincourt arthur pendennis of crecy general pendennis of blenheim and oudenarde were as real and actual beings for this young gentleman aswhom shall we sayas robinson crusoe or peter wilkins or the seven champions of christendom whose histories were in his library pendenniss fortune which at the best was not above eight hundred pounds a year did not with the best economy and management permit of his living with the great folks of the county but he had a decent comfortable society of the secondbest sort if they were not the roses they lived near the roses as it were and had a good deal of the odor of genteel life they had out their plate and dined each other round in the moonlight nights twice a year coming a dozen miles to these festivals and besides the county the pendennises had the society of the town of clavering as much as nay more than they liked for mrs pybus was always poking about helens conservatories and intercepting the operation of her souptickets and coalclubs captain glanders h p th dragoon guards was forever swaggering about the squires stables and gardens and endeavoring to enlist him in his quarrels with the vicar with the postmaster with the reverend f wapshot of clavering grammar school for overflogging his son anglesea glanderswith all the village in fine and pendennis and his wife often blessed themselves that their house of fairoaks was nearly a mile out of clavering or their premises would never have been free from the prying eyes and prattle of one or other of the male and female inhabitants there fairoaks lawn comes down to the little river brawl and on the other side were the plantations and woods as much as were left of them of clavering park sir francis clavering bart the park was let out in pasture and fed down by sheep and cattle when the pendennises came first to live at fairoaks shutters were up in the house a splendid freestone palace with great stairs statues and porticos whereof you may see a picture in the beauties of england and wales sir richard clavering sir franciss grandfather had commenced the ruin of the family by the building of this palace his successor had achieved the ruin by living in it the present sir francis was abroad somewhere nor could any body be found rich enough to rent that enormous mansion through the deserted rooms moldy clanking halls and dismal galleries of which arthur pendennis many a time walked trembling when he was a boy at sunset from the lawn of fairoaks there was a pretty sight it and the opposite park of clavering were in the habit of putting on a rich golden tinge which became them both wonderfully the upper windows of the great house flamed so as to make your eyes wink the little river ran off noisily westward and was lost in a somber wood behind which the towers of the old abbey church of clavering whereby that town is called clavering st marys to the present day rose up in purple splendor little arthurs figure and his mothers cast long blue shadows over the grass and he would repeat in a low voice for a scene of great natural beauty always moved the boy who inherited this sensibility from his mother certain lines beginning these are thy glorious works parent of good almighty thine this universal frame greatly to mrs pendenniss delight such walks and conversation generally ended in a profusion of filial and maternal embraces for to love and to pray were the main occupations of this dear womans life and i have often heard pendennis say in his wild way that he felt that he was sure of going to heaven for his mother never could be happy there without him as for john pendennis as the father of the family and that sort of thing every body had the greatest respect for him and his orders were obeyed like those of the medes and persians his hat was as well brushed perhaps as that of any man in this empire his meals were served at the same minute every day and wo to those who came late as little pen a disorderly little rascal sometimes did prayers were recited his letters were read his business dispatched his stables and garden inspected his henhouses and kennel his barn and pigstye visited always at regular hours after dinner he always had a nap with the globe newspaper on his knee and his yellow bandanna handkerchief on his face major pendennis sent the yellow handkerchiefs from india and his brother had helped in the purchase of his majority so that they were good friends now and so as his dinner took place at six oclock to a minute and the sunset business alluded to may be supposed to have occurred at about halfpast seven it is probable that he did not much care for the view in front of his lawn windows or take any share in the poetry and caresses which were taking place there they seldom occurred in his presence however frisky they were before mother and child were hushed and quiet when mr pendennis walked into the drawing room his newspaper under his arm and here while little pen buried in a great chair read all the books of which he could lay hold the squire perused his own articles in the gardeners gazette or took a solemn hand at picquet with mrs pendennis or an occasional friend from the village pendennis usually took care that at least one of his grand dinners should take place when his brother the major who on the return of his regiment from india and new south wales had sold out and gone upon halfpay came to pay his biennial visit to fairoaks my brother major pendennis was a constant theme of the retired doctors conversation all the family delighted in my brother the major he was the link which bound them to the great world of london and the fashion he always brought down the last news of the nobility and was in the constant habit of dining with lords and great folks he spoke of such with soldierlike respect and decorum he would say my lord bareacres has been good enough to invite me to bareacres for the pheasant shooting or my lord steyne is so kind as to wish for my presence at stillbrook for the easter holidays and you may be sure the whereabouts of my brother the major was carefully made known by worthy mr pendennis to his friends at the clavering readingroom at justicemeetings or at the county town their carriages would come from ten miles round to call upon major pendennis in his visits to fairoaks the fame of his fashion as a man about town was established throughout the county there was a talk of his marrying miss hunkle of lilybank old hunkle the attorneys daughter with at least fifteen hundred a year to her fortune but my brother the major refused this negotiation advantageous as it might seem to most persons as a bachelor he said nobody cares how poor i am i have the happiness to live with people who are so highly placed in the world that a few hundreds or thousands a year more or less can make no difference in the estimation in which they are pleased to hold me miss hunkle though a most respectable lady is not in possession of either the birth or the manners which would entitle her to be received into the sphere in which i have the honor to move i shall live and die an old bachelor john and your worthy friend miss hunkle i have no doubt will find some more worthy object of her affection than a wornout old soldier on halfpay time showed the correctness of the surmise of the old man of the world miss hunkle married a young french nobleman and is now at this moment living at lilybank under the title of baroness de carambole having been separated from her wild young scapegrace of a baron very shortly after their union the major was a great favorite with almost all the little establishment of fairoaks he was as goodnatured as he was well bred and had a sincere liking and regard for his sisterinlaw whom he pronounced and with perfect truth to be as fine a lady as any in england and an honor to the family indeed mrs pendenniss tranquil beauty her natural sweetness and kindness and that simplicity and dignity which a perfect purity and innocence are sure to bestow upon a handsome woman rendered her quite worthy of her brothers praises i think it is not national prejudice which makes me believe that a highbred english lady is the most complete of all heavens subjects in this world in whom else do you see so much grace and so much virtue so much faith and so much tenderness with such a perfect refinement and chastity and by highbred ladies i dont mean duchesses and countesses be they ever so high in station they can be but ladies and no more but almost every man who lives in the world has the happiness let us hope of counting a few such persons among his circle of acquaintancewomen in whose angelical natures there is something awful as well as beautiful to contemplate at whose feet the wildest and fiercest of us must fall down and humble ourselvesin admiration of that adorable purity which never seems to do or to think wrong arthur pendennis had the good fortune to have a mother endowed with those happy qualities during his childhood and youth the boy thought of her as little less than an angelas a supernatural being all wisdom love and beauty when her husband drove her into the county town or to the assize balls or concerts there he would step into the assembly with his wife on his arm and look the great folks in the face as much as to say look at that my lord can any of you show me a woman like that she enraged some country ladies with three times her money by a sort of desperate perfection which they found in her miss pybus said she was cold and haughty miss pierce that she was too proud for her station mrs wapshot as a doctor of divinitys lady would have the pas of her who was only the wife of a medical practitioner in the mean while this lady moved through the world quite regardless of all the comments that were made in her praise or disfavor she did not seem to know that she was admired or hated for being so perfect but carried on calmly through life saying her prayers loving her family helping her neighbors and doing her duty that even a woman should be faultless however is an arrangement not permitted by nature which assigns to us mental defects as it awards to us headaches illnesses or death without which the scheme of the world could not be carried onnay some of the best qualities of mankind could not be brought into exercise as pain produces or elicits fortitude and endurance difficulty perseverance poverty industry and ingenuity danger courage and what not so the very virtues on the other hand will generate some vices and in fine mrs pendennis had that vice which miss pybus and miss pierce discovered in her namely that of pride which did not vest itself so much in her own person as in that of her family she spoke about mr pendennis a worthy little gentleman enough but there are others as good as he with an awful reverence as if he had been the pope of rome on his throne and she a cardinal kneeling at his feet and giving him incense the major she held to be a sort of bayard among majors and as for her son arthur she worshiped that youth with an ardor which the young scapegrace accepted almost as coolly as the statue of the saint in saint peters receives the rapturous osculations which the faithful deliver on his toe this unfortunate superstition and idolworship of this good woman was the cause of a great deal of the misfortune which befell the young gentleman who is the hero of this history and deserves therefore to be mentioned at the outset of his story arthur pendenniss schoolfellows at the greyfriars school state that as a boy he was in no ways remarkable either as a dunce or as a scholar he did in fact just as much as was required of him and no more if he was distinguished for any thing it was for versewriting but was his enthusiasm ever so great it stopped when he had composed the number of lines demanded by the regulations unlike young swettenham for instance who with no more of poetry in his composition than mr wakley yet would bring up a hundred dreary hexameters to the master after a halfholiday or young fluxmore who not only did his own verses but all the fifth forms besides he never read to improve himself out of schoolhours but on the contrary devoured all the novels plays and poetry on which he could lay his hands he never was flogged but it was a wonder how he escaped the whippingpost when he had money he spent it royally in tarts for himself and his friends he has been known to disburse nine and sixpence out of ten shillings awarded to him in a single day when he had no funds he went on tick when he could get no credit he went without and was almost as happy he has been known to take a thrashing for a crony without saying a word but a blow ever so slight from a friend would make him roar to fighting he was averse from his earliest youth as indeed to physic the greek grammar or any other exertion and would engage in none of them except at the last extremity he seldom if ever told lies and never bullied little boys those masters or seniors who were kind to him he loved with boyish ardor and though the doctor when he did not know his horace or could not construe his greek play said that that boy pendennis was a disgrace to the school a candidate for ruin in this world and perdition in the next a profligate who would most likely bring his venerable father to ruin and his mother to a dishonored grave and the likeyet as the doctor made use of these compliments to most of the boys in the place which has not turned out an unusual number of felons and pickpockets little pen at first uneasy and terrified by these charges became gradually accustomed to hear them and he has not in fact either murdered his parents or committed any act worthy of transportation or hanging up to the present day there were many of the upper boys among the cistercians with whom pendennis was educated who assumed all the privileges of men long before they quitted that seminary many of them for example smoked cigarsand some had already begun the practice of inebriation one had fought a duel with an ensign in a marching regiment in consequence of a row at the theateranother actually kept a buggy and horse at a livery stable in covent garden and might be seen driving any sunday in hyde park with a groom with squared arms and armorial buttons by his side many of the seniors were in love and showed each other in confidence poems addressed to or letters and locks of hair received from young ladiesbut pen a modest and timid youth rather envied these than imitated them as yet he had not got beyond the theory as yetthe practice of life was all to come and by the way ye tender mothers and sober fathers of christian families a prodigious thing that theory of life is as orally learned at a great public school why if you could hear those boys of fourteen who blush before mothers and sneak off in silence in the presence of their daughters talking among each otherit would be the womans turn to blush then before he was twelve years old and while his mother fancied him an angel of candor little pen had heard talk enough to make him quite awfully wise upon certain pointsand so madam has your pretty little rosycheeked son who is coming home from school for the ensuing christmas holidays i dont say that the boy is lost or that the innocence has left him which he had from heaven which is our home but that the shades of the prisonhouse are closing very fast over him and that we are helping as much as possible to corrupt him wellpen had just made his public appearance in a coat with a tail or caudavirilis and was looking most anxiously in his little studyglass to see if his whiskers were growing like those of more fortunate youths his companions and instead of the treble voice with which he used to speak and sing for his singing voice was a very sweet one and he used when little to be made to perform home sweet home my pretty page and a french song or two which his mother had taught him and other ballads for the delectation of the senior boys had suddenly plunged into a deep bass diversified by a squeak which when he was called upon to construe in school set the master and scholars laughinghe was about sixteen years old in a word when he was suddenly called away from his academic studies it was at the close of the forenoon school and pen had been unnoticed all the previous part of the morning till now when the doctor put him on to construe in a greek play he did not know a word of it though little timmins his formfellow was prompting him with all his might pen had made a sad blunder or twowhen the awful chief broke out upon him pendennis sir he said your idleness is incorrigible and your stupidity beyond example you are a disgrace to your school and to your family and i have no doubt will prove so in afterlife to your country if that vice sir which is described to us as the root of all evil be really what moralists have represented and i have no doubt of the correctness of their opinion for what a prodigious quantity of future crime and wickedness are you unhappy boy laying the seed miserable trifler a boy who construes greek de and instead of greek de but at sixteen years of age is guilty not merely of folly and ignorance and dullness inconceivable but of crime of deadly crime of filial ingratitude which i tremble to contemplate a boy sir who does not learn his greek play cheats the parent who spends money for his education a boy who cheats his parent is not very far from robbing or forging upon his neighbor a man who forges on his neighbor pays the penalty of his crime at the gallows and it is not such a one that i pity for he will be deservedly cut off but his maddened and heartbroken parents who are driven to a premature grave by his crimes or if they live drag on a wretched and dishonored old age go on sir and i warn you that the very next mistake that you make shall subject you to the punishment of the rod whos that laughing what illconditioned boy is there that dares to laugh shouted the doctor illustration indeed while the master was making this oration there was a general titter behind him in the schoolroom the orator had his back to the door of this ancient apartment which was open and a gentleman who was quite familiar with the place for both major arthur and mr john pendennis had been at the school was asking the fifth form boy who sate by the door for pendennis the lad grinning pointed to the culprit against whom the doctor was pouring out the thunders of his just wrathmajor pendennis could not help laughing he remembered having stood under that very pillar where pen the younger now stood and having been assaulted by the doctors predecessor years and years ago the intelligence was passed round that it was pendenniss uncle in an instant and a hundred young faces wondering and giggling between terror and laughter turned now to the new comer and then to the awful doctor the major asked the fifthform boy to carry his card up to the doctor which the lad did with an arch look major pendennis had written on the card i must take a p home his father is very ill as the doctor received the card and stopped his harangue with rather a scared look the laughter of the boys half constrained until then burst out in a general shout silence roared out the doctor stamping with his foot pen looked up and saw who was his deliverer the major beckoned to him gravely with one of his white gloves and tumbling down his books pen went across the doctor took out his watch it was two minutes to one we will take the juvenal at afternoon school he said nodding to the major and all the boys understanding the signal gathered up their books and poured out of the hall young pen saw by his uncles face that something had happened at home is there any thing the matter withmy mother he said he could hardly speak though for emotion and the tears which were ready to start no said the major but your fathers very ill go and pack your trunk directly i have got a postchaise at the gate pen went off quickly to his boardinghouse to do as his uncle bade him and the doctor now left alone in the schoolroom came out to shake hands with his old schoolfellow you would not have thought it was the same man as cinderella at a particular hour became from a blazing and magnificent princess quite an ordinary little maid in a gray petticoat so as the clock struck one all the thundering majesty and awful wrath of the schoolmaster disappeared there is nothing serious i hope said the doctor it is a pity to take the boy away unless there is he is a very good boy rather idle and unenergetic but he is a very honest gentlemanlike little fellow though i cant get him to construe as i wish wont you come in and have some luncheon my wife will be very happy to see you but major pendennis declined the luncheon he said his brother was very ill had had a fit the day before and it was a great question if they should see him alive theres no other son is there said the doctor the major answered no and theres a good eha good ehproperty i believe asked the other in an offhand way hmso so said the major whereupon this colloquy came to an end and arthur pendennis got into the postchaise with his uncle never to come back to school any more as the chaise drove through clavering the hostler standing whistling under the archway of the clavering arms winked the postillion ominously as much as to say all was over the gardeners wife came and opened the lodgegates and let the travelers through with a silent shake of the head all the blinds were down at fairoaksthe face of the old footman was as blank when he let them in arthurs face was white too with terror more than with grief whatever of warmth and love the deceased man might have had and he adored his wife and loved and admired his son with all his heart he had shut them up within himself nor had the boy been ever able to penetrate that frigid outward harrier but arthur had been his fathers pride and glory through life and his name the last which john pendennis had tried to articulate while he lay with his wifes hand clasping his own cold and clammy palm as the flickering spirit went out into the darkness of death and life and the world passed away from him the little girl whose face had peered for a moment under the blinds as the chaise came up opened the door from the stairs into the hall and taking arthurs hand silently as he stooped down to kiss her led him upstairs to his mother old john opened the drawingroom door for the major the room was darkened with the blinds down and surrounded by all the gloomy pictures of the pendennises he drank a glass of wine the bottle had been opened for the squire four days before his hat was brushed and laid on the hall table his newspapers and his letter bag with john pendennis esquire fairoaks engraved upon the brass plate were there in waiting the doctor and the lawyer from clavering who had seen the chaise pass through came up in a gig half an hour after the majors arrival and entered by the back door the former gave a detailed account of the seizure and demise of mr pendennis enlarged on his virtues and the estimation in which the neighborhood held him on what a loss he would be to the magistrates bench the county hospital c mrs pendennis bore up wonderfully he said especially since master arthurs arrival the lawyer staid and dined with major pendennis and they talked business all the evening the major was his brothers executor and joint guardian to the boy with mrs pendennis every thing was left unreservedly to her except in case of a second marriagean occasion which might offer itself in the case of so young and handsome a woman mr tatham gallantly said when different provisions were enacted by the deceased the major would of course take entire superintendence of every thing under this most impressive and melancholy occasion aware of this authority old john the footman when he brought major pendennis the candle to go to bed followed afterward with the platebasket and the next morning brought him the key of the hall clockthe squire always used to wind it up of a thursday john said mrs pendenniss maid brought him messages from her mistress she confirmed the doctors report of the comfort which master arthurs arrival had caused to his mother what passed between that lady and the boy is not of import a vail should be thrown over those sacred emotions of love and grief the maternal passion is a sacred mystery to me what one sees symbolized in the roman churches in the image of the virgin mother with a bosom bleeding with love i think one may witness and admire the almighty bounty for every day i saw a jewish lady only yesterday with a child at her knee and from whose face toward the child there shone a sweetness so angelical that it seemed to form a sort of glory round both i protest i could have knelt before her too and adored in her the divine beneficence in endowing us with the maternal storge which began with our race and sanctifies the history of mankind so it was with this in a word that mrs pendennis comforted herself on the death of her husband whom however she always reverenced as the best the most upright wise highminded accomplished and awful of men if the women did not make idols of us and if they saw us as we see each other would life be bearable or could society go on let a man pray that none of his womankind should form a just estimation of him if your wife knew you as you are neighbor she would not grieve much about being your widow and would let your gravelamp go out very soon or perhaps not even take the trouble to light it whereas helen pendennis put up the handsomest of memorials to her husband and constantly renewed it with the most precious oil as for arthur pendennis after that awful shock which the sight of his dead father must have produced on him and the pity and feeling which such an event no doubt occasioned i am not sure that in the very moment of the grief and as he embraced his mother and tenderly consoled her and promised to love her forever there was not springing up in his breast a feeling of secret triumph and exultation he was the chief now and lord he was pendennis and all round about him were his servants and handmaids youll never send me away little laura said tripping by him and holding his hand you wont send me to school will you arthur arthur kissed her and patted her head no she shouldnt go to school and as for going himself that was quite out of the question he had determined that that part of his life should not be renewed in the midst of the general grief and the corpse still lying above he had leisure to conclude that he would have it all holidays for the future that he wouldnt get up till he liked or stand the bullying of the doctor any more and had made a hundred of such day dreams and resolves for the future how ones thoughts will travel and how quickly our wishes beget them when he with laura in his hand went into the kitchen on his way to the dogkennel the fowlhouses and his other favorite haunts all the servants there assembled in great silence with their friends and the laboring men and their wives and sally potter who went with the postbag to clavering and the bakers man from claveringall there assembled and drinking beer on the melancholy occasionrose up on his entrance and bowed or courtesied to him they never used to do so last holidays he felt at once and with indescribable pleasure the cook cried out o lord and whispered how master arthur do grow thomas the groom in the act of drinking put down the jug alarmed before his master thomass master felt the honor keenly he went through and looked at the pointers as flora put her nose up to his waistcoat and ponto yelling with pleasure hurtled at his chain pen patronized the dogs and said poo ponto poo flora in his most condescending manner and then he went and looked at lauras hens and at the pigs and at the orchard and at the dairy perhaps he blushed to think that it was only last holidays he had in a manner robbed the great appletree and been scolded by the dairymaid for taking cream they buried john pendennis esquire formerly an eminent medical practitioner at bath and subsequently an able magistrate a benevolent landlord and a benefactor to many charities and public institutions in this neighborhood and county with one of the most handsome funerals that had been seen since sir roger clavering was buried here the clerk said in the abbey church of clavering st marys a fair marble slab from which the above inscription is copied was erected over the fairoaks pew in the church on it you may see the pendennis coat of arms and crest an eagle looking toward the sun with the motto nec tenui penna to the present day doctor portman alluded to the deceased most handsomely and affectingly as our dear departed friend in his sermon next sunday and arthur pendennis reigned in his stead illustration chapter iii in which pendennis appears as a very young man indeed illustration arthur was about sixteen years old we have said when he began to reign in person for i see that the artist who is to illustrate this book and who makes sad work of the likeness will never be able to take my friend off he had what his friends would call a dumpy but his mamma styled a neat little figure his hair was of a healthy brown color which looks like gold in the sunshine his face was round rosy freckled and goodhumored his whiskers when those facial ornaments for which he sighed so ardently were awarded to him by nature were decidedly of a reddish hue in fact without being a beauty he had such a frank goodnatured kind face and laughed so merrily at you out of his honest blue eyes that no wonder mrs pendennis thought him the pride of the whole county between the ages of sixteen and eighteen he rose from five feet six to five feet eight inches in height at which altitude he paused but his mother wondered at it he was three inches taller than his father was it possible that any man could grow to be three inches taller than mr pendennis you may be certain he never went back to school the discipline of the establishment did not suit him and he liked being at home much better the question of his return was debated and his uncle was for his going back the doctor wrote his opinion that it was most important for arthurs success in afterlife that he should know a greek play thoroughly but pen adroitly managed to hint to his mother what a dangerous place greyfriars was and what sad wild fellows some of the chaps there were and the timid soul taking alarm at once acceded to his desire to stay at home then pens uncle offered to use his influence with his royal highness the commanderinchief who was pleased to be very kind to him and proposed to get pen a commission in the foot guards pens heart leaped at this he had been to hear the band at st jamess play on a sunday when he went out to his uncle he had seen tom ricketts of the fourth form who used to wear a jacket and trowsers so ludicrously tight that the elder boys could not forbear using him in the quality of a butt or cockshyhe had seen this very ricketts arrayed in crimson and gold with an immense bearskin cap on his head staggering under the colors of the regiment tom had recognized him and gave him a patronizing nod tom a little wretch whom he had cut over the back with a hockeystick last quarterand there he was in the center of the square rallying round the flag of his country surrounded by bayonets crossbelts and scarlet the band blowing trumpets and banging cymbalstalking familiarly to immense warriors with tufts to their chins and waterloo medals what would not pen have given to wear such epaulettes and enter such a service but helen pendennis when this point was proposed to her by her son put on a face full of terror and alarm she said she did not quarrel with others who thought differently but that in her opinion a christian had no right to make the army a profession mr pendennis never never would have permitted his son to be a soldier finally she should be very unhappy if he thought of it now pen would have as soon cut off his nose and ears as deliberately and of aforethought malice made his mother unhappy and as he was of such a generous disposition that he would give away any thing to any one he instantly made a present of his visionary red coat and epaulettes and his ardor for military glory to his mother she thought him the noblest creature in the world but major pendennis when the offer of the commission was acknowledged and refused wrote back a curt and somewhat angry letter to the widow and thought his nephew was rather a spooney he was contented however when he saw the boys performances out hunting at christmas when the major came down as usual to fairoaks pen had a very good mare and rode her with uncommon pluck and grace he took his fences with great coolness and yet with judgment and without bravado he wrote to the chaps at school about his topboots and his feats across country he began to think seriously of a scarlet coat and his mother must own that she thought it would become him remarkably well though of course she passed hours of anguish during his absence and daily expected to see him brought home on a shutter with these amusements in rather too great plenty it must not be assumed that pen neglected his studies altogether he had a natural taste for reading every possible kind of book which did not fall into his schoolcourse it was only when they forced his head into the waters of knowledge that he refused to drink he devoured all the books at home from inchbalds theater to whites farriery he ransacked the neighboring bookcases he found at clavering an old cargo of french novels which he read with all his might and he would sit for hours perched upon the topmost bar of doctor portmans library steps with a folio on his knees whether it were hackluyts travels hobbess leviathan augustini opera or chaucers poems he and the vicar were very good friends and from his reverence pen learned that honest taste for port wine which distinguished him through life and as for that dear good woman mrs portman who was not in the least jealous though her doctor avowed himself in love with mrs pendennis whom he pronounced to be by far the finest lady in the countyall her grief was as she looked up fondly at pen perched on the bookladder that her daughter minny was too old for himas indeed she was miss mira portman being at that period only two years younger than pens mother and weighing as much as pen and mrs pendennis together are these details insipid look back good friend at your own youth and ask how was that i like to think of a wellnurtured boy brave and gentle warmhearted and loving and looking the world in the face with kind honest eyes what bright colors it wore then and how you enjoyed it a man has not many years of such time he does not know them while they are with him it is only when they are passed long away that he remembers how dear and happy they were in order to keep mr pen from indulging in that idleness of which his friend the doctor of the cistercians had prophesied such awful consequences mr smirke dr portmans curate was engaged at a liberal salary to walk or ride over from clavering and pass several hours daily with the young gentleman smirke was a man perfectly faultless at a teatable wore a curl on his fair forehead and tied his neckcloth with a melancholy grace he was a decent scholar and mathematician and taught pen as much as the lad was ever disposed to learn which was not much for pen had soon taken the measure of his tutor who when he came riding into the courtyard at fairoaks on his pony turned out his toes so absurdly and left such a gap between his knees and the saddle that it was impossible for any lad endowed with a sense of humor to respect such an equestrian he nearly killed smirke with terror by putting him on his mare and taking him a ride over a common where the county foxhounds then hunted by that stanch old sportsman mr hardhead of dumplingbeare happened to meet mr smirke on pens mare rebecca she was named after pens favorite heroine the daughter of isaac of york astounded the hounds as much as he disgusted the huntsman laming one of the former by persisting in riding among the pack and receiving a speech from the latter more remarkable for energy of language than any oration he had ever heard since he left the bargemen on the banks of isis smirke confided to his pupil his poems both latin and english and presented to mrs pendennis a volume of the latter printed at clapham his native place the two read the ancient poets together and rattled through them at a pleasant rate very different from that steady grubbing pace with which the cistercians used to go over the classic ground scenting out each word as they went and digging up every root in the way pen never liked to halt but made his tutor construe when he was at fault and thus galloped through the iliad and the odyssey the tragic playwriters and the charming wicked aristophanes whom he vowed to be the greatest poet of all but he went at such a pace that though he certainly galloped through a considerable extent of the ancient country he clean forgot it in afterlife and had only such a vague remembrance of his early classic course as a man has in the house of commons let us say who still keeps up two or three quotations or a reviewer who just for decencys sake hints at a little greek our people are the most prosaic in the world but the most faithful and with curious reverence we keep up and transmit from generation to generation the superstition of what we call the education of a gentleman besides the ancient poets you may be sure pen read the english with great gusto smirke sighed and shook his head sadly both about byron and moore but pen was a sworn fireworshiper and a corsair he had them by heart and used to take little laura into the window and sayzuleika i am not thy brother in tones so tragic that they caused the solemn little maid to open her great eyes still wider she sat until the proper hour for retirement sewing at mrs pendenniss knee and listening to pen reading out to her of nights without comprehending one word of what he read he read shakspeare to his mother which she said she liked but didnt and byron and pope and his favorite lalla rookh which pleased her indifferently but as for bishop heber and mrs hemans above all this lady used to melt right away and be absorbed into her pockethandkerchief when pen read those authors to her in his kind boyish voice the christian year was a book which appeared about that time the son and the mother whispered it to each other with awe faint very faint and seldom in afterlife pendennis heard that solemn church music but he always loved the remembrance of it and of the times when it struck on his heart and he walked over the fields full of hope and void of doubt as the church bells rang on sunday morning it was at this period of his existence that pen broke out in the poets corner of the county chronicle with some verses with which he was perfectly well satisfied his are the verses signed nep addressed to a tear on the anniversary of the battle of waterloo to madame caradori singing at the assize meetings on saint bartholomews day a tremendous denunciation of popery and a solemn warning to the people of england to rally against emancipating the roman catholics c call which masterpieces mrs pendennis no doubt keeps to this day along with his first socks the first cutting of his hair his bottle and other interesting relics of his infancy he used to gallop rebecca over the neighboring dumpling downs or into the county town which if you please we shall call chatteries spouting his own poems and filled with quite a byronic afflatus as he thought his genius at this time was of a decidedly gloomy cast he brought his mother a tragedy in which though he killed sixteen people before the second act it made her laugh so that he thrust his masterpiece into the fire in a pet he projected an epic poem in blank verse cortez or the conqueror of mexico and the incas daughter he wrote part of seneca or the fatal bath and ariadne in naxos classical pieces with choruses and strophes and antistrophes which sadly puzzled poor mrs pendennis and began a history of the jesuits in which he lashed that order with tremendous severity and warned his protestant fellowcountrymen of their machinations his loyalty did his mothers heart good to witness he was a stanch unflinching churchandking man in those days and at the election when sir giles beanfield stood on the blue interest against lord trehawk lord eyries son a whig and a friend of popery arthur pendennis with an immense bow for himself which his mother made and with a blue ribbon for rebecca rode alongside of the reverend doctor portman on his gray mare dowdy and at the head of the clavering voters whom the doctor brought up to plump for the protestant champion on that day pen made his first speech at the blue hotel and also it appears for the first time in his life took a little more wine than was good for him mercy what a scene it was at fairoaks when he rode back at ever so much oclock at night what moving about of lanterns in the courtyard and stables though the moon was shining out what a gathering of servants as pen came home clattering over the bridge and up the stableyard with halfascore of the clavering voters yelling after him the blue song of the election he wanted them all to come in and have some winesome very good madeirasome capital madeirajohn go and get some madeiraand there is no knowing what the farmers would have done had not madam pendennis made her appearance in a white wrapper with a candle and scared those zealous blues so by the sight of her pale handsome face that they touched their hats and rode off besides these amusements and occupations in which mr pen indulged there was one which forms the main business and pleasure of youth if the poets tell us aright whom pen was always studying and this young fellows heart was so ardent and his imagination so eager that it is not to be expected he should long escape the passion to which we allude and which ladies you have rightly guessed to be that of love pen sighed for it first in secret and like the lovesick swain in ovid opened his breast and saidaura veni what generous youth is there that has not courted some such windy mistress in his time yes pen began to feel the necessity of a first loveof a consuming passionof an object on which he could concentrate all those vague floating fancies under which he sweetly sufferedof a young lady to whom he could really make verses and whom he could set up and adore in place of those unsubstantial ianthes and zuleikas to whom he addressed the outpourings of his gushing muse he read his favorite poems over and over again he called upon alma venus the delight of gods and men he translated anacreons odes and picked out passages suitable to his complaint from waller dryden prior and the like smirke and he were never weary in their interviews of discoursing about love the faithless tutor entertained him with sentimental conversations in place of lectures on algebra and greek for smirke was in love too who could help it being in daily intercourse with such a woman smirke was madly in love as far as such a mild flame as mr smirkes may be called madness with mrs pendennis that honest lady sitting down below stairs teaching little laura to play the piano or devising flannel petticoats for the poor round about her or otherwise busied with the calm routine of her modest and spotless christian life was little aware what storms were brewing in two bosoms upstairs in the studyin pens as he sat in his shooting jacket with his elbows on the green studytable and his hands clutching his curly brown hair homer under his noseand in worthy mr smirkes with whom he was reading here they would talk about helen and andromache andromaches like my mother pen used to avouch but i say smirke by jove id cut off my nose to see helen and he would spout certain favorite lines which the reader will find in their proper place in the third book he drew portraits of herthey are extant stillwith straight noses and enormous eyes and arthur pendennis delineavit et pinxit gallantly written underneath as for mr smirke he naturally preferred andromache and in consequence he was uncommonly kind to pen he gave him his elzevir horace of which the boy was fond and his little greek testament which his own mamma at clapham had purchased and presented to him he bought him a silver pencil case and in the matter of learning let him do just as much or as little as ever he pleased he always seemed to be on the point of unbosoming himself to pen nay he confessed to the latter that he had aan attachment an ardently cherished attachment about which pendennis longed to hear and said tell us old chap is she handsome has she got blue eyes or black but doctor portmans curate heaving a gentle sigh cast up his eyes to the ceiling and begged pen faintly to change the conversation poor smirke he invited pen to dine at his lodgings over madame fribsbys the milliners in clavering and once when it was raining and mrs pendennis who had driven in her ponychaise into clavering with respect to some arrangements about leaving off mourning probably was prevailed upon to enter the curates apartments he sent out for poundcakes instantly the sofa on which she sate became sacred to him from that day and he kept flowers in the glass which she drank from ever after as mrs pendennis was never tired of hearing the praises of her son we may be certain that this rogue of a tutor neglected no opportunity of conversing with her upon that subject it might be a little tedious to him to hear the stories about pens generosity about his bravery in fighting the big naughty boy about his fun and jokes about his prodigious skill in latin music riding cbut what price would he not pay to be in her company and the widow after these conversations thought mr smirke a very pleasing and wellinformed man as for her son she had not settled in her mind whether he was to be senior wrangler and archbishop of canterbury or double first class at oxford and lord chancellor that all england did not possess his peer was a fact about which there was in her mind no manner of question a simple person of inexpensive habits she began forthwith to save and perhaps to be a little parsimonious in favor of her boy there were no entertainments of course at fairoaks during the year of her weeds nor indeed did the doctors silver dishcovers of which he was so proud and which were flourished all over with the arms of the pendennises and surmounted with their crest come out of the platechests again for long long years the household was diminished and its expenses curtailed there was a very blank anchorite repast when pen dined from home and he himself headed the remonstrance from the kitchen regarding the deteriorated quality of the fairoaks beer she was becoming miserly for pen indeed who ever accused women of being just they are always sacrificing themselves or somebody for somebody elses sake there happened to be no young woman in the small circle of friends who were in the widows intimacy whom pendennis could by any possibility gratify by endowing her with the inestimable treasure of a heart which he was longing to give away some young fellows in this predicament bestow their young affections upon dolly the dairymaid or cast the eyes of tenderness upon molly the blacksmiths daughter pen thought a pendennis much too grand a personage to stoop so low he was too highminded for a vulgar intrigue and at the idea of an intrigue or a seduction had he ever entertained it his heart would have revolted as from the notion of any act of baseness or dishonor miss minny portman was too old too large and too fond of reading rollins ancient history the miss boardbacks admiral boardbacks daughters of st vincents or fourth of june house as it was called disgusted pen with the london airs which they brought into the country from gloucester place where they passed the season and looked down upon pen as a chit captain glanderss h p th dragoon guards three girls were in brownholland pinafores as yet with the ends of their hairplaits tied up in dirty pink ribbon not having acquired the art of dancing the youth avoided such chances as he might have had of meeting with the fair sex at the chatteries assemblies in fine he was not in love because there was nobody at hand to fell in love with and the young monkey used to ride out day after day in quest of dulcinea and peep into the ponychaises and gentlefolks carriages as they drove along the broad turnpike roads with a heart heating within him and a secret tremor and hope that she might be in that yellow postchaise coming swinging up the hill or one of those three girls in beaver bonnets in the back seat of the double gig which the fat old gentleman in black was driving at four miles an hour the postchaise contained a snuffy old dowager of seventy with a maid her contemporary the three girls in the beaver bonnets were no handsomer than the turnips that skirted the roadside do as he might and ride where he would the fairy princess that he was to rescue and win had not yet appeared to honest pen upon these points he did not discourse to his mother he had a world of his own what generous ardent imaginative soul has not a secret pleasureplace in which it disports let no clumsy prying or dull meddling of ours try to disturb it in our children actaeon was a brute for wanting to push in where diana was bathing leave him occasionally alone my good madame if you have a poet for a child even your admirable advice may be a bore sometimes you are faultless but it does not follow that every body in your family is to think exactly like yourself yonder little child may have thoughts too deep even for your great mind and fancies so coy and timid that they will not bare them selves when your ladyship sits by helen pendennis by the force of sheer love divined a great number of her sons secrets but she kept these things in her heart if we may so speak and did not speak of them besides she had made up her mind that he was to marry little laura who would be eighteen when pen was sixandtwenty and had finished his college career and had made his grand tour and was settled either in london astonishing all the metropolis by his learning and eloquence at the bar or better still in a sweet country parsonage surrounded with hollyhocks and roses close to a delightful romantic ivycovered church from the pulpit of which pen would utter the most beautiful sermons ever preached while these natural sentiments were waging war and trouble in honest pens bosom it chanced one day that he rode into chatteries for the purpose of carrying to the county chronicle a tremendous and thrilling poem for the next weeks paper and putting up his horse according to custom at the stables of the george hotel there he fell in with an old acquaintance a grand black tandem with scarlet wheels came rattling into the inn yard as pen stood there in converse with the hostler about rebecca and the voice of the driver called out hallo pendennis is that you in a loud patronizing manner pen had some difficulty in recognizing under the broadbrimmed hat and the vast great coats and neckcloths with which the new comer was habited the person and figure of his quondam schoolfellow mr foker a years absence had made no small difference in that gentleman a youth who had been deservedly whipped a few months previously and who spent his pocketmoney on tarts and hardbake now appeared before pen in one of those costumes to which the public consent that i take to be quite as influential in this respect as johnsons dictionary has awarded the title of swell he had a bulldog between his legs and in his scarlet shawl neckcloth was a pin representing another bulldog in gold he wore a fur waistcoat laced over with gold chains a green cutaway coat with basketbuttons and a white uppercoat ornamented with cheeseplate buttons on each of which was engraved some stirring incident of the road or the chase all which ornaments set off this young fellows figure to such advantage that you would hesitate to say which character in life he most resembled and whether he was a boxer en goguette or a coachman in his gala suit left that place for good pendennis mr foker said descending from his landau and giving pendennis a finger yes this year or more pen said beastly old hole mr foker remarked hate it hate the doctor hate towzer the second master hate every body there not a fit place for a gentleman not at all said pen with an air of the utmost consequence by gad sir i sometimes dream now that the doctors walking into me foker continued and pen smiled as he thought that he himself had likewise fearful dreams of this nature when i think of the diet there by gad sir i wonder how i stood it mangy mutton brutal beef pudding on thursdays and sundays and that fit to poison you just look at my leaderdid you ever see a prettier animal drove over from baymouth came the nine mile in twoandforty minutes not bad going sir are you stopping at baymouth foker pendennis asked im coaching there said the other with a nod what asked pen and in a tone of such wonder that foker burst out laughing and said he was blowed if he didnt think pen was such a flat as not to know what coaching meant im come down with a coach from oxford a tutor dont you see old boy hes coaching me and some other men for the little go me and spavin have the drag between us and i thought id just tool over and go to the play did you ever see rowkins do the hornpipe and mr foker began to perform some steps of that popular dance in the inn yard looking round for the sympathy of his groom and the stable men pen thought he would like to go to the play too and could ride home afterward as there was a moonlight so he accepted fokers invitation to dinner and the young men entered the inn together where mr foker stopped at the bar and called upon miss rincer the landladys fair daughter who presided there to give him a glass of his mixture pen and his family had been known at the george ever since they came into the country and mr pendenniss carriages and horses always put up there when he paid a visit to the county town the landlady dropped the heir of fairoaks a respectful courtesy and complimented him upon his growth and manly appearance and asked news of the family at fairoaks and of doctor portman and the clavering people to all of which questions the young gentleman answered with much affability but he spoke to mr and mrs rincer with that sort of good nature with which a young prince addresses his fathers subjects never dreaming that those bonnes gens were his equals in life mr fokers behavior was quite different he inquired for rincer and the cold in his nose told mrs rincer a riddle asked miss rincer when she would be ready to marry him and paid his compliments to miss brett the other young lady in the bar all in a minute of time and with a liveliness and facetiousness which set all these ladies in a giggle and he gave a cluck expressive of great satisfaction as he tossed off his mixture which miss rincer prepared and handed to him have a drop said he to pen its recommended to me by the faculty as a whatdoyoucallema stomatic old boy give the young one a glass r and score it up to yours truly poor pen took a glass and every body laughed at the face which he made as he put it downgin bitters and some other cordial was the compound with which mr foker was so delighted as to call it by the name of fokers own as pen choked sputtered and made faces the other took occasion to remark to mr rincer that the young fellow was green very green but that he would soon form him and then they proceeded to order dinnerwhich mr foker determined should consist of turtle and venison cautioning the landlady to be very particular about icing the wine then messrs foker and pen strolled down the highstreet togetherthe former having a cigar in his mouth which he had drawn out of a case almost as big as a portmanteau he went in to replenish it at mr lewiss and talked to that gentleman for a while sitting down on the counter he then looked in at the fruiterers to see the pretty girl there to whom he paid compliments similar to those before addressed to the bar at the george then they passed the county chronicle office for which pen had his packet ready in the shape of lines to thyrza but poor pen did not like to put the letter into the editors box while walking in company with such a fine gentleman as mr foker they met heavy dragoons of the regiment always quartered at chatteries and stopped and talked about the baymouth balls and what a pretty girl was miss brown and what a dem fine woman mrs jones was it was in vain that pen recalled to his own mind what a stupid ass foker used to be at schoolhow he could scarcely read how he was not cleanly in his person and notorious for his blunders and dullness mr foker was no more like a gentleman now than in his school days and yet pen felt a secret pride in strutting down highstreet with a young fellow who owned tandems talked to officers and ordered turtle and champagne for dinner he listened and with respect too to mr fokers accounts of what the men did at the university of which mr f was an ornament and encountered a long series of stories about boatracing bumping college grassplats and milkpunchand began to wish to go up himself to college to a place where there were such manly pleasures and enjoyments farmer gurnett who lives close by fairoaks riding by at this minute and touching his hat to pen the latter stopped him and sent a message to his mother to say that he had met with an old schoolfellow and should dine in chatteries the two young gentlemen continued their walk and were passing round the cathedral yard where they could hear the music of the afternoon service a music which always exceedingly impressed and affected pen but whither mr foker came for the purpose of inspecting the nursery maids who frequent the elms walk there and who are uncommonly pretty at chatteries and here they strolled until with a final burst of music the small congregation was played out old doctor portman was one of the few who came from the venerable gate spying pen he came and shook him by the hand and eyed with wonder pens friend from whose mouth and cigar clouds of fragrance issued which curled round the doctors honest face and shovel hat an old schoolfellow of mine mr foker said pen the doctor said hm and scowled at the cigar he did not mind a pipe in his study but the cigar was an abomination to the worthy gentleman i came up on bishops business the doctor said well ride home arthur if you like iim engaged to my friend here pen answered you had better come home with me said the doctor his mother knows hes out sir mr foker remarked dont she pendennis but that does not prove that he had not better come home with me the doctor growled and he walked off with great dignity old boy dont like the weed i suppose foker said ha whos hereheres the general and bingley the manager how do cos how do bingley how does my worthy and gallant young foker said the gentleman addressed as the general and who wore a shabby military cape with a mangy collar and a hat cocked very much over one eye trust you are very well my very dear sir said the other gentleman and that the theater royal will have the honor of your patronage tonight we perform the stranger in which your humble servant will cant stand you in tights and hessians bingley young mr foker said on which the general with the irish accent said but i think yell like miss fotheringay in mrs haller or me names not jack costigan pen looked at these individuals with the greatest interest he had never seen an actor before and he saw dr portmans red face looking over the doctors shoulder as he retreated from the cathedral yard evidently quite dissatisfied with the acquaintances into whose hands pen had fallen perhaps it would have been much better for him had he taken the parsons advice and company home but which of us knows his fate chapter iv mrs haller illustration having returned to the george mr foker and his guest sate down to a handsome repast in the coffeeroom where mr rincer brought in the first dish and bowed as gravely as if he was waiting upon the lordlieutenant of the county mr foker attacked the turtle and venison with as much gusto as he had shown the year before when he used to make feasts off gingerbeer and smuggled polonies pen could not but respect his connoisseurship as he pronounced the champagne to be condemned gooseberry and winked at the port with one eye the latter he declared to be of the right sort and told the waiters there was no way of humbugging him all these attendants he knew by their christian names and showed a great interest in their families and as the london coaches drove up which in those early days used to set off from the george mr foker flung the coffeeroom window open and called the guards and coachmen by their christian names too asking about their respective families and imitating with great liveliness and accuracy the tooting of the horns as jem the ostler whipped the horses cloths off and the carriages drove gayly away a bottle of sherry a bottle of sham a bottle of port and a shass caffy it aint so bad hay pen foker said and pronounced after all these delicacies and a quantity of nuts and fruit had been dispatched that it was time to toddle pen sprang up with very bright eyes and a flushed face and they moved off toward the theater where they paid their money to the wheezy old lady slumbering in the money takers box mrs dropsicum bingleys motherinlaw great in lady macbeth foker said to his companion foker knew her too they had almost their choice of places in the boxes of the theater which was no better filled than country theaters usually are in spite of the universal burst of attraction and galvanic thrills of delight advertised by bingley in the playbills a score or so of people dotted the pitbenches a few more kept a kicking and whistling in the galleries and a dozen others who came in with free admissions were in the boxes where our young gentlemen sate lieutenants rodgers and podgers and young cornet tidmus of the dragoons occupied a private box the performers acted to them and these gentlemen seemed to hold conversations with the players when not engaged in the dialogue and applauded them by name loudly bingley the manager who assumed all the chief tragic and comic parts except when he modestly retreated to make way for the london stars who came down occasionally to chatteries was great in the character of the stranger he was attired in the tight pantaloons and hessian boots which the stage legend has given to that injured man with a large cloak and beaver and a hearse feather in it drooping over his raddled old face and only partially concealing his great buckled brown wig he had the stagejewelry on too of which he selected the largest and most shiny rings for himself and allowed his little finger to quiver out of his cloak with a sham diamond ring covering the first joint of the finger and twiddling in the faces of the pit bingley made it a favor to the young men of his company to go on in light comedy parts with that ring they flattered him by asking its history the stage has its traditional jewels as the crown and all great families have this had belonged to george frederick cooke who had had it from mr quin who may have bought it for a shilling bingley fancied the world was fascinated with its glitter he was reading out of the stagebookthat wonderful stagebook which is not bound like any other book in the world but is rouged and tawdry like the hero or heroine who holds it and who holds it as people never do hold books and points with his finger to a passage and wags his head ominously at the audience and then lifts up eyes and finger to the ceiling professing to derive some intense consolation from the work between which and heaven there is a strong affinity any body who has ever seen one of our great light comedians x in a chintz dressinggown such as nobody ever wore and representing himself to the public as a young nobleman in his apartments and whiling away the time with light literature until his friend sir harry shall arrive or his father shall come down to breakfastany body i say who has seen the great x over a sham book has indeed had a great pleasure and an abiding matter for thought directly the stranger saw the young men he acted at them eying them solemnly over his gilt volume as he lay on the stagebank showing his hand his ring and his hessians he calculated the effect that every one of these ornaments would produce upon his victims he was determined to fascinate them for he knew they had paid their money and he saw their families coming in from the country and filling the cane chairs in his boxes as he lay on the bank reading his servant francis made remarks upon his master again reading said francis thus it is from morn to night to him nature has no beautylife no charm for three years i have never seen him smile the gloom of bingleys face was fearful to witness during these comments of the faithful domestic nothing diverts him o if he would but attach himself to any living thing were it an animalfor something man must love enter tobias goll from the hut he cries o how refreshing after seven long weeks to feel these warm sunbeams once again thanks bounteous heaven for the joy i taste he presses his cap between his hands looks up and prays the stranger eyes him attentively francis to the stranger this old mans share of earthly happiness can be but little yet mark how grateful he is for his portion of it bingley because though old he is but a child in the leadingstring of hope he looks steadily at foker who however continues to suck the top of his stick in an unconcerned manner francis hope is the nurse of life bingley and her cradleis the grave the stranger uttered this with the moan of a bassoon in agony and fixed his eyes on pendennis so steadily that the poor lad was quite put out of countenance he thought the whole house must be looking at him and cast his eyes down as soon as ever he raised them bingleys were at him again all through the scene the manager played at him when he was about to do a good action and sent off francis with his book so that that domestic should not witness the deed of benevolence which he meditated bingley marked the page carefully so that he might continue the perusal of the volume off the stage if he liked but all was done in the direct face of pendennis whom the manager was bent upon subjugating how relieved the lad was when the scene ended and foker tapping with his cane cried out bravo bingley give him a hand pendennis you know every chap likes a hand mr foker said and the goodnatured young gentleman and pendennis laughing and the dragoons in the opposite box began clapping hands to the best of their power a chamber in wintersen castle closed over tobiass hut and the stranger and his boots and servants appeared bustling about with chairs and tablesthats hicks and miss thackthwaite whispered foker pretty girl aint she pendennis but stophurraybravo heres the fotheringay the pit thrilled and thumped its umbrellas a volley of applause was fired from the gallery the dragoon officers and foker clapped their hands furiously you would have thought the house was full so loud were their plaudits the red face and ragged whiskers of mr costigan were seen peering from the sidescene pens eyes opened wide and bright as mrs haller entered with a downcast look then rallying at the sound of the applause swept the house with a grateful glance and folding her hands across her breast sank down in a magnificent courtesy more applause more umbrellas pen this time flaming with wine and enthusiasm clapped hands and sang bravo louder than all mrs haller saw him and every body else and old mr bows the little first fiddler of the orchestra which was this night increased by a detachment of the band of the dragoons by the kind permission of colonel swallowtail looked up from the desk where he was perched with his crutch beside him and smiled at the enthusiasm of the lad those who have only seen miss fotheringay in later days since her marriage and introduction into london life have little idea how beautiful a creature she was at the time when our friend pen first set eyes on her and i warn my reader as beforehand that the pencil which illustrates this work and can draw an ugly face tolerably well but is sadly put out when it tries to delineate a beauty can give no sort of notion of her she was of the tallest of women and at her then age of sixandtwentyfor sixandtwenty she was though she vows she was only nineteenin the prime and fullness of her beauty her forehead was vast and her black hair waved over it with a natural ripple that beauties of late days have tried to imitate with the help of the crimpingirons and was confined in shining and voluminous braids at the back of a neck such as you see on the shoulders of the louvre venusthat delight of gods and men her eyes when she lifted them up to gaze on you and ere she dropped their purple deepfringed lids shone with tenderness and mystery unfathomable love and genius seemed to look out from them and then retire coyly as if ashamed to have been seen at the lattice who could have had such a commanding brow but a woman of high intellect she never laughed indeed her teeth were not good but a smile of endless tenderness and sweetness played round her beautiful lips and in the dimples of her cheeks and her lovely chin her nose defied description in those days her ears were like two little pearl shells which the earrings she wore though the handsomest properties in the theater only insulted she was dressed in long flowing robes of black which she managed and swept to and fro with wonderful grace and out of the folds of which you only saw her sandals occasionally they were of rather a large size but pen thought them as ravishing as the slippers of cinderella but it was her hand and arm that this magnificent creature most excelled in and somehow you could never see her but through them they surrounded her when she folded them over her bosom in resignation when she dropped them in mute agony or raised them in superb command when in sportive gayety her hands fluttered and waved before her likewhat shall we saylike the snowy doves before the chariot of venusit was with these arms and hands that she beckoned repelled entreated embraced her admirersno single one for she was armed with her own virtue and with her fathers valor whose sword would have leapt from its scabbard at any insult offered to his childbut the whole house which rose to her as the phrase was as she courtesied and bowed and charmed it thus she stood for a minutecomplete and beautifulas pen stared at her i say pen isnt she a stunner asked mr foker hush pen said shes speaking she began her business in a deep sweet voice those who know the play of the stranger are aware that the remarks made by the various characters are not valuable in themselves either for their sound sense their novelty of observation or their poetic fancy in fact if a man were to say it was a stupid play he would not be far wrong nobody ever talked so if we meet idiots in life as will happen it is a great mercy that they do not use such absurdly fine words the strangers talk is sham like the book he reads and the hair he wears and the bank he sits on and the diamond ring he makes play withbut in the midst of the balderdash there runs that reality of love children and forgiveness of wrong which will be listened to wherever it is preached and sets all the world sympathizing with what smothered sorrow with what gushing pathos mrs haller delivered her part at first when as count wintersens housekeeper and preparing for his excellencys arrival she has to give orders about the beds and furniture and the dinner c to be got ready she did so with the calm agony of despair but when she could get rid of the stupid servants and give vent to her feelings to the pit and the house she overflowed to each individual as if he were her particular confidant and she was crying out her griefs on his shoulder the little fiddler in the orchestra whom she did not seem to watch though he followed her ceaselessly twitched twisted nodded pointed about and when she came to the favorite passage i have a william too if he be still aliveah yes if he be still alive his little sisters too why fancy dost thou rack me so why dost thou image my poor children fainting in sickness and crying tototheir mumumotherwhen she came to this passage little bows buried his face in his blue cotton handkerchief after crying out bravo all the house was affected foker for his part taking out a large yellow bandanna wept piteously as for pen he was gone too far for that he followed the woman about and aboutwhen she was off the stage it and the house were blank the lights and the red officers reeled wildly before his sight he watched her at the sidescenewhere she stood waiting to come on the stage and where her father took off her shawl when the reconciliation arrived and she flung herself down on mr bingleys shoulders while the children clung to their knees and the countess mrs bingley and baron steinforth performed with great liveliness and spirit by garbettswhile the rest of the characters formed a group round them pens hot eyes only saw fotheringay fotheringay the curtain fell upon him like a pall he did not hear a word of what bingley said who came forward to announce the play for the next evening and who took the tumultuous applause as usual for himself pen was not even distinctly aware that the house was calling for miss fotheringay nor did the manager seem to comprehend that any body else but himself had caused the success of the play at last he understood itstepped back with a grin and presently appeared with mrs haller on his arm how beautiful she looked her hair had fallen down the officers threw her flowers she clutched them to her heart she put back her hair and smiled all round her eyes met pens down went the curtain again and she was gone not one note could he hear of the overture which the brass band of the dragoons blew by kind permission of colonel swallowtail she is a crusher aint she now mr foker asked of his companion pen did not know exactly what foker said and answered vaguely he could not tell the other what he felt he could not have spoken just then to any mortal besides pendennis did not quite know what he felt yet it was something overwhelming maddening delicious a fever of wild joy and undefined longing and now rowkins and miss thackthwaite came on to dance the favorite double hornpipe and foker abandoned himself to the delights of this ballet just as he had to the tears of the tragedy a few minutes before pen did not care for it or indeed think about the dance except to remember that that woman was acting with her in the scene where she first came in it was a mist before his eyes at the end of the dance he looked at his watch and said it was time for him to go hang it stay to see the bravo of the battleax foker said bingleys splendid in it he wears red tights and has to carry mrs b over the pinebridge of the cataract only shes too heavy its great fun do stop pen looked at the bill with one lingering fond hope that miss fotheringays name might be hidden somewhere in the list of the actors of the afterpiece but there was no such name go he must he had a long ride home he squeezed fokers hand he was choking to speak but he couldnt he quitted the theater and walked frantically about the town he knew not how long then he mounted at the george and rode homeward and clavering clock sang out one as he came into the yard at fairoaks the lady of the house might have been awake but she only heard him from the passage outside his room as he dashed into bed and pulled the clothes over his head pen had not been in the habit of passing wakeful nights so he at once fell off into a sound sleep even in later days and with a great deal of care and other thoughtful matter to keep him awake a man from long practice or fatigue or resolution begins by going to sleep as usual and gets a nap in advance of anxiety but she soon comes up with him and jogs his shoulder and says come my man no more of this laziness you must wake up and have a talk with me then they fall to together in the midnight well whatever might afterward happen to him poor little pen was not come to this state yet he tumbled into a sound sleepdid not wake until an early hour in the morning when the rooks began to caw from the little wood beyond his bedroom windows andat that very instant and as his eyes started open the beloved image was in his mind my dear boy he heard her say you were in a sound sleep and i would not disturb you but i have been close by your pillow all this while and i dont intend that you shall leave me i am love i bring with me fever and passion wild longing maddening desire restless craving and seeking many a long day ere this i heard you calling out for me and behold now i am come was pen frightened at the summons not he he did not know what was coming it was all wild pleasure and delight as yet and as when three years previously and on entering the fifth form at the cistercians his father had made him a present of a gold watch which the boy took from under his pillow and examined on the instant of waking forever rubbing and polishing it up in private and retiring into corners to listen to its ticking so the young man exulted over his new delight felt in his waistcoat pocket to see that it was safe wound it up at nights and at the very first moment of waking hugged it and looked at itby the way that first watch of pens was a showy ill manufactured piece it never went well from the beginning and was always getting out of order and after putting it aside into a drawer and forgetting it for some time he swapped it finally away for a more useful timekeeper pen felt himself to be ever so many years older since yesterday there was no mistake about it now he was as much in love as the best hero in the best romance he ever read he told john to bring his shaving water with the utmost confidence he dressed himself in some of his finest clothes that morning and came splendidly down to breakfast patronizing his mother and little laura who had been strumming her music lesson for hours before and who after he had read the prayers of which he did not heed one single syllable wondered at his grand appearance and asked him to tell her what the play was about pen laughed and declined to tell laura what the play was about in fact it was quite as well that she should not know then she asked him why he had got on his fine pin and beautiful new waistcoat pen blushed and told his mother that the old schoolfellow with whom he had dined at chatteries was reading with a tutor at baymouth a very learned man and as he was himself to go to college and as there were several young men pursuing their studies at baymouthhe was anxious to ride overandand just see what the course of their reading was laura made a long face helen pendennis looked hard at her son troubled more than ever with the vague doubt and terror which had been haunting her ever since the last night when farmer gurnett brought back the news that pen would not return home to dinner arthurs eyes defied her she tried to console herself and drive off her fears the boy had never told her an untruth pen conducted himself during breakfast in a very haughty and supercilious manner and taking leave of the elder and younger lady was presently heard riding out of the stable court he went gently at first but galloped like a madman as soon as he thought he was out of hearing smirke thinking of his own affairs and softly riding with his toes out to give pen his three hours reading at fairoaks met his pupil who shot by him like the wind smirkes pony shied as the other thundered past him the gentle curate went over his head among the stinging nettles in the hedge pen laughed as they met pointed toward the baymouth road and was gone half a mile in that direction before poor smirke had picked himself up pen had resolved in his mind that he must see foker that morning he must hear about her know about her be with somebody who knew her and honest smirke for his part sitting up among the stingingnettles as his pony cropped quietly in the hedge thought dismally to himself ought he to go to fairoaks now that his pupil was evidently gone away for the day yes he thought he might go too he might go and ask mrs pendennis when arthur would be back and hear miss laura her wattss catechism he got up on the little ponyboth were used to his slipping offand advanced upon the house from which his scholar had just rushed away in a whirlwind thus love makes fools of all of us big and little and the curate had tumbled over head and heels in pursuit of it and pen had started in the first heat of the mad race chapter v mrs haller at home illustration without slackening her pace rebecca the mare galloped on to baymouth where pen put her up at the inn stables and ran straightway to mr fokers lodgings which he knew from the direction given to him by that gentleman on the previous day on reaching these apartments which were over a chemists shop whose stock of cigars and sodawater went off rapidly by the kind patronage of his young inmates pen only found mr spavin fokers friend and part owner of the tandem which the latter had driven into chatteries who was smoking and teaching a little dog a friend of his tricks with a bit of biscuit pens healthy red face fresh from the gallop compared oddly with the waxy debauched little features of fokers chum the latter remarked it whos that man he thought he looks as fresh as a bean his hand dont shake of a morning id bet five to one foker had not come home at all here was a disappointment mr spavin could not say when his friend would return sometimes he stopped a day sometimes a week of what college was pen would he have any thing there was a very fair tap of ale mr spavin was enabled to know pendenniss name on the card which the latter took out and laid down perhaps pen in these days was rather proud of having a cardand so the young men took leave then pen went down the rock and walked about on the sand biting his nails by the shore of the much sounding sea it stretched before him bright and immeasurable the blue waters came rolling into the bay foaming and roaring hoarsely pen looked them in the face with blank eyes hardly regarding them what a tide there was pouring into the lads own mind at the time and what a little power had he to check it pen flung stones into the sea but it still kept coming on he was in a rage at not seeing foker he wanted to see foker he must see foker suppose i go onon the chatteries road just to see if i can meet him pen thought rebecca was saddled in another half hour and galloping on the grass by the chatteries road about four miles from baymouth the clavering road branches off as every body knows and the mare naturally was for taking that turn but cutting her over the shoulder pen passed the turning and rode on to the turnpike without seeing any sign of the black tandem and red wheels as he was at the turnpike he might as well go on that was quite clear so pen rode to the george and the hostler told him that mr foker was there sure enough and that hed been a making a tremendous row the night afore a drinkin and a singin and wanting to fight tom the postboy which im thinking hed have the worst of it the man added with a grinhave you carried up your masters hot water to shave with he added in a very satirical manner to mr fokers domestic who here came down the yard bearing his masters clothes most beautifully brushed and arranged show mr pendennis up to un and pen followed the man at last to the apartment where in the midst of an immense bed mr harry foker lay reposing the feather bed and bolsters swelled up all round mr foker so that you could hardly see his little sallow face and red silk nightcap hullo said pen who goes there brother quickly tell sang out the voice from the bed what pendennis again is your mamma acquainted with your absence did you sup with us last night nostopwho supped with us last night stoopid there was the three officers sir and mr bingley sir and mr costigan sir the man answered who received all mr fokers remarks with perfect gravity ah yes the cup and merry jest went round we chanted and i remember i wanted to fight a postboy did i thrash him stoopid no sir fight didnt come off sir said stoopid still with perfect gravity he was arranging mr fokers dressingcasea trunk the gift of a fond mother without which the young fellow never traveled it contained a prodigious apparatus in plate a silver dish a silver mug silver boxes and bottles for all sorts of essences and a choice of razors ready against the time when mr fokers beard should come do it some other day said the young fellow yawning and throwing up his little lean arms over his head no there was no fight but there was chanting bingley chanted i chanted the general chantedcostigan i meandid you ever hear him sing the little pig under the bed pen the man we met yesterday said pen all in a tremor the father of of the fotheringaythe very man aint she a venus pen please sir mr costigans in the sittinroom sir and says sir you asked him to breakfast sir called five times sir but wouldnt wake you on no account and has been year since eleven oclock sir how much is it now one sir what would the best of mothers say cried the little sluggard if she saw me in bed at this hour she sent me down here with a grinder she wants me to cultivate my neglected genushe he i say pen this isnt quite like seven oclock schoolis it old boyand the young fellow burst out into a boyish laugh of enjoyment then he addedgo in and talk to the general whilst i dress and i say pendennis ask him to sing you the little pig under the bed its capital pen went off in great perturbation to meet mr costigan and mr foker commenced his toilet of mr fokers two grandfathers the one from whom he inherited a fortune was a brewer the other was an earl who endowed him with the most doting mother in the world the fokers had been at the cistercian school from father to son at which place our friend whose name could be seen over the playground wall on a publichouse sign under which fokers entire was painted had been dreadfully bullied on account of his trade his uncomely countenance his inaptitude for learning and cleanliness his gluttony and other weak points but those who know how a susceptible youth under the tyranny of his schoolfellows becomes silent and a sneak may understand how in a very few months after his liberation from bondage he developed himself as he had done and became the humorous the sarcastic the brilliant foker with whom we have made acquaintance a dunce he always was it is true for learning can not be acquired by leaving school and entering at college as a fellow commoner but he was now in his own peculiar manner as great a dandy as he before had been a slattern and when he entered his sittingroom to join his two guests arrived scented and arrayed in fine linen and perfectly splendid in appearance general or captain costiganfor the latter was the rank which he preferred to assumewas seated in the window with the newspaper held before him at arms length the captains eyes were somewhat dim and he was spelling the paper with the help of his lips as well as of those bloodshot eyes of his as you see gentlemen do to whom reading is a rare and difficult occupation his hat was cocked very much on one ear and as one of his feet lay up in the windowseat the observer of such matters might remark by the size and shabbiness of the boots which the captain wore that times did not go very well with him poverty seems as if it were disposed before it takes possession of a man entirely to attack his extremities first the coverings of his head feet and hands are its first prey all these parts of the captains person were particularly rakish and shabby as soon as he saw pen he descended from the windowseat and saluted the new comer first in a military manner by conveying a couple of his fingers covered with a broken black glove to his hat and then removing that ornament altogether the captain was inclined to be bald but he brought a quantity of lank irongray hair over his pate and had a couple of wisps of the same falling down on each side of his face much whisky had spoiled what complexion mr costigan may have possessed in his youth his once handsome face had now a copper tinge he wore a very high stock scarred and stained in many places and a dresscoat tightly buttoned up in those parts where the buttons had not parted company from the garment the young gentleman to whom i had the honor to be introjuiced yesterday in the cathadral yard said the captain with a splendid bow and wave of his hat i hope i see you well sir i marked ye in the thayater last night during me daughters perfawrumance and missed ye on my return i did but conduct her home sir for jack costigan though poor is a gentleman and when i reintered the house to pay me respects to me joyous young friend mr fokerye were gone we had a jolly night of ut sirmr foker the three gallant young dragoons and your umble servant gad sir it put me in mind of one of our old nights when i bore his majestys commission in the foighting hundtherd and third and he pulled out an old snuffbox which he presented with a stately air to his new acquaintance arthur was a great deal too much flurried to speak this shabbylooking buck waswas her father the captain was perfumed with the recollections of the last nights cigars and pulled and twisted the tuft on his chin as jauntily as any young dandy i hope miss f miss costigan is well sir pen said flushing up sheshe gave me greater pleasure thanthan iii ever enjoyed at a play i think siri think shes the finest actress in the world he gasped out your hand young man for ye speak from your heart cried the captain thank ye sir an old soldier and a fond father thanks ye she is the finest actress in the world ive seen the siddons sir and the onalethey were great but what were they compared to miss fotheringay i do not wish that she should ashume her own name while on the stage me family sir are proud people and the costigans of costiganstown think that an honest man who has borne her majestys colors in the hundred and third would demean himself by permitting his daughter to earn her old fathers bread there can not be a more honorable duty surely pen said honorable bedad sir id like to see the man who said jack costigan would consent to any thing dishonorable i have a heart sir though i am poor i like a man who has a heart you have i read it in your honest face and steady eye and would you believe it he added after a pause and with a pathetic whisper that that bingley who has made his fortune by me child gives her but two guineas a week out of which she finds herself in dresses and which added to me own small means makes our all now the captains means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible but nobody knows how the wind is tempered to shorn irish lambs and in what marvelous places they find pasture if captain costigan whom i had the honor to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truthhe was unable even to think itand fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colors a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humor those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos poor cos he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always goodnatured and sometimes almost trustworthy up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any mans bill and his end was in a spunginghouse where the sheriffs officer who took him was fond of him in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honor of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commandersinchief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloatthe windraising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himselfthe means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whiskyandwater all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out before he and pen had had a half hours conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughters benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latters delicacy costigan scrawled him an order for a box lightly slipped the sovereigns into his waistcoat and slapped his hand over the place where they lay they seemed to warm his old sides faith sir said he the bullions scarcer with me than it used to be as is the case with many a good fellow i won six hundthred of em in a single night sir when me kind friend his royal highness the duke of kent was in gibralther and he straightway poured out to pen a series of stories regarding the claret drunk the bets made the races ridden by the garrison there with which he kept the young gentleman amused until the arrival of their host and his breakfast then it was good to see the captains behavior before the deviled turkey and the muttonchops his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendor and all the lords generals and lordlieutenants he had ever known he described the death of his darling bessie the late mrs costigan and the challenge he had sent to captain shanty clancy of the slashers for looking rude at miss fotheringay as she was on her kyar in the phaynix and then he described how the captain apologized gave a dinner at the kildarestreet where six of them drank twintyone bottles of claret c he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldiers existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment he winked at one or two tradesmens shops where possibly he owed a bill as much as to saysee the company i am insure ill pay you my boyand they parted finally with mr foker at a billiardroom where the latter had a particular engagement with some gentlemen of colonel swallowtails regiment pen and the shabby captain still walked the streets together the captain in his sly way making inquiries about mr fokers fortune and station in life pen told him how fokers father was a celebrated brewer and his mother was lady agnes milton lord roshervilles daughter the captain broke out into a strain of exaggerated compliment and panegyric about mr foker whose native aristocracie he said could be seen with the twinkling of an oiand only served to adawrun other qualities which he possesseda foin intellect and a generous heartin not one word of which speech did the captain accurately believe pen walked on listening to his companions prate wondering amused and puzzled it had not as yet entered into the boys head to disbelieve any statement that was made to him and being of a candid nature himself he took naturally for truth what other people told him costigan had never had a better listener and was highly flattered by the attentiveness and modest bearing of the young man so much pleased was he with the young gentleman so artless honest and cheerful did pen seem to be that the captain finally made him an invitation which he very seldom accorded to young men and asked pen if he would do him the fevor to enter his humble abode which was near at hand where the captain would have the honor of inthrojuicing his young friend to his daughther miss fotheringay pen was so delightfully shocked at this invitation and was so stricken down by the happiness thus suddenly offered to him that he thought he should have dropped from the captains arm at first and trembled lest the other should discover his emotion he gasped out a few incoherent words indicative of the high gratification he should have in being presented to the lady for whosefor whose talents he had conceived such an admirationsuch an extreme admiration and followed the captain scarcely knowing whither that gentleman led him he was going to see her he was going to see her in her was the center of the universe she was the kernel of the world for pen yesterday before he knew her seemed a period ever so long agoa revolution was between him and that time and a new world about to begin the captain conducted his young friend to that quiet little street in chatteries which is called priors lane which lies in the ecclesiastical quarter of the town close by deans green and the canons houses and is overlooked by the enormous towers of the cathedral there the captain dwelt modestly in the first floor of a low gabled house on the door of which was the brassplate of creed tailor and robemaker creed was dead however his widow was a pewopener in the cathedral hard by his eldest son was a little scamp of a choirboy who played tosshalfpenny led his little brothers into mischief and had a voice as sweet as an angel a couple of the latter were sitting on the doorstep down which you went into the passage of the house and they jumped up with great alacrity to meet their lodger and plunged wildly and rather to pens surprise at the swallowtails of the captains dresscoat for the truth is that the goodnatured gentleman when he was in cash generally brought home an apple or a piece of gingerbread for these childrenwhereby the widdy never pressed me for rint when not convanient as he remarked afterward to pen winking knowingly and laying a finger on his nose pen tumbled down the step and as he followed his companion up the creaking old stair his knees trembled under him he could hardly see when he entered following the captain and stood in the roomin her room he saw something black before him and waving as if making a courtesy and heard but quite indistinctly costigan making a speech over him in which the captain with his usual magniloquence expressed to me child his wish to make her known to his dear and admirable young friend mr awther pindinnis a young gentleman of property in the neighborhood a person of refoined moind and emiable manners a sincare lover of poethry and a man possest of a feeling and affectionate heart it is very fine weather miss fotheringay said in an irish accent and with a deep rich melancholy voice very said mr pendennis in this romantic way their conversation began and he found himself seated on a chair and having leisure to look at the young lady she looked still handsomer off the stage than before the lamps all her attitudes were naturally grand and majestical if she went and stood up against the mantlepiece her robe draped itself classically round her her chin supported itself on her hand the other lines of her form arranged themselves in full harmonious undulations she looked like a muse in contemplation if she sate down on a canebottomed chair her arm rounded itself over the back of the seat her hand seemed as if it ought to have a scepter put into it the folds of her dress fell naturally round her in order like ladies of honor round a throne and she looked like an empress all her movements were graceful and imperial in the morning you could see her hair was blueblack her complexion of dazzling fairness with the faintest possible blush flickering as it were in her cheek her eyes were gray with prodigious long lashes and as for her mouth mr pendennis has given me subsequently to understand that it was of a staring red color with which the most brilliant geranium sealingwax or guardsmans coat could not vie and very warm continued this empress and queen of sheba mr pen again assented and the conversation rolled on in this manner she asked costigan whether he had had a pleasant evening at the george and he recounted the supper and the tumblers of punch then the father asked her how she had been employing the morning bows came said she at ten and we studied ophalia its for the twentyfourth when i hope sir we shall have the honor of seeing ye indeed indeed you will mr pendennis cried wondering that she should say ophalia and speak with an irish inflection of voice naturally who had not the least hibernian accent on the stage ive secured um for your benefit dear said the captain tapping his waistcoat pocket wherein lay pens sovereigns and winking at pen with one eye at which the boy blushed mr the gentlemans very obleging said mrs haller my name is pendennis said pen blushing iihope youllyoull remember it his heart thumped so as he made this audacious declaration that he almost choked in uttering it pendennis she answered slowly and looking him full in the eyes with a glance so straight so clear so bright so killing with a voice so sweet so round so low that the word and the glance shot pen through and through and perfectly transfixed him with pleasure i never knew the name was so pretty before pen said tis a very pretty name ophelia said pentweazles not a pretty name remember papa when we were on the norwich circuit young pentweazle who used to play second old men and married miss rancy the columbine theyre both engaged in london now at the queens and get five pounds a week pentweazle wasnt his real name twas judkin gave it him i dont know why his name was harrington that is his real name was potts fawther a clergyman very respectable harrington was in london and got in debt ye remember he came out in falkland to mrs bunces julia and a pretty julia she was the captain interposed a woman of fifty and a mother of ten children tis you ought to have been julia or my names not jack costigan i didnt take the leading business then miss fotheringay said modestly i wasnt fit fort till bows taught me true for you my dear said the captain and bending to pendennis he added rejuced in circumstances sir i was for some time a fencing master in dublin theres only three men in the empire could touch me with the foil once but jack costigans getting old and stiff now sir and my daughter had an engagement at the thayater there and twas there that my friend mr bows who saw her capabilities and is an uncommon cute man gave her lessons in the dramatic art and made her what ye see what have ye done since bows went emily sure ive made a pie emily said with perfect simplicity she pronounced it poy if yell try it at four oclock sir say the word said costigan gallantly that girl sir makes the best veal and ham pie in england and i think i can promise ye a glass of punch of the right flavor pen had promised to be at home to dinner at six oclock but the rascal thought he could accommodate pleasure and duty in this point and was only too eager to accept this invitation he looked on with delight and wonder while ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humor which enchanted her guest more and more the poy arrived from the bakers in the hands of one of the little choirboys brothers at the proper hour and at four oclock pen found himself at dinneractually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her fatherwith the handsomest woman in all creationwith his first and only love whom he had adored ever since whenever since yesterday ever since forever he ate a crust of her making he poured her out a glass of beer he saw her drink a glass of punchjust one wineglass fullout of the tumbler which she mixed for her papa she was perfectly goodnatured and offered to mix one for pendennis too it was prodigiously strong pen had never in his life drunk so much spirits and water was it the punch or the punchmaker who intoxicated him during dinner when the captain whom his daughter treated most respectfully ceased prattling about himself and his adventures pen tried to engage the fotheringay in conversation about poetry and about her profession he asked her what she thought of ophelias madness and whether she was in love with hamlet or not in love with such a little ojous wretch as that stunted manager of a bingley she bristled with indignation at the thought pen explained it was not of her he spoke but of ophelia of the play oh indeed if no offense was meant none was taken but as for bingley indeed she did not value himnot that glass of punch pen next tried her on kotzebue kotzebue who was hethe author of the play in which she had been performing so admirably she did not know thatthe mans name at the beginning of the book was thompson she said pen laughed at her adorable simplicity he told her of the melancholy fate of the author of the play and how sand had killed him it was for the first time in her life that miss costigan had ever heard of mr kotzebues existence but she looked as if she was very much interested and her sympathy sufficed for honest pen and in the midst of this simple conversation the hour and a quarter which poor pen could afford to allow himself passed away only too quickly and he had taken leave he was gone and away on his rapid road homeward on the back of rebecca she was called upon to show her mettle in the three journeys which she made that day what was that he was talking about the madness of hamlet and the theory of the great german critic on the subject emily asked of her father deed then i dont know milly dear answered the captain well ask bows when he comes anyhow hes a nice fairspoken pretty young man the lady said how many tickets did he take of you fait then he took six and gev me two guineas milly the captain said i suppose them young chaps is not too flush of coin hes full of booklearning miss fotheringay continued kotzebue he he what a droll name indeed now and the poor fellow killed by sand too did ye ever hear such a thing ill ask bows about it papa dear a queer death sure enough ejaculated the captain and changed the painful theme tis an elegant mare the young gentleman rides costigan went on to say and a grand breakfast intirely that young mister foker gave us hes good for two private boxes and at least twenty tickets i should say cried the daughter a prudent lass who always kept her fine eyes on the main chance ill go bail of that answered the papa and so their conversation continued awhile until the tumbler of punch was finished and their hour of departure soon came too for at half past six miss fotheringay was to appear at the theater again whither her father always accompanied her and stood as we have seen in the sidescene watching her and drank spiritsandwater in the greenroom with the company there illustration how beautiful she is thought pen cantering homeward how simple and how tender how charming it is to see a woman of her commanding genius busying herself with the delightful though humble offices of domestic life cooking dishes to make her old father comfortable and brewing drink for him with her delicate fingers how rude it was of me to begin to talk about professional matters and how well she turned the conversation bytheway she talked about professional matters herself but then with what fun and humor she told the story of her comrade pentweazle as he was called there is no humor like irish humor her father is rather tedious but thoroughly amiable and how fine of him giving lessons in fencing after he quitted the army where he was the pet of the duke of kent fencing i should like to continue my fencing or i shall forget what angelo taught me uncle arthur always liked me to fencehe says it is the exercise of a gentleman hang it ill take some lessons of captain costigan go along rebeccaup the hill old lady pendennis pendennishow she spoke the word emily emily how good how noble how beautiful how perfect she is now the reader who has had the benefit of overhearing the entire conversation which pen had with miss fotheringay can judge for himself about the powers of her mind and may perhaps be disposed to think that she has not said any thing astonishingly humorous or intellectual in the course of the above interview she has married and taken her position in the world as a most spotless and irreproachable lady since and i have had the pleasure of making her acquaintance and must certainly own against my friend pens opinion that his adored emily is not a clever woman the truth is she had not only never heard of kotzebue but she had never heard of farquhar or congreve or any dramatist in whose plays she had not a part and of these dramas she only knew that part which concerned herself a wag once told her that dante was born at algiers and asked herwhich dr johnson wrote first irene or every man in his humor but she had the best of the joke for she had never heard of irene or every man in his humor or dante or perhaps algiers it was all one to her she acted what little bows told herwhere he told her to sob she sobbedwhere he told her to laugh she laughed she gave the tirade or the repartee without the slightest notion of its meaning she went to church and goes every sunday with a reputation perfectly intact and was and is as guiltless of sense as of any other crime but what did our pen know of these things he saw a pair of bright eyes and he believed in thema beautiful image and he fell down and worshiped it he supplied the meaning which her words wanted and created the divinity which he loved was titania the first who fell in love with an ass or pygmalion the only artist who has gone crazy about a stone he had found her he had found what his soul thirsted after he flung himself into the stream and drank with all his might let those say who have been thirsty once how delicious that first draught is as he rode down the avenue toward home pen shrieked with laughter as he saw the reverend mr smirke once more coming demurely away from fairoaks on his pony smirke had dawdled and staid at the cottages on the way and then dawdled with laura over her lessonsand then looked at mrs pendenniss gardens and improvements until he had perfectly bored out that lady and he had taken his leave at the very last minute without that invitation to dinner which he fondly expected pen was full of kindness and triumph what picked up and sound he cried out laughing come along back old fellow and eat my dinneri have had mine but we will have a bottle of the old wine and drink her health smirke poor smirke turned the ponys head round and jogged along with arthur his mother was charmed to see him in such high spirits and welcomed mr smirke for his sake when arthur said he had forced the curate back to dine he gave a most ludicrous account of the play of the night before and of the acting of bingley the manager in his ricketty hessians and the enormous mrs bingley as the countess in rumpled green satin and a polish cap he mimicked them and delighted his mother and little laura who clapped her hands with pleasure and mrs haller said mrs pendennis shes a stunner maam pen said laughing and using the words of his reverend friend mr foker a what arthur asked the lady what is a stunner arthur cried laura in the same voice so he gave them a queer account of mr foker and how he used to be called vats and grains and by other contumelious names at school and how he was now exceedingly rich and a fellow commoner at st boniface but gay and communicative as he was mr pen did not say one syllable about his ride to chatteries that day or about the new friends whom he had made there when the two ladies retired pen with flashing eyes filled up two great bumpers of madeira and looking smirke full in the face said heres to her heres to her said the curate with a sigh lifting the glass and emptying it so that his face was a little pink when he put it down pen had even less sleep that night than on the night before in the morning and almost before dawn he went out and saddled that unfortunate rebecca himself and rode her on the downs like mad again love had roused himand said awake pendennis i am here that charming feverthat delicious longingand fire and uncertainty he hugged them to himhe would not have lost them for all the world chapter vi contains both love and war illustration cicero and euripides did not occupy mr pen much for some time after this and honest mr smirke had a very easy time with his pupil rebecca was the animal who suffered most in the present state of pens mind for besides those days when he could publicly announce his intention of going to chatteries to take a fencinglesson and went thither with the knowledge of his mother whenever he saw three hours clear before him the young rascal made a rush for the city and found his way to priors lane he was as frantic with vexation when rebecca went lame as richard at bosworth when his horse was killed under him and got deeply into the books of the man who kept the hunting stables at chatteries for the doctoring of his own and the hire of another animal then and perhaps once in a week under pretense of going to read a greek play with smirke this young reprobate set off so as to be in time for the competitor down coach staid a couple of hours in chatteries and returned on the rival which left for london at ten at night once his secret was nearly lost by smirkes simplicity of whom mrs pendennis asked whether they had read a great deal the night before or a question to that effect smirke was about to tell the truth that he had never seen mr pen at all when the latters bootheel came grinding down on mr smirkes toe under the table and warned the curate not to betray him they had had conversations on the tender subject of course it is good sport if you are not yourself engaged in the conversation to hear two men in love talk there must be a confidant and depositary somewhere when informed under the most solemn vows of secrecy of pens condition of mind the curate said with no small tremor that he hoped it was no unworthy objectno unlawful attachment which pen had formedfor if so the poor fellow felt it would be his duty to break his vow and inform pens mother and then there would be a quarrel he felt with sickening apprehension and he would never again have a chance of seeing what he most liked in the world unlawful unworthy pen bounced out at the curates question she is as pure as she is beautiful i would give my heart to no other woman i keep the matter a secret in my family becausebecausethere are reasons of a weighty nature which i am not at liberty to disclose but any man who breathes a word against her purity insults both her honor and mine andand dammy i wont stand it smirke with a faint laugh only said well well dont call me out arthur for you know i cant fight but by this compromise the wretched curate was put more than ever into the power of his pupil and the greek and mathematics suffered correspondingly if the reverend gentleman had had much discernment and looked into the poets corner of the county chronicle as it arrived in the wednesdays bag he might have seen mrs haller passion and genius lines to miss fotheringay of the theater royal appearing every week and other verses of the most gloomy thrilling and passionate cast but as these poems were no longer signed nep by their artful composer but subscribed eros neither the tutor nor helen the good soul who cut all her sons verses out of the paper knew that nep was no other than that flaming eros who sang so vehemently the character of the new actress who is the lady at last asked mrs pendennis whom your rival is always singing in the county chronicle he writes something like you dear pen but yours is much the best have you seen miss fotheringay pen said yes he had that night he went to see the stranger she acted mrs haller by the way she was going to have a benefit and was to appear in opheliasuppose we were to goshakspeare you know motherwe can get horses from the clavering arms little laura sprang up with delight she longed for a play pen introduced shakspeare you know because the deceased pendennis as became a man of his character professed an uncommon respect for the bard of avon in whose works he safely said there was more poetry than in all johnsons poets put together and though mr pendennis did not much read the works in question yet he enjoined pen to peruse them and often said what pleasure he should have when the boy was of a proper age in taking him and his mother to see some good plays of the immortal poet the ready tears welled up in the kind mothers eyes as she remembered these speeches of the man who was gone she kissed her son fondly and said she would go laura jumped for joy was pen happywas he ashamed as he held his mother to him he longed to tell her all but he kept his counsel he would see how his mother liked her the play should be the thing and he would try his mother like hamlets helen in her good humor asked mr smirke to be of the party that ecclesiastic had been bred up by a fond parent at clapham who had an objection to dramatic entertainments and he had never yet seen a play but shakspearebut to go with mrs pendennis in her carriage and sit a whole night by her sidehe could not resist the idea of so much pleasure and made a feeble speech in which he spoke of temptation and gratitude and finally accepted mrs pendenniss most kind offer as he spoke he gave her a look which made her exceedingly uncomfortable she had seen that look more than once of late pursuing her he became more positively odious every day in the widows eyes we are not going to say a great deal about pens courtship of miss fotheringay for the reader has already had a specimen of her conversation much of which need surely not be reported pen sate with her hour after hour and poured forth all his honest boyish soul to her every thing he knew or hoped or felt or had read or fancied he told to her he never tired of talking and longing one after another as his thoughts rose in his hot eager brain he clothed them in words and told them to her her part of the teteatete was not to talk but to appear as if she understood what pen talked a difficult matter for the young fellow blurted out no small quantity of nonsense and to look exceedingly handsome and sympathizing the fact is while he was making one of his tiradesand delighted perhaps and wondering at his own eloquence the lad would go on for twenty minutes at a timethe lovely emily who could not comprehend a tenth part of his talk had leisure to think about her own affairs and would arrange in her own mind how they should dress the cold mutton or how she would turn the black satin or make herself out of her scarf a bonnet like miss thackthwaites new one and so forth pen spouted byron and moore passion and poetry her business was to throw up her eyes or fixing them for a moment on his face to cry oh tis beautiful ah how exquisite repeat those lines again and off the boy went and she returned to her own simple thoughts about the turned gown or the hashed mutton in fact pens passion was not long a secret from the lovely emily or her father upon his second visit his admiration was quite evident to both of them and on his departure the old gentleman said to his daughter as he winked at her over his glass of grog faith milly darling i think yeve hooked that chap pooh tis only a boy papa dear milly remarked sure hes but a child pen would have been very much pleased if he had heard that phrasehe was galloping home wild with pleasure and shouting out her name as he rode yeve hooked um any how said the captain and let me tell ye hes not a bad fish i asked tom at the george and flint the grocer where his mother dalesfine fortunedrives in her chariotsplendid park and groundsfairoaks parkonly sonproperty all his own at twentyoneye might go further and not fare so well miss fotheringay them boys are mostly talk said milly seriously ye know at dublin how ye went on about young poldoody and ive a whole desk full of verses he wrote me when he was in trinity college but he went abroad and his mother married him to an englishwoman lord poldoody was a young nobleman and in them its natural and ye werent in the position in which ye are now milly dear but ye mustnt encourage this young chap too much for bedad jack costigan wont have any thrifling with his daughter no more will his daughter papa you may be sure of that milly said a little sip more of the punchsure tis beautiful ye neednt be afraid about the young chapi think im old enough to take care of myself captain costigan so pen used to come day after day rushing in and galloping away and growing more wild about the girl with every visit sometimes the captain was present at their meetings but having a perfect confidence in his daughter he was more often inclined to leave the young couple to themselves and cocked his hat over his eye and strutted off on some errand when pen entered how delightful these interviews were the captains drawingroom was a low wainscoted room with a large window looking into the deans garden there pen sate and talkedand talked to emily looking beautiful as she sate at her worklooking beautiful and calm and the sunshine came streaming in at the great windows and lighted up her superb face and form in the midst of the conversation the great bell would begin to boom and he would pause smiling and be silent until the sound of the vast music died awayor the rooks in the cathedral elms would make a great noise toward sunsetor the sound of the organ and the choristers would come over the quiet air and gently hush pens talking by the way it must be said that miss fotheringay in a plain shawl and a close bonnet and vail went to church every sunday of her life accompanied by her indefatigable father who gave the responses in a very rich and fine brogue joined in the psalms and chanting and behaved in the most exemplary manner little bows the housefriend of the family was exceedingly wroth at the notion of miss fotheringays marriage with a stripling seven or eight years her junior bows who was a cripple and owned that he was a little more deformed even than bingley the manager so that he could not appear on the stage was a singular wild man of no small talents and humor attracted first by miss fotheringays beauty he began to teach her how to act he shrieked out in his cracked voice the parts and his pupil learned them from his lips by rote and repeated them in her full rich tones he indicated the attitudes and set and moved those beautiful arms of hers those who remember this grand actress on the stage can recall how she used always precisely the same gestures looks and tones how she stood on the same plank of the stage in the same position rolled her eyes at the same instant and to the same degree and wept with precisely the same heartrending pathos and over the same pathetic syllable and after she had come out trembling with emotion before the audience and looking so exhausted and tearful that you fancied she would faint with sensibility she would gather up her hair the instant she was behind the curtain and go home to a mutton chop and a glass of brown stout and the harrowing labors of the day over she went to bed and snored as resolutely and as regularly as a porter bows then was indignant at the notion that his pupil should throw her chances away in life by bestowing her hand upon a little country squire as soon as a london manager saw her he prophesied that she would get a london engagement and a great success the misfortune was that the london managers had seen her she had played in london three years before and failed from utter stupidity since then it was that bows had taken her in hand and taught her part after part how he worked and screamed and twisted and repeated lines over and over again and with what indomitable patience and dullness she followed him she knew that he made her and let herself be made she was not grateful or ungrateful or unkind or illhumored she was only stupid and pen was madly in love with her the posthorses from the clavering arms arrived in due time and carried the party to the theater at chatteries where pen was gratified in perceiving that a tolerably large audience was assembled the young gentlemen from baymouth had a box in the front of which sate mr foker and his friend mr spavin splendidly attired in the most fullblown evening costume they saluted pen in a cordial manner and examined his party of which they approved for little laura was a pretty little redcheeked girl with a quantity of shining brown ringlets and mrs pendennis dressed in black velvet with the diamond cross which she sported on great occasions looked uncommonly handsome and majestic behind these sate mr arthur and the gentle smirke with the curl reposing on his fair forehead and his white tie in perfect order he blushed to find himself in such a placebut how happy was he to be there he and mrs pendennis brought books of hamlet with them to follow the tragedy as is the custom of honest countryfolks who go to a play in state samuel coachman groom and gardener to mr pendennis took his place in the pit where mr fokers man was also visible it was dotted with noncommissioned officers of the dragoons whose band by kind permission of colonel swallowtail were as usual in the orchestra and that corpulent and distinguished warrior himself with his waterloo medal and a number of his young men made a handsome show in the boxes who is that oddlooking person bowing to you arthur mrs pendennis asked of her son pen blushed a great deal his name is captain costigan maam he saida peninsular officer in fact it was the captain in a new shoot of clothes as he called them and with a large pair of white kid gloves one of which he waved to pendennis while he laid the other sprawling over his heart and coat buttons pen did not say any more and how was mrs pendennis to know that mr costigan was the father of miss fotheringay mr hornbull from london was the hamlet of the night mr bingley modestly contenting himself with the part of horatio and reserving his chief strength for william in blackeyed susan which was the second piece we have nothing to do with the play except to say that ophelia looked lovely and performed with admirable wild pathos laughing weeping gazing wildly waving her beautiful white arms and flinging about her snatches of flowers and songs with the most charming madness what an opportunity her splendid black hair had of tossing over her shoulders she made the most charming corpse ever seen and while hamlet and laertes were battling in her grave she was looking out from the back scenes with some curiosity toward pens box and the family party assembled in it there was but one voice in her praise there mrs pendennis was in ecstasies with her beauty little laura was bewildered by the piece and the ghost and the play within the play during which as hamlet lay at ophelias knee pen felt that he would have liked to strangle mr hornbull but cried out great praises of that beautiful young creature pen was charmed with the effect which she produced on his motherand the clergyman for his part was exceedingly enthusiastic when the curtain fell upon that group of slaughtered personages who are dispatched so suddenly at the end of hamlet and whose demise astonished poor little laura not a little there was an immense shouting and applause from all quarters of the house the intrepid smirke violently excited clapped his hands and cried out bravo bravo as loud as the dragoon officers themselves these were greatly movedils sagitaient sur leurs bancsto borrow a phrase from our neighbors they were led cheering into action by the portly swallowtail who waved his capthe noncommissioned officers in the pit of course gallantly following their chiefs there was a roar of bravos rang through the house pen bellowing with the loudest fotheringay fotheringay and messrs spavin and foker giving the view halloo from their box even mrs pendennis began to wave about her pockethandkerchief and little laura danced laughed clapped and looked up at pen with wonder hornbull led the beneficiaire forward amidst bursts of enthusiasmand she looked so handsome and radiant with her hair still over her shoulders that pen hardly could contain himself for rapture and he leaned over his mothers chair and shouted and hurrayed and waved his hat it was all he could do to keep his secret from helen and not say look thats the woman isnt she peerless i tell you i love her but he disguised these feelings under an enormous bellowing and hurraying illustration as for miss fotheringay and her behavior the reader is referred to a former page for an account of that she went through precisely the same business she surveyed the house all round with glances of gratitude and trembled and almost sank with emotion over her favorite trapdoor she seized the flowers foker discharged a prodigious bouquet at her and even smirke made a feeble shy with a rose and blushed dreadfully when it fell into the pit she seized the flowers and pressed them to her swelling heartc cin a wordwe refer the reader to page twinkling in her breast poor old pen saw a locket which he had bought of mr nathan in highstreet with the last shilling he was worth and a sovereign borrowed from smirke blackeyed susan followed at which sweet story our gentlehearted friends were exceedingly charmed and affected and in which susan with a russet gown and a pink ribbon in her cap looked to the full as lovely as ophelia bingley was great in william goll as the admiral looked like the figurehead of a seventyfour and garbetts as captain boldweather a miscreant who forms a plan for carrying off blackeyed susan and waving an immense cocked hat says come what may he will be the ruin of herall these performed their parts with their accustomed talent and it was with a sincere regret that all our friends saw the curtain drop down and end that pretty and tender story if pen had been alone with his mother in the carriage as they went home he would have told her all that night but he sate on the box in the moonshine smoking a cigar by the side of smirke who warmed himself with a comforter mr fokers tandem and lamps whirled by the sober old clavering posters as they were a couple of miles on their road home and mr spavin saluted mrs pendenniss carriage with some considerable variations of rule britannia on the keybugle it happened two days after the above gayeties that mr dean of chatteries entertained a few select clerical friends at dinner at his deanery house that they drank uncommonly good port wine and abused the bishop over their dessert are very likely matters but with such we have nothing at present to do our friend doctor portman of clavering was one of the deans guests and being a gallant man and seeing from his place at the mahogany the deans lady walking up and down the grass with her children sporting around her and her pink parasol over her lovely headthe doctor stepped out of the french windows of the diningroom into the lawn which skirts that apartment and left the other white neckcloths to gird at my lord bishop then the doctor went up and offered mrs dean his arm and they sauntered over the ancient velvet lawn which had been mowed and rolled for immemorial deans in that easy quiet comfortable manner in which people of middle age and good temper walk after a good dinner in a calm golden summer evening when the sun has but just sunk behind the enormous cathedraltowers and the sickleshaped moon is growing every instant brighter in the heavens now at the end of the deans garden there is as we have stated mrs creeds house and the windows of the firstfloor room were open to admit the pleasant summer air a young lady of sixandtwenty whose eyes were perfectly wide open and a luckless boy of eighteen blind with love and infatuation were in that chamber together in which persons as we have before seen them in the same place the reader will have no difficulty in recognizing mr arthur pendennis and miss costigan the poor boy had taken the plunge trembling with passionate emotion his heart beating and throbbing fiercely tears rushing forth in spite of him his voice almost choking with feeling poor pen had said those words which he could withhold no more and flung himself and his whole store of love and admiration and ardor at the feet of this mature beauty is he the first who has done so have none before or after him staked all their treasure of life as a savage does his land and possessions against a draught of the fairskins firewater or a couple of bauble eyes does your mother know of this arthur said miss fotheringay slowly he seized her hand madly and kissed it a thousand times she did not withdraw it does the old lady know it miss costigan thought to herself well perhaps she may and then she remembered what a handsome diamond cross mrs pendennis had on the night of the play and thought sure twill go in the family calm yourself dear arthur she said in her low rich voice and smiled sweetly and gravely upon him then with her disengaged hand she put the hair lightly off his throbbing forehead he was in such a rapture and whirl of happiness that he could hardly speak at last he gasped out my mother has seen you and admires you beyond measure she will learn to love you soon who can do otherwise she will love you because i do deed then i think you do said miss costigan perhaps with a sort of pity for pen think he did of course here mr pen went off into a rhapsody through which as we have perfect command over our own feelings we have no reason to follow the lad of course love truth and eternity were produced and words were tried but found impossible to plumb the tremendous depth of his affection this speech we say is no business of ours it was most likely not very wise but what right have we to overhear let the poor boy fling out his simple heart at the womans feet and deal gently with him it is best to love wisely no doubt but to love foolishly is better than not to be able to love at all some of us cant and are proud of our impotence too at the end of his speech pen again kissed the imperial hand with raptureand i believe it was at this very moment and while mrs dean and doctor portman were engaged in conversation that young master ridley roset her son pulled his mother by the back of her capacious dress and said i say ma look up thereand he waggled his innocent head that was indeed a view from the deans garden such as seldom is seen by deansor is written in chapters there was poor pen performing a salute upon the rosy fingers of his charmer who received the embrace with perfect calmness and good humor master ridley looked up and grinned little miss rosa looked at her brother and opened the mouth of astonishment mrs deans countenance defied expression and as for dr portman when he beheld the scene and saw his prime favorite and dear pupil pen he stood mute with rage and wonder mrs haller spied the party below at the same moment and gave a start and a laugh sure theres somebody in the deans garden she cried out and withdrew with perfect calmness while pen darted away with his face glowing like coals the garden party had reentered the house when he ventured to look out again the sickle moon was blazing bright in the heavens then the stars were glittering the bell of the cathedral tolling nine the deans guests all save one who had called for his horse dumpling and ridden off early were partaking of tea and buttered cakes in mrs deans drawingroomwhen pen took leave of miss costigan pen arrived at home in due time afterward and was going to slip off to bed for the poor lad was greatly worn and agitated and his highstrung nerves had been at almost a maddening pitchwhen a summons came to him by john the old footman whose countenance bore a very ominous look that his mother must see him below on this he tied on his neckcloth again and went down stairs to the drawingroom there sate not only his mother but her friend the reverend doctor portman helens face looked very pale by the light of the lampthe doctors was flushed on the contrary and quivering with anger and emotion pen saw at once that there was a crisis and that there had been a discovery now for it he thought where have you been arthur helen said in a trembling voice how can you look thatthat dear lady and a christian clergyman in the face sir bounced out the doctor in spite of helens pale appealing looks where has he been where his mothers son should have been ashamed to go for your mothers an angel sir an angel how dare you bring pollution into her house and make that spotless creature wretched with the thoughts of your crime sir said pen dont deny it sir roared the doctor dont add lies sir to your other infamy i saw you myself sir i saw you from the deans garden i saw you kissing the hand of that infernal painted stop pen said clapping his fist on the table till the lamp flickered up and shook i am a very young man but you will please to remember that i am a gentlemani will hear no abuse of that lady lady sir cried the doctor that a ladyyouyouyou stand in your mothers presence and call thatthat woman a lady in any bodys presence shouted out pen she is worthy of any place she is as pure as any woman she is as good as she is beautiful if any man but you insulted her i would tell him what i thought but as you are my oldest friend i suppose you have the privilege to doubt of my honor no no pen dearest pen cried out helen in an excess of joy i told i told you doctor he was notnot what you thought and the tender creature coming trembling forward flung herself on pens shoulder pen felt himself a man and a match for all the doctors in doctordom he was glad this explanation had come you saw how beautiful she was he said to his mother with a soothing protecting air like hamlet with gertrude in the play i tell you dear mother she is as good when you know her you will say so she is of all except you the simplest the kindest the most affectionate of women why should she not be on the stageshe maintains her father by her labor drunken old reprobate growled the doctor but pen did not hear or heed if you could see as i have how orderly her life is how pure and pious her whole conduct you wouldas i doyes as i dowith a savage look at the doctorspurn the slanderer who dared to do her wrong her father was an officer and distinguished himself in spain he was a friend of his royal highness the duke of kent and is intimately known to the duke of wellington and some of the first officers of our army he has met my uncle arthur at lord hills he thinks his own family is one of the most ancient and respectable in ireland and indeed is as good as our own thethe costigans were kings of ireland why god bless my soul shrieked out the doctor hardly knowing whether to burst with rage or laughter you dont mean to say you want to marry her pen put on his most princely air what else dr portman he said do you suppose would be my desire utterly foiled in his attack and knocked down by this sudden lunge of pens the doctor could only gasp out mrs pendennis maam send for the major send for the major with all my heart said arthur prince of pendennis and grand duke of fairoaks with a most superb wave of the hand and the colloquy terminated by the writing of those two letters which were laid on major pendenniss breakfasttable in london at the commencement of prince arthurs most veracious history chapter vii in which the major makes his appearance illustration our acquaintance major arthur pendennis arrived in due time at fairoaks after a dreary night passed in the mailcoach where a stout fellowpassenger swelling preternaturally with greatcoats had crowded him into a corner and kept him awake by snoring indecently where a widow lady opposite had not only shut out the fresh air by closing all the windows of the vehicle but had filled the interior with fumes of jamaica rum and water which she sucked perpetually from a bottle in her reticule where whenever he caught a brief moment of sleep the twanging of the horn at the turnpikegates or the scuffling of his huge neighbor wedging him closer and closer or the play of the widows feet on his own tender toes speedily woke up the poor gentleman to the horrors and realities of lifea life which has passed away now and become impossible and only lives in fond memories eight miles an hour for twenty or fiveandtwenty hours a tight mailcoach a hard seat a gouty tendency a perpetual change of coachmen grumbling because you did not fee them enough a fellowpassenger partial to spiritsandwaterwho has not borne with these evils in the jolly old times and how could people travel under such difficulties and yet they did and were merry too next the widow and by the side of the majors servant on the roof were a couple of schoolboys going home for the midsummer holidays and major pendennis wondered to see them sup at the inn at bagshot where they took in a cargo of ham eggs pie pickles tea coffee and boiled beef which surprised the poor major sipping a cup of very feeble tea and thinking with a tender dejection that lord steynes dinner was coming off at that very moment the ingenuous ardor of the boys however amused the major who was very goodnatured and he became the more interested when he found that the one who traveled inside with him was a lords son whose noble father pendennis of course had met in the world of fashion which he frequented the little lord slept all night through in spite of the squeezing and the hornblowing and the widow and he looked as fresh as paint and indeed pronounced himself to be so when the major with a yellow face a bristly beard a wig out of curl and strong rheumatic griefs shooting through various limbs of his uneasy body descended at the little lodgegate at fairoaks where the portress and gardeners wife reverentially greeted him and still more respectfully mr morgan his man helen was on the lookout for this expected guest and saw him from her window but she did not come forward immediately to greet him she knew the major did not like to be seen at a surprise and required a little preparation before he cared to be visible pen when a boy had incurred sad disgrace by carrying off from the majors dressingtable a little morocco box which it must be confessed contained the majors back teeth which he naturally would leave out of his jaws in a jolting mailcoach and without which he would not choose to appear morgan his man made a mystery of his wigs curling them in private places introducing them mysteriously to his masters roomnor without his head of hair would the major care to show himself to any member of his family or any acquaintance he went to his apartment then and supplied these deficiencies he groaned and moaned and wheezed and cursed morgan through his toilet as an old buck will who has been up all night with a rheumatism and has a long duty to perform and finally being belted curled and set straight he descended upon the drawingroom with a grave majestic air such as befitted one who was at once a man of business and a man of fashion pen was not there however only helen and little laura sewing at her knees and to whom he never presented more than a forefinger as he did on this occasion after saluting his sisterinlaw laura took the finger trembling and dropped itand then fled out of the room major pendennis did not want to keep her or indeed to have her in the house at all and had his private reason for disapproving of her which we may mention on some future occasion meanwhile laura disappeared and wandered about the premises seeking for pen whom she presently found in the orchard pacing up and down a walk there in earnest conversation with mr smirke he was so occupied that he did not hear lauras clear voice singing out until smirke pulled him by the coat and pointed toward her as she came running she ran up and put her hand into his come in pen she said theres somebody come uncle arthurs come he is is he said pen and she felt him grasp her little hand he looked round at smirke with uncommon fierceness as much as to say i am ready for him or any manmr smirke cast up his eyes as usual and heaved a gentle sigh lead on laura pen said with a half fierce half comic airlead on and say i wait upon my uncle but he was laughing in order to hide a great anxiety and was screwing his courage inwardly to face the ordeal which he knew was now before him pen had taken smirke into his confidence in the last two days and after the outbreak attendant on the discovery of dr portman and during every one of those fortyeight hours which he had passed in mr smirkes society had done nothing but talk to his tutor about miss fotheringaymiss emily fotheringayemily c to all which talk smirke listened without difficulty for he was in love himself most anxious in all things to propitiate pen and indeed very much himself enraptured by the personal charms of this goddess whose like never having been before at a theatrical representation he had not beheld until now pens fire and volubility his hot eloquence and rich poetical tropes and figures his manly heart kind ardent and hopeful refusing to see any defects in the person he loved any difficulties in their position that he might not overcome half convinced mr smirke that the arrangement proposed by mr pen was a very feasible and prudent one and that it would be a great comfort to have emily settled at fairoaks captain costigan in the yellow room established for life there and pen married at eighteen and it is a fact that in these two days the boy had almost talked over his mother too had parried all her objections one after another with that indignant good sense which is often the perfection of absurdity and had brought her almost to acquiesce in the belief that if the marriage was doomed in heaven why doomed it wasthat if the young woman was a good person it was all that she for her part had to ask and rather to dread the arrival of the guardian uncle who she foresaw would regard mr pens marriage in a manner very different to that simple romantic honest and utterly absurd way in which the widow was already disposed to look at questions of this sort for as in the old allegory of the gold and silver shield about which the two knights quarreled each is right according to the point from which he looks so about marriage the question whether it is foolish or good wise or otherwise depends upon the point of view from which you regard it if it means a snug house in belgravia and pretty little dinner parties and a pretty little brougham to drive in the park and a decent provision not only for the young people but for the little belgravians to come and if these are the necessaries of life and they are with many honest people to talk of any other arrangement is an absurdity of love in lodgingsa babyish folly of affection that cant pay coachhire or afford a decent millineras mere wicked balderdash and childish romance if on the other hand your opinion is that people not with an assured subsistence but with a fair chance to obtain it and with the stimulus of hope health and strong affection may take the chance of fortune for better or worse and share its good or its evil together the polite theory then becomes an absurdity in its turn worse than an absurdity a blasphemy almost and doubt of providence and a man who waits to make his chosen woman happy until he can drive her to church in a neat little carriage with a pair of horses is no better than a coward or a trifler who is neither worthy of love nor of fortune i dont say that the town folks are not right but helen pendennis was a country bred woman and the book of life as she interpreted it told her a different story to that page which is read in cities like most soft and sentimental women matchmaking in general formed a great part of her thoughts and i dare say she had begun to speculate about her sons falling in love and marrying long before the subject had ever entered into the brains of the young gentleman it pleased her with that dismal pleasure which the idea of sacrificing themselves gives to certain women to think of the day when she would give up all to pen and he should bring his wife home and she would surrender the keys and the best bedroom and go and sit at the side of the table and see him happy what did she want in life but to see the lad prosper as an empress certainly was not too good for him and would be honored by becoming mrs pen so if he selected humble esther instead of queen vashti she would be content with his lordships choice never mind how lowly or poor the person might be who was to enjoy that prodigious honor mrs pendennis was willing to bow before her and welcome her and yield her up the first place but an actressa mature woman who had long ceased blushing except with rouge as she stood under the eager glances of thousands of eyesan illiterate and illbred person very likely who must have lived with light associates and have heard doubtful conversationoh it was hard that such a one should be chosen and that the matron should be deposed to give place to such a sultana all these doubts the widow laid before pen during the two days which had of necessity to elapse ere the uncle came down but he met them with that happy frankness and ease which a young gentleman exhibits at his time of life and routed his mothers objections with infinite satisfaction to himself miss costigan was a paragon of virtue and delicacy she was as sensitive as the most timid maiden she was as pure as the unsullied snow she had the finest manners the most graceful wit and genius the most charming refinement and justness of appreciation in all matters of taste she had the most admirable temper and devotion to her father a good old gentleman of high family and fallen fortunes who had lived however with the best society in europe he was in no hurry and could afford to wait any timetill he was oneandtwenty but he felt and here his face assumed an awful and harrowing solemnity that he was engaged in the one only passion of his life and that death alone could close it helen told him with a sad smile and shake of the head that people survived these passions and as for long engagements contracted between very young men and old womenshe knew an instance in her own familylauras poor father was an instancehow fatal they were mr pen however was resolved that death must be his doom in case of disappointment and rather than thisrather than balk him in factthis lady would have submitted to any sacrifice or personal pain and would have gone down on her knees and have kissed the feet of a hottentot daughterinlaw arthur knew his power over the widow and the young tyrant was touched while he exercised it in those two days he brought her almost into submission and patronized her very kindly and he passed one evening with the lovely piemaker at chatteries in which he bragged of his influence over his mother and he spent the other night in composing a most flaming and conceited copy of verses to his divinity in which he vowed like montrose that he would make her famous with his sword and glorious by his pen and that he would love her as no mortal woman had been adored since the creation of womankind it was on that night long after midnight that wakeful helen passing stealthily by her sons door saw a light streaming through the chink of the door into the dark passage and heard pen tossing and tumbling and mumbling verses in his bed she waited outside for a while anxiously listening to him in infantile fevers and early boyish illnesses many a night before the kind soul had so kept watch she turned the lock very softly now and went in so gently that pen for a moment did not see her his face was turned from her his papers on his desk were scattered about and more were lying on the bed round him he was biting a pencil and thinking of rhymes and all sorts of follies and passions he was hamlet jumping into ophelias grave he was the stranger taking mrs haller to his arms beautiful mrs haller with the raven ringlets falling over her shoulders despair and byron thomas moore and all the loves of the angels waller and herrick beranger and all the lovesongs he had ever read were working and seething in this young gentlemans mind and he was at the very height and paroxysm of the imaginative frenzy when his mother found him arthur said the mothers soft silver voice and he started up and turned round he clutched some of the papers and pushed them under the pillow why dont you go to sleep my dear she said with a sweet tender smile and sate down on the bed and took one of his hot hands pen looked at her wildly for an instanti couldnt sleep he saidii wasi was writingand hereupon he flung his arms round her neck and said o mother i love her i love herhow could such a kind soul as that help soothing and pitying him the gentle creature did her best and thought with a strange wonderment and tenderness that it was only yesterday that he was a child in that bed and how she used to come and say her prayers over it before he woke upon holiday mornings they were very grand verses no doubt although miss fotheringay did not understand them but old cos with a wink and a knowing finger on his nose said put them up with th other letthers milly darling poldoodys pomes was nothing to this so milly locked up the manuscripts when then the major being dressed and presentable presented himself to mrs pendennis he found in the course of ten minutes colloquy that the poor widow was not merely distressed at the idea of the marriage contemplated by pen but actually more distressed at thinking that the boy himself was unhappy about it and that his uncle and he should have any violent altercation on the subject she besought major pendennis to be very gentle with arthur he has a very high spirit and will not brook unkind words she hinted dr portman spoke to him very roughlyand i must own unjustly the other nightfor my dearest boys honor is as high as any mother can desirebut pens answer quite frightened me it was so indignant recollect he is a man now and be veryvery cautious said the widow laying a fair long hand on the majors sleeve he took it up kissed it gallantly and looked in her alarmed face with wonder and a scorn which he was too polite to show bon dieu thought the old negotiator the boy has actually talked the woman round and shed get him a wife as she would a toy if master cried for it why are there no such things as lettresdecachetand a bastile for young fellows of family the major lived in such good company that he might be excused for feeling like an earlhe kissed the widows timid hand pressed it in both his and laid it down on the table with one of his own over it as he smiled and looked her in the face confess said he now that you are thinking how you possibly can make it up to your conscience to let the boy have his own way she blushed and was moved in the usual manner of females i am thinking that he is very unhappy and i am too to contradict him or to let him have his own wish asked the other and added with great comfort to his inward self im dd if he shall to think that he should have formed so foolish and cruel and fatal an attachment the widow said which can but end in pain whatever be the issue the issue shant be marriage my dear sister the major said resolutely were not going to have a pendennis the head of the house marry a strolling mountebank from a booth no no we wont marry into greenwich fair maam if the match is broken suddenly off the widow interposed i dont know what may be the consequence i know arthurs ardent temper the intensity of his affections the agony of his pleasures and disappointments and i tremble at this one if it must be indeed indeed it must not come on him too suddenly my dear madam the major said with an air of the deepest commiseration ive no doubt arthur will have to suffer confoundedly before he gets over the little disappointment but is he think you the only person who has been so rendered miserable no indeed said helen holding down her eyes she was thinking of her own case and was at that moment seventeen again and most miserable i myself whispered her brotherinlaw have undergone a disappointment in early life a young woman with fifteen thousand pounds niece to an earlmost accomplished creaturea third of her money would have run up my promotion in no time and i should have been a lieutenantcolonel at thirty but it might not be i was but a penniless lieutenant her parents interfered and i embarked for indiawhere i had the honor of being secretary to lord buckley when commanderinchiefwithout her what happened we returned our letters sent back our locks of hair the major here passed his fingers through his wig we suffered but we recovered she is now a baronets wife with thirteen grownup children altered it is true in person but her daughters remind me of what she was and the third is to be presented early next week helen did not answer she was still thinking of old times i suppose if one lives to be a hundred there are certain passages of ones early life whereof the recollection will always carry us back to youth again and that helen was thinking of one of these look at my own brother my dear creature the major continued gallantly he himself you know had a little disappointment when he started in thethe medical professionan eligible opportunity presented itself miss balls i remember the name was daughter of an apotha practitioner in very large practice my brother had very nearly succeeded in his suitbut difficulties arose disappointments supervened andand i am sure he had no reason to regret the disappointment which gave him this hand said the major and he once more politely pressed helens fingers those marriages between people of such different rank and age said helen are sad things i have known them produce a great deal of unhappinesslauras father my cousin whowho was brought up with meshe added in a low voice was an instance of that most injudicious cut in the major i dont know any thing more painful than for a man to marry his superior in age or his inferior in station fancy marrying a woman of a low rank of life and having your house filled with her confounded tagragandbobtail of relations fancy your wife attached to a mother who dropped her hs or called maria marire how are you to introduce her into society my dear mrs pendennis i will name no names but in the very best circles of london society i have seen men suffering the most excruciating agony i have known them to be cut to be lost entirely from the vulgarity of their wives connections what did lady snapperton do last year at her dejeune dansant after the bohemian ball she told lord brouncker that he might bring his daughters or send them with a proper chaperon but that she would not receive lady brouncker who was a druggists daughter or some such thing and as tom wagg remarked of her never wanted medicine certainly for she never had an h in her life good ged what would have been the trifling pang of a separation in the first instance to the enduring infliction of a constant misalliance and intercourse with low people what indeed said helen dimly disposed toward laughter but yet checking the inclination because she remembered in what prodigious respect her deceased husband held major pendennis and his stories of the great world then this fatal woman is ten years older than that silly young scapegrace of an arthur what happens in such cases my dear creature i dont mind telling you now we are alone that in the highest state of society misery undeviating misery is the result look at lord clodworthy come into a room with his wifewhy good ged she looks like clodworthys mother whats the case between lord and lady willowbank whose love match was notorious he has already cut her down twice when she has hanged herself out of jealousy for mademoiselle de sainte cunegonde the dancer and mark my words good ged one day hell not cut the old woman down no my dear madam you are not in the world but i am you are a little romantic and sentimental you know you arewomen with those large beautiful eyes always are you must leave this matter to my experience marry this woman marry at eighteen an actress of thirtybah bahi would as soon he sent into the kitchen and married the cook i know the evils of premature engagements sighed out helen and as she made this allusion no less than thrice in the course of the above conversation and seems to be so oppressed with the notion of long engagements and unequal marriages and as the circumstance we have to relate will explain what perhaps some persons are anxious to know namely who little laura is who has appeared more than once before us it will be as well to clear up these points in another chapter chapter viii in which pen is kept waiting at the door while the reader is informed who little laura was illustration once upon a time then there was a young gentleman of cambridge university who came to pass the long vacation at the village where young helen thistlewood was living with her mother the widow of the lieutenant slain at copenhagenthis gentlemanwhose name was the reverend francis bellwas nephew to mrs thistlewood and by consequence own cousin to miss helen so that it was very right that he should take lodgings in his aunts house who lived in a very small way and there he passed the long vacation reading with three or four pupils who accompanied him to the village mr bell was fellow of a college and famous in the university for his learning and skill as a tutor his two kinswomen understood pretty early that the reverend gentleman was engaged to be married and was only waiting for a college living to enable him to fulfill his engagement his intended bride was the daughter of another parson who had acted as mr bells own private tutor in bells early life and it was while under mr coachers roof indeed and when only a boy of seventeen or eighteen years of age that the impetuous young bell had flung himself at the feet of miss martha coacher whom he was helping to pick peas in the garden on his knees before those peas and her he pledged himself to an endless affection miss coacher was by many years the young fellows senior and her own heart had been lacerated by many previous disappointments in the matrimonial line no less than three pupils of her father had trifled with those young affections the apothecary of the village had despicably jilted her the dragoon officer with whom she had danced so many times during that happy season which she passed at bath with her gouty grandmamma one day gayly shook his bridlerein and galloped away never to return wounded by the shafts of repeated ingratitude can it be wondered at that the heart of martha coacher should pant to find rest somewhere she listened to the proposals of the gawky gallant honest boy with great kindness and goodhumor at the end of his speech she said law bell im sure you are too young to think of such things but intimated that she too would revolve them in her own virgin bosom she could not refer mr bell to her mamma for mr coacher was a widower and being immersed in his books was of course unable to take the direction of so frail and wondrous an article as a ladys heart which miss martha had to manage for herself a lock of her hair tied up in a piece of blue ribbon conveyed to the happy bell the result of the vestals conference with herself thrice before had she snipt off one of her auburn ringlets and given them away the possessors were faithless but the hair had grown again and martha had indeed occasion to say that men were deceivers when she handed over this token of love to the simple boy number however was an exception to former passionsfrancis bell was the most faithful of lovers when his time arrived to go to college and it became necessary to acquaint mr coacher of the arrangements that had been made the latter cried god bless my soul i hadnt the least idea what was going on as was indeed very likely for he had been taken in three times before in precisely a similar manner and francis went to the university resolved to conquer honors so as to be able to lay them at the feet of his beloved martha this prize in view made him labor prodigiously news came term after term of the honors he won he sent the prizebooks for his college essays to old coacher and his silver declamation cup to miss martha in due season he was high among the wranglers and a fellow of his college and during all the time of these transactions a constant tender correspondence was kept up with miss coacher to whose influence and perhaps with justice he attributed the successes which he had won by the time however when the rev francis bell ma and fellow and tutor of his college was twentysix years of age it happened that miss coacher was thirtyfour nor had her charms her manners or her temper improved since that sunny day in the springtime of life when he found her picking peas in the garden having achieved his honors he relaxed in the ardor of his studies and his judgment and taste also perhaps became cooler the sunshine of the peagarden faded away from miss martha and poor bell found himself engagedand his hand pledged to that bond in a thousand lettersto a coarse illtempered illfavored illmannered middleaged woman it was in consequence of one of many altercations in which marthas eloquence shone and in which therefore she was frequently pleased to indulge that francis refused to take his pupils to bearleaders green where mr coachers living was and where bell was in the habit of spending the summer and he bethought him that he would pass the vacation at his aunts village which he had not seen for many yearsnot since little helen was a girl and used to sit on his knee down then he came and lived with them helen was grown a beautiful young woman now the cousins were nearly four months together from june to october they walked in the summer evenings they met in the early morn they read out of the same book when the old lady dozed at night over the candles what little helen knew frank taught her she sang to him she gave her artless heart to him she was aware of all his story had he made any secrethad he not shown the picture of the woman to whom he was engaged and with a blushher letters hard eager and cruelthe days went on and on happier and closer with more kindness more confidence and more pity at last one morning in october came when francis went back to college and the poor girl felt that her tender heart was gone with him frank too wakened up from the delightful midsummerdream to the horrible reality of his own pain he gnashed and tore at the chain which bound him he was frantic to break it and be free should he confessgive his savings to the woman to whom he was bound and beg his releasethere was time yethe temporized no living might fall in for years to come the cousins went on corresponding sadly and fondly the betrothed woman hard jealous and dissatisfied complaining bitterly and with reason of her franciss altered tone at last things came to a crisis and the new attachment was discovered francis owned it cared not to disguise it rebuked martha with her violent temper and angry imperiousness and worst of all with her inferiority and her age her reply was that if he did not keep his promise she would carry his letters into every court in the kingdomletters in which his love was pledged to her ten thousand times and after exposing him to the world as the perjurer and traitor he was she would kill herself frank had one more interview with helen whose mother was dead then and who was living companion with old lady pontypoolone more interview where it was resolved that he was to do his duty that is to redeem his vow that is to pay a debt cozened from him by a sharper that is to make two honest people miserable so the two judged their duty to be and they parted the living fell in only too soon but yet frank bell was quite a gray and wornout man when he was inducted into it helen wrote him a letter on his marriage beginning my dear cousin and ending always truly yours she sent him back the other letters and the lock of his hairall but a small piece she had it in her desk when she was talking to the major bell lived for three or four years in his living at the end of which time the chaplainship of coventry island falling vacant frank applied for it privately and having procured it announced the appointment to his wife she objected as she did to every thing he told her bitterly that he did not want her to come so she went bell went out in governor crawleys time and was very intimate with that gentleman in his later years and it was in coventry island years after his own marriage and five years after he had heard of the birth of helens boy that his own daughter was born she was not the daughter of the first mrs bell who died of island fever very soon after helen pendennis and her husband to whom helen had told every thing wrote to inform bell of the birth of their child i was old was i said mrs bell the first i was old and her inferior was i but i married you mr bell and kept you from marrying her and hereupon she died bell married a colonial lady whom he loved fondly but he was not doomed to prosper in love and this lady dying in childbirth bell gave up too sending his little girl home to helen pendennis and her husband with a parting prayer that they would befriend her the little thing came to fairoaks from bristol which is not very far off dressed in black and in company of a soldiers wife her nurse at parting from whom she wept bitterly but she soon dried up her grief under helens motherly care round her neck she had a locket with hair which helen had given ah how many years ago to poor francis dead and buried this child was all that was left of him and she cherished as so tender a creature would the legacy which he had bequeathed to her the girls name as his dying letter stated was helen laura but john pendennis though he accepted the trust was always rather jealous of the orphan and gloomily ordered that she should be called by her own mothers name and not by that first one which her father had given her she was afraid of mr pendennis to the last moment of his life and it was only when her husband was gone that helen dared openly to indulge in the tenderness which she felt for the little girl thus it was that laura bell became mrs pendenniss daughter neither her husband nor that gentlemans brother the major viewed her with very favorable eyes she reminded the first of circumstances in his wifes life which he was forced to accept but would have forgotten much more willingly and as for the second how could he regard her she was neither related to his own family of pendennis nor to any nobleman in this empire and she had but a couple of thousand pounds for her fortune and now let mr pen come in who has been waiting all this while having strung up his nerves and prepared himself without at the door for the meeting he came to it determined to face the awful uncle he had settled in his mind that the encounter was to be a fierce one and was resolved on bearing it through with all the courage and dignity of the famous family which he represented and he flung open the door and entered with the most severe and warlike expression armed capapie as it were with lance couched and plumes displayed and glancing at his adversary as if to say come on im ready the old man of the world as he surveyed the boys demeanor could hardly help a grin at his admirable pompous simplicity major pendennis too had examined his ground and finding that the widow was already half won over to the enemy and having a shrewd notion that threats and tragic exhortations would have no effect upon the boy who was inclined to be perfectly stubborn and awfully serious the major laid aside the authoritative manner at once and with the most goodhumored natural smile in the world held out his hands to pen shook the lads passive fingers gayly and said well pen my boy tell us all about it helen was delighted with the generosity of the majors good humor on the contrary it quite took aback and disappointed poor pen whose nerves were strung up for a tragedy and who felt that his grand entree was altogether balked and ludicrous he blushed and winced with mortified vanity and bewilderment he felt immensely inclined to begin to cryiii didnt know that you were come till just now he said isistown very full i suppose if pen could hardly gulp his tears down it was all the major could do to keep from laughter he turned round and shot a comical glance at mrs pendennis who too felt that the scene was at once ridiculous and sentimental and so having nothing to say she went up and kissed mr pen as he thought of her tenderness and soft obedience to his wishes it is very possible too the boy was melted what a couple of fools they are thought the old guardian if i hadnt come down she would have driven over in state to pay a visit and give her blessing to the young ladys family come come said he still grinning at the couple let us have as little sentiment as possible and pen my good fellow tell us the whole story pen got back at once to his tragic and heroical air the story is sir said he as i have written it to you before i have made the acquaintance of a most beautiful and most virtuous lady of a high family although in reduced circumstances i have found the woman in whom i know that the happiness of my life is centered i feel that i never never can think about any woman but her i am aware of the difference of our ages and other difficulties in my way but my affection was so great that i felt i could surmount all thesethat we both could and she has consented to unite her lot with mine and to accept my heart and my fortune how much is that my boy said the major has any body left you some money i dont know that you are worth a shilling in the world you know what i have is his cried out mrs pendennis good heavens madam hold your tongue was what the guardian was disposed to say but he kept his temper not without a struggle no doubt no doubt he said you would sacrifice any thing for him every body knows that but it is after all then your fortune which pen is offering to the young lady and of which he wishes to take possession at eighteen i know my mother will give me any thing pen said looking rather disturbed yes my good fellow but there is reason in all things if your mother keeps the house it is but fair that she should select her company when you give her house over her head and transfer her bankers account to yourself for the benefit of miss whatdyoucallemmiss costigandont you think you should at least have consulted my sister as one of the principal parties in the transaction i am speaking to you you see without the least anger or assumption of authority such as the law and your fathers will give me over you for three years to comebut as one man of the world to anotherand i ask you if you think that because you can do what you like with your mother therefore you have a right to do so as you are her dependent would it not have been more generous to wait before you took this step and at least to have paid her the courtesy to ask her leave pen held down his head and began dimly to perceive that the action on which he had prided himself as a most romantic generous instance of disinterested affection was perhaps a very selfish and headstrong piece of folly i did it in a moment of passion said pen floundering i was not aware what i was going to say or to do and in this he spoke with perfect sincerity but now it is said and i stand to it no i neither can nor will recall it ill die rather than do so and ii dont want to burthen my mother he continued ill work for myself ill go on the stage and act with her sheshe says i should do well there but will she take you on those terms the major interposed mind i do not say that miss costigan is not the most disinterested of women but dont you suppose now fairly that your position as a young gentleman of ancient birth and decent expectations forms a part of the cause why she finds your addresses welcome ill die i say rather than forfeit my pledge to her said pen doubling his fists and turning red who asks you my dear friend answered the imperturbable guardian no gentleman breaks his word of course when it has been given freely but after all you can wait you owe something to your mother something to your familysomething to me as your fathers representative oh of course pen said feeling rather relieved well as you have pledged your word to her give us another will you arthur what is it arthur asked that you will make no private marriagethat you wont be taking a trip to scotland you understand that would be a falsehood pen never told his mother a falsehood helen said pen hung down his head again and his eyes filled with tears of shame had not this whole intrigue been a falsehood to that tender and confiding creature who was ready to give up all for his sake he gave his uncle his hand no siron my word of honor as a gentleman he said i will never marry without my mothers consent and giving helen a bright parting look of confidence and affection unchangeable the boy went out of the drawingroom into his own study hes an angelhes an angel the mother cried out in one of her usual raptures he comes of a good stock maam said her brotherinlawof a good stock on both sides the major was greatly pleased with the result of his diplomacyso much so that he once more saluted the tips of mrs pendenniss glove and dropping the curt manly and straightforward tone in which he had conducted the conversation with the lad assumed a certain drawl which he always adopted when he was most conceited and fine my dear creature said he in that his politest tone i think it certainly as well that i came down and i flatter myself that last botte was a successful one i tell you how i came to think of it three years ago my kind friend lady ferrybridge sent for me in the greatest state of alarm about her son gretna whose affair you remember and implored me to use my influence with the young gentleman who was engaged in an affaire de coeur with a scotch clergymans daughter miss mactoddy i implored i entreated gentle measures but lord ferrybridge was furious and tried the high hand gretna was sulky and silent and his parents thought they had conquered but what was the fact my dear creature the young people had been married for three months before lord ferrybridge knew any thing about it and that was why i extracted the promise from master pen arthur would never have done so mrs pendennis said he hasntthat is one comfort answered the brotherinlaw like a wary and patient man of the world major pendennis did not press poor pen any farther for the moment but hoped the best from time and that the young fellows eyes would be opened before long to see the absurdity of which he was guilty and having found out how keen the boys point of honor was he worked kindly upon that kindly feeling with great skill discoursing him over their wine after dinner and pointing out to pen the necessity of a perfect uprightness and openness in all his dealings and entreating that his communications with his interesting young friend as the major politely called miss fotheringay should be carried on with the knowledge if not approbation of mrs pendennis after all pen the major said with a convenient frankness that did not displease the boy while it advanced the interests of the negotiator you must bear in mind that you are throwing yourself away your mother might submit to your marriage as she would to any thing else you desired if you did but cry long enough for it but be sure of this that it can never please her you take a young woman off the boards of a country theater and prefer her for such is the case to one of the finest ladies in england and your mother will submit to your choice but you cant suppose that she will be happy under it i have often fancied entre nous that my sister had it in her eye to make a marriage between you and that little ward of hersflora laurawhats her name and i always determined to do my small endeavor to prevent any such match the child has but two thousand pounds i am given to understand it is only with the utmost economy and care that my sister can provide for the decent maintenance of her house and for your appearance and education as a gentleman and i dont care to own to you that i had other and much higher views for you with your name and birth sirwith your talents which i suppose are respectable with the friends whom i have the honor to possess i could have placed you in an excellent positiona remarkable position for a young man of such exceeding small means and had hoped to see you at least try to restore the honors of our name your mothers softness stopped one prospect or you might have been a general like our gallant ancestor who fought at ramillies and malplaquet i had another plan in view my excellent and kind friend lord bagwig who is very well disposed toward me would i have little doubt have attached you to his mission at pumpernickel and you might have advanced in the diplomatic service but pardon me for recurring to the subject how is a man to serve a young gentleman of eighteen who proposes to marry a lady of thirty whom he has selected from a booth in a fairwell not a faira barn that profession at once is closed to you the public service is closed to you society is closed to you you see my good friend to what you bring yourself you may get on at the bar to be sure where i am given to understand that gentlemen of merit occasionally marry out of their kitchens but in no other profession or you may come and live down heredown here mon dieu forever said the major with a dreary shrug as he thought with inexpressible fondness of pall mall where your mother will receive the mrs arthur that is to be with perfect kindness where the good people of the county wont visit you and where by gad sir i shall be shy of visiting you myself for im a plainspoken man and i own to you that i like to live with gentlemen for my companions where you will have to live with rumandwaterdrinking gentlemenfarmers and drag through your life the young husband of an old woman who if she doesnt quarrel with your mother will at least cost that lady her position in society and drag her down into that dubious caste into which you must inevitably fall it is no affair of mine my good sir i am not angry your downfall will not hurt me farther than that it will extinguish the hopes i had of seeing my family once more taking its place in the world it is only your mother and yourself that will be ruined and i pity you both from my soul pass the claret it is some i sent to your poor father i remember i bought it at poor lord levants sale but of course added the major smacking the wine having engaged yourself you will do what becomes you as a man of honor however fatal your promise may be however promise us on our side my boy what i set out by entreating you to grantthat there shall be nothing clandestine that you will pursue your studies that you will only visit your interesting friend at proper intervals do you write to her much pen blushed and said why yes he had written i suppose verses eh as well as prose i was a dab at verses myself i recollect when i first joined i used to write verses for the fellows in the regiment and did some pretty things in that way i was talking to my old friend general hobbler about some lines i dashed off for him in the year when we were at the cape and gad he remembered every line of them still for hed used em so often the old rogue and had actually tried em on mrs hobbler sirwho brought him sixty thousand pounds i suppose youve tried verses eh pen pen blushed again and said why yes he had written verses and does the fair one respond in poetry or prose asked the major eying his nephew with the queerest expression as much as to say o moses and green spectacles what a fool the boy is pen blushed again she had written but not in verse the young lover owned and he gave his breastpocket the benefit of a squeeze with his left arm which the major remarked according to his wont you have got the letters there i see said the old campaigner nodding at pen and pointing to his own chest which was manfully wadded with cotton by mr stultz you know you have i would give twopence to see em why said pen twiddling the stalks of the strawberries ii but this sentence never finished for pens face was so comical and embarrassed as the major watched it that the elder could contain his gravity no longer and burst into a fit of laughter in which chorus pen himself was obliged to join after a minute when he broke out fairly into a guffaw it sent them with great good humor into mrs pendenniss drawingroom she was pleased to hear them laughing in the hall as they crossed it you sly rascal said the major putting his arm gayly on pens shoulder and giving a playful push at the boys breastpocket he felt the papers crackling there sure enough the young fellow was delightedconceitedtriumphantand in one word a spoony the pair came to the teatable in the highest spirits the majors politeness was beyond expression he had never tasted such good tea and such bread was only to be had in the country he asked mrs pendennis for one of her charming songs he then made pen sing and was delighted and astonished at the beauty of the boys voice he made his nephew fetch his map and drawings and praised them as really remarkable works of talent in a young fellow he complimented him on his french pronunciation he flattered the simple boy as adroitly as ever lover flattered a mistress and when bed time came mother and son went to their several rooms perfectly enchanted with the kind major when they had reached those apartments i suppose helen took to her knees as usual and pen read over his letters before going to bed just as if he didnt know every word of them by heart already in truth there were but three of those documents and to learn their contents required no great effort of memory in no miss fotheringay presents grateful compliments to mr pendennis and in her papas name and her own begs to thank him for his most beautiful presents they will always be kept carefully and miss f and captain c will never forget the delightful evening which they passed on tuesday last no saiddear sir we shall have a small quiet party of social friends at our humble board next tuesday evening at an early tea when i shall wear the beautiful scarf which with its accompanying delightful verses i shall ever ever cherish and papa bids me say how happy he will be if you will join the feast of reason and the flow of soul in our festive little party as i am sure will be your truly grateful emily fotheringay no was somewhat more confidential and showed that matters had proceeded rather far you were odious yesterday night the letter said why did you not come to the stagedoor papa could not escort me on account of his eye he had an accident and fell down over a loose carpet on the stair on sunday night i saw you looking at miss diggle all night and you were so enchanted with lydia languish you scarcely once looked at julia i could have crushed bingley i was so angry i play ella rosenberg on friday will you come then miss diggle performsever your e f these three letters mr pen used to read at intervals during the day and night and embrace with that delight and fervor which such beautiful compositions surely warranted a thousand times at least he had kissed fondly the musky satin paper made sacred to him by the hand of emily fotheringay this was all he had in return for his passion and flames his vows and protests his rhymes and similes his wakeful nights and endless thoughts his fondness fears and folly the young wiseacre had pledged away his all for this signed his name to endless promissory notes conferring his heart upon the bearer bound himself for life and got back twopence as an equivalent for miss costigan was a young lady of such perfect good conduct and selfcommand that she never would have thought of giving more and reserved the treasures of her affection until she could transfer them lawfully at church howbeit mr pen was content with what tokens of regard he had got and mumbled over his three letters in a rapture of high spirits and went to sleep delighted with his kind old uncle from london who must evidently yield to his wishes in time and in a word in a preposterous state of contentment with himself and all the world chapter ix in which the major opens the campaign illustration let those who have a real heartfelt relish for london society and the privilege of an entree into its most select circles admit that major pendennis was a man of no ordinary generosity and affection in the sacrifice which he now made he gave up london in mayhis newspapers and his morningshis afternoons from club to club his little confidential visits to my ladies his rides in rotten row his dinners and his stall at the opera his rapid escapades to fulham or richmond on saturdays and sundays his bow from my lord duke or my lord marquis at the great london entertainments and his name in the morning post of the succeeding dayhis quieter little festivals more select secret and delightfulall these he resigned to lock himself into a lone little country house with a simple widow and a greenhorn of a son a mawkish curate and a little girl of ten years of age he made the sacrifice and it was the greater that few knew the extent of it his letters came down franked from town and he showed the invitations to helen with a sigh it was beautiful and tragical to see him refuse one party after anotherat least to those who could understand as helen didnt the melancholy grandeur of his selfdenial helen did not or only smiled at the awful pathos with which the major spoke of the court guide in general but young pen looked with great respect at the great names upon the superscriptions of his uncles letters and listened to the majors stories about the fashionable world with constant interest and sympathy the elder pendenniss rich memory was stored with thousands of these delightful tales and he poured them into pens willing ear with unfailing eloquence he knew the name and pedigree of every body in the peerage and every bodys relations my dear boy he would say with a mournful earnestness and veracity you can not begin your genealogical studies too early i wish to heavens you would read in debrett every day not so much the historical part for the pedigrees between ourselves are many of them very fabulous and there are few families that can show such a clear descent as our own as the account of family alliances and who is related to whom i have known a mans career in life blasted by ignorance on this important this allimportant subject why only last month at dinner at my lord hobanobs a young man who has lately been received among us young mr suckling author of a work i believe began to speak lightly of admiral bowsers conduct for ratting to ministers in what i must own is the most audacious manner but who do you think sate next and opposite to this mr suckling whywhy next to him was lady grampound bowsers daughter and opposite to him was lord grampound bowsers soninlaw the infatuated young man went on cutting his jokes at the admirals expense fancying that all the world was laughing with him and i leave you to imagine lady hobanobs feelingshobanobsthose of every wellbred man as the wretched intru was so exposing himself he will never dine again in southstreet i promise you that with such discourses the major entertained his nephew as he paced the terrace in front of the house for his two hours constitutional walk or as they sate together after dinner over their wine he grieved that sir francis clavering had not come down to the park to live in it since his marriage and to make a society for the neighborhood he mourned that lord eyrie was not in the country that he might take pen and present him to his lordship he has daughters the major said who knows you might have married lady emily or lady barbara trehawk but all those dreams are over my poor fellow you must lie on the bed which you have made for yourself these things to hear did young pendennis seriously incline they are not so interesting in print as when delivered orally but the majors anecdotes of the great george of the royal dukes of the statesmen beauties and fashionable ladies of the day filled young pens soul with longing and wonder and he found the conversations with his guardian which sadly bored and perplexed poor mrs pendennis for his own part never tedious it cant be said that mr pens new guide philosopher and friend discoursed him on the most elevated subjects or treated the subjects which he chose in the most elevated manner but his morality such as it was was consistent it might not perhaps tend to a mans progress in another world but it was pretty well calculated to advance his interests in this and then it must be remembered that the major never for one instant doubted that his views were the only views practicable and that his conduct was perfectly virtuous and respectable he was a man of honor in a word and had his eyes what he called open he took pity on this young greenhorn of a nephew and wanted to open his eyes too no man for instance went more regularly to church when in the country than the old bachelor it dont matter so much in town pen he said for there the women go and the men are not missed but when a gentleman is sur ses terres he must give an example to the country people and if i could turn a tune i even think i should sing the duke of saint davids whom i have the honor of knowing always sings in the country and let me tell you it has a doosed fine effect from the family pew and you are somebody down here as long as the claverings are away you are the first man in the parish and as good as any you might represent the town if you played your cards well your poor dear father would have done so had he lived so might younot if you marry a lady however amiable whom the country people wont meetwell well its a painful subject let us change it my boy but if major pendennis changed the subject once he recurred to it a score of times in the day and the moral of his discourse always was that pen was throwing himself away now it does not require much coaxing or wheedling to make a simple boy believe that he is a very fine fellow pen took his uncles counsels to heart he was glad enough we have said to listen to his elders talk the conversation of captain costigan became by no means pleasant to him and the idea of that tipsy old fatherinlaw haunted him with terror he couldnt bring that man unshaven and reeking of punch to associate with his mother even about emilyhe faltered when the pitiless guardian began to question him was she accomplished he was obliged to own no was she clever well she had a very good average intellect but he could not absolutely say she was clever come let us see some of her letters so pen confessed that he had but those three of which we have made mentionand that they were but trivial invitations or answers she is cautious enough the major said drily she is older than you my poor boy and then he apologized with the utmost frankness and humility and flung himself upon pens good feelings begging the lad to excuse a fond old uncle who had only his familys honor in viewfor arthur was ready to flame up in indignation whenever miss costigans honesty was doubted and swore that he would never have her name mentioned lightly and never never would part from her he repeated this to his uncle and his friends at home and also it must be confessed to miss fotheringay and the amiable family at chatteries with whom he still continued to spend some portion of his time miss emily was alarmed when she heard of the arrival of pens guardian and rightly conceived that the major came down with hostile intentions to herself i suppose ye intend to leave me now your grand relation has come down from town hell carry ye off and youll forget your poor emily mr arthur forget her in her presence in that of miss rouncy the columbine and millys confidential friend of the company in the presence of the captain himself pen swore he never could think of any other woman but his beloved miss fotheringay and the captain looking up at his foils which were hung as a trophy on the wall of the room where pen and he used to fence grimly said he would not advoise any man to meddle rashly with the affections of his darling child and would never believe his gallant young arthur whom he treated as his son whom he called his son would ever be guilty of conduct so revolting to every idaya of honor and humanity he went up and embraced pen after speaking he cried and wiped his eye with one large dirty hand as he clasped pen with the other arthur shuddered in that grasp and thought of his uncle at home his fatherinlaw looked unusually dirty and shabby the odor of whiskyandwater was even more decided than in common how was he to bring that man and his mother together he trembled when he thought that he had absolutely written to costigan inclosing to him a sovereign the loan of which the worthy gentleman had need saying that one day he hoped to sign himself his affectionate son arthur pendennis he was glad to get away from chatteries that day from miss rouncy the confidante from the old toping fatherinlaw from the divine emily herself o emily emily he cried inwardly as he tattled homeward on rebecca you little know what sacrifices i am making for youfor you who are always so cold so cautious so mistrustful and he thought of a character in pope to whom he had often involuntarily compared her pen never rode over to chatteries upon a certain errand but the major found out on what errand the boy had been faithful to his plan major pendennis gave his nephew no let or hindrance but somehow the constant feeling that the seniors eye was upon him an uneasy shame attendant upon that inevitable confession which the evenings conversation would be sure to elicit in the most natural simple manner made pen go less frequently to sigh away his soul at the feet of his charmer than he had been wont to do previous to his uncles arrival there was no use trying to deceive him there was no pretext of dining with smirke or reading greek plays with foker pen felt when he returned from one of his flying visits that every body knew whence he came and appeared quite guilty before his mother and guardian over their books or their game at picquet once having walked out half a mile to the fairoaks inn beyond the lodge gates to be in readiness for the competitor coach which changed horses there to take a run for chatteries a man on the roof touched his hat to the young gentleman it was his uncles man mr morgan who was going on a message for his master and had been took up at the lodge as he said and mr morgan came back by the rival too so that pen had the pleasure of that domestics company both ways nothing was said at home the lad seemed to have every decent liberty and yet he felt himself dimly watched and guarded and that there were eyes upon him even in the presence of his dulcinea in fact pens suspicions were not unfounded and his guardian had sent forth to gather all possible information regarding the lad and his interesting young friend the discreet and ingenious mr morgan a london confidential valet whose fidelity could be trusted had been to chatteries more than once and made every inquiry regarding the past history and present habits of the captain and his daughter he delicately crossexamined the waiters the ostlers and all the inmates of the bar at the george and got from them what little they knew respecting the worthy captain he was not held in very great regard there as it appeared the waiters never saw the color of his money and were warned not to furnish the poor gentleman with any liquor for which some other party was not responsible he swaggered sadly about the coffeeroom there consumed a toothpick and looked over the paper and if any friend asked him to dinner he staid morgan heard at the george of pens acquaintance with mr foker and he went over to baymouth to enter into relations with that gentlemans man but the young student was gone to a coast regatta and his servant of course traveled in charge of the dressingcase from the servants of the officers at the barracks mr morgan found that the captain had so frequently and outrageously inebriated himself there that colonel swallowtail had forbidden him the messroom the indefatigable morgan then put himself in communication with some of the inferior actors at the theater and pumped them over their cigars and punch and all agreed that costigan was poor shabby and given to debt and to drink but there was not a breath upon the reputation of miss fotheringay her fathers courage was reported to have displayed itself on more than one occasion toward persons disposed to treat his daughter with freedom she never came to the theater but with her father in his most inebriated moments that gentleman kept a watch over her finally mr morgan from his own experience added that he had been to see her hact and was uncommon delighted with the performance besides thinking her a most splendid woman mrs creed the pewopener confirmed these statements to doctor portman who examined her personally and threatened her with the terrors of the church one day after afternoon service mrs creed had nothing unfavorable to her lodger to divulge she saw nobody only one or two ladies of the theater the captain did intoxicate himself sometimes and did not always pay his rent regularly but he did when he had money or rather miss fotheringay did since the young gentleman from clavering had been and took lessons in fencing one or two more had come from the barracks sir derby oaks and his young friend mr foker which was often together and which was always driving over from baymouth in the tandem but on the occasions of the lessons miss f was very seldom present and generally came down stairs to mrs creeds own room the doctor and the major consulting together as they often did groaned in spirit over that information major pendennis openly expressed his disappointment and i believe the divine himself was illpleased at not being able to pick a hole in poor miss fotheringays reputation even about pen himself mrs creeds reports were desperately favorable whenever he come mrs creed said she always have me or one of the children with her and mrs creed marm says she if you please marm youll on no account leave the room when that young gentlemans here and manys the time ive seen him a lookin as if he wished i was away poor young man and he took to coming in servicetime when i wasnt at home of course but she always had one of the boys up if her pa wasnt at home or old mr bowser with her a teaching of her her lesson or one of the young ladies of the theayter it was all true whatever encouragements might have been given him before he avowed his passion the prudence of miss emily was prodigious after pen had declared himself and the poor fellow chafed against her hopeless reserve which maintained his ardor as it excited his anger the major surveyed the state of things with a sigh if it were but a temporary liaison the excellent man said one could bear it a young fellow must sow his wild oats and that sort of thing but a virtuous attachment is the deuce it comes from the dd romantic notions boys get from being brought up by women allow me to say major that you speak a little too like a man of the world replied the doctor nothing can be more desirable for pen than a virtuous attachment for a young lady of his own rank and with a corresponding fortunethis present infatuation of course i must deplore as sincerely as you do if i were his guardian i should command him to give it up the very means i tell you to make him marry tomorrow we have got time from him that is all and we must do our best with that i say major said the doctor at the end of the conversation in which the above subject was discussedi am not of course a playgoing manbut suppose i say we go and see her the major laughedhe had been a fortnight at fairoaks and strange to say had not thought of that well he said why not after all it is not my niece but miss fotheringay the actress and we have as good a right as any other of the public to see her if we pay our money so upon a day when it was arranged that pen was to dine at home and pass the evening with his mother the two elderly gentlemen drove over to chatteries in the doctors chaise and there like a couple of jolly bachelors dined at the george inn before proceeding to the play only two other guests were in the rooman officer of the regiment quartered at chatteries and a young gentleman whom the doctor thought he had somewhere seen they left them at their meal however and hastened to the theater it was hamlet over again shakspeare was article xl of stout old dr portmans creed to which he always made a point of testifying publicly at least once in a year we have described the play before and how those who saw miss fotheringay perform in ophelia saw precisely the same thing on one night as on another both the elderly gentlemen looked at her with extraordinary interest thinking how very much young pen was charmed with her gad said the major between his teeth as he surveyed her when she was called forward as usual and swept her courtesies to the scanty audience the young rascal has not made a bad choice the doctor applauded her loudly and loyally upon my word said he she is a very clever actress and i must say major she is endowed with very considerable personal attractions so that young officer thinks in the stagebox major pendennis answered and he pointed out to doctor portmans attention the young dragoon of the george coffeeroom who sat in the box in question and applauded with immense enthusiasm she looked extremely sweet upon him too thought the major but thats their wayand he shut up his natty operaglass and pocketed it as if he wished to see no more that night nor did the doctor of course propose to stay for the afterpiece so they rose and left the theater the doctor returning to mrs portman who was on a visit at the deanery and the major walking home full of thought toward the george where he had bespoken a bed chapter x facing the enemy illustration sauntering slowly homeward major pendennis reached the george presently and found mr morgan his faithful valet awaiting him at the door of the george inn who stopped his master as he was about to take a candle to go to bed and said with his usual air of knowing deference i think sir if you would go into the coffeeroom theres a young gentleman there as you would like to see what is mr arthur here the major said in great anger no sirbut his great friend mr foker sir lady hagnes fokers son is here sir hes been asleep in the coffeeroom since he took his dinner and has just rung for his coffee sir and i think praps you might like to git into conversation with him the valet said opening the coffeeroom door the major entered and there indeed was mr foker the only occupant of the place he was rubbing his eyes and sate before a table decorated with empty decanters and relics of dessert he had intended to go to the play too but sleep had overtaken him after a copious meal and he had flung up his legs on the bench and indulged in a nap instead of the dramatic amusement the major was meditating how to address the young man but the latter prevented him that trouble like to look at the evening paper sir said mr foker who was always communicative and affable and he took up the globe from his table and offered it to the new comer i am very much obliged to you said the major with a grateful bow and smile if i dont mistake the family likeness i have the pleasure of speaking to mr henry foker lady agnes fokers son i have the happiness to name her ladyship among my acquaintancesand you bear sir a rosherville face hullo i beg your pardon mr foker said i took youhe was going to sayi took you for a commercial gent but he stopped that phrase to whom have i the pleasure of speaking he added to a relative of a friend and schoolfellow of yoursarthur pendennis my nephew who has often spoken to me about you in terms of great regard i am major pendennis of whom you may have heard him speak may i take my sodawater at your table i have had the pleasure of sitting at your grandfathers sir you do me proud said mr foker with much courtesy and so you are arthur pendenniss uncle are you and guardian added the major hes as good a fellow as ever stepped sir said mr foker i am glad you think so and clever tooi was always a stupid chap i wasbut you see sir i know em when they are clever and like em of that sort you show your taste and your modesty too said the major i have heard arthur repeatedly speak of you and he said your talents were very good im not good at the books mr foker said wagging his headnever could manage thatpendennis couldhe used to do half the chaps versesand yetthe young gentleman broke outyou are his guardian and i hope you will pardon me for saying that i think he is what we call a flat the candid young gentleman said the major found himself on the instant in the midst of a most interesting and confidential conversation and how is arthur a flat he asked with a smile you know foker answered winking at himhe would have winked at the duke of wellington with just as little scruple for he was in that state of absence candor and fearlessness which a man sometimes possesses after drinking a couple of bottles of wineyou know arthurs a flatabout women i mean he is not the first of us my dear mr harry answered the major i have heard something of thisbut pray tell me more why sir seeits partly my fault he went to the play one nightfor you see im down here readin for my littlego during the long only i come over from baymouth pretty often in my dragwell sir we went to the play and pen was struck all of a heap with miss fotheringaycostigan her real name isan uncommon fine gal she is too and the next morning i introduced him to the general as we call her fathera regular old scampand such a boy for the whiskyandwaterand hes gone on being intimate there and hes fallen in love with herand im blessed if he hasnt proposed to her foker said slapping his hand on the table until all the dessert began to jingle what you know it too asked the major know it dont i and many more too we were talking about it at mess yesterday and chaffing derby oaksuntil he was as mad as a hatter know sir derby oaks we dined together and he went to the play we were standing at the door smoking i remember when you passed in to dinner illustration i remember sir thomas oaks his father before he was a baronet or a knight he lived in cavendishsquare and was physician to queen charlotte the young one is making the money spin i can tell you mr foker said and is sir derby oaks the major said with great delight and anxiety another soupirant another what inquired mr foker another admirer of miss fotheringay lord bless you we call him mondays wednesdays and fridays and pen tuesdays thursdays and saturdays but mind you nothing wrong no no miss f is a deal too wide awake for that major pendennis she plays one off against the other what you call two strings to her bow i think you seem tolerably wide awake too mr foker pendennis said laughing pretty well thank you sirhow are you foker replied imperturbably im not clever praps but i am rather downy and partial friends say i know whats oclock tolerably well can i tell you the time of day in any way upon my word the major answered quite delighted i think you may be of very great service to me you are a young man of the world and with such one likes to deal and as such i need not inform you that our family is by no means delighted at this absurd intrigue in which arthur is engaged i should rather think not said mr foker connection not eligible too much beer drunk on the premises no irish need apply that i take to be your meaning the major said it was exactly though in truth he did not quite understand what mr fokers meaning was and he proceeded to examine his new acquaintance regarding the amiable family into which his nephew proposed to enter and soon got from the candid witness a number of particulars regarding the house of costigan we must do mr foker the justice to say that he spoke most favorably of mr and miss costigans moral character you see said he i think the general is fond of the jovial bowl and if i wanted to be very certain of my money it isnt in his pocket id invest itbut he has always kept a watchful eye on his daughter and neither he nor she will stand any thing but whats honorable pens attentions to her are talked about in the whole company and i hear all about them from a young lady who used to be very intimate with her and with whose family i sometimes take tea in a friendly way miss rouncy says sir derby oaks has been hanging about miss fotheringay ever since his regiment has been down here but pen has come in and cut him out lately which has made the baronet so mad that he has been very near on the point of proposing too wish he would and youd see which of the two miss fotheringay would jump at i thought as much the major said you give me a great deal of pleasure mr foker i wish i could have seen you before didnt like to put in my oar replied the other dont speak till im asked when if theres no objections i speak pretty freely heard your man had been hankering about my servantdidnt know myself what was going on until miss fotheringay and miss rouncy had the row about the ostrich feathers when miss r told me every thing miss rouncy i gather was the confidante of the other confidant i believe you why shes twice as clever a girl as fotheringay and literary and that while miss foth cant do much more than read she can write said the major remembering pens breast pocket foker broke out into a sardonic he he rouncy writes her letters he said every one of em and since theyve quarreled she dont know how the deuce to get on miss rouncy is an uncommon pretty hand whereas the old one makes dreadful work of the writing and spelling when bows aint by rouncys been settin her copies latelyshe writes a beautiful hand rouncy does i suppose you know it pretty well said the major archly upon which mr foker winked at him again i would give a great deal to have a specimen of her handwriting continued major pendennis i dare say you could give me one no no that would be too bad foker replied perhaps i oughtnt to have said as much as i have miss fs writin aint so very bad i dare say only she got miss r to write the first letter and has gone on ever since but you mark my word that till they are friends again the letters will stop i hope they will never be reconciled the major said with great sincerity and i cant tell you how delighted i am to have had the good fortune of making your acquaintance you must feel my dear sir as a man of the world how fatal to my nephews prospects in life is this step which he contemplates and how eager we all must be to free him from this absurd engagement he has come out uncommon strong said mr foker i have seen his verses rouncy copied em and i said to myself when i saw em catch me writin verses to a womanthats all he has made a fool of himself as many a good fellow has before him how can we make him see his folly and cure it i am sure you will give us what aid you can in extricating a generous young man from such a pair of schemers as this father and daughter seem to be love on the ladys side is out of the question love indeed foker said if pen hadnt two thousand a year when he came of age if pen hadnt what cried out the major in astonishment two thousand a year hasnt he got two thousand a yearthe general says he has my dear friend shrieked out the major with an eagerness which this gentleman rarely showed thank youthank youi begin to see nowtwo thousand a year why his mother has but five hundred a year in the worldshe is likely to live to eighty and arthur has not a shilling but what she can allow him what he aint rich then foker asked upon my honor he has no more than what i say and you aint going to leave him any thing the major had sunk every shilling he could scrape together on annuity and of course was going to leave pen nothing but he did not tell foker this how much do you think a major on halfpay can save he asked if these people have been looking at him as a fortune they are utterly mistakenandand you have made me the happiest man in the world sir to you said mr foker politely and when they parted for the night they shook hands with the greatest cordiality the younger gentleman promising the elder not to leave chatteries without a further conversation in the morning and as the major went up to his room and mr foker smoked his cigar against the door pillars of the george pen very likely ten miles off was lying in bed kissing the letter from his emily the next morning before mr foker drove off in his drag the insinuating major had actually got a letter of miss rouncys in his own pocketbook let it be a lesson to women how they write and in very high spirits major pendennis went to call upon doctor portman at the deanery and told him what happy discoveries he had made on the previous night as they sat in confidential conversation in the deans oak breakfast parlor they could look across the lawn and see captain costigans window at which poor pen had been only too visible some three weeks since the doctor was most indignant against mrs creed the landlady for her duplicity in concealing sir derby oakss constant visits to her lodgers and threatened to excommunicate her out of the cathedral but the wary major thought that all things were for the best and having taken counsel with himself over night felt himself quite strong enough to go and face captain costigan im going to fight the dragon he said with a laugh to doctor portman and i shrive you sir and bid good fortune go with you answered the doctor perhaps he and mrs portman and miss mira as they sate with their friend the deans lady in her drawingroom looked up more than once at the enemys window to see if they could perceive any signs of the combat the major walked round according to the directions given him and soon found mrs creeds little door he passed in and as he ascended to captain costigans apartment he could hear a stamping of feet and a great shouting of ha ha within its sir derby oaks taking his fencing lesson said the child who piloted major pendennis he takes it mondays wednesdays and fridays the major knocked and at length a tall gentleman came forth with a foil and mask in one hand and a fencing glove on the other pendennis made him a deferential bow i believe i have the honor of speaking to captain costiganmy name is major pendennis the captain brought his weapon up to the salute and saidmajor the honor is moine im deloighted to see ye chapter xi negotiation illustration the major and captain costigan were old soldiers and accustomed to face the enemy so we may presume that they retained their presence of mind perfectly but the rest of the party assembled in coss sittingroom were perhaps a little flurried at pendenniss apparition miss fotheringays slow heart began to beat no doubt for her cheek flushed up with a great healthy blush as lieutenant sir derby oaks looked at her with a scowl the little crooked old man in the windowseat who had been witnessing the fencingmatch between the two gentlemen whose stamping and jumping had been such as to cause him to give up all attempts to continue writing the theater music in the copying of which he had been engaged looked up eagerly toward the new comer as the major of the wellblacked boots entered the apartment distributing the most graceful bows to every body present me daughterme friend mr bowsme gallant young pupil and friend i may call um sir derby oaks said costigan splendidly waving his hand and pointing each of these individuals to the majors attention in one moment meejor im your humble servant and to dash into the little adjoining chamber where he slept to give a twist to his lank hair with his hairbrush a wonderful and ancient piece to tear off his old stock and put on a new one which emily had constructed for him and to assume a handsome clean collar and the new coat which had been ordered upon the occasion of miss fotheringays benefit was with the still active costigan the work of a minute after him sir derby entered and presently emerged from the same apartment where he also cased himself in his little shelljacket which fitted tightly upon the young officers big person and which he and miss fotheringay and poor pen too perhaps admired prodigiously meanwhile conversation was engaged between the actress and the new comer and the usual remarks about the weather had been interchanged before costigan reentered in his new shoot as he called it i neednt apologize to ye meejor he said in his richest and most courteous manner for receiving ye in me shirtsleeves an old soldier cant be better employed than in teaching a young one the use of his sword answered the major gallantly i remember in old times hearing that you could use yours pretty well captain costigan what yeve heard of jack costigan major said the other greatly the major had indeed he had pumped his nephew concerning his new friend the irish officer and whether he had no other knowledge of the captain than what he had thus gained or whether he actually remembered him we can not say but major pendennis was a person of honor and undoubted veracity and said that he perfectly well recollected meeting mr costigan and hearing him sing at sir richard strachans table at walcheren at this information and the bland and cordial manner in which it was conveyed bows looked up entirely puzzled but we will talk of these matters another time the major continued perhaps not wishing to commit himself it is to miss fotheringay that i came to pay my respects today and he performed another bow for her so courtly and gracious that if she had been a duchess he could not have made it more handsome i had heard of your performances from my nephew madam the major said who raves about you as i believe you know pretty well but arthur is but a boy and a wild enthusiastic young fellow whose opinions one must not take au pied de la lettre and i confess i was anxious to judge for myself permit me to say your performance delighted and astonished me i have seen our best actresses and on my word i think you surpass them all you are as majestic as mrs siddons faith i always said so costigan said winking at his daughter major take a chair milly rose at this hint took an unripped satin garment off the only vacant seat and brought the latter to major pendennis with one of her finest courtesies you are as pathetic as miss oneill he continued bowing and seating himself your snatches of song reminded me of mrs jordan in her best time when we were young men captain costigan and your manner reminded me of mars did you ever see the mars miss fotheringay there was two mahers in crowstreet remarked miss emily fanny was well enough but biddy was no great things sure the major means the god of war milly my dear interposed the parent it is not that mars i meant though venus i suppose may be pardoned for thinking about him the major replied with a smile directed in full to sir derby oaks who now reentered in his shelljacket but the lady did not understand the words of which he made use nor did the compliment at all pacify sir derby who probably did not understand it either and at any rate received it with great sulkiness and stiffness scowling uneasily at miss fotheringay with an expression which seemed to ask what the deuce does this man here major pendennis was not in the least annoyed by the gentlemans illhumor on the contrary it delighted him so thought he a rival is in the field and he offered up vows that sir derby might be not only a rival but a winner too in this lovematch in which he and pen were engaged i fear i interrupted your fencing lesson but my stay in chatteries is very short and i was anxious to make myself known to my old fellowcampaigner captain costigan and to see a lady nearer who had charmed me so much from the stage i was not the only man epris last night miss fotheringay if i must call you so though your own family name is a very ancient and noble one there was a reverend friend of mine who went home in raptures with ophelia and i saw sir derby oaks fling a bouquet which no actress ever merited better i should have brought one myself had i known what i was going to see are not those the very flowers in a glass of water on the mantlepiece yonder i am very fond of flowers said miss fotheringay with a languishing ogle at sir derby oaksbut the baronet still scowled sulkily sweets to the sweetisnt that the expression of the play mr pendennis asked bent upon being goodhumored pon my life i dont know very likely it is i aint much of a literary man answered sir derby is it possible the major continued with an air of surprise you dont inherit your fathers love of letters then sir derby he was a remarkably fine scholar and i had the honor of knowing him very well indeed said the other and gave a sulky wag of his head he saved my life continued pendennis did he now cried miss fotheringay rolling her eyes first upon the major with surprise then toward sir derby with gratitudebut the latter was proof against those glances and far from appearing to be pleased that the apothecary his father should have saved major pendenniss life the young man actually looked as if he wished the event had turned the other way my father i believe was a very good doctor the young gentleman said by way of reply im not in that line myself i wish you good morning sir ive got an appointmentcos bybymiss fotheringay good morning and in spite of the young ladys imploring looks and appealing smiles the dragoon bowed stiffly out of the room and the clatter of his saber was heard as he strode down the creaking stair and the angry tones of his voice as he cursed little tom creed who was disporting in the passage and whose pegtop sir derby kicked away with an oath into the street illustration the major did not smile in the least though he had every reason to be amused monstrous handsome young man thatas fine a looking soldier as ever i saw he said to costigan a credit to the army and to human nature in general answered costigan a young man of refoined manners polite affabilitee and princely fortune his table is sumptuous hes adawrd in the regiment and he rides sixteen stone a perfect champion said the major laughing i have no doubt all the ladies admire him hes very well in spite of his weight now hes young said milly but hes no conversation hes best on horseback mr bows said on which milly replied that the baronet had ridden third in the steeplechase on his horse tareaways and the major began to comprehend that the young lady herself was not of a particular genius and to wonder how she should be so stupid and act so well costigan with irish hospitality of course pressed refreshment upon his guest and the major who was no more hungry than you are after a lord mayors dinner declared that he should like a biscuit and a glass of wine above all things as he felt quite faint from long fastingbut he knew that to receive small kindnesses flatters the donors very much and that people must needs grow well disposed toward you as they give you their hospitality some of the old madara milly love costigan said winking to his childand that lady turning to her father a glance of intelligence went out of the room and down the stair where she softly summoned her little emissary master tommy creed and giving him a piece of money ordered him to go buy a pint of madara wine at the grapes and sixpennyworth of sorted biscuits at the bakers and to return in a hurry when he might have two biscuits for himself while tommy creed was gone on this errand miss costigan sate below with mrs creed telling her landlady how mr arthur pendenniss uncle the major was above stairs a nice softspoken old gentleman that butter wouldnt melt in his mouth and how sir derby had gone out of the room in a rage of jealousy and thinking what must be done to pacify both of them she keeps the keys of the cellar major said mr costigan as the girl left the room upon my word you have a very beautiful butler answered pendennis gallantly and i dont wonder at the young fellows raving about her when we were of their age captain costigan i think plainer women would have done our business faith and ye may say that sirand lucky is the man who gets her ask me friend bob bows here whether miss fotheringays moind is not even shuparior to her person and whether she does not possess a cultiveated intellect a refoined understanding and an emiable disposition o of course said mr bows rather drily here comes hebe blushing from the cellar dont you think it is time to go to rehearsal miss hebe you will be fined if you are laterand he gave the young lady a look which intimated that they had much better leave the room and the two elders together at this order miss hebe took up her bonnet and shawl looking uncommonly pretty goodhumored and smiling and bows gathered up his roll of papers and hobbled across the room for his hat and cane must you go said the major cant you give us a few minutes more miss fotheringay before you leave us permit an old fellow to shake you by the hand and believe that i am proud to have had the honor of making your acquaintance and am most sincerely anxious to be your friend miss fotheringay made a low courtesy at the conclusion of this gallant speech and the major followed her retreating steps to the door where he squeezed her hand with the kindest and most paternal pressure bows was puzzled with this exhibition of cordiality the lads relatives cant be really wanting to marry him to her he thoughtand so they departed now for it thought major pendennis and as for mr costigan he profited instantaneously by his daughters absence to drink up the rest of the wine and tossed off one bumper after another of the madeira from the grapes with an eager shaking hand the major came up to the table and took up his glass and drained it with a jovial smack if it had been lord steynes particular and not publichouse cape he could not have appeared to relish it more capital madeira captain costigan he said where do you get it i drink the health of that charming creature in a bumper faith captain i dont wonder that the men are wild about her i never saw such eyes in my life or such a grand manner i am sure she is as intellectual as she is beautiful and i have no doubt shes as good as she is clever a good girl sira good girl sir said the delighted father and i pledge a toast to her with all my heart shall i send to theto the cellar for another pint its handy by no well indeed sir ye may say she is a good girl and the pride and glory of her fatherhonest old jack costigan the man who gets her will have a jewl to a wife sir and i drink his health sir and ye know who i mean major i am not surprised at young or old falling in love with her said the major and frankly must tell you that though i was very angry with my poor nephew arthur when i heard of the boys passionnow i have seen the lady i can pardon him any extent of it by george i should like to enter for the race myself if i wernt an old fellow and a poor one and no better man major im sure cried jack enraptured your friendship sir delights me your admiration for my girl brings tears to me eyestears sirmanlee tearsand when she leaves me humble home for your own more splendid mansion i hope shell keep a place for her poor old father poor old jack costiganthe captain suited the action to the word and his bloodshot eyes were suffused with water as he addressed the major your sentiments do you honor the other said but captain costigan i cant help smiling at one thing you have just said and whats that sir asked jack who was at a too heroic and sentimental pitch to descend from it you were speaking about our splendid mansionmy sisters house i mean i mane the park and mansion of arthur pendennis esquire of fairoaks park whom i hope to see a mimber of parliament for his native town of clavering when he is of ege to take that responsible stetion cried the captain with much dignity the major smiled as he recognized a shaft out of his own bow it was he who had set pen upon the idea of sitting in parliament for the neighboring boroughand the poor lad had evidently been bragging on the subject to costigan and the lady of his affections fairoaks park my dear sir he said do you know our history we are of excessively ancient family certainly but i began life with scarce enough money to purchase my commission and my eldest brother was a country apothecary who made every shilling he died possessed of out of his pestle and mortar i have consented to waive that objection sir said costigan majestically in consideration of the known respectability of your family curse your impudence thought the major but he only smiled and bowed the costigans too have met with misfortunes and our house of castle costigan is by no manes what it was i have known very honest men apothecaries sir and theres some in dublin that has had the honor of dining at the lord leftenants teeble you are very kind to give us the benefit of your charity the major continued but permit me to say that is not the question you spoke just now of my little nephew as heir of fairoaks park and i dont know what besides funded property ive no doubt meejor and something handsome eventually from yourself my good sir i tell you the boy is the son of a country apothecary cried out major pendennis and that when he comes of age he wont have a shilling pooh major youre laughing at me said mr costigan me young friend i make no doubt is heir to two thousand pounds a year two thousand fiddlesticks i beg your pardon my dear sir but has the boy been humbugging youit is not his habit upon my word and honor as a gentleman and an executor to my brothers will too he left little more than five hundred a year behind him and with aconomy a handsome sum of money too sir the captain answered faith ive known a man drink his clart and drive his

shilling to his son arthur are ye joking with me meejor pendennis cried jack costigan are ye thrifling with the feelings of a father and a gentleman i am telling you the honest truth said major pendennis every shilling my brother had he left to his widow with a partial reversion it is true to the boy but she is a young woman and may marry if he offends heror she may outlive him for she comes of an uncommonly longlived family and i ask you as a gentleman and a man of the world what allowance can my sister mrs pendennis make to her son out of five hundred a year which is all her fortunethat shall enable him to maintain himself and your daughter in the rank befitting such an accomplished young lady am i to understand sir that the young gentleman your nephew and whom i have fosthered and cherished as the son of me bosom is an imposther who has been thrifling with the affections of me beloved child exclaimed the general with an outbreak of wrathhave you yourself been working upon the feelings of the young mans susceptible nature to injuice him to break off an engagement and with it me adored emilys heart have a care sir how you thrifle with the honor of john costigan if i thought any mortal man meant to do so be heavens id have his blood sirwere he old or young mr costigan cried out the major mr costigan can protect his own and his daughters honor and will sir said the other look at that chest of dthrawers it contains heaps of letthers that that viper has addressed to that innocent child theres promises there sir enough to fill a bandbox with and when i have dragged the scoundthrel before the courts of law and shown up his perjury and his dishonor i have another remedy in yondther mahogany case sir which shall set me right sir with any individualye mark me words major pendenniswith any individual who has counseled your nephew to insult a soldier and a gentleman what me daughter to be jilted and me gray hairs dishonored by an apothecarys son by the laws of heaven sir i should like to see the man that shall do it i am to understand then that you threaten in the first place to publish the letters of a boy of eighteen to a woman of eightandtwenty and afterward to do me the honor of calling me out the major said still with perfect coolness you have described my intentions with perfect accuracy meejor pendennis answered the captain as he pulled his ragged whiskers over his chin well well these shall be the subjects of future arrangements but before we come to powder and ball my good sirdo have the kindness to think with yourself in what earthly way i have injured you i have told you that my nephew is dependent upon his mother who has scarcely more than five hundred a year i have my own opinion of the correctness of that assertion said the captain will you go to my sisters lawyers messrs tatham here and satisfy yourself i decline to meet those gentlemen said the captain with rather a disturbed air if it be as you say i have been athrociously deceived by some one and on that person ill be revenged is it my nephew cried the major starting up and putting on his hat did he ever tell you that his property was two thousand a year if he did im mistaken in the boy to tell lies has not been a habit in our family mr costigan and i dont think my brothers son has learned it as yet try and consider whether you have not deceived yourself or adopted extravagant reports from hearsay as for me sir you are at liberty to understand that i am not afraid of all the costigans in ireland and know quite well how to defend myself against any threats from any quarter i come here as the boys guardian to protest against a marriage most absurd and unequal that can not but bring poverty and misery with it and in preventing it i conceive i am quite as much your daughters friend who i have no doubt is an honorable young lady as the friend of my own family and prevent the marriage i will sir by every means in my power there i have said my say sir but i have not said mine major pendennisand ye shall hear more from me mr costigan said with a look of tremendous severity sdeath sir what do you mean the major asked turning round on the threshold of the door and looking the intrepid costigan in the face ye said in the coorse of conversation that ye were at the george hotel i think mr costigan said in a stately manner a friend shall wait upon ye there before ye leave town sir let him make haste mr costigan cried out the major almost beside himself with rage i wish you a good morning sir and captain costigan bowed a magnificent bow of defiance to major pendennis over the landingplace as the latter retreated down the stairs chapter xii in which a shooting match is proposed illustration early mention has been made in this history of mr garbetts principal tragedian a promising and athletic young actor of jovial habits and irregular inclinations with whom and mr costigan there was a considerable intimacy they were the chief ornaments of the convivial club held at the magpie hotel they helped each other in various bill transactions in which they had been engaged with the mutual loan of each others valuable signatures they were friends in fine although mr garbetts seldom called at costigans house being disliked by miss fotheringay of whom in her turn mrs garbetts was considerably jealous the truth is that garbetts had paid his court to miss fotheringay and been refused by her before he offered his hand to mrs g their history however forms no part of our present schemesuffice it mr garbetts was called in by captain costigan immediately after his daughter and mr bows had quitted the house as a friend proper to be consulted at the actual juncture he was a large man with a loud voice and fierce aspect who had the finest legs of the whole company and could break a poker in mere sport across his stalwart arm run tommy said mr costigan to the little messenger and fetch mr garbetts from his lodgings over the tripe shop ye know and tell em to send two glasses of whiskyandwater hot from the grapes so tommy went his way and presently mr garbetts and the whisky came captain costigan did not disclose to him the whole of the previous events of which the reader is in possession but with the aid of the spiritsandwater he composed a letter of a threatening nature to major pendenniss address in which he called upon that gentleman to offer no hindrance to the marriage projected between mr arthur pendennis and his daughter miss fotheringay and to fix an early day for its celebration or in any other case to give him the satisfaction which was usual between gentlemen of honor and should major pendennis be disinclined to this alternative the captain hinted that he would force him to accept by the use of a horsewhip which he should employ upon the majors person the precise terms of this letter we can not give for reasons which shall be specified presently but it was no doubt couched in the captains finest style and sealed elaborately with the great silver seal of the costigansthe only bit of the family plate which the captain possessed garbetts was dispatched then with this message and letter and bidding heaven bless um the general squeezed his embassadors hand and saw him depart then he took down his venerable and murderous dueling pistols with flint locks that had done the business of many a pretty fellow in dublin and having examined these and seen that they were in a satisfactory condition he brought from the drawer all pens letters and poems which he kept there and which he always read before he permitted his emily to enjoy their perusal in a score of minutes garbetts came back with an anxious and crestfallen countenance yeve seen um the captain said why yes said garbetts and when is it for asked costigan trying the lock of one of the ancient pistols and bringing it to a level with his oias he called that bloodshot orb when is what for asked mr garbetts the meeting my dear fellow you dont mean to say you mean mortal combat captain garbetts said aghast what the devil else do i mean garbettsi want to shoot that man that has trajuiced me honor or meself dthrop a victim on the sod d if i carry challenges mr garbetts replied im a family man captain and will have nothing to do with pistolstake back your letter and to the surprise and indignation of captain costigan his emissary flung the letter down with its great sprawling superscription and blotched seal ye dont mean to say ye saw um and didnt give um the letter cried out the captain in a fury i saw him but i could not have speech with him captain said mr garbetts and why the devil not asked the other there was one there i cared not to meet nor would you the tragedian answered in a sepulchral voice the minion tatham was there captain the cowardly scoundthrel roared costigan hes frightened already going to swear the peace against me ill have nothing to do with the fighting mark that the tragedian doggedly said and i wish id not seen tatham neither nor that bit of hold your tongue bob acres its my belief yere no better than a coward said captain costigan quoting sir lucius otrigger which character he had performed with credit both off and on the stage and after some more parley between the couple they separated in not very good humor their colloquy has been here condensed as the reader knows the main point upon which it turned but the latter will now see how it is impossible to give a correct account of the letter which the captain wrote to major pendennis as it was never opened at all by that gentleman when miss costigan came home from rehearsal which she did in the company of the faithful mr bows she found her father pacing up and down their apartment in a great state of agitation and in the midst of a powerful odor of spiritsandwater which as it appeared had not succeeded in pacifying his disordered mind the pendennis papers were on the table surrounding the empty goblets and now useless teaspoon which had served to hold and mix the captains liquor and his friends as emily entered he seized her in his arms and cried out prepare yourself me child me blessed child in a voice of agony and with eyes brimful of tears yere tipsy again papa miss fotheringay said pushing back her sire ye promised me ye wouldnt take spirits before dinner its to forget me sorrows me poor girl that ive taken just a drop cried the bereaved fatherits to drown me care that i drain the bowl your care takes a deal of drowning captain dear said bows mimicking his friends accent what has happened has the softspoken gentleman in the wig been vexing you the oily miscreant ill have his blood roared cos miss milly it must be premised had fled to her room out of his embrace and was taking off her bonnet and shawl there i thought he meant mischief he was so uncommon civil the other said what has he come to say o bows he has overwhellumd me the captain said theres a hellish conspiracy on foot against me poor girl and its me opinion that both them pendennises nephew and uncle is two infernal thrators and scoundthrels who should be conshumed from off the face of the earth what is it what has happened said mr bows growing rather excited costigan then told him the majors statement that the young pendennis had not two thousand nor two hundred pounds a year and expressed his fury that he should have permitted such an impostor to coax and wheedle his innocent girl and that he should have nourished such a viper in his own personal bosom i have shaken the reptile from me however said costigan and as for his uncle ill have such a revenge on that old man as shall make um rue the day he ever insulted a costigan what do you mean general said bows i mean to have his life bowshis villainous skulking life my boy and he rapped upon the battered old pistolcase in an ominous and savage manner bows had often heard him appeal to that box of death with which he proposed to sacrifice his enemies but the captain did not tell him that he had actually written and sent a challenge to major pendennis and mr bows therefore rather disregarded the pistols in the present instance at this juncture miss fotheringay returned to the common sittingroom from her private apartment looking perfectly healthy happy and unconcerned a striking and wholesome contrast to her father who was in a delirious tremor of grief anger and other agitation she brought in a pair of exwhite satin shoes with her which she proposed to rub as clean as might be with breadcrumb intending to go mad with them upon next tuesday evening in ophelia in which character she was to reappear on that night she looked at the papers on the table stopped as if she was going to ask a question but thought better of it and going to the cupboard selected an eligible piece of bread wherewith she might operate on the satin slippers and afterward coming back to the table seated herself there commodiously with the shoes and then asked her father in her honest irish brogue what have ye got them letthers and pothry and stuff of master arthurs out for pa sure ye dont want to be reading over that nonsense o emilee cried the captain that boy whom i loved as the boy of mee bosom is only a scoundthrel and a deceiver mee poor girl and he looked in the most tragical way at mr bows opposite who in his turn gazed somewhat anxiously at miss costigan he pooh sure the poor lads as simple as a schoolboy she said all them children write verses and nonsense hes been acting the part of a viper to this fireside and a traitor in this familee cried the captain i tell ye hes no better than an impostor what has the poor fellow done papa asked emily done he has deceived us in the most athrocious manner miss emilys papa said he has thrifled with your affections and outraged my own fine feelings he has represented himself as a man of property and it turruns out that he is no betther than a beggar havent i often told ye he had two thousand a year hes a pauper i tell ye miss costigan a depindent upon the bountee of his mother a good woman who may marry again whos likely to live forever and who has but five hundred a year how dar he ask ye to marry into a family which has not the means of providing for ye yeve been grossly deceived and put upon milly and its my belief his old ruffian of an uncle in a wig is in the plot against us that soft old gentleman what has he been doing papa continued emily still imperturbable costigan informed milly that when she was gone major pendennis told him in his doublefaced pall mall polite manner that young arthur had no fortune at all that the major had asked him costigan to go to the lawyers wherein he knew the scoundthrels have a bill of mine and i cant meet them the captain parenthetically remarked and see the lads fathers will and finally that an infernal swindle had been practiced upon him by the pair and that he was resolved either on a marriage or on the blood of both of them milly looked very grave and thoughtful rubbing the white satin shoes sure if hes no money theres no use marrying him papa she said sententiously why did the villain say he was a man of prawpertee asked costigan the poor fellow always said he was poor answered the girl twas you would have it he was rich papaand made me agree to take him he should have been explicit and told us his income milly answered the father a young fellow who rides a blood mare and makes presents of shawls and bracelets is an impostor if he has no moneyand as for his uncle bedad ill pull off his wig whenever i see um bows here shall take a message to him and tell him so either its a marriage or he meets me in the field like a man or i tweak um on the nose in front of his hotel or in the gravel walks of fairoaks park before all the county bedad bedad you may send somebody else with the message said bows laughing im a fiddler not a fighting man captain pooh youve no spirit sir roared the general ill be my own second if no one will stand by and see me injured and ill take my case of pistols and shoot um in the coffeeroom of the george and so poor arthur has no money sighed out miss costigan rather plaintively poor lad he was a good lad too wild and talking nonsense with his verses and pothry and that but a brave generous boy and indeed i liked himand he liked me too she added rather softly and rubbing away at the shoe why dont you marry him if you like him so mr bows said rather savagely he is not more than ten years younger than you are his mother may relent and you might go and live and have enough at fairoaks park why not go and be a lady i could go on with the fiddle and the general live on his halfpay why dont you marry him you know he likes you theres others that likes me as well bows that has no money and thats old enough miss milly said sententiously yes d it said bows with a bitter cursethat are old enough and poor enough and fools enough for any thing theres old fools and young fools too youve often said so you silly man the imperious beauty said with a conscious glance at the old gentleman if pendennis has not enough money to live upon its folly to talk about marrying him and thats the long and short of it and the boy said mr bows by jove you throw a man away like an old glove miss costigan i dont know what you mean bows said miss fotheringay placidly rubbing the second shoe if he had had half of two thousand a year that papa gave him or the half of that i would marry him but what is the good of taking on with a beggar were poor enough already theres no use in my going to live with an old lady thats testy and cross maybe and would grudge me every morsel of meat sure its near dinner time and suky not laid the cloth yet and then added miss costigan quite simply suppose there was a familywhy papa we shouldnt be as well off as we are now deed then you would not milly dear answered the father and theres an end to all the fine talk about mrs arthur pendennis of fairoaks parkthe member of parliaments lady said milly with a laugh pretty carriages and horses we should have to ridethat you were always talking about papa but its always the same if a man looked at me you fancied he was going to marry me and if he had a good coat you fancied he was as rich as crazes as croesus said mr bows well call um what ye like but its a fact now that papa has married me these eight years a score of times wasnt i to be my lady poldoody of oystherstown castle then there was the navy captain at portsmouth and the old surgeon at norwich and the methodist preacher here last year and who knows how many more well i bet a penny with all your scheming i shall die milly costigan at last so poor little arthur has no money stop and take dinner bows weve a beautiful beefsteak pudding i wonder whether she is on with sir derby oaks thought bows whose eyes and thoughts were always watching her the dodges of women beat all comprehension and i am sure she wouldnt let the lad off so easily if she had not some other scheme on hand it will have been perceived that miss fotheringay though silent in general and by no means brilliant as a conversationalist where poetry literature or the fine arts were concerned could talk freely and with good sense too in her own family circle she can not justly be called a romantic person nor were her literary acquirements great she never opened a shakspeare from the day she left the stage nor indeed understood it during all the time she adorned the boards but about a pudding a piece of needlework or her own domestic affairs she was as good a judge as could be found and not being misled by a strong imagination or a passionate temper was better enabled to keep her judgment cool when over their dinner costigan tried to convince himself and the company that the majors statement regarding pens finances was unworthy of credit and a mere ruse upon the old hypocrites part so as to induce them on their side to break off the match miss milly would not for a moment admit the possibility of deceit on the side of the adversary and pointed out clearly that it was her father who had deceived himself and not poor little pen who had tried to take them in as for that poor lad she said she pitied him with all her heart and she ate an exceedingly good dinner to the admiration of mr bows who had a remarkable regard and contempt for this woman during and after which repast the party devised upon the best means of bringing this love matter to a close as for costigan his idea of tweaking the majors nose vanished with his supply of afterdinner whiskyandwater and he was submissive to his daughter and ready for any plan on which she might decide in order to meet the crisis which she saw was at hand the captain who as long as he had a notion that he was wronged was eager to face and demolish both pen and his uncle perhaps shrank from the idea of meeting the former and asked what the juice they were to say to the lad if he remained steady to his engagement and they broke from theirs what dont you know how to throw a man over said bows ask a woman to tell you and miss fotheringay showed how this feat was to be done simply enoughnothing was more easy papa writes to arthur to know what settlements he proposes to make in the event of a marriage and asks what his means are arthur writes back and says what hes got and youll find its as the major says ill go bail then papa writes and says its not enough and the match had best be at an end and of course you inclose a parting line in which you say you will always regard him as a brother said mr bows eying her in his scornful way of course and so i shall answered miss fotheringay hes a most worthy young man im sure ill thank ye hand me the salt them filberts is beautiful and there will be no noses pulled cos my boy im sorry youre balked said mr bows dad i suppose not said cos rubbing his ownwhatll ye do about them letters and verses and pomes milly darlingye must send em back wigsby would give a hundred pound for em bows said with a sneer deed then he would said captain costigan who was easily led papa said miss milly ye wouldnt be for not sending the poor boy his letters back them letters and pomes is mine they were very long and full of all sorts of nonsense and latin and things i couldnt understand the half of indeed ive not read em all but well send em back to him when the proper time comes and going to a drawer miss fotheringay took out from it a number of the county chronicle and chatteries champion in which pen had written a copy of flaming verses celebrating her appearance in the character of imogen and putting by the leaf upon which the poem appeared for like ladies of her profession she kept the favorable printed notices of her performances she wrapped up pens letters poems passions and fancies and tied them with a piece of string neatly as she would a parcel of sugar nor was she in the least moved while performing this act what hours the boy had passed over those papers what love and longing what generous faith and manly devotionwhat watchful nights and lonely fevers might they tell of she tied them up like so much grocery and sate down and made tea afterward with a perfectly placid and contented heart while pen was yearning after her ten miles off and hugging her image to his soul chapter xiii a crisis illustration meanwhile they were wondering at fairoaks that the major had not returned dr portman and his lady on their way home to clavering stopped at helens lodgegate with a brief note for her from major pendennis in which he said he should remain at chatteries another day being anxious to have some talk with messrs tatham the lawyers whom he would meet that afternoon but no mention was made of the transaction in which the writer had been engaged during the morning indeed the note was written at the pause after the first part of the engagement and when the major had decidedly had the worst of the battle pen did not care somehow to go into the town while his uncle was there he did not like to have to fancy that his guardian might be spying at him from that abominable deans grassplat while he was making love in miss costigans drawingroom and the pleasures of a walk a delight which he was very rarely permitted to enjoy would have been spoiled if he had met the man of the polished boots on that occasion his modest love could not show in public by any outward signs except the eyes with which the poor fellow ogled and gazed violently to be sure but it was dumb in the presence of third parties and so much the better for of all the talk which takes place in this world that of lovemakers is surely to the uninitiated the most silly it is the vocabulary without the key it is the lamp without the flame let the respected reader look or think over some old loveletters that he or she has had and forgotten and try them over again how blank and meaningless they seem what glamour of infatuation was it which made that nonsense beautiful one wonders that such puling and trash could ever have made one happy and yet there were days when you kissed those silly letters with rapturelived upon six absurd lines for a week and until the reactionary period came when you were restless and miserable until you got a fresh supply of folly that is why we decline to publish any of the letters and verses which mr pen wrote at this period of his life out of mere regard for the young fellows character they are too spooney and wild young ladies ought not to be called upon to read them in cold blood bide your time young women perhaps you will get and write them on your own account soon meanwhile we will respect mr pens first outpourings and keep them tied up in the newspapers with miss fotheringays string and sealed with captain costigans great silver seal the major came away from his interview with captain costigan in a state of such concentrated fury as rendered him terrible to approach the impudent bogtrotting scamp he thought dare to threaten me dare to talk of permitting his damned costigans to marry with the pendennises send me a challenge if the fellow can get any thing in the shape of a genleman to carry it i have the greatest mind in life not to balk himpsha what would people say if i were to go out with a tipsy mountebank about a row with an actress in a barn so when the major saw dr portman who asked anxiously regarding the issue of his battle with the dragon mr pendennis did not care to inform the divine of the generals insolent behavior but stated that the affair was a very ugly and disagreeable one and that it was by no means over yet he enjoined doctor and mrs portman to say nothing about the business at fairoaks whither he contented himself with dispatching the note we have before mentioned and then he returned to his hotel where he vented his wrath upon mr morgan his valet dammin and cussin up stairs and down stairs as that gentleman observed to mr fokers man in whose company he partook of dinner in the servants room of the george the servant carried the news to his master and mr foker having finished his breakfast about this time it being two oclock in the afternoon remembered that he was anxious to know the result of the interview between his two friends and having inquired the number of the majors sittingroom went over in his brocade dressinggown and knocked for admission major pendennis had some business as he had stated respecting a lease of the widows about which he was desirous of consulting old mr tatham the lawyer who had been his brothers man of business and who had a branchoffice at clavering where he and his son attended market and other days three or four in the week this gentleman and his client were now in consultation when mr foker showed his grand dressinggown and embroidered skullcap at major pendenniss door seeing the major engaged with papers and redtape and an old man with a white head the modest youth was for drawing backand said o youre busycall again another time but mr pendennis wanted to see him and begged him with a smile to enter whereupon mr foker took off the embroidered tarboosh or fez it had been worked by the fondest of mothers and advanced bowing to the gentlemen and smiling on them graciously mr tatham had never seen so splendid an apparition before as this brocaded youth who seated himself in an arm chair spreading out his crimson skirts and looking with exceeding kindness and frankness on the other two tenants of the room you seem to like my dressinggown sir he said to mr tatham a pretty thing isnt it neat but not in the least gaudy and how do you do major pendennis sir and how does the world treat you there was that in fokers manner and appearance which would have put an inquisitor into good humor and it smoothed the wrinkles under pendenniss head of hair i have had an interview with that irishman you may speak before my friend mr tatham here who knows all the affairs of the family and it has not i own been very satisfactory he wont believe that my nephew is poor he says we are both liars he did me the honor to hint that i was a coward as i took leave and i thought when you knocked at the door that you might be the gentleman whom i expect with a challenge from mr costiganthat is how the world treats me mr foker you dont mean that irishman the actresss father cried mr tatham who was a dissenter himself and did not patronize the drama that irishman the actresss fatherthe very man have not you heard what a fool my nephew has made of himself about the girlmr tatham who never entered the walls of a theater had heard nothing and major pendennis had to recount the story of his nephews loves to the lawyer mr foker coming in with appropriate comments in his usual familiar language tatham was lost in wonder at the narrative why had not mrs pendennis married a serious man he thoughtmr tatham was a widowerand kept this unfortunate boy from perdition as for miss costigan he would say nothing her profession was sufficient to characterize her mr foker here interposed to say he had known some uncommon good people in the booths as he called the temple of the muses well it might be so mr tatham hoped sobut the father tatham knew personallya man of the worst character a winebibber and an idler in taverns and billiardrooms and a notorious insolvent i can understand the reason major he said why the fellow would not come to my office to ascertain the truth of the statements which you made himwe have a writ out against him and another disreputable fellow one of the playactors for a bill given to mr skinner of this city a most respectable grocer and wine and spirit merchant and a member of the society of friends this costigan came crying to mr skinnercrying in the shop sirand we have not proceeded against him or the other as neither were worth powder and shot it was while mr tatham was engaged in telling this story that a third knock came to the door and there entered an athletic gentleman in a shabby braided frock bearing in his hand a letter with a large blotched red seal can i have the honor of speaking with major pendennis in private he begani have a few words for your ear sir i am the bearer of a mission from my friend captain costiganbut here the man with the bass voice paused faltered and turned palehe caught sight of the red and wellremembered face of mr tatham hullo garbetts speak up cried mr foker delighted why bless my soul it is the other party to the bill said mr tatham i say sir stop i say but garbetts with a face as blank as macbeths when banquos ghost appears upon him gasped some inarticulate words and fled out of the room the majors gravity was also altogether upset and he burst out laughing so did mr foker who said by jove it was a good un so did the attorney although by profession a serious man i dont think therell be any fight major young foker said and began mimicking the tragedian if there is the old gentlemanyour name tathamvery happy to make your acquaintance mr tathammay send the bailiffs to separate the men and mr tathampromised to do so the major was by no means sorry at the ludicrous issue of the quarrel it seems to me sir he said to mr foker that you always arrive to put me into good humor nor was this the only occasion on which mr foker this day was destined to be of service to the pendennis family we have said that he had the entree of captain costigans lodgings and in the course of the afternoon he thought he would pay the general a visit and hear from his own lips what had occurred in the conversation in the morning with mr pendennis captain costigan was not at home he had received permission nay encouragement from his daughter to go to the convivial club at the magpie hotel where no doubt he was bragging at that moment of his desire to murder a certain ruffian for he was not only brave but he knew it too and liked to take out his courage and as it were give it an airing in company costigan then was absent but miss fotheringay was at home washing the teacups while mr bows sate opposite to her just done breakfast i seehow do said mr foker popping in his little funny head get out you funny little man cried miss fotheringay you mean come in answered the otherhere we are and entering the room he folded his arms and began twirling his head round and round with immense rapidity like harlequin in the pantomime when he first issues from his cocoon or envelope miss fotheringay laughed with all her heart a wink of fokers would set her off laughing when the bitterest joke bows ever made could not get a smile from her or the finest of poor pens speeches would only puzzle her at the end of the harlequinade he sank down on one knee and kissed her hand youre the drollest little man she said and gave him a great goodhumored slap pen used to tremble as he kissed her hand pen would have died of a slap these preliminaries over the three began to talk mr foker amused his companions by recounting to them the scene which he had just witnessed of the discomfiture of mr garbetts by which they learned for the first time how far the general had carried his wrath against major pendennis foker spoke strongly in favor of the majors character for veracity and honor and described him as a tiptop swell moving in the upper circle of society who would never submit to any deceitmuch more to deceive such a charming young woman as miss foth he touched delicately upon the delicate marriage question though he couldnt help showing that he held pen rather cheap in fact he had a perhaps just contempt for mr pens high flown sentimentality his own weakness as he thought not lying that way i knew it wouldnt do miss foth said he nodding his little head couldnt dodidnt like to put my hand into the bag but knew it couldnt do hes too young for you too green a deal too green and he turns out to be poor as job cant have him at no price can she mr bo indeed hes a nice poor boy said the fotheringay rather sadly poor little beggar said bows with his hands in his pockets and stealing up a queer look at miss fotheringay perhaps he thought and wondered at the way in which women play with men and coax them and win them and drop them but mr bows had not the least objection to acknowledge that he thought miss fotheringay was perfectly right in giving up mr arthur pendennis and that in his idea the match was always an absurd one and miss costigan owned that she thought so herself only she couldnt send away two thousand a year it all comes of believing papas silly stories she said faith ill choose for meself another timeand very likely the large image of lieutenant sir derby oaks entered into her mind at that instant after praising major pendennis whom miss costigan declared to be a proper gentleman entirely smelling of lavender and as neat as a pinand who was pronounced by mr bows to be the right sort of fellow though rather too much of an old buck mr foker suddenly bethought him to ask the pair to come and meet the major that very evening at dinner at his apartment at the george he agreed to dine with me and i think after theafter the little shindy this morning in which i must say the general was wrong it would look kind you knowi know the major fell in love with you miss foth he said so so she may be mrs pendennis still bows said with a sneerno thank you mr five dined sure that was at three oclock said miss costigan who had an honest appetite and i cant go without you well have lobster salad and champagne said the little monster who could not construe a line of latin or do a sum beyond the rule of three now for lobstersalad and champagne in an honorable manner miss costigan would have gone any whereand major pendennis actually found himself at seven oclock seated at a dinnertable in company with mr bows a professional fiddler and miss costigan whose father had wanted to blow his brains out a few hours before to make the happy meeting complete mr foker who knew costigans haunts dispatched stoopid to the club at the magpie where the general was in the act of singing a pathetic song and brought him off to supper to find his daughter and bows seated at the board was a surprise indeedmajor pendennis laughed and cordially held out his hand which the general officer grasped avec effusion as the french say in fact he was considerably inebriated and had already been crying over his own song before he joined the little party at the george he burst into tears more than once during the entertainment and called the major his dearest friend stoopid and mr foker walked home with him the major gallantly giving his arm to miss costigan he was received with great friendliness when he called the next day when many civilities passed between the gentlemen on taking leave he expressed his anxious desire to serve miss costigan on any occasion in which he could be useful to her and he shook hands with mr foker most cordially and gratefully and said that gentleman had done him the very greatest service all right said mr foker and they parted with mutual esteem on his return to fairoaks the next day major pendennis did not say what had happened to him on the previous night or allude to the company in which he had passed it but he engaged mr smirke to stop to dinner and any person accustomed to watch his manner might have remarked that there was something constrained in his hilarity and talkativeness and that he was unusually gracious and watchful in his communications with his nephew he gave pen an emphatic godblessyou when the lad went to bed and as they were about to part for the night he seemed as if he was going to say something to mrs pendennis but he bethought him that if he spoke he might spoil her nights rest and allowed her to sleep in peace the next morning he was down in the breakfastroom earlier than was his custom and saluted every body there with great cordiality the post used to arrive commonly about the end of this meal when john the old servant entered and discharged the bag of its letters and papers the major looked hard at pen as the lad got hisarthur blushed and put his letter down he knew the hand it was that of old costigan and he did not care to read it in public major pendennis knew the letter too he had put it into the post himself in chatteries the day before he told little laura to go away which the child did having a thorough dislike to him and as the door closed on her he took mrs pendenniss hand and giving her a look full of meaning pointed to the letter under the newspaper which pen was pretending to read will you come into the drawingroom he said i want to speak to you and she followed him wondering into the hall what is it she said nervously the affair is at an end major pendennis said he has a letter there giving him his dismissal i dictated it myself yesterday there are a few lines from the lady too bidding him farewell it is all over helen ran back to the diningroom her brother following pen had jumped at his letter the instant they were gone he was reading it with a stupefied face it stated what the major had said that mr costigan was most gratified for the kindness with which arthur had treated his daughter but that he was only now made aware of mr pendenniss pecuniary circumstances they were such that marriage was at present out of the question and considering the great disparity in the age of the two a future union was impossible under these circumstances and with the deepest regret and esteem for him mr costigan bade arthur farewell and suggested that he should cease visiting for some time at least at his house a few lines from miss costigan were inclosed she acquiesced in the decision of her papa she pointed out that she was many years older than arthur and that an engagement was not to be thought of she would always be grateful for his kindness to her and hoped to keep his friendship but at present and until the pain of the separation should be over she entreated they should not meet pen read costigans letter and its inclosure mechanically hardly knowing what was before his eyes he looked up wildly and saw his mother and uncle regarding him with sad faces helens indeed was full of tender maternal anxieties whatwhat is this pen said its some joke this is not her writing this is some servants writing whos playing these tricks upon me it comes under her fathers envelope the major said those letters you had before were not in her hand that is hers how do you know said pen very fiercely i saw her write it the uncle answered as the boy started up and his mother coming forward took his hand he put her away how came you to see her how came you between me and her what have i ever done to you that you shouldoh its not true its not truepen broke out with a wild execration she cant have done it of her own accord she cant mean it shes pledged to me who has told her lies to break her from me lies are not told in the family arthur major pendennis replied i told her the truth which was that you had no money to maintain her for her foolish father had represented you to be rich and when she knew how poor you were she withdrew at once and without any persuasion of mine she was quite right she is ten years older than you are she is perfectly unfitted to be your wife and knows it look at that handwriting and ask yourself is such a woman fitted to be the companion of your mother i will know from herself if it is true arthur said crumpling up the paper wont you take my word of honor her letters were written by a confidante of hers who writes better than she canlook here heres one from the lady to your friend mr foker you have seen her with miss costigan as whose amanuensis she actedthe major said with ever so little of a sneer and laid down a certain billet which mr foker had given to him its not that said pen burning with shame and rage i suppose what you say is true sir but ill hear it from herself arthur appealed his mother i will see her said arthur ill ask her to marry me once more i will no one shall prevent me what a woman who spells affection with one f nonsense sir be a man and remember that your mother is a lady she was never made to associate with that tipsy old swindler or his daughter be a man and forget her as she does you be a man and comfort your mother my arthur helen said going and embracing him and seeing that the pair were greatly moved major pendennis went out of the room and shut the door upon them wisely judging that they were best alone he had won a complete victory he actually had brought away pens letters in his portmanteau from chatteries having complimented mr costigan when he returned them by giving him the little promissory note which had disquieted himself and mr garbetts and for which the major settled with mr tatham pen rushed wildly off to chatteries that day but in vain attempted to see miss fotheringay for whom he left a letter inclosed to her father the inclosure was returned by mr costigan who begged that all correspondence might end and after one or two further attempts of the lads the indignant general desired that their acquaintance might cease he cut pen in the street as arthur and foker were pacing the castle walk one day they came upon emily on her fathers arm she passed without any nod of recognition foker felt poor pen trembling on his arm his uncle wanted him to travel to quit the country for a while and his mother urged him too for he was growing very ill and suffered severely but he refused and said point blank he would not go he would not obey in this instance and his mother was too fond and his uncle too wise to force him whenever miss fotheringay acted he rode over to the chatteries theater and saw her one night there were so few people in the house that the manager returned the money pen came home and went to bed at eight oclock and had a fever if this continues his mother will be going over and fetching the girl the major thought in despair as for pen he thought he should die we are not going to describe his feelings or give a dreary journal of his despair and passion have not other gentlemen been balked in love besides mr pen yes indeed but few die of the malady chapter xiv in which miss fotheringay makes a new engagement illustration within a short period of the events above narrated mr manager bingley was performing his famous character of rolla in pizarro to a house so exceedingly thin that it would appear as if the part of rolla was by no means such a favorite with the people of chatteries as it was with the accomplished actor himself scarce any body was in the theater poor pen had the boxes almost all to himself and sate there lonely with bloodshot eyes leaning over the ledge and gazing haggardly toward the scene when cora came in when she was not on the stage he saw nothing spaniards and peruvians processions and battles priests and virgins of the sun went in and out and had their talk but arthur took no note of any one of them and only saw cora whom his soul longed after he said afterward that he wondered he had not taken a pistol to shoot her so mad was he with love and rage and despair and had it not been for his mother at home to whom he did not speak about his luckless condition but whose silent sympathy and watchfulness greatly comforted the simple half heartbroken fellow who knows but he might have done something desperate and have ended his days prematurely in front of chatteries jail there he sate then miserable and gazing at her and she took no more notice of him than he did of the rest of the house the fotheringay was uncommonly handsome in a white raiment and leopard skin with a sun upon her breast and fine tawdry bracelets on her beautiful glancing arms she spouted to admiration the few words of her part and looked it still better the eyes which had overthrown pens soul rolled and gleamed as lustrous as ever but it was not to him that they were directed that night he did not know to whom or remark a couple of gentlemen in the box next to him upon whom miss fotheringays glances were perpetually shining nor had pen noticed the extraordinary change which had taken place on the stage a short time after entry of these two gentleman into the theater there were so few people in the house that the first act of the play languished entirely and there had been some question of returning the money as upon that other unfortunate night when poor pen had been driven away the actors were perfectly careless about their parts and yawned through the dialogue and talked loud to each other in the intervals even bingley was listless and mrs b in elvira spoke under her breath how came it that all of a sudden mrs bingley began to raise her voice and bellow like a bull of bashan whence was it that bingley flinging off his apathy darted about the stage and yelled like kean why did garbetts and rowkins and miss rouncy try each of them the force of their charms or graces and act and swagger and scowl and spout their very loudest at the two gentlemen in box no one was a quiet little man in black with a gray head and a jolly shrewd facethe other was in all respects a splendid and remarkable individual he was a tall and portly gentleman with a hooked nose and a profusion of curling brown hair and whiskers his coat was covered with the richest frogsbraiding and velvet he had underwaistcoats many splendid rings jeweled pins and neckchains when he took out his yellow pockethankerchief with his hand that was cased in white kids a delightful odor of musk and bergamot was shaken through the house he was evidently a personage of rank and it was at him that the little chatteries company was acting he was in a word no other than mr dolphin the great manager from london accompanied by his faithful friend and secretary mr william minns without whom he never traveled he had not been ten minutes in the theater before his august presence there was perceived by bingley and the rest and they all began to act their best and try to engage his attention even miss fotheringays dull heart which was disturbed at nothing felt perhaps a flutter when she came in presence of the famous london impresario she had not much to do in her part but to look handsome and stand in picturesque attitudes encircling her child and she did this work to admiration in vain the various actors tried to win the favor of the great stage sultan pizaro never got a hand from him bingley yelled and mrs bingley bellowed and the manager only took snuff out of his great gold box it was only in the last scene when rolla comes in staggering with the infant bingley is not so strong as he was and his fourth son master talma bingley is a monstrous large child for his agewhen rolla comes staggering with the child to cora who rushes forward with a shriek and sayso god theres blood upon himthat the london manager clapped his hands and broke out with an enthusiastic bravo then having concluded his applause mr dolphin gave his secretary a slap on the shoulder and said by jove billy shell do who taught her that dodge said old billy who was a sardonic old gentlemani remember her at the olympic and hang me if she could say bo to a goose it was little mr bows in the orchestra who had taught her the dodge in question all the company heard the applause and as the curtain went down came round her and congratulated and hated miss fotheringay now mr dolphins appearance in the remote little chatteries theater may be accounted for in this manner in spite of all his exertions and the perpetual blazes of triumph coruscations of talent victories of good old english comedy which his play bills advertised his theater which if you please and to injure no present susceptibilities and vested interests we shall call the museum theater by no means prospered and the famous impresario found himself on the verge of ruin the great hubbard had acted legitimate drama for twenty nights and failed to remunerate any body but himself the celebrated mr and mrs cawdor had come out in mr rawheads tragedy and in their favorite round of pieces and had not attracted the public herr garbages lions and tigers had drawn for a little time until one of the animals had bitten a piece out of the herrs shoulder when the lord chamberlain interfered and put a stop to this species of performance and the grand lyrical drama though brought out with unexampled splendor and success with monsieur poumons as first tenor and an enormous orchestra had almost crushed poor dolphin in its triumphant progress so that great as his genius and resources were they seemed to be at an end he was dragging on his season wretchedly with half salaries small operas feeble old comedies and his ballet company and every body was looking out for the day when he should appear in the gazette one of the illustrious patrons of the museum theater and occupant of the great prosceniumbox was a gentleman whose name has been mentioned in a previous history that refined patron of the arts and enlightened lover of music and the drama the most noble the marquis of steyne his lordships avocations as a statesman prevented him from attending the playhouse very often or coming very early but he occasionally appeared at the theater in time for the ballet and was always received with the greatest respect by the manager from whom he sometimes condescended to receive a visit in his box it communicated with the stage and when any thing occurred there which particularly pleased him when a new face made its appearance among the coryphees or a fair dancer executed a pas with especial grace or agility mr wenham mr wagg or some other aiddecamp of the noble marquis would be commissioned to go behind the scenes and express the great mans approbation or make the inquiries which were prompted by his lordships curiosity or his interest in the dramatic art he could not be seen by the audience for lord steyne sate modestly behind a curtain and looked only toward the stagebut you could know he was in the house by the glances which all the corpsdeballet and all the principal dancers cast toward his box i have seen many scores of pairs of eyes as in the palm dance in the ballet of cook at otaheite where no less than a hundredandtwenty lovely female savages in palm leaves and feather aprons were made to dance round floridor as captain cook ogling that box as they performed before it and have often wondered to remark the presence of mind of mademoiselle sautarelle or mademoiselle de bondi known as la petite caoutchouc who when actually up in the air quivering like so many shuttlecocks always kept their lovely eyes winking at that box in which the great steyne sate now and then you would hear a harsh voice from behind the curtain cry brava brava or a pair of white gloves wave from it and begin to applaud bondi or sauterelle when they came down to earth courtesied and smiled especially to those hands before they walked up the stage again panting and happy one night this great prince surrounded by a few choice friends was in his box at the museum and they were making such a noise and laughter that the pit was scandalized and many indignant voices were bawling out silence so loudly that wagg wondered the police did not interfere to take the rascals out wenham was amusing the party in the box with extracts from a private letter which he had received from major pendennis whose absence in the country at the full london season had been remarked and of course deplored by his friends the secret is out said mr wenham theres a woman in the case why d it wenham hes your age said the gentleman behind the curtain pour les ames bien nees lamour ne compte pas le nombre des annees said mr wenham with a gallant air for my part i hope to be a victim till i die and to break my heart every year of my life the meaning of which sentence was my lord you need not talk im three years younger than you and twice as well conserve wenham you affect me said the great man with one of his usual oaths by you do i like to see a fellow preserving all the illusions of youth up to our time of lifeand keeping his heart warm as yours is hang it sirits a comfort to meet with such a generous candid creaturewhos that gal in the second row with blue ribbons third from the stagefine gal yes you and i are sentimentalists wagg i dont think so much caresits the stomach rather more than the heart with you eh wagg my boy i like every thing thats good said mr wagg generously beauty and burgundy venus and venison i dont say that venuss turtles are to be despised because they dont cook them at the london tavern butbut tell us about old pendennis mr wenham he abruptly concludedfor his joke flagged just then as he saw that his patron was not listening in fact steynes glasses were up and he was examining some object on the stage yes ive heard that joke about venuss turtles and the london tavern beforeyou begin to fail my poor wagg if you dont mind i shall be obliged to have a new jester lord steyne said laying down his glass go on wenham about old pendennis dear wenhamhe begins mr wenham readas you have had my character in your hands for the last three weeks and no doubt have torn me to shreds according to your custom i think you can afford to be goodhumored by way of variety and to do me a service it is a delicate matter entre nous une affaire de coeur there is a young friend of mine who is gone wild about a certain miss fotheringay an actress at the theater here and i must own to you as handsome a woman and as it appears to me as good an actress as ever put on rouge she does ophelia lady teazle mrs hallerthat sort of thing upon my word she is as splendid as georges in her best days and as far as i know utterly superior to any thing we have on our scene i want a london engagement for her cant you get your friend dolphin to come and see herto engage herto take her out of this place a word from a noble friend of ours you understand would be invaluable and if you could get the gaunt house interest for mei will promise any thing i can in return for your servicewhich i shall consider as one of the greatest that can be done to me do do this now as a good fellow which i always said you were and in return command yours truly a pendennis its a clear case said mr wenham having read this letter old pendennis is in love and wants to get the woman up to londonevidently continued mr wagg i should like to see pendennis on his knees with the rheumatism said mr wenham or accommodating the beloved object with a lock of his hair said wagg stuff said the great man he has relations in the country hasnt he he said something about a nephew whose interest could return a member it is the nephews affair depend on it the young one is in a scrape i was myselfwhen i was in the fifth form at etona marketgardeners daughterand swore id marry her i was mad about herpoor pollyhere he made a pause and perhaps the past rose up to lord steyne and george gaunt was a boy again not altogether lostbut i say she must be a fine woman from pendenniss account have in dolphin and let us hear if he knows any thing of her at this wenham sprang out of the box passed the servitor who waited at the door communicating with the stage and who saluted mr wenham with profound respect and the latter emissary pushing on and familiar with the place had no difficulty in finding out the manager who was employed as he not unfrequently was in swearing and cursing the ladies of the corpsdeballet for not doing their duty illustration the oaths died away on mr dolphins lips as soon as he saw mr wenham and he drew off the hand which was clenched in the face of one of the offending coryphees to grasp that of the new comer how do mr wenham hows his lordship tonight looks uncommonly well said the manager smiling as if he had never been out of temper in his life and he was only too delighted to follow lord steynes embassador and pay his personal respects to that great man the visit to chatteries was the result of their conversation and mr dolphin wrote to his lordship from that place and did himself the honor to inform the marquess of steyne that he had seen the lady about whom his lordship had spoken that he was as much struck by her talents as he was by her personal appearance and that he had made an engagement with miss fotheringay who would soon have the honor of appearing before a london audience and his noble and enlightened patron the marquess of steyne pen read the announcement of miss fotheringays engagement in the chatteries paper where he had so often praised her charms the editor made very handsome mention of her talent and beauty and prophesied her success in the metropolis bingley the manager began to advertise the last night of miss fotheringays engagement poor pen and sir derby oaks were very constant at the play sir derby in the stagebox throwing bouquets and getting glancespen in the almost deserted boxes haggard wretched and lonely nobody cared whether miss fotheringay was going or staying except those twoand perhaps one more which was mr bows of the orchestra he came out of his place one night and went into the house to the box where pen was and he held out his hand to him and asked him to come and walk they walked down the street together and went and sate upon chatteries bridge in the moonlight and talked about her we may sit on the same bridge said he we have been in the same boat for a long time you are not the only man who has made a fool of himself about that woman and i have less excuse than you because im older and know her better she has no more heart than the stone you are leaning on and it or you or i might fall into the water and never come up again and she wouldnt care yesshe would care for me because she wants me to teach her and she wont be able to get on without me and will be forced to send for me from london but she wouldnt if she didnt want me she has no heart and no head and no sense and no feelings and no griefs or cares whatever i was going to say no pleasuresbut the fact is she does like her dinner and she is pleased when people admire her and you do said pen interested out of himself and wondering at the crabbed homely little old man its a habit like taking snuff or drinking drams said the other ive been taking her these five years and cant do without her it was i made her if she doesnt send for me i shall follow her but i know shell send for me she wants me same day shell marry and fling me over as i do the end of this cigar the little flaming spark dropped into the water below and disappeared and pen as he rode home that night actually thought about somebody but himself chapter xv the happy village illustration until the enemy had retired altogether from before the place major pendennis was resolved to keep his garrison in fairoaks he did not appear to watch pens behavior or to put any restraint on his nephews actions but he managed nevertheless to keep the lad constantly under his eye or those of his agents and young arthurs comings and goings were quite well known to his vigilant guardian i suppose there is scarcely any man who reads this or any other novel but has been balked in love sometime or other by fate and circumstance by the falsehood of woman or his own fault let that worthy friend recall his own sensations under the circumstances and apply them as illustrative of mr pens anguish ah what weary nights and sickening fevers ah what mad desires dashing up against some rock of obstruction or indifference and flung back again from the unimpressionable granite if a list could be made this very night in london of the groans thoughts imprecations of tossing lovers what a catalogue it would be i wonder what a per centage of the male population of the metropolis will be lying awake at two or three oclock tomorrow morning counting the hours as they go by knelling drearily and rolling from left to right restless yearning and heartsick what a pang it is i never knew a man die of love certainly but i have known a twelve stone man go down to nine stone five under a disappointed passion so that pretty nearly a quarter of him may be said to have perished and that is no small portion he has come back to his old size subsequently perhaps is bigger than ever very likely some new affection has closed round his heart and ribs and made them comfortable and young pen is a man who will console himself like the rest of us we say this lest the ladies should be disposed to deplore him prematurely or be seriously uneasy with regard to his complaint his mother was but what will not a maternal fondness fear or invent depend on it my dear creature major pendennis would say gallantly to her the boy will recover as soon as we get her out of the country we will take him somewhere and show him a little life meantime make yourself easy about him half a fellows pangs at losing a woman result from vanity more than affection to be left by a woman is the deuce and all to be sure but look how easily we leave em mrs pendennis did not know this sort of knowledge had by no means come within the simple ladys scope indeed she did not like the subject or to talk of it her heart had had its own little private misadventure and she had borne up against it and cured it and perhaps she had not much patience with other folks passions except of course arthurs whose sufferings she made her own feeling indeed very likely in many of the boys illnesses and pains a great deal more than pen himself endured and she watched him through this present grief with a jealous silent sympathy although as we have said he did not talk to her of his unfortunate condition the major must be allowed to have had not a little merit and forbearance and to have exhibited a highly creditable degree of family affection the life at fairoaks was uncommonly dull to a man who had the entree of half the houses in london and was in the habit of making his bow in three or four drawingrooms of a night a dinner with doctor portman or a neighboring squire now and then a dreary rubber at backgammon with the widow who did her utmost to amuse him these were the chief of his pleasures he used to long for the arrival of the bag with the letters and he read every word of the evening paper he doctored himself too assiduouslya course of quiet living would suit him well he thought after the london banquets he dressed himself laboriously every morning and afternoon he took regular exercise up and down the terrace walk thus with his cane his toilet his medicinechest his backgammonbox and his newspaper this worthy and worldly philosopher fenced himself against ennui and if he did not improve each shining hour like the bees by the widows garden wall major pendennis made one hour after another pass as he could and rendered his captivity just tolerable after this period it was remarked that he was fond of bringing round the conversation to the american war the massacre of wyoming and the brilliant actions of saint lucie the fact being that he had a couple of volumes of the annual register in his bedroom which he sedulously studied it is thus a wellregulated man will accommodate himself to circumstances and show himself calmly superior to fortune pen sometimes took the box at backgammon of a night or would listen to his mothers simple music of summer eveningsbut he was very restless and wretched in spite of all and has been known to be up before the early daylight even and down at a carppond in clavering park a dreary pool with innumerablewhispering rushes and green alders where a milkmaid drowned herself in the baronets grandfathers time and her ghost was said to walk still but pen did not drown himself as perhaps his mother fancied might be his intention he liked to go and fish there and think and think at leisure as the float quivered in the little eddies of the pond and the fish flapped about him if he got a bite he was excited enough and in this way occasionally brought home carps tenches and eels which the major cooked in the continental fashion by this pond and under a tree which was his favorite resort pen composed a number of poems suitable to his circumstancesover which verses he blushed in after days wondering how he could ever have invented such rubbish and as for the tree why it is in a hollow of this very tree where he used to put his tin box of groundbait and other fishing commodities that he afterwardbut we are advancing matters suffice it to say he wrote poems and relieved himself very much when a mans grief or passion is at this point it may be loud but it is not very severe when a gentleman is cudgeling his brain to find any rhyme for sorrow beside borrow and tomorrow his woes are nearer at an end than he thinks for so were pens he had his hot and cold fits his days of sullenness and peevishness and of blank resignation and despondency and occasional mad paroxysms of rage and longing in which fits rebecca would be saddled and galloped fiercely about the country or into chatteries her rider gesticulating wildly on her back and astonishing carters and turnpikemen as he passed crying out the name of the false one mr foker became a very frequent and welcome visitor at fairoaks during this period where his good spirits and oddities always amused the major and pendennis while they astonished the widow and little laura not a little his tandem made a great sensation in clavering marketplace where he upset a market stall and cut mrs pybuss poodle over the shaven quarters and drank a glass of raspberry bitters at the clavering arms all the society in the little place heard who he was and looked out his name in their peerages he was so young and their books so old that his name did not appear in many of their volumes and his mamma now quite an antiquated lady figured among the progeny of the earl of rosherville as lady agnes milton still but his name wealth and honorable lineage were speedily known about clavering where you may be sure that poor pens little transaction with the chatteries actress was also pretty freely discussed looking at the little old town of clavering st mary from the london road as it runs by the lodge at fairoaks and seeing the rapid and shining brawl winding down from the town and skirting the woods of clavering park and the ancient church tower and peaked roofs of the houses rising up among trees and old walls behind which swells a fair background of sunshiny hills that stretch from clavering westward toward the seathe place looks so cheery and comfortable that many a travelers heart must have yearned toward it from the coachtop and he must have thought that it was in such a calm friendly nook he would like to shelter at the end of lifes struggle tom smith who used to drive the alacrity coach would often point to a tree near the river from which a fine view of the church and town was commanded and inform his companion on the box that artises come and take hoff the church from that there treeit was a habby once sirand indeed a pretty view it is which i recommend to mr stanfield or mr roberts for their next tour like constantinople seen from the bosphorus like mrs rougemont viewed in her box from the opposite side of the house like many an object which we pursue in life and admire before we have attained it clavering is rather prettier at a distance than it is on a closer acquaintance the town so cheerful of aspect a few furlongs off looks very blank and dreary except on market days there is nobody in the streets the clack of a pair of pattens echoes through half the place and you may hear the creaking of the rusty old ensign at the clavering arms without being disturbed by any other noise there has not been a ball in the assembly rooms since the clavering volunteers gave one to their colonel the old sir francis clavering and the stables which once held a great part of that brilliant but defunct regiment are now cheerless and empty except on thursdays when the farmers put up there and their tilted carts and gigs make a feeble show of liveliness in the place or on petty sessions when the magistrates attend in what used to be the old cardroom on the south side of the market rises up the church with its great gray towers of which the sun illuminates the delicate carving deepening the shadows of the huge buttresses and gilding the glittering windows and flaming vanes the image of the patroness of the church was wrenched out of the porch centuries ago such of the statues of saints as were within reach of stones and hammer at that period of pious demolition are maimed and headless and of those who were out of fire only doctor portman knows the names and history for his curate smirke is not much of an antiquarian and mr simcoe husband of the honorable mrs simcoe incumbent and architect of the chapel of ease in the lower town thinks them the abomination of desolation the rectory is a stout broadshouldered brick house of the reign of anne it communicates with the church and market by different gates and stands at the opening of yewtree lane where the grammar school rev wapshot is yewtree cottage miss flather the butchers slaughteringhouse an old barn or brewhouse of the abbey times and the misses finucanes establishment for young ladies the two schools had their pews in the loft on each side of the organ until the abbey church getting rather empty through the falling off of the congregation who were inveigled to the heresyshop in the lower town the doctor induced the misses finucane to bring their pretty little flock down stairs and the young ladies bonnets make a tolerable show in the rather vacant aisles nobody is in the great pew of the clavering family except the statues of defunct baronets and their ladies there is sir poyntz clavering knight and baronet kneeling in a square beard opposite his wife in a ruff a very fat lady the dame rebecca clavering in altorelievo is borne up to heaven by two little blueveined angels who seem to have a severe taskand so forth how well in after life pen remembered those effigies and how often in youth he scanned them as the doctor was grumbling the sermon from the pulpit and smirkes mild head and forehead curl peered over the great prayerbook in the desk the fairoaks folks were constant at the old church their servants had a pew so had the doctors so had wapshots and those of misses finucanes establishment three maids and a very nice looking young man in a livery the wapshot family were numerous and faithful glanders and his children regularly came to church so did one of the apothecaries mrs pybus went turn and turn about to the low town church and to the abbey the charity school and their families of course came wapshots boys made a good cheerful noise scuffling with their feet as they marched into church and up the organloft stair and blowing their noses a good deal during the service to be brief the congregation looked as decent as might be in these bad times the abbey church was furnished with a magnificent screen and many hatchments and heraldic tombstones the doctor spent a great part of his income in beautifying his darling place he had endowed it with a superb painted window bought in the netherlands and an organ grand enough for a cathedral but in spite of organ and window in consequence of the latter very likely which had come out of a papistical place of worship and was blazoned all over with idolatry clavering new church prospered scandalously in the teeth of orthodoxy and many of the doctors congregation deserted to mr simcoe and the honorable woman his wife their efforts had thinned the very ebenezer hard by them which building before simcoes advent used to be so full that you could see the backs of the congregation squeezing out of the arched windows thereof mr simcoes tracts fluttered into the doors of all the doctors cottages and were taken as greedily as honest mrs portmans soup with the quality of which the graceless people found fault with the folks at the ribbon factory situated by the weir on the brawl side and round which the low town had grown orthodoxy could make no way at all quiet miss myra was put out of court by impetuous mrs simcoe and her female aidsdecamp ah it was a hard burthen for the doctors lady to bear to behold her husbands congregation dwindling away to give the precedence on the few occasions when they met to a notorious lowchurchmans wife who was the daughter of an irish peer to know that there was a party in clavering their own town of clavering on which her doctor spent a great deal more than his professional income who held him up to odium because he played a rubber at whist and pronounced him to be a heathen because he went to the play in her grief she besought him to give up the play and the rubberindeed they could scarcely get a table now so dreadful was the outcry against the sportbut the doctor declared that he would do what he thought right and what the great and good george the third did whose chaplain he had been and as for giving up whist because those silly folks cried out against it he would play dummy to the end of his days with his wife and myra rather than yield to their despicable persecutions of the two families owners of the factory which had spoiled the brawl as a troutstream and brought all the mischief into the town the senior partner mr rolt went to ebenezer the junior mr barker to the new church in a word people quarreled in this little place a great deal more than neighbors do in london and in the book club which the prudent and conciliating pendennis had set up and which ought to have been a neutral territory they bickered so much that nobody scarcely was ever seen in the reading room except smirke who though he kept up a faint amity with the simcoe faction had still a taste for magazines and light worldly literature and old glanders whose white head and grizzly mustache might be seen at the window and of course little mrs pybus who looked at every bodys letters as the post brought them for the clavering reading room as every one knows used to be held at bakers library londonstreet formerly hog lane and read every advertisement in the paper it may be imagined how great a sensation was created in this amiable little community when the news reached it of mr pens lovepassages at chatteries it was carried from house to house and formed the subject of talk at highchurch lowchurch and nochurch tables it was canvassed by the misses finucane and their teachers and very likely debated by the young ladies in the dormitories for what we know wapshots big boys had their version of the story and eyed pen curiously as he sate in his pew at church or raised the finger of scorn at him as he passed through chatteries they always hated him and called him lord pendennis because he did not wear corduroys as they did and rode a horse and gave himself the airs of a buck and if the truth must be told it was mrs portman herself who was the chief narrator of the story of pens loves whatever tales this candid woman heard she was sure to impart them to her neighbors and after she had been put into possession of pens secret by the little scandal at chatteries poor doctor portman knew that it would next day be about the parish of which he was the rector and so indeed it was the whole society there had the legendat the news room at the milliners at the shoeshop and the general warehouse at the corner of the market at mrs pybuss at the glanderss at the honorable mrs simcoes soiree at the factory nay through the mill itself the tale was current in a few hours and young arthur pendenniss madness was in every mouth all doctor portmans acquaintances barked out upon him when he walked the street the next day the poor divine knew that his betsy was the author of the rumor and groaned in spirit well wellit must have come in a day or two and it was as well that the town should have the real story what the clavering folks thought of mrs pendennis for spoiling her son and of that precocious young rascal of an arthur for daring to propose to a playactress need not be told here if pride exists among any folks in our country and assuredly we have enough of it there is no pride more deepseated than that of twopenny old gentlewomen in small towns gracious goodness the cry was how infatuated the mother is about that pert and headstrong boy who gives himself the airs of a lord on his bloodhorse and for whom our society is not good enough and who would marry an odious painted actress off a booth where very likely he wants to rant himself if dear good mr pendennis had been alive this scandal would never have happened no more it would very likely nor should we have been occupied in narrating pens history it was true that he gave himself airs to the clavering folks naturally haughty and frank their cackle and small talk and small dignities bored him and he showed a contempt which he could not conceal the doctor and the curate were the only people pen cared for in the placeeven mrs portman shared in the general distrust of him and of his mother the widow who kept herself aloof from the village society and was sneered at accordingly because she tried forsooth to keep her head up with the great county families she indeed mrs barker at the factory has four times the butchers meat that goes up to fairoaks with all their fine airs c c c let the reader fill up these details according to his liking and experience of village scandal they will suffice to show how it was that a good woman occupied solely in doing her duty to her neighbor and her children and an honest brave lad impetuous and full of good and wishing well to every mortal alive found enemies and detractors among people to whom they were superior and to whom they had never done any thing like harm the clavering curs were yelping all round the house of fairoaks and delighted to pull pen down doctor portman and smirke were both cautious of informing the widow of the constant outbreak of calumny which was pursuing poor pen though glanders who was a friend of the house kept him au courant it may be imagined what his indignation was was there any man in the village whom he could call to account presently some wags began to chalk up fotheringay forever and other sarcastic allusions to late transactions at fairoaks gate another brought a large playbill from chatteries and wafered it there one night on one occasion pen riding through the lower town fancied he heard the factory boys jeer him and finally going through the doctors gate into the churchyard where some of wapshots boys were lounging the biggest of them a young gentleman about twenty years of age son of a neighboring small squire who lived in the doubtful capacity of parlor boarder with mr wapshot flung himself into a theatrical attitude near a newlymade grave and began repeating hamlets verses over ophelia with a hideous leer at pen the young fellow was so enraged that he rushed at hobnell major with a shriek very much resembling an oath cut him furiously across the face with the ridingwhip which he carried flung it away calling upon the cowardly villain to defend himself and in another minute knocked the bewildered young ruffian into the grave which was just waiting for a different lodger then with his fists clenched and his face quivering with passion and indignation he roared out to mr hobnells gaping companions to know if any of the blackguards would come on but they held back with a growl and retreated as doctor portman came up to his wicket and mr hobnell with his nose and lip bleeding piteously emerged from the grave pen looking death and defiance at the lads who retreated toward their side of the churchyard walked back again through the doctors wicket and was interrogated by that gentleman the young fellow was so agitated he could scarcely speak his voice broke into a sob as he answered the coward insulted me sir he said and the doctor passed over the oath and respected the emotion of the honest suffering young heart pendennis the elder who like a real man of the world had a proper and constant dread of the opinion of his neighbor was prodigiously annoyed by the absurd little tempest which was blowing in chatteries and tossing about master pens reputation doctor portman and captain glanders had to support the charges of the whole chatteries society against the young reprobate who was looked upon as a monster of crime pen did not say any thing about the churchyard scuffle at home but went over to baymouth and took counsel with his friend harry foker esq who drove over his drag presently to the clavering arms whence he sent stoopid with a note to thomas hobnell esq at the rev j wapshots and a civil message to ask when he should wait upon that gentleman stoopid brought back word that the note had been opened by mr hobnell and read to halfadozen of the big boys on whom it seemed to make a great impression and that after consulting together and laughing mr hobnell said he would send an answer arter arternoon school which the bell was a ringing and mr wapshot he came out in his masters gownd stoopid was learned in academical costume having attended mr foker at st boniface mr foker went out to see the curiosities of clavering meanwhile but not having a taste for architecture doctor portmans fine church did not engage his attention much and he pronounced the tower to be as moldy as an old stilton cheese he walked down the street and looked at the few shops there he saw captain glanders at the window of the readingroom and having taken a good stare at that gentleman he wagged his head at him in token of satisfaction he inquired the price of meat at the butchers with an air of the greatest interest and asked when was next killing day he flattened his little nose against madam fribsbys window to see if haply there was a pretty workwoman in her premises but there was no face more comely than the dolls or dummys wearing the french cap in the window only that of madame fribsby herself dimly visible in the parlor reading a novel that object was not of sufficient interest to keep mr foker very long in contemplation and so having exhausted the town and the inn stables in which there were no cattle save the single old pair of posters that earned a scanty livelihood by transporting the gentry round about to the county dinners mr foker was giving himself up to ennui entirely when a messenger from mr hobnell was at length announced illustration it was no other than mr wapshot himself who came with an air of great indignation and holding pens missive in his hand asked mr foker how dared he bring such an unchristian message as a challenge to a boy of his school in fact pen had written a note to his adversary of the day before telling him that if after the chastisement which his insolence richly deserved he felt inclined to ask the reparation which was usually given among gentlemen mr arthur pendenniss friend mr henry foker was empowered to make any arrangements for the satisfaction of mr hobnell and so he sent you with the answerdid he sir mr foker said surveying the schoolmaster in his black coat and clerical costume if he had accepted this wicked challenge i should have flogged him mr wapshot said and gave mr foker a glance which seemed to say and i should like very much to flog you too uncommon kind of you sir im sure said pens emissary i told my principal that i didnt think the other man would fight he continued with a great air of dignity he prefers being flogged to fighting sir i dare say may i offer you any refreshment mr i havent the advantage of your name my name is wapshot sir and i am master of the grammar school of this town sir cried the other and i want no refreshment sir i thank you and have no desire to make your acquaintance sir i didnt seek yours sir im sure replied mr foker in affairs of this sort you see i think it is a pity that the clergy should be called in but theres no accounting for tastes sir i think its a pity that boys should talk about committing murder sir as lightly as you do roared the schoolmaster and if i had you in my school i dare say you would teach me better sir mr foker said with a bow thank you sir ive finished my education sir and aint a going back to school sirwhen i do ill remember your kind offer sir john show this gentleman down stairsand of course as mr hobnell likes being thrashed we can have no objection sir and we shall be very happy to accommodate him whenever he comes our way and with this the young fellow bowed the elder gentleman out of the room and sate down and wrote a note off to pen in which he informed the latter that mr hobnell was not disposed to fight and proposed to put up with the caning which pen had administered to him chapter xvi more storms in the puddle illustration pens conduct in this business of course was soon made public and angered his friend doctor portman not a little while it only amused major pendennis as for the good mrs pendennis she was almost distracted when she heard of the squabble and of pens unchristian behavior all sorts of wretchedness discomfort crime annoyance seemed to come out of this transaction in which the luckless boy had engaged and she longed more than ever to see him out of chatteries for a whileany where removed from the woman who had brought him into so much trouble pen when remonstrated with by this fond parent and angrily rebuked by the doctor for his violence and ferocious intentions took the matter au grand serieux with the happy conceit and gravity of youth said that he himself was very sorry for the affair that the insult had come upon him without the slightest provocation on his part that he would permit no man to insult him upon this head without vindicating his own honor and appealing with great dignity to his uncle asked whether he could have acted otherwise as a gentleman than as he did in resenting the outrage offered to him and in offering satisfaction to the person chastised vous allez trop vite my good sir said the uncle rather puzzled for he had been indoctrinating his nephew with some of his own notions upon the point of honoroldworld notions savoring of the camp and pistol a great deal more than our soberer opinions of the present daybetween men of the world i dont say but between two schoolboys this sort of thing is ridiculous my dear boyperfectly ridiculous it is extremely wicked and unlike my son said mrs pendennis with tears in her eyes and bewildered with the obstinacy of the boy pen kissed her and said with great pomposity women dear mother dont understand these mattersi put myself into fokers handsi had no other course to pursue major pendennis grinned and shrugged his shoulders the young ones were certainly making great progress he thought mrs pendennis declared that that foker was a wicked horrid little wretch and was sure that he would lead her dear boy into mischief if pen went to the same college with him i have a great mind not to let him go at all she said and only that she remembered that the lads father had always destined him for the college in which he had had his own brief education very likely the fond mother would have put a veto upon his going to the university that he was to go and at the next october term had been arranged between all the authorities who presided over the lads welfare foker had promised to introduce him to the right set and major pendennis laid great store upon pens introduction into college life and society by this admirable young gentleman mr foker knows the very best young men now at the university the major said and pen will form acquaintances there who will be of the greatest advantage through life to him the young marquis of plinlimmon is there eldest son of the duke of saint davidslord magnus charters is there lord runnymedes son and a first cousin of mr foker lady runnymede my dear was lady agatha milton you of course remember lady agnes will certainly invite him to logwood and far from being alarmed at his intimacy with her son who is a singular and humorous but most prudent and amiable young man to whom i am sure we are under every obligation for his admirable conduct in the affair of the fotheringay marriage i look upon it as one of the very luckiest things which could have happened to pen that he should have formed an intimacy with this most amusing young gentleman helen sighed she supposed the major knew best mr foker had been very kind in the wretched business with miss costigan certainly and she was grateful to him but she could not feel otherwise than a dim presentiment of evil and all these quarrels and riots and worldliness scared her about the fate of her boy doctor portman was decidedly of opinion that pen should go to college he hoped the lad would read and have a moderate indulgence of the best society too he was of opinion that pen would distinguish himself smirke spoke very highly of his proficiency the doctor himself had heard him construe and thought he acquitted himself remarkably well that he should go out of chatteries was a great point at any rate and pen who was distracted from his private grief by the various rows and troubles which had risen round about him gloomily said he would obey there were assizes races and the entertainments and the flux of company consequent upon them at chatteries during a part of the months of august and september and miss fotheringay still continued to act and take farewell of the audiences at the chatteries theater during that time nobody seemed to be particularly affected by her presence or her announced departure except those persons whom we have named nor could the polite county folks who had houses in london and very likely admired the fotheringay prodigiously in the capital when they had been taught to do so by the fashion which set in in her favor find any thing remarkable in the actress performing on the little chatteries boards many a genius and many a quack for that matter has met with a similar fate before and since miss costigans time this honest woman meanwhile bore up against the public neglect and any other crosses or vexations which she might have in life with her usual equanimity and ate drank acted slept with that regularity and comfort which belongs to people of her temperament what a deal of grief care and other harmful excitement does a healthy dullness and cheerful insensibility avoid nor do i mean to say that virtue is not virtue because it is never tempted to go astray only that dullness is a much finer gift than we give it credit for being and that some people are very lucky whom nature has endowed with a good store of that great anodyne pen used to go drearily in and out from the play at chatteries during this season and pretty much according to his fancy his proceedings tortured his mother not a little and her anxiety would have led her often to interfere had not the major constantly checked and at the same time encouraged her for the wily man of the world fancied he saw that a favorable turn had occurred in pens malady it was the violent efflux of versification among other symptoms which gave pens guardian and physician satisfaction he might be heard spouting verses in the shrubbery walks or muttering them between his teeth as he sat with the home party of evenings one day prowling about the house in pens absence the major found a great book full of verses in the lads study they were in english and in latin quotations from the classic authors were given in the scholastic manner in the footnotes he cant be very bad wisely thought the pall mall philosopher and he made pens mother remark not perhaps without a secret feeling of disappointment for she loved romance like other soft women that the young gentleman during the last fortnight came home quite hungry to dinner at night and also showed a very decent appetite at the breakfast table in the morning gad i wish i could said the major thinking ruefully of his dinner pills the boy begins to sleep well depend upon that it was cruel but it was true having no other soul to confide infor he could not speak to his mother of his loves and disappointmentshis uncle treated them in a scornful and worldly tone which though carefully guarded and polite yet jarred greatly on the feelings of mr penand foker was much too coarse to appreciate those refined sentimental secretsthe lads friendship for the curate redoubled or rather he was never tired of having smirke for a listener on that one subject what is a lover without a confidant pen employed mr smirke as corydon does the elmtree to cut out his mistresss name upon he made him echo with the name of the beautiful amaryllis when men have left off playing the tune they do not care much for the pipe but pen thought he had a great friendship for smirke because he could sigh out his loves and griefs into his tutors ears and smirke had his own reasons for always being ready at the lads call pens affection gushed out in a multitude of sonnets to the friend of his heart as he styled the curate which the other received with great sympathy he plied smirke with latin sapphics and alcaics the lovesongs multiplied under his fluent pen and smirke declared and believed that they were beautiful on the other hand pen expressed a boundless gratitude to think that heaven should have sent him such a friend at such a moment he presented his tutor with his best bound books and his gold guard chain and wanted him to take his doublebarreled gun he went into chatteries and got a gold pencilcase on credit for he had no money and indeed was still in debt to smirke for some of the fotheringay presents which he presented to smirke with an inscription indicative of his unalterable and eternal regard for the curate who of course was pleased with every mark of the boys attachment the poor curate was naturally very much dismayed at the contemplated departure of his pupil when arthur should go smirkes occupation and delight would go too what pretext could he find for a daily visit to fairoaks and that kind word or glance from the lady there which was as necessary to the curate as the frugal dinner which madam fribsby served him arthur gone he would only be allowed to make visits like any other acquaintance little laura could not accommodate him by learning the catechism more than once a week he had curled himself like ivy round fairoaks he pined at the thought that he must lose his hold of the place should he speak his mind and go down on his knees to the widow he thought over any indications in her behavior which flattered his hopes she had praised his sermon three weeks before she had thanked him exceedingly for his present of a melon for a small dinner party which mrs pendennis gave she said she should always be grateful to him for his kindness to arthur and when he declared that there were no bounds to his love and affection for that dear boy she had certainly replied in a romantic manner indicating her own strong gratitude and regard to all her sons friends should he speak outor should he delay if he spoke and she refused him it was awful to think that the gate of fairoaks might be shut upon him foreverand within that door lay all the world for mr smirke thus oh friendly readers we see how every man in the world has his own private griefs and business by which he is more cast down or occupied than by the affairs or sorrows of any other person while mrs pendennis is disquieting herself about losing her son and that anxious hold she has had of him as long as he has remained in the mothers nest whence he is about to take flight into the great world beyondwhile the majors great soul chafes and frets inwardly vexed as he thinks what great parties are going on in london and that he might be sunning himself in the glances of dukes and duchesses but for those cursed affairs which keep him in a wretched little country holewhile pen is tossing between his passion and a more agreeable sensation unacknowledged yet but swaying him considerably namely his longing to see the worldmr smirke has a private care watching at his bed side and sitting behind him on his pony and is no more satisfied than the rest of us how lonely we are in the world how selfish and secret every body you and your wife have pressed the same pillow for forty years and fancy yourselves unitedpshaw does she cry out when you have the gout or do you lie awake when she has

dish we eat from has not the same taste to the one and the otheryou and i are but a pair of infinite isolations with some fellowislands a little more or less near to us let us return however to the solitary smirke smirke had one confidante for his passionthat most injudicious woman madame fribsby how she became madame fribsby nobody knows she had left clavering to go to a milliners in london as miss fribsbyshe pretended that she had got the rank in paris during her residence in that city but how could the french king were he ever so much disposed give her any such title we shall not inquire into this mystery however suffice to say she went away from home a bouncing young lass she returned a rather elderly character with a madonna front and a melancholy countenancebought the late mrs harbottles business for a songtook her elderly mother to live with her was very good to the poor was constant at church and had the best of characters but there was no one in all clavering not mrs portman herself who read so many novels as madame fribsby she had plenty of time for this amusement for in truth very few people besides the folks at the rectory and fairoaks employed her and by a perpetual perusal of such works which were by no means so moral or edifying in the days of which we write as they are at present she had got to be so absurdly sentimental that in her eyes life was nothing but an immense lovematch and she never could see two people together but she fancied they were dying for one another on the day after mrs pendenniss visit to the curate which we have recorded many pages back madame fribsby settled in her mind that mr smirke must be in love with the widow and did every thing in her power to encourage this passion on both sides mrs pendennis she very seldom saw indeed except in public and in her pew at church that lady had very little need of millinery or made most of her own dresses and caps but on the rare occasions when madame fribsby received visits from mrs pendennis or paid her respects at fairoaks she never failed to entertain the widow with praises of the curate pointing out what an angelical man he was how gentle how studious how lonely and she would wonder that no lady would take pity upon him helen laughed at these sentimental remarks and wondered that madame herself did not compassionate her lodger and console him madame fribsby shook her madonna front mong cure a boco souffare she said laying her hand on the part she designated as her cure il est more en espang madame she said with a sigh she was proud of her intimacy with the french language and spoke it with more volubility than correctness mrs pendennis did not care to penetrate the secrets of this wounded heart except to her few intimates she was a reserved and it may be a very proud woman she looked upon her sons tutor merely as an attendant on that young prince to be treated with respect as a clergyman certainly but with proper dignity as a dependent on the house of pendennis nor were madames constant allusions to the curate particularly agreeable to her it required a very ingenious sentimental turn indeed to find out that the widow had a secret regard for mr smirke to which pernicious error however madame fribsby persisted in holding her lodger was very much more willing to talk on this subject with his softhearted landlady every time after that she praised the curate to mrs pendennis she came away from the latter with the notion that the widow herself had been praising him etre soul au monde est bien ouneeyong she would say glancing up at a print of a french carbineer in a green coat and brass cuirass which decorated her apartmentdepend upon it when master pendennis goes to college his ma will find herself very lonely she is quite young yetyou wouldnt suppose her to be fiveandtwenty monsieur le cury song cure est touchyjong suis sureje conny cela biangally monsieur smirke he softly blushed he sighed he hoped he feared he doubted he sometimes yielded to the delightful ideahis pleasure was to sit in madame fribsbys apartment and talk upon the subject where as the greater part of the conversation was carried on in french by the milliner and her old mother was deaf that retired old individual who had once been a housekeeper wife and widow of a butler in the clavering family could understand scarce one syllable of their talk thus it was that when major pendennis announced to his nephews tutor that the young fellow would go to college in october and that mr smirkes valuable services would no longer be needful to his pupil for which services the major who spoke as grandly as a lord professed himself exceedingly grateful and besought mr smirke to command his interest in any waythus it was that the curate felt that the critical moment was come for him and was racked and tortured by those severe pangs which the occasion warranted madame fribsby had of course taken the strongest interest in the progress of mr pens love affair with miss fotheringay she had been over to chatteries and having seen that actress perform had pronounced that she was old and overrated and had talked over master pens passion in her shop many and many a time to the halfdozen old maids and old women in male clothes who are to be found in little country towns and who formed the genteel population of clavering captain glanders hp had pronounced that pen was going to be a devil of a fellow and had begun early mrs glanders had told him to check his horrid observations and to respect his own wife if he pleased she said it would be a lesson to helen for her pride and absurd infatuation about that boy mrs pybus said many people were proud of very small things and for her part she didnt know why an apothecarys wife should give herself such airs mrs wapshot called her daughters away from that side of the street one day when pen on rebecca was stopping at the saddlers to get a new lash to his whipone and all of these people had made visits of curiosity to fairoaks and had tried to condole with the widow or bring the subject of the fotheringay affair on the tapis and had been severally checked by the haughty reserve of mrs pendennis supported by the frigid politeness of the major her brother these rebuffs however did not put an end to the gossip and slander went on increasing about the unlucky fairoaks family glanders hp a retired cavalry officer whose halfpay and large family compelled him to fuddle himself with brandyandwater instead of claret after he quitted the dragoons had the occasional entree at fairoaks and kept his friend the major there informed of all the stories which were current at clavering mrs pybus had taken an inside place by the coach to chatteries and gone to the george on purpose to get the particulars mrs speerss man had treated mr fokers servant to drink at baymouth for a similar purpose it was said that pen had hanged himself for despair in the orchard and that his uncle had cut him down that on the contrary it was miss costigan who was jilted and not young arthur and that the affair had only been hushed up by the payment of a large sum of money the exact amount of which there were several people in clavering could testifythe sum of course varying according to the calculation of the individual narrator of the story pen shook his mane and raged like a furious lion when these scandals affecting miss costigans honor and his own came to his ears why was not pybus a man she had whiskers enough that he might call her out and shoot her seeing simcoe pass by pen glared at him so from his saddle on rebecca and clutched his whip in a manner so menacing that that clergyman went home and wrote a sermon or thought over a sermon for he delivered oral testimony at great length in which he spoke of jezebel theatrical entertainments a double cut thisfor doctor portman the rector of the old church was known to frequent such and of youth going to perdition in a manner which made it clear to every capacity that pen was the individual meant and on the road alluded to what stories more were there not against young pendennis while he sate sulking achilleslike in his tent for the loss of his ravished briseis after the affair with hobnell pen was pronounced to be a murderer as well as a profligate and his name became a name of terror and a byword in clavering but this was not all he was not the only one of the family about whom the village began to chatter and his unlucky mother was the next to become a victim to their gossip it is all settled said mrs pybus to mrs speers the boy is to go to college and then the widow is to console herself hes been there every day in the most open manner my dear continued mrs speers enough to make poor mr pendennis turn in his grave said mrs wapshot she never liked him that we know says no married him for his money every body knows that was a penniless hangeron of lady pontypools says no its rather too open though to encourage a lover under pretense of having a tutor for your son cried no hush here comes mrs portman some one said as the good rectors wife entered madame fribsbys shop to inspect her monthly book of fashions just arrived from london and the fact is that madame fribsby had been able to hold out no longer and one day after she and her lodger had been talking of pens approaching departure and the curate had gone off to give one of his last lessons to that gentleman madame fribsby had communicated to mrs pybus who happened to step in with mrs speers her strong suspicion her certainty almost that there was an attachment between a certain clerical gentleman and a certain lady whose naughty son was growing quite unmanageable and that a certain marriage would take place pretty soon mrs portman saw it all of course when the matter was mentioned what a sly fox that curate was he was lowchurch and she never liked him and to think of mrs pendennis taking a fancy to him after she had been married to such a man as mr pendennis she could hardly stay five minutes at madame fribsbys so eager was she to run to the rectory and give doctor portman the news when doctor portman heard this piece of intelligence he was in such a rage with his curate that his first movement was to break with mr smirke and to beg him to transfer his services to some other parish that milksop of a creature pretend to be worthy of such a woman as mrs pendennis broke out the doctor where will impudence stop next she is much too old for mr smirke mrs portman remarked why poor dear mrs pendennis might be his mother almost you always choose the most charitable reason betsy cried the rector a matron with a son grown upshe would never think of marrying again you only think men should marry again doctor portman answered his lady bridling up you stupid old woman said the doctor when i am gone you shall marry whomsoever you like i will leave orders in my will my dear to that effect and ill bequeath a ring to my successor and my ghost shall come and dance at your wedding it is cruel for a clergyman to talk so the lady answered with a ready whimper but these little breezes used to pass very rapidly over the surface of the doctors domestic bliss and were followed by a great calm and sunshine the doctor adopted a plan for soothing mrs portmans ruffled countenance which has a great effect when it is tried between a worthy couple who are sincerely fond of one another and which i think becomes john anderson at threescore just as much as it used to do when he was a black haired young jo of fiveandtwenty hadnt you better speak to mr smirke john mrs portman asked when pen goes to college cadit quaestio replied the rector smirkes visits at fairoaks will cease of themselves and there will be no need to bother the widow she has trouble enough on her hands with the affairs of that silly young scapegrace without being pestered by the tittletattle of this place it is all an invention of that fool fribsby against whom i always warned youyou know i did my dear john interposed mrs portman that you did you very often do my love the doctor answered with a laugh it is not from want of warning on your part i am sure that i have formed my opinion of most women with whom we are acquainted madam fribsby is a fool and fond of gossip and so are some other folks but she is good to the poor she takes care of her mother and she comes to church twice every sunday and as for smirke my dear here the doctors face assumed for one moment a comical expression which mrs portman did not perceive for she was looking out of the drawingroom window and wondering what mrs pybus could want cheapening fowls again in the market when she had had poultry from livermores two days beforeand as for mr smirke my dear betsy will you promise me that you will never breathe to any mortal what i am going to tell you as a profound secret what is it my dear johnof course i wont answered the rectors lady well theni can not say it is a fact mindbut if you find that smirke is at this momentay and has been for yearsengaged to a young lady a missa miss thompson if you will have the name who lives on clapham commonyes on clapham common not far from mrs smirkes house what becomes of your story then about smirke and mrs pendennis why did you not tell me this before asked the doctors wifehow long have you known ithow we all of us have been deceived in that man why should i meddle in other folks business my dear the doctor answered i know how to keep a secretand perhaps this is only an invention like that other absurd story at least madam portman i should never have told you this but for the other which i beg you to contradict whenever you hear it and so saying the doctor went away to his study and mrs portman seeing that the day was a remarkably fine one thought she would take advantage of the weather and pay a few visits the doctor looking out of his study window saw the wife of his bosom presently issue forth attired in her best she crossed the marketplace saluting the marketwomen right and left and giving a glance at the grocery and general emporium at the corner then entering londonstreet formerly hog lane she stopped for a minute at madame fribsbys window and looking at the fashions which hung up there seemed hesitating whether she should enter but she passed on and never stopped again until she came to mrs pybuss little green gate and garden through which she went to that ladys cottage there of course her husband lost sight of mrs portman oh what a long bow i have pulled he said inwardlygoodness forgive me and shot my own flesh and blood there must be no more tattling and scandal about that house i must stop it and speak to smirke ill ask him to dinner this very day having a sermon to compose the doctor sat down to that work and was so engaged in the composition that he had not concluded it until near five oclock in the afternoon when he stepped over to mr smirkes lodgings to put his hospitable intentions regarding that gentleman into effect he reached madame fribsbys door just as the curate issued from it mr smirke was magnificently dressed and as he turned out his toes he showed a pair of elegant openworked silk stockings and glossy pumps his white cravat was arranged in a splendid stiff tie and his gold shirt studs shone on his spotless linen his hair was curled round his fair temples had he borrowed madame fribsbys irons to give that curly grace his white cambric pocket handkerchief was scented with the most delicious eaudecologne o gracilis puercried the doctorwhither are you bound i wanted you to come home to dinner illustration i am engaged to dine atat fairoaks said mr smirke blushing faintly and whisking the scented pockethandkerchief and his pony being in waiting he mounted and rode away simpering down the street no accident befell him that day and he arrived with his tie in the very best order at mrs pendenniss house chapter xvii which concludes the first part of this history illustration the curate had gone on his daily errand to fairoaks and was upstairs in pens study pretending to read with his pupil in the early part of that very afternoon when mrs portman after transacting business with mrs pybus had found the weather so exceedingly fine that she pursued her walk as far as fairoaks in order to pay a visit to her dear friend there in the course of their conversation the rectors lady told mrs pendennis and the major a very great secret about the curate mr smirke which was no less than that he had an attachment a very old attachment which he had long kept quite private and on whom is it that mr smirke has bestowed his heart asked mrs pendennis with a superb air but rather an inward alarm why my dear the other lady answered when he first came and used to dine at the rectory people said we wanted him for myra and we were forced to give up asking him then they used to say he was smitten in another quarter but i always contradicted it for my part and said that you that i cried mrs pendennis people are very impertinent i am sure mr smirke came here as arthurs tutor and i am surprised that any body should dare to speak so pon my soul it is a little too much the major said laying down the newspaper and the double eyeglass ive no patience with that mrs pybus helen continued indignantly i told her there was no truth in it mrs portman said i always said so my dear and now it comes out that my demure gentleman has been engaged to a young ladymiss thompson of clapham common ever so long and i am delighted for my part and on myras account too for an unmarried curate is always objectionable about ones house and of course it is strictly private but i thought i would tell you as it might remove unpleasantnesses but mind not one word if you please about the story mrs pendennis said with perfect sincerity that she was exceedingly glad to hear the news and hoped mr smirke who was a very kind and amiable man would have a deserving wife and when her visitor went away helen and her brother talked of the matter with great satisfaction the kind lady rebuking herself for her haughty behavior to mr smirke whom she had avoided of late instead of being grateful to him for his constant attention to arthur gratitude to this kind of people the major said is very well but familiarity is out of the question this gentleman gives his lessons and receives his money like any other master you are too humble my good soul there must be distinctions in ranks and that sort of thing i told you before you were too kind to mr smirke but helen did not think so and now that arthur was going away and she bethought her how very polite mr smirke had been how he had gone on messages for her how he had brought books and copied music how he had taught laura so many things and given her so many kind presents her heart smote her on account of her ingratitude toward the curateso much so that when he came down from study with pen and was hankering about the hall previous to his departure she went out and shook hands with him with rather a blushing face and begged him to come into her drawingroom where she said they now never saw him and as there was to be rather a good dinner that day she invited mr smirke to partake of it and we may be sure that he was too happy to accept such a delightful summons eased by the above report of all her former doubts and misgivings regarding the curate helen was exceedingly kind and gracious to mr smirke during dinner redoubling her attentions perhaps because major pendennis was very high and reserved with his nephews tutor when pendennis asked smirke to drink wine he addressed him as if he was a sovereign speaking to a petty retainer in a manner so condescending that even pen laughed at it although quite ready for his part to be as conceited as most young men are but smirke did not care for the impertinences of the major so long as he had his hostesss kind behavior and he passed a delightful time by her side at table exerting all his powers of conversation to please her talking in a manner both clerical and worldly about the fancy bazaar and the great missionary meeting about the last new novel and the bishops excellent sermonabout the fashionable parties in london an account of which he read in the newspapersin fine he neglected no art by which a college divine who has both sprightly and serious talents a taste for the genteel an irreproachable conduct and a susceptible heart will try and make himself agreeable to the person on whom he has fixed his affections major pendennis came yawning out of the diningroom very soon after his sister and little laura had left the apartmentwhat an unsufferable bore that man is and how he did talk the major said he has been very good to arthur who is very fond of him mrs pendennis saidi wonder who the miss thompson is whom he is going to marry i always thought the fellow was looking in another direction said the major and in what asked mrs pendennis quite innocentlytoward myra portman toward helen pendennis if you must know answered her brotherinlaw toward me impossible helen said who knew perfectly well that such had been the case his marriage will be a very happy thing i hope arthur will not take too much wine now arthur flushed with a good deal of pride at the privilege of having the keys of the cellar and remembering that a very few more dinners would probably take place which he and his dear friend smirke could share had brought up a liberal supply of claret for the companys drinking and when the elders with little laura left him he and the curate began to pass the wine very freely one bottle speedly yielded up the ghost another shed more than half its blood before the two topers had been much more than half an hour togetherpen with a hollow laugh and voice had drunk off one bumper to the falsehood of women and had said sardonically that wine at any rate was a mistress who never deceived and was sure to give a man a welcome smirke gently said that he knew for his part some women who were all truth and tenderness and casting up his eyes toward the ceiling and heaving a sigh as if evoking some being dear and unmentionable he took up his glass and drained it and the rosy liquor began to suffuse his face pen trolled over some verses he had been making that morning in which he informed himself that the woman who had slighted his passion could not be worthy to win it that he was awaking from loves mad fever and of course under these circumstances proceeded to leave her and to quit a heartless deceiver that a name which had one day been famous in the land might again be heard in it and that though he never should be the happy and careless boy he was but a few months since or his heart be what it had been ere passion had filled it and grief had wellnigh killed it that though to him personally death was as welcome as life and that he would not hesitate to part with the latter but for the love of one kind being whose happiness depended on his ownyet he hoped to show he was a man worthy of his race and that one day the false one should be brought to know how great was the treasure and noble the heart which she had flung away pen we say who was a very excitable person rolled out these verses in his rich sweet voice which trembled with emotion while our young poet spoke he had a trick of blushing when in this excited state and his large and honest gray eyes also exhibited proofs of a sensibility so genuine hearty and manly that miss costigan if she had a heart must needs have softened toward him and very likely she was as he said altogether unworthy of the affection which he lavished upon her the sentimental smirke was caught by the emotion which agitated his young friend he grasped pens hand over the dessert dishes and wine glasses he said the verses were beautiful that pen was a poet a great poet and likely by heavens permission to run a great career in the world go on and prosper dear arthur he cried the wounds under which at present you suffer are only temporary and the very grief you endure will cleanse and strengthen your heart i have always prophesied the greatest and brightest things of you as soon as you have corrected some failings and weaknesses of character which at present belong to you but you will get over these my boy you will get over these and when you are famous and celebrated as i know you will be will you remember your old tutor and the happy early days of your youth pen swore he would with another shake of the hand across the glasses and apricots i shall never forget how kind you have been to me smirke he said i dont know what i should have done without you you are my best friend am i really arthur said smirke looking through his spectacles and his heart began to beat so that he thought pen must almost hear it throbbing my best friend my friend forever pen said god bless you old boy and he drank up the last glass of the second bottle of the famous wine which his father had laid in which his uncle had bought which lord levant had imported and which now like a slave indifferent was ministering pleasure to its present owner and giving its young master delectation well have another bottle old boy pen said by jove we will hurrayclaret goes for nothing my uncle was telling me that he saw sheridan drink five bottles at brookess besides a bottle of maraschino this is some of the finest wine in england he says so it is by jove theres nothing like it nunc vino pellite curascras ingens iterabimus aeqfill your glass old smirke a hogshead of it wont do you any harm and mr pen began to sing the drinking song out of der freischuetz the diningroom windows were open and his mother was softly pacing on the lawn outside while little laura was looking at the sunset the sweet fresh notes of the boys voice came to the widow it cheered her kind heart to hear him sing youyou are taking too much wine arthur mr smirke said softlyyou are exciting yourself no said pen women give headaches but this dont fill your glass old fellow and lets drinki say smirke my boylets drink to heryour her i mean not mine for whom i swear ill care no moreno not a pennyno not a figno not a glass of wine tell us about the lady smirke ive often seen you sighing about her oh said smirkeand his beautiful cambric shirt front and glistening studs heaved with the emotion which agitated his gentle and suffering bosom ohwhat a sigh pen cried growing very hilarious fill my boy and drink the toast you cant refuse a toast no gentleman refuses a toast heres her health and good luck to you and may she soon be mrs smirke do you say so smirke said all of a tremble do you really say so arthur say so of course i say so down with it heres mrs smirkes good health hip hip hurray smirke convulsively gulped down his glass of wine and pen waved his over his head cheering so as to make his mother and laura wonder on the lawn and his uncle who was dozing over the paper in the drawingroom start and say to himself that boys drinking too much smirke put down the glass i accept the omen gasped out the blushing curate oh my dear arthur youyou know her whatmyra portman i wish you joy shes got a devlish large waist but i wish you joy old fellow oh arthur groaned the curate again and nodded his head speechless beg your pardonsorry i offended youbut she has got a large waist you knowdevilish large waist pen continuedthe third bottle evidently beginning to act upon the young gentleman its not miss portman the other said in a voice of agony is it any body at chatteries or at clapham somebody here noit aint old pybus it cant be miss rolt at the factoryshes only fourteen its somebody rather older than i am pen the curate cried looking up at his friend and then guiltily casting his eyes down into his plate pen burst out laughing its madame fribsby by jove its madame fribsby madame frib by the immortal gods the curate could contain no more o pen he cried how can you suppose that any of thoseof those more than ordinary beings you have named could have an influence upon this heart when i have been daily in the habit of contemplating perfection i may be insane i may be madly ambitious i may be presumptuousbut for two years my heart has been filled by one image and has known no other idol havent i loved you as a son arthursay hasnt charles smirke loved you as a son yes old boy youve been very good to me pen said whose liking however for his tutor was not by any means of the filial kind my means rushed on smirke are at present limited i own and my mother is not so liberal as might be desired but what she has will be mine at her death were she to hear of my marrying a lady of rank and good fortune my mother would be liberal i am sure she would be liberal whatever i have or subsequently inheritand its five hundred a year at the very leastwould be settled upon her andandand you at my deaththat is what the deuce do you meanand what have i to do with your money cried out pen in a puzzle arthur arthur exclaimed the other wildly you say i am your dearest friendlet me be more oh cant you see that the angelic being i lovethe purest the best of womenis no other than your dear dear angel of a mother my mother cried out arthur jumping up and sober in a minute pooh damn it smirke you must be madshes seven or eight years older than you are did you find that any objection cried smirke piteously and alluding of course to the elderly subject of pens own passion the lad felt the hint and blushed quite red the cases are not similar smirke he said and the allusion might have been spared a man may forget his own rank and elevate any woman to it but allow me to say our positions are very different how do you mean dear arthur the curate interposed sadly cowering as he felt that his sentence was about to be read mean said arthur i mean what i say my tutor i say my tutor has no right to ask a lady of my mothers rank of life to marry him its a breach of confidence i say its a liberty you take smirkeits a liberty mean indeed oh arthur the curate began to cry with clasped hands and a scared face but arthur gave another stamp with his foot and began to pull at the bell dont lets have any more of this well have some coffee if you please he said with a majestic air and the old butler entering at the summons arthur bade him to serve that refreshment john said he had just carried coffee into the drawingroom where his uncle was asking for master arthur and the old man gave a glance of wonder at the three empty claretbottles smirke said he thought hedhed rather not go into the drawingroom on which arthur haughtily said as you please and called for mr smirkes horse to be brought round the poor fellow said he knew the way to the stable and would get his pony himself and he went into the hall and sadly put on his coat and hat pen followed him out uncovered helen was still walking up and down the soft lawn as the sun was setting and the curate took off his hat and bowed by way of farewell and passed on to the door leading to the stablecourt by which the pair disappeared smirke knew the way to the stables as he said well enough he fumbled at the girths of the saddle which pen fastened for him and put on the bridle and led the pony into the yard the boy was touched by the grief which appeared in the others face as he mounted pen held out his hand and smirke wrung it silently i say smirke he said in an agitated voice forgive me if i have said any thing harshfor you have always been very very kind to me but it cant be old fellow it cant be be a man god bless you smirke nodded his head silently and rode out of the lodge gate and pen looked after him for a couple of minutes until he disappeared down the road and the clatter of the ponys hoofs died away helen was still lingering in the lawn waiting until the boy came backshe put his hair off his forehead and kissed it fondly she was afraid he had been drinking too much wine why had mr smirke gone away without any tea he looked at her with a kind humor beaming in his eyes smirke is unwell he said with a laugh for a long while helen had not seen the boy looking so cheerful he put his arm round her waist and walked her up and down the walk in front of the house laura began to drub on the drawingroom window and nod and laugh from it come along you two people cried out major pendennis your coffee is getting quite cold when laura was gone to bed pen who was big with his secret burst out with it and described the dismal but ludicrous scene which had occurred helen heard of it with many blushes which became her pale face very well and a perplexity which arthur roguishly enjoyed confound the fellows impudence major pendennis said as he took his candle where will the assurance of these people stop pen and his mother had a long talk that night full of love confidence and laughter and the boy somehow slept more soundly and woke up more easily than he had done for many months before before the great mr dolphin quitted chatteries he not only made an advantageous engagement with miss fotheringay but he liberally left with her a sum of money to pay off any debts which the little family might have contracted during their stay in the place and which mainly through the ladys own economy and management were not considerable the small account with the spirit merchant which major pendennis had settled was the chief of captain costigans debts and though the captain at one time talked about repaying every farthing of the money it never appears that he executed his menace nor did the laws of honor in the least call upon him to accomplish that threat when miss costigan had seen all the outstanding bills paid to the uttermost shilling she handed over the balance to her father who broke out into hospitalities to all his friends gave the little creeds more apples and gingerbread than he had ever bestowed upon them so that the widow creed ever after held the memory of her lodger in veneration and the young ones wept bitterly when he went away and in a word managed the money so cleverly that it was entirely expended before many days and that he was compelled to draw upon mr dolphin for a sum to pay for traveling expenses when the time of their departure arrived there was held at an inn in that county town a weekly meeting of a festive almost a riotous character of a society of gentlemen who called themselves the buccaneers some of the choice spirits of chatteries belonged to this cheerful club graves the apothecary than whom a better fellow never put a pipe in his mouth and smoked it smart the talented and humorous portraitpainter of highstreet croker an excellent auctioneer and the uncompromising hicks the able editor for twentythree years of the county chronicle and chatteries champion were among the crew of the buccaneers whom also bingley the manager liked to join of a saturday evening whenever he received permission from his lady costigan had been also an occasional buccaneer but a want of punctuality of payments had of late somewhat excluded him from the society where he was subject to disagreeable remarks from the landlord who said that a buccaneer who didnt pay his shot was utterly unworthy to be a marine bandit but when it became known to the ears as the clubbists called themselves familiarly that miss fotheringay had made a splendid engagement a great revolution of feeling took place in the club regarding captain costigan solly mine host of the grapes and i need not say as worthy a fellow as ever stood behind a bar told the gents in the buccaneers room one night how noble the captain had beayved having been round and paid off all his ticks in chatteries including his score of three pound fourteen here and pronounced that cos was a good feller a gentleman at bottom and he solly had always said so and finally worked upon the feelings of the buccaneers to give the captain a dinner the banquet took place on the last night of costigans stay in chatteries and was served in sollys accustomed manner as good a plain dinner of old english fare as ever smoked on a table was prepared by mrs solly and about eighteen gentlemen sate down to the festive board mr jubber the eminent draper of highstreet was in the chair having this distinguished guest of the club on his right the able and consistent hicks officiated as croupier on the occasion most of the gentlemen of the club were present and h foker esq and spavin esq friends of captain costigan were also participators in the entertainment the cloth having been drawn the chairman said costigan there is wine if you like but the captain preferring punch that liquor was voted by acclamation and non nobis having been sung in admirable style by messrs bingley hicks and bullby of the cathedral choir than whom a more jovial spirit neer tossed off a bumper or emptied a bowl the chairman gave the health of the king which was drunk with the loyalty of chatteries men and then without further circumlocution proposed their friend captain costigan after the enthusiastic cheering which rang through old chatteries had subsided captain costigan rose in reply and made a speech of twenty minutes in which he was repeatedly overcome by his emotions illustration the gallant captain said he must be pardoned for incoherence if his heart was too full to speak he was quitting a city celebrated for its antiquitee its hospitalitee the beautee of its women the manly fidelitee generositee and jovialitee of its men cheers he was going from that ancient and venerable city of which while mimoree held her sayt he should never think without the fondest emotion to a methrawpolis where the talents of his daughther were about to have full play and where he would watch over her like a guardian angel he should never forget that it was at chatteries she had acquired the skill which she was about to exercise in another sphere and in her name and his own jack costigan thanked and blessed them the gallant officers speech was received with tremendous cheers mr hicks croupier in a brilliant and energetic manner proposed miss fotheringays health captain costigan returned thanks in a speech full of feeling and eloquence mr jubber proposed the drama and the chatteries theater and mr bingley was about to rise but was prevented by captain costigan who as long connected with the chatteries theater and on behalf of his daughter thanked the company he informed them that he had been in garrison at gibraltar and at malta and had been at the taking of flushing the duke of york was a patron of the drama he had the honor of dining with his royal highness and the duke of kent many times and the former had justly been named the friend of the soldier cheers the army was then proposed and captain costigan returned thanks in the course of the night he sang his well known songs the deserter the shan van voght the little pig under the bed and the vale of avoca the evening was a great triumph for himit ended all triumphs and all evenings end and the next day miss costigan having taken leave of all her friends and having been reconciled to miss rouncy to whom she left a necklace and a white satin gownthe next day he and miss costigan had places in the competitor coach rolling by the gates of fairoaks lodgeand pendennis never saw them tom smith the coachman pointed out fairoaks to mr costigan who sate on the box smelling of rumandwaterand the captain said it was a poor placeand added ye should see castle costigan county mayo me boywhich tom said he should like very much to see they were gone and pen had never seen them he only knew of their departure by its announcement in the county paper the next day and straight galloped over to chatteries to hear the truth of this news they were gone indeed a card of lodgings to let was placed in the dear little familiar window he rushed up into the room and viewed it over he sate ever so long in the old windowseat looking into the deans garden whence he and emily had so often looked out together he walked with a sort of terror into her little empty bedroom it was swept out and prepared for new comers the glass which had reflected her fair face was shining ready for her successor the curtains lay square folded on the little bed he flung himself down and buried his head on the vacant pillow laura had netted a purse into which his mother had put some sovereigns and pen had found it on his dressingtable that very morning he gave one to the little servant who had been used to wait upon the costigans and another to the children because they said they were very fond of her it was but a few months back yet what years ago it seemed since he had first entered that room he felt that it was all done the very missing her at the coach had something fatal in it blank weary utterly wretched and lonely the poor lad felt his mother saw she was gone by his look when he came home he was eager to fly too now as were other folks round about chatteries poor smirke wanted to go away from the sight of the syren widow foker began to think he had had enough of baymouth and that a few supper parties at saint boniface would not be unpleasant and major pendennis longed to be off and have a little pheasantshooting at stillbrook and get rid of all annoyances and tracasseries of the village the widow and laura nervously set about the preparation for pens kit and filled trunks with his books and linen helen wrote cards with the name of arthur pendennis esq which were duly nailed on the boxes and at which both she and laura looked with tearful wistful eyes it was not until long long after he was gone that pen remembered how constant and tender the affection of these women had been and how selfish his own conduct was a night soon comes when the mail with echoing horn and blazing lamps stops at the lodgegate of fairoaks and pens trunks and his uncles are placed on the roof of the carriage into which the pair presently afterward enter helen and laura are standing by the evergreens of the shrubbery their figures lighted up by the coach lamps the guard cries all right in another instant the carriage whirls onward the lights disappear and helens heart and prayers go with them her sainted benedictions follow the departing boy he has left the homenest in which he has been chafing and whither after his very first flight he returned bleeding and wounded he is eager to go forth again and try his restless wings how lonely the house looks without him the corded trunks and bookboxes are there in his empty study laura asks leave to come and sleep in helens room and when she has cried herself to sleep there the mother goes softly into pens vacant chamber and kneels down by the bed on which the moon is shining and there prays for her boy as mothers only know how to plead he knows that her pure blessings are following him as he is carried miles away chapter xviii alma mater illustration every man however brief or inglorious may have been his academical career must remember with kindness and tenderness the old university comrades and days the young mans life is just beginning the boys leadingstrings are cut and he has all the novel delights and dignities of freedom he has no idea of cares yet or of bad health or of roguery or poverty or tomorrows disappointment the play has not been acted so often as to make him tired though the afterdrink as we mechanically go on repeating it is stale and bitter how pure and brilliant was that first sparkling draught of pleasurehow the boy rushes at the cup and with what a wild eagerness he drains it but old epicures who are cut off from the delights of the table and are restricted to a poached egg and a glass of water like to see people with good appetites and as the next best thing to being amused at a pantomime ones self is to see ones children enjoy it i hope there may be no degree of age or experience to which mortal may attain when he shall become such a glum philosopher as not to be pleased by the sight of happy youth coming back a few weeks since from a brief visit to the old university of oxbridge where my friend mr arthur pendennis passed some period of his life i made the journey in the railroad by the side of a young fellow at present a student of saint boniface he had got an excat somehow and was bent on a days lark in london he never stopped rattling and talking from the commencement of the journey until its close which was a great deal too soon for me for i never was tired of listening to the honest young fellows jokes and cheery laughter and when we arrived at the terminus nothing would satisfy him but a hansom cab so that he might get into town the quicker and plunge into the pleasures awaiting him there away the young lad went whirling with joy lighting up his honest face and as for the readers humble servant having but a small carpetbag i got up on the outside of the omnibus and sate there very contentedly between a jewpedlar smoking bad cigars and a gentlemans servant taking care of a poodledog until we got our fated complement of passengers and boxes when the coachman drove leisurely away we werent in a hurry to get to town neither one of us was particularly eager about rushing into that near smoking babylon or thought of dining at the club that night or dancing at the casino yet a few years more and my young friend of the railroad will be not a whit more eager there were no railroads made when arthur pendennis went to the famous university of oxbridge but he drove thither in a well appointed coach filled inside and out with dons gownsmen young freshmen about to enter and their guardians who were conducting them to the university a fat old gentleman in gray stockings from the city who sate by major pendennis inside the coach having his palefaced son opposite was frightened beyond measure when he heard that the coach had been driven for a couple of stages by young mr foker of saint boniface college who was the friend of all men including coachmen and could drive as well as tom hicks himself pen sate on the roof examining coach passengers and country with great delight and curiosity his heart jumped with pleasure as the famous university came in view and the magnificent prospect of venerable towers and pinnacles tall elms and shining river spread before him pen had passed a few days with his uncle at the majors lodgings in burystreet before they set out for oxbridge major pendennis thought that the lads wardrobe wanted renewal and arthur was by no means averse to any plan which was to bring him new coats and waistcoats there was no end to the sacrifices which the selfdenying uncle made in the youths behalf london was awfully lonely the pall mall pavement was deserted the very red jackets had gone out of town there was scarce a face to be seen in the bow windows of the clubs the major conducted his nephew into one or two of those desert mansions and wrote down the lads name on the candidatelist of one of them and arthurs pleasure at this compliment on his guardians part was excessive he read in the parchment volume his name and titles as arthur pendennis esquire of fairoaks lodge shire and saint boniface college oxbridge proposed by major pendennis and seconded by viscount colchicum with a thrill of intense gratification you will come in for ballot in about three years by which time you will have taken your degree the guardian said pen longed for the three years to be over and surveyed the stuccohalls and vast libraries and drawing rooms as already his own property the major laughed slily to see the pompous airs of the simple young fellow as he strutted out of the building he and foker drove down in the latters cab one day to the gray friars and renewed acquaintance with some of their old comrades there the boys came crowding up to the cab as it stood by the gray friars gates where they were entering and admired the chestnut horse and the tights and livery and gravity of stoopid the tiger the bell for afternoonschool rang as they were swaggering about the play ground talking to their old cronies the awful doctor passed into school with his grammar in his hand foker slunk away uneasily at his presence but pen went up blushing and shook the dignitary by the hand he laughed as he thought that wellremembered latin grammar had boxed his ears many a time he was generous goodnatured and in a word perfectly conceited and satisfied with himself then they drove to the parental brewhouse fokers entire is composed in an enormous pile of buildings not far from the gray friars and the name of that well known firm is gilded upon innumerable publichouse signs tenanted by its vassals in the neighborhood and the venerable junior partner and manager did honor to the young lord of the vats and his friend and served them with silver flagons of brown stout so strong that you would have thought not only the young men but the very horse mr harry foker drove was affected by the potency of the drink for he rushed home to the westend of the town at a rapid pace which endangered the piestalls and the women on the crossings and brought the cabsteps into collision with the posts at the street corners and caused stoopid to swing fearfully on his board behind the major was quite pleased when pen was with his young acquaintance listened to mr fokers artless stories with the greatest interest gave the two boys a fine dinner at a covent garden coffeehouse whence they proceeded to the play but was above all happy when mr and lady agnes foker who happened to be in london requested the pleasure of major pendennis and mr arthur pendenniss company at dinner in grosvenorstreet having obtained the entree into lady agnes fokers house he said to pen with an affectionate solemnity which befitted the importance of the occasion it behoves you my dear boy to keep it you must mind and never neglect to call in grosvenorstreet when you come to london i recommend you to read up carefully in debrett the alliances and genealogy of the earls of rosherville and if you can to make some trifling allusions to the family something historical neat and complimentary and that sort of thing which you who have a poetic fancy can do pretty well mr foker himself is a worthy man though not of high extraction or indeed much education he always makes a point of having some of the family porter served round after dinner which you will on no account refuse and which i shall drink myself though all beer disagrees with me confoundedly and the heroic martyr did actually sacrifice himself as he said he would on the day when the dinner took place and old mr foker at the head of his table made his usual joke about fokers entire we should all of us i am sure have liked to see the majors grin when the worthy old gentleman made his timehonored joke lady agnes who wrapped up in harry was the fondest of mothers and one of the most goodnatured though not the wisest of women received her sons friend with great cordiality and astonished pen by accounts of the severe course of studies which her darling boy was pursuing and which she feared might injure his dear health foker the elder burst into a horselaugh at some of these speeches and the heir of the house winked his eye very knowingly at his friend and lady agnes then going through her sons history from the earliest time and recounting his miraculous sufferings in the measles and whoopingcough his escape from drowning the shocking tyrannies practiced upon him at that horrid school whither mr foker would send him because he had been brought up there himself and she never would forgive that disagreeable doctor no neverlady agnes we say having prattled away for an hour incessantly about her son voted the two messieurs pendennis most agreeable men and when the pheasants came with the second course which the major praised as the very finest birds he ever saw her ladyship said they came from logwood as the major knew perfectly well and hoped that they would both pay her a visit thereat christmas or when dear harry was at home for the vacations god bless you my dear boy pendennis said to arthur as they were lighting their candles in burystreet afterward to go to bed you made that little allusion to agincourt where one of the roshervilles distinguished himself very neatly and well although lady agnes did not quite understand it but it was exceedingly well for a beginnerthough you oughtnt to blush so by the wayand i beseech you my dear arthur to remember through life that with an entreewith a good entree mindit is just as easy for you to have good society as bad and that it costs a man when properly introduced no more trouble or soins to keep a good footing in the best houses in london than to dine with a lawyer in bedfordsquare mind this when you are at oxbridge pursuing your studies and for heavens sake be very particular in the acquaintances which you make the premier pas in life is the most important of alldid you write to your mother todaynowell do before you go and call and ask mr foker for a frankthey like itgood night god bless you pen wrote a droll account of his doings in london and the play and the visit to the old friars and the brewery and the party at mr fokers to his dearest mother who was saying her prayers at home in the lonely house at fairoaks her heart full of love and tenderness unutterable for the boy and she and laura read that letter and those which followed many many times and brooded over them as women do it was the first step in life that pen was makingah what a dangerous journey it is and how the bravest may stumble and the strongest fail brother wayfarer may you have a kind arm to support you on the path and a friendly hand to succor those who fall beside you may truth guide mercy forgive at the end and love accompany always without that lamp how blind the traveler would be and how black and cheerless the journey so the coach drove up to that ancient and comfortable inn the trencher which stands in mainstreet oxbridge and pen with delight and eagerness remarked for the first time gownsmen going about chapel bells clinking bells in oxbridge are ringing from morningtide till evensongtowers and pinnacles rising calm and stately over the gables and antique houseroofs of the homely busy city previous communications had taken place between dr portman on pens part and mr buck tutor of boniface on whose side pen was entered and as soon as major pendennis had arranged his personal appearance so that it should make a satisfactory impression upon pens tutor the pair walked down mainstreet and passed the great gate and belfrytower of saint georges college and so came as they were directed to saint boniface where again pens heart began to beat as they entered at the wicket of the venerable ivymantled gate of the college it is surmounted with an ancient dome almost covered with creepers and adorned with the effigy of the saint from whom the house takes its name and many coatsofarms of its royal and noble benefactors the porter pointed out a queer old tower at the corner of the quadrangle by which mr bucks rooms were approached and the two gentlemen walked across the square the main features of which were at once and forever stamped in pens mindthe pretty fountain playing in the center of the fair grass plats the tall chapel windows and buttresses rising to the right the hall with its tapering lantern and oriel window the lodge from the doors of which the master issued awfully in rustling silks the lines of the surrounding rooms pleasantly broken by carved chimneys gray turrets and quaint gablesall these mr pens eyes drank in with an eagerness which belongs to first impressions and major pendennis surveyed with that calmness which belongs to a gentleman who does not care for the picturesque and whose eyes have been somewhat dimmed by the constant glare of the pavement of pall mall saint georges is the great college of the university of oxbridge with its four vast quadrangles and its beautiful hall and gardens and the georgians as the men are called wear gowns of a peculiar cut and give themselves no small airs of superiority over all other young men little saint boniface is but a petty hermitage in comparison of the huge consecrated pile alongside of which it lies but considering its size it has always kept an excellent name in the university its ton is very good the best families of certain counties have time out of mind sent up their young men to saint boniface the college livings are remarkably good the fellowships easy the boniface men had had more than their fair share of university honors their boat was third upon the river their chapelchoir is not inferior to saint georges itself and the boniface ale the best in oxbridge in the comfortable old wainscoted collegehall and round about roubilliacs statue of saint boniface who stands in an attitude of seraphic benediction over the uncommonly good cheer of the fellows table there are portraits of many most eminent bonifacians there is the learned dr griddle who suffered in henry viiis time and archbishop bush who roasted himthere is lord chief justice hicksthe duke of st davids k g chancellor of the university and member of this collegesprott the poet of whose fame the college is justly prouddoctor blogg the late master and friend of doctor johnson who visited him at st bonifaceand other lawyers scholars and divines whose portraitures look from the walls or whose coatsofarms shine in emerald and ruby gold and azure in the tall windows of the refectory the venerable cook of the college is one of the best artists in oxbridge his son took the highest honors in the other university of camford and the wine in the fellows room has long been famed for its excellence and abundance into this certainly not the least snugly sheltered arbor among the groves of academe pen now found his way leaning on his uncles arm and they speedily reached mr bucks rooms and were conducted into the apartment of that courteous gentleman he had received previous information from dr portman regarding pen with respect to whose family fortune and personal merits the honest doctor had spoken with no small enthusiasm indeed portman had described arthur to the tutor as a young gentleman of some fortune and landed estate of one of the most ancient families in the kingdom and possessing such a character and genius as were sure under the proper guidance to make him a credit to the college and the university under such recommendations the tutor was of course most cordial to the young freshman and his guardian invited the latter to dine in hall where he would have the satisfaction of seeing his nephew wear his gown and eat his dinner for the first time and requested the pair to take wine at his rooms after hall and in consequence of the highly favorable report he had received of mr arthur pendennis said he should be happy to give him the best set of rooms to be had in collegea gentlemanpensioners set indeed which were just luckily vacant so they parted until dinnertime which was very near at hand and major pendennis pronounced mr buck to be uncommonly civil indeed indeed when a college magnate takes the trouble to be polite there is no man more splendidly courteous immersed in their books and excluded from the world by the gravity of their occupations these reverend men assume a solemn magnificence of compliment in which they rustle and swell as in their grand robes of state those silks and brocades are not put on for all comers or every day when the two gentlemen had taken leave of the tutor in his study and had returned to mr bucks anteroom or lectureroom a very handsome apartment turkeycarpeted and hung with excellent prints and richly framed pictures they found the tutors servant already in waiting there accompanied by a man with a bag full of caps and a number of gowns from which pen might select a cap and gown for himself and the servant no doubt would get a commission proportionable to the service done by him mr pen was all in a tremor of pleasure as the bustling tailor tried on a gown and pronounced that it was an excellent fit and then he put the pretty college cap on in rather a dandified manner and somewhat on one side as he had seen fiddicombe the youngest master at gray friars wear it and he inspected the entire costume with a great deal of satisfaction in one of the great gilt mirrors which ornamented mr bucks lectureroom for some of these college divines are no more above lookingglasses than a lady is and look to the set of their gowns and caps quite as anxiously as folks do of the lovelier sex the major smiled as he saw the boy dandifying himself in the glass the old gentleman was not displeased with the appearance of the comely lad illustration then davis the skip or attendant led the way keys in hand across the quadrangle the major and pen following him the latter blushing and pleased with his new academical habiliments across the quadrangle to the rooms which were destined for the freshman and which were vacated by the retreat of the gentlemanpensioner mr spicer the rooms were very comfortable with large cross beams high wainscots and small windows in deep embrasures mr spicers furniture was there and to be sold at a valuation and major pendennis agreed on his nephews behalf to take the available part of it laughingly however declining as indeed pen did for his own part six sporting prints and four groups of operadancers with gauze draperies which formed the late occupants pictorial collection then they went to hall where pen sate down and ate his commons with his brother freshmen and the major took his place at the hightable along with the college dignitaries and other fathers or guardians of youth who had come up with their sons to oxbridge and after hall they went to mr bucks to take wine and after wine to chapel where the major sate with great gravity in the upper place having a fine view of the master in his carved throne or stall under the organloft where that gentleman the learned doctor donne sate magnificent with his great prayerbook before him an image of statuesque piety and rigid devotion all the young freshmen behaved with gravity and decorum but pen was shocked to see that atrocious little foker who came in very late and halfadozen of his comrades in the gentlemenpensioners seats giggling and talking as if they had been in so many stalls at the opera but these circumstances it must be remembered took place some years back when william the fourth was king young men are much better behaved now and besides saint boniface was rather a fast college pen could hardly sleep at night in his bedroom at the trencher so anxious was he to begin his college life and to get into his own apartments what did he think about as he lay tossing and awake was it about his mother at home the pious soul whose life was bound up in his yes let us hope he thought of her a little was it about miss fotheringay and his eternal passion which had kept him awake so many nights and created such wretchedness and such longing he had a trick of blushing and if you had been in the room and the candle had not been out you might have seen the youths countenance redden more than once as he broke out into passionate incoherent exclamations regarding that luckless event of his life his uncles lessons had not been thrown away upon him the mist of passion had passed from his eyes now and he saw her as she was to think that he pendennis had been enslaved by such a woman and then jilted by her that he should have stooped so low to be trampled on in the mire that there was a time in his life and that but a few months back when he was willing to take costigan for his fatherinlaw poor old smirke pen presently laughed outwell ill write and try and console the poor old boy he wont die of his passion ha ha the major had he been awake might have heard a score of such ejaculations uttered by pen as he lay awake and restless through the first night of his residence at oxbridge it would perhaps have been better for a youth the battle of whose life was going to begin on the morrow to have passed the eve in a different sort of vigil but the world had got hold of pen in the shape of his selfish old mentor and those who have any interest in his character must have perceived ere now that this lad was very weak as well as very impetuous very vain as well as very frank and if of a generous disposition not a little selfish in the midst of his profuseness and also rather fickle as all eager pursuers of selfgratification are the six months passion had aged him very considerably there was an immense gulf between pen the victim of love and pen the innocent boy of eighteen sighing after it and so arthur pendennis had all the experience and superiority besides that command which afterward conceit and imperiousness of disposition gave him over the young men with whom he now began to live he and his uncle passed the morning with great satisfaction in making purchases for the better comfort of the apartments which the lad was about to occupy mr spicers china and glass was in a dreadfully dismantled condition his lamps smashed and his book cases by no means so spacious as those shelves which would be requisite to receive the contents of the boxes which were lying in the hall at fairoaks and which were addressed to arthur in the hand of poor helen the boxes arrived in a few days that his mother had packed with so much care pen was touched as he read the superscriptions in the dear wellknown hand and he arranged in their proper places all the books his old friends and all the linen and tablecloths which helen had selected from the family stock and all the jampots which little laura had bound in straw and the hundred simple gifts of home pen had another alma mater now but it is not all children who take to her kindly chapter xix pendennis of boniface illustration our friend pen was not sorry when his mentor took leave of the young gentleman on the second day after the arrival of the pair in oxbridge and we may be sure that the major on his part was very glad to have discharged his duty and to have the duty over more than three months of precious time had that martyr of a major given up to his nephewwas ever selfish man called upon to make a greater sacrifice do you know many men or majors who would do as much a man will lay down his head or peril his life for his honor but let us be shy how we ask him to give up his ease or his hearts desire very few of us can bear that trial say worthy reader if thou hast peradventure a beard wouldst thou do as much i will not say that a woman will not they are used to it we take care to accustom them to sacrifices but my good sir the amount of selfdenial which you have probably exerted through life when put down to your account elsewhere will not probably swell the balance on the credit side much well well there is no use in speaking of such ugly matters and you are too polite to use a vulgar tu quoque but i wish to state once for all that i greatly admire the major for his conduct during the past quarter and think that he has quite a right to be pleased at getting a holiday foker and pen saw him off in the coach and the former young gentleman gave particular orders to the coachman to take care of that gentleman inside it pleased the elder pendennis to have his nephew in the company of a young fellow who would introduce him to the best set of the university the major rushed off to london and thence to cheltenham from which wateringplace he descended upon some neighboring great houses whereof the families were not gone abroad and where good shooting and company was to be had a quarter of the space which custom has awarded to works styled the serial nature has been assigned to the account of one passage in pens career and it is manifest that the whole of his adventures can not be treated at a similar length unless some descendant of the chronicler of pens history should take up the pen at his decease and continue the narrative for the successors of the present generation of readers we are not about to go through the young fellows academical career with by any means a similar minuteness alas the life of such boys does not bear telling altogether i wish it did i ask you does yours as long as what we call our honor is clear i suppose your mind is pretty easy women are pure but not men women are unselfish but not men and i would not wish to say of poor arthur pendennis that he was worse than his neighbors only that his neighbors are bad for the most part let us have the candor to own as much at least can you point out ten spotless men of your acquaintance mine is pretty large but i cant find ten saints in the list during the first term of mr pens academical life he attended classical and mathematical lectures with tolerable assiduity but discovering before very long time that he had little taste or genius for the pursuing of the exact sciences and being perhaps rather annoyed that one or two very vulgar young men who did not even use straps to their trowsers so as to cover the abominably thick and coarse shoes and stockings which they wore beat him completely in the lectureroom he gave up his attendance at that course and announced to his fond parent that he proposed to devote himself exclusively to the cultivation of greek and roman literature mrs pendennis was for her part quite satisfied that her darling boy should pursue that branch of learning for which he had the greatest inclination and only besought him not to ruin his health by too much study for she had heard the most melancholy stories of young students who by over fatigue had brought on brainfevers and perished untimely in the midst of their university career and pens health which was always delicate was to be regarded as she justly said beyond all considerations or vain honors pen although not aware of any lurking disease which was likely to endanger his life yet kindly promised his mamma not to sit up reading too late of nights and stuck to his word in this respect with a great deal more tenacity of resolution than he exhibited upon some other occasions when perhaps he was a little remiss presently he began too to find that he learned little good in the classical lecture his fellowstudents there were too dull as in mathematics they were too learned for him mr buck the tutor was no better a scholar than many a fifthform boy at gray friars might have some stupid humdrum notions about the meter and grammatical construction of a passage of aeschylus or aristophanes but had no more notion of the poetry than mrs binge his bedmaker and pen grew weary of hearing the dull students and tutor blunder through a few lines of a play which he could read in a tenth part of the time which they gave to it after all private reading as he began to perceive was the only study which was really profitable to a man and he announced to his mamma that he should read by himself a great deal more and in public a great deal less that excellent woman knew no more about homer than she did about algebra but she was quite contented with pens arrangements regarding his course of studies and felt perfectly confident that her dear boy would get the place which he merited pen did not come home until after christmas a little to the fond mothers disappointment and lauras who was longing for him to make a fine snow fortification such as he had made three winters before but he was invited to logwood lady agnes fokers where there were private theatricals and a gay christmas party of very fine folks some of them whom major pendennis would on no account have his nephew neglect however he staid at home for the last three weeks of the vacation and laura had the opportunity of remarking what a quantity of fine new clothes he brought with him and his mother admired his improved appearance and manly and decided tone he did not come home at easter but when he arrived for the long vacation he brought more smart clothes appearing in the morning in wonderful shootingjackets with remarkable buttons and in the evening in gorgeous velvet waistcoats with richlyembroidered cravats and curious linen and as she pried about his room she saw oh such a beautiful dressingcase with silver mountings and a quantity of lovely rings and jewelry and he had a new french watch and gold chain in place of the big old chronometer with its bunch of jingling seals which had hung from the fob of john pendennis and by the secondhand of which the defunct doctor had felt many a patients pulse in his time it was but a few months back pen had longed for this watch which he thought the most splendid and august timepiece in the world and just before he went to college helen had taken it out of her trinketbox where it had remained unwound since the death of her husband and given it to pen with a solemn and appropriate little speech respecting his fathers virtues and the proper use of time this portly and valuable chronometer pen now pronounced to be out of date and indeed made some comparisons between it and a warmingpan which laura thought disrespectful and he left the watch in a drawer in the company of soiled primrose gloves cravats which had gone out of favor and of that other school watch which has once before been mentioned in this history our old friend rebecca pen pronounced to be no longer up to his weight and swapped her away for another and more powerful horse for which he had to pay rather a heavy figure mrs pendennis gave the boy the money for the new horse and laura cried when rebecca was fetched away also pen brought a large box of cigars branded colorados afrancesados telescopios fudson oxfordstreet or by some such strange titles and began to consume these not only about the stables and greenhouses where they were very good for helens plants but in his own study of which practice his mother did not at first approve but he was at work upon a prizepoem he said and could not compose without his cigar and quoted the late lamented lord byrons lines in favor of the custom of smoking as he was smoking to such good purpose his mother could not of course refuse permission in fact the good soul coming into the room one day in the midst of pens labors he was consulting a novel which had recently appeared for the cultivation of the light literature of his own country as well as of foreign nations became every studenthelen we say coming into the room and finding pen on the sofa at this work rather than disturb him went for a lightbox and his cigarcase to his bedroom which was adjacent and actually put the cigar into his mouth and lighted the match at which he kindled it pen laughed and kissed his mothers hand as it hung fondly over the back of the sofa dear old mother he said if i were to tell you to burn the house down i think you would do it and it is very likely that mr pen was right and that the foolish woman would have done almost as much for him as he said besides the works of english light literature which this diligent student devoured he brought down boxes of the light literature of the neighboring country of france into the leaves of which when helen dipped she read such things as caused her to open her eyes with wonder but pen showed her that it was not he who made the books though it was absolutely necessary that he should keep up his french by an acquaintance with the most celebrated writers of the day and that it was as clearly his duty to read the eminent paul de kock as to study swift or moliere and mrs pendennis yielded with a sigh of perplexity but miss laura was warned off the books both by his anxious mother and that rigid moralist mr arthur pendennis himself who however he might be called upon to study every branch of literature in order to form his mind and to perfect his style would by no means prescribe such a course of reading to a young lady whose business in life was very different in the course of this long vacation mr pen drank up the bin of claret which his father had laid in and of which we have heard the son remark that there was not a headache in a hogshead and this wine being exhausted he wrote for a further supply to his wine merchants messrs binney and latham of mark lane london from whom indeed old doctor portman had recommended pen to get a supply of port and sherry on going to college you will have no doubt to entertain your young friends at boniface with wine parties the honest rector had remarked to the lad they used to be customary at college in my time and i would advise you to employ an honest and respectable house in london for your small stock of wine rather than to have recourse to the oxbridge tradesmen whose liquor if i remember rightly was both deleterious in quality and exorbitant in price and the obedient young gentleman took the doctors advice and patronized messrs binney and latham at the rectors suggestion so when he wrote orders for a stock of wine to be sent down to the cellars at fairoaks he hinted that messrs b and l might send in his university account for wine at the same time with the fairoaks bill the poor widow was frightened at the amount but pen laughed at her oldfashioned views said that the bill was moderate that every body drank claret and champagne now and finally the widow paid feeling dimly that the expenses of her household were increasing considerably and that her narrow income would scarce suffice to meet them but they were only occasional pen merely came home for a few weeks at the vacation laura and she might pinch when he was gone in the brief time he was with them ought they not to make him happy arthurs own allowances were liberal all this time indeed much more so than those of the sons of far more wealthy men years before the thrifty and affectionate john pendennis whose darling project it had ever been to give his son a university education and those advantages of which his own fathers extravagance had deprived him had begun laying by a store of money which he called arthurs education fund year after year in his book his executors found entries of sums vested as a e f and during the period subsequent to her husbands decease and before pens entry at college the widow had added sundry sums to this fund so that when arthur went up to oxbridge it reached no inconsiderable amount let him be liberally allowanced was major pendenniss maxim let him make his first entree into the world as a gentleman and take his place with men of good rank and station after giving it to him it will be his own duty to hold it there is no such bad policy as stinting a boyor putting him on a lower allowance than his fellows arthur will have to face the world and fight for himself presently meanwhile we shall have procured for him good friends gentlemanly habits and have him well backed and well trained against the time when the real struggle comes and these liberal opinions the major probably advanced both because they were just and because he was not dealing with his own money thus young pen the only son of an estated country gentleman with a good allowance and a gentlemanlike bearing and person looked to be a lad of much more consequence than he was really and was held by the oxbridge authorities tradesmen and undergraduates as quite a young buck and member of the aristocracy his manner was frank brave and perhaps a little impertinent as becomes a highspirited youth he was perfectly generous and freehanded with his money which seemed pretty plentiful he loved joviality and had a good voice for a song boatracing had not risen in pens time to the fureur which as we are given to understand it has since attained in the university and riding and tandemdriving were the fashions of the ingenuous youth pen rode well to hounds appeared in pink as became a young buck and not particularly extravagant in equestrian or any other amusement yet managed to run up a fine bill at niles the livery stablekeeper and in a number of other quarters in fact this lucky young gentleman had almost every taste to a considerable degree he was very fond of books of all sorts doctor portman had taught him to like rare editions and his own taste led him to like beautiful bindings it was marvelous what tall copies and gilding and marbling and blindtooling the booksellers and binders put upon pens bookshelves he had a very fair taste in matters of art and a keen relish for prints of a high schoolnone of your french opera dancers or tawdry racing prints such as had delighted the simple eyes of mr spicer his predecessorbut your stranges and rembrandt etchings and wilkies before the letter with which his apartments were furnished presently in the most perfect good taste as was allowed in the university where this young fellow got no small reputation we have mentioned that he exhibited a certain partiality for rings jewelry and fine raiment of all sorts and it must be owned that mr pen during his time at the university was rather a dressy man and loved to array himself in splendor he and his polite friends would dress themselves out with as much care in order to go and dine at each others rooms as other folks would who were going to enslave a mistress they said he used to wear rings over his kid gloves which he always denies but what follies will not youth perpetrate with its own admirable gravity and simplicity that he took perfumed baths is a truth and he used to say that he took them after meeting certain men of a very low set in hall in pens second year when miss fotheringay made her chief hit in london and scores of prints were published of her pen had one of these hung in his bedroom and confided to the men of his set how awfully how wildly how madly how passionately he had loved that woman he showed them in confidence the verses that he had written to her and his brow would darken his eyes roll his chest heave with emotion as he recalled that fatal period of his life and described the woes and agonies which he had suffered the verses were copied out handed about sneered at admired passed from coterie to coterie there are few things which elevate a lad in the estimation of his brother boys more than to have a character for a great and romantic passion perhaps there is something noble in it at all timesamong very young men it is considered heroicpen was pronounced a tremendous fellow they said he had almost committed suicide that he had fought a duel with a baronet about her freshmen pointed him out to each other as at the promenade time at two oclock he swaggered out of college surrounded by his cronies he was famous to behold he was elaborately attired he would ogle the ladies who came to lionize the university and passed before him on the arms of happy gownsmen and give his opinion upon their personal charms or their toilets with the gravity of a critic whose experience entitled him to speak with authority men used to say that they had been walking with pendennis and were as pleased to be seen in his company as some of us would be if we walked with a duke down pall mall he and the proctor capped each other as they met as if they were rival powers and the men hardly knew which was the greater illustration in fact in the course of his second year arthur pendennis had become one of the men of fashion in the university it is curious to watch that facile admiration and simple fidelity of youth they hang round a leader and wonder at him and love him and imitate him no generous boy ever lived i suppose that has not had some wonderment of admiration for another boy and monsieur pen at oxbridge had his school his faithful band of friends and his rivals when the young men heard at the haberdashers shops that mr pendennis of boniface had just ordered a crimson satin cravat you would see a couple of dozen crimson satin cravats in mainstreet in the course of the weekand simon the jeweler was known to sell no less than two gross of pendennis pins from a pattern which the young gentleman had selected in his shop now if any person with an arithmetical turn of mind will take the trouble to calculate what a sum of money it would cost a young man to indulge freely in all the above propensities which we have said mr pen possessed it will be seen that a young fellow with such liberal tastes and amusements must needs in the course of two or three years spend or owe a very handsome sum of money we have said our friend pen had not a calculating turn no one propensity of his was outrageously extravagant and it is certain that paddingtons tailors account guttleburys cooks bill for dinners dillon tandys bill with finn the printseller for raphaelmorghens and landseer proofs and wormalls dealings with parkton the great bookseller for aldine editions blackletter folios and richly illuminated missals of the xvi century and snaffles or fokers score with nile the horsedealer were each and all of them incomparably greater than any little bills which mr pen might run up with the abovementioned tradesmen but pendennis of boniface had the advantage over all these young gentleman his friends and associates of a universality of taste and whereas young lord paddington did not care twopence for the most beautiful print or to look into any gilt frame that had not a mirror within it and guttlebury did not mind in the least how he was dressed and had an aversion for horse exercise nay a terror of it and snaffle never read any printed works but the racing calender or bells life or cared for any manuscript except his greasy little scrawl of a bettingbookour catholicminded young friend occupied himself in every one of the branches of science or pleasure abovementioned and distinguished himself tolerably in each hence young pen got a prodigious reputation in the university and was hailed as a sort of crichton and as for the english verse prize in competition for which we have seen him busily engaged at fairoaks jones of jesus carried it that year certainly but the undergraduates thought pens a much finer poem and he had his verses printed at his own expense and distributed in gilt morocco covers among his acquaintance i found a copy of it lately in a dusty corner of mr pens bookcases and have it before me this minute bound up in a collection of old oxbridge tracts university statutes prizepoems by successful and unsuccessful candidates declamations recited in the college chapel speeches delivered at the union debating society and inscribed by arthur with his name and college pendennisboniface or presented to him by his affectionate friend thompson or jackson the author how strange the epigraphs look in those halfboyish hands and what a thrill the sight of the documents gives one after the lapse of a few lusters how fate since that time has removed some estranged others dealt awfully with all many a hand is cold that wrote those kindly memorials and that we pressed in the confident and generous grasp of youthful friendship what passions our friendships were in those old days how artless and void of doubt how the arm you were never tired of having linked in yours under the fair college avenues or by the river side where it washes magdalen gardens or christ church meadows or winds by trinity and kings was withdrawn of necessity when you entered presently the world and each parted to push and struggle for himself through the great mob on the way through life are we the same men now that wrote those inscriptionsthat read those poems that delivered or heard those essays and speeches so simple so pompous so ludicrously solemn parodied so artlessly from books and spoken with smug chubby faces and

with these grave parodies and boyish exercises which are at once frank and false and so mirthful yet somehow so mournful by youthful hands that shall never write more fate has interposed darkly and the young voices are silent and the eager brains have ceased to work this one had genius and a great descent and seemed to be destined for honors which now are of little worth to him that had virtue learning geniusevery faculty and endowment which might secure love admiration and worldly fame an obscure and solitary churchyard contains the grave of many fond hopes and the pathetic stone which bids them farewelli saw the sun shining on it in the fall of last year and heard the sweet village choir raising anthems round about what boots whether it be westminster or a little country spire which covers your ashes or if a few days sooner or later the world forgets you amidst these friends then and a host more pen passed more than two brilliant and happy years of his life he had his fill of pleasure and popularity no dinner or supper party was complete without him and pens jovial wit and pens songs and dashing courage and frank and manly bearing charmed all the undergraduates and even disarmed the tutors who cried out at his idleness and murmured about his extravagant way of life though he became the favorite and leader of young men who were much his superiors in wealth and station he was much too generous to endeavor to propitiate them by any meanness or cringing on his own part and would not neglect the humblest man of his acquaintance in order to curry favor with the richest young grandee in the university his name is still remembered at the union debating club as one of the brilliant orators of his day by the way from having been an ardent tory in his freshmans year his principles took a sudden turn afterward and he became a liberal of the most violent order he avowed himself a dantonist and asserted that louis the sixteenth was served right and as for charles the first he vowed that he would chop off that monarchs head with his own right hand were he then in the room at the union debating club and had cromwell no other executioner for the traitor he and lord magnus charters the marquis of runnymedes son beforementioned were the most truculent republicans of their day there are reputations of this sort made quite independent of the collegiate hierarchy in the republic of gownsmen a man may be famous in the honorlists and entirely unknown to the undergraduates who elect kings and chieftains of their own whom they admire and obey as negrogangs have private black sovereigns in their own body to whom they pay an occult obedience besides that which they publicly profess for their owners and drivers among the young ones pen became famous and popular not that he did much but there was a general determination that he could do a great deal if he chose ah if pendennis of boniface would but try the men said he might do any thing he was backed for the greek ode won by smith of trinity every body was sure he would have the latin hexameter prize which brown of st johns however carried off and in this way one university honor after another was lost by him until after two or three failures mr pen ceased to compete but he got a declamation prize in his own college and brought home to his mother and laura at fairoaks a set of prizebooks begilt with the college arms and so big wellbound and magnificent that these ladies thought there had been no such prize ever given in a college before as this of pens and that he had won the very largest honor which oxbridge was capable of awarding as vacation after vacation and term after term passed away without the desired news that pen had sate for any scholarship or won any honor doctor portman grew mightily gloomy in his behavior toward arthur and adopted a sulky grandeur of deportment toward him which the lad returned by a similar haughtiness one vacation he did not call upon the doctor at all much to his mothers annoyance who thought that it was a privilege to enter the rectoryhouse at clavering and listened to dr portmans antique jokes and stories though ever so often repeated with unfailing veneration i can not stand the doctors patronizing air pen said hes too kind to me a great deal too fatherly i have seen in the world better men than him and i am not going to bore myself by listening to his dull old stories and drinking his stupid old port wine the tacit feud between pen and the doctor made the widow nervous so that she too avoided doctor portman and was afraid to go to the rectory when arthur was at home one sunday in the last long vacation the wretched boy pushed his rebellious spirit so far as not to go to church and he was seen at the gate of the clavering arms smoking a cigar in the face of the congregation as it issued from st marys there was an awful sensation in the villagesociety portman prophesied pens ruin after that and groaned in spirit over the rebellious young prodigal so did helen tremble in her heart and little lauralaura had grown to be a fine young stripling by this time graceful and fair clinging round helen and worshiping her with a passionate affection both of these women felt that their boy was changed he was no longer the artless pen of old days so brave so artless so impetuous and tender his face looked careworn and haggard his voice had a deeper sound and tones more sarcastic care seemed to be pursuing him but he only laughed when his mother questioned him and parried her anxious queries with some scornful jest nor did he spend much of his vacations at home he went on visits to one great friend or another and scared the quiet pair at fairoaks by stories of great houses whither he had been invited and by talking of lords without their titles honest harry foker who had been the means of introducing arthur pendennis to that set of young men at the university from whose society and connections arthurs uncle expected that the lad would get so much benefit who had called for arthurs first song at his first supperparty and who had presented him at the barmecide club where none but the very best men of oxbridge were admitted it consisted in pens time of six noblemen eight gentlemenpensioners and twelve of the most select commoners of the university soon found himself left far behind by the young freshman in the fashionable world of oxbridge and being a generous and worthy fellow without a spark of envy in his composition was exceedingly pleased at the success of his young protege and admired pen quite as much as any of the other youth did it was he who followed pen now and quoted his sayings learned his songs and retailed them at minor supperparties and was never weary of hearing them from the gifted young poets own mouthfor a good deal of the time which mr pen might have employed much more advantageously in the pursuit of the regular scholastic studies was given up to the composition of secular ballads which he sang about at parties according to university wont it had been as well for arthur if the honest foker had remained for some time at college for with all his vivacity he was a prudent young man and often curbed pens propensity to extravagance but fokers collegiate career did not last very long after arthurs entrance at boniface repeated differences with the university authorities caused mr foker to quit oxbridge in an untimely manner he would persist in attending races on the neighboring hungerford heath in spite of the injunctions of his academic superiors he never could be got to frequent the chapel of the college with that regularity of piety which alma mater demands from her children tandems which are abominations in the eyes of the heads and tutors were fokers greatest delight and so reckless was his driving and frequent the accidents and upsets out of his drag that pen called taking a drive with him taking the diversions of purley finally having a dinnerparty at his rooms to entertain some friends from london nothing would satisfy mr foker but painting mr bucks door vermilion in which freak he was caught by the proctors and although young black strap the celebrated negrofighter who was one of mr fokers distinguished guests and was holding the can of paint while the young artist operated on the door knocked down two of the proctors attendants and performed prodigies of valor yet these feats rather injured than served foker whom the proctor knew very well and who was taken with the brush in his hand and who was summarily convened and sent down from the university the tutor wrote a very kind and feeling letter to lady agnes on the subject stating that every body was fond of the youth that he never meant harm to any mortal creature that he for his own part would have been delighted to pardon the harmless little boyish frolic had not its unhappy publicity rendered it impossible to look the freak over and breathing the most fervent wishes for the young fellows welfarewishes no doubt sincere for foker as we know came of a noble family on his mothers side and on the other was heir to a great number of thousand pounds a year it dont matter said foker talking over the matter with pena little sooner or a little later what is the odds i should have been plucked for my littlego again i know i shouldthat latin i can not screw into my head and my mammas anguish would have broke out next term the governor will blow like an old grampus i know he willwell we must stop till he gets his wind again i shall probably go abroad and improve my mind with foreign travel yes parly voos the ticket itly and that sort of thing ill go to paris and learn to dance and complete my education but its not me im anxious about pen as long as people drink beer i dont careits about you im doubtful my boy youre going too fast and cant keep up the pace i tell you its not the fifty you owe mepay it or not when you likebut its the every day pace and i tell you it will kill you youre livin as if there was no end to the money in the stockin at home you oughtnt to give dinners you ought to eat em fellows are glad to have you you oughtnt to owe horse bills you ought to ride other chaps nags you know no more about betting than i do about algebra the chaps will win your money as sure as you sport it hang me if you are not trying at every thing i saw you sit down to ecarte last week at trumpingtons and taking your turn with the bones after ringwoods supper theyll beat you at it pen my boy even if they play on the square which i dont say they dont nor which i dont say they do mind but i wont play with em youre no match for em you aint up to their weight its like little black strap standing up to tom springthe blacks a pretty fighter but law bless you his arm aint long enough to touch tomand i tell you youre going it with fellers beyond your weight look hereif youll promise me never to bet nor touch a box nor a card ill let you off the two ponies but pen laughingly said that though it wasnt convenient to him to pay the two ponies at that moment he by no means wished to be let off any just debts he owed and he and foker parted not without many dark forebodings on the latters part with regard to his friend who harry thought was traveling speedily on the road to ruin one must do at rome as rome does pen said in a dandified manner jingling some sovereigns in his waistcoatpocket a little quiet play at ecarte cant hurt a man who plays pretty welli came away fourteen sovereigns richer from ringwoods supper and gad i wanted the moneyand he walked off after having taken leave of poor foker who went away without any beat of drum or offer to drive the coach out of oxbridge to superintend a little dinner which he was going to give at his own rooms in boniface about which dinners the cook of the college who had a great respect for mr pendennis always took especial pains for his young favorite chapter xx rakes progress illustration some short time before mr fokers departure from oxbridge there had come up to boniface a gentleman who had once as it turned out belonged to the other university of camford which he had quitted on account of some differences with the tutors and authorities there this gentleman whose name was horace bloundell was of the ancient suffolk family of bloundellbloundell of bloundellbloundell hall bloundellbloundellshire as the young wags used to call it and no doubt it was on account of his descent and because dr donne the master of boniface was a suffolk man and related perhaps to the family that mr horace bloundell was taken in at boniface after st georges and one or two other colleges had refused to receive him there was a living in the family which it was important for mr bloundell to hold and being in a dragoon regiment at the time when his third brother for whom the living was originally intended sickened and died mr bloundell determined upon quitting crimson pantaloons and sable shakos for the black coat and white neckcloth of the english divine the misfortunes which occurred at camford occasioned some slight disturbance to mr bloundells plans but although defeated upon one occasion the resolute exdragoon was not dismayed and set to work to win victory elsewhere in pens second year major pendennis paid a brief visit to his nephew and was introduced to several of pens university friendsthe gentle and polite lord plinlimmon the gallant and openhearted magnus charters the sly and witty harland the intrepid ringwood who was called rupert in the union debating club from his opinions and the bravery of his blunders broadbent styled barebones broadbent from the republican nature of his opinions he was of a dissenting family from bristol and a perfect boanerges of debate mr bloundellbloundell finally who had at once taken his place among the select of the university major pendennis though he did not understand harlands greek quotations or quite appreciate broadbents thick shoes and dingy hands was nevertheless delighted with the company assembled round his nephew and highly approved of all the young men with the exception of that one who gave himself the greatest airs in the society and affected most to have the manners of a man of the world as he and pen sate at breakfast on the morning after the party in the rooms of the latter the major gave his opinions regarding the young men with whom he was in the greatest good humor he had regaled them with some of his stories which though not quite so fresh in london where people have a diseased appetite for novelty in the way of anecdotes were entirely new at oxbridge and the lads heard them with that honest sympathy that eager pleasure that boisterous laughter or that profound respect so rare in the metropolis and which must be so delightful to the professed racconteur only once or twice during the telling of the anecdotes mr bloundells face wore a look of scorn or betrayed by its expression that he was acquainted with the tales narrated once he had the audacity to question the accuracy of one of the particulars of a tale as given by major pendennis and gave his own version of the anecdote about which he knew he was right for he heard it openly talked of at the club by so and so and tother who were present at the business the youngsters present looked up with wonder at their associate who dared to interrupt the majorfew of them could appreciate that melancholy grace and politeness with which major pendennis at once acceded to mr bloundells version of the story and thanked him for correcting his own error they stared on the next occasion of meeting when bloundell spoke in contemptuous terms of old pen said every body knew old pen regular old trencherman at gaunt house notorious old bore regular old fogy major pendennis on his side liked mr bloundell not a whit these sympathies are pretty sure to be mutual among men and women and if for my part some kind friend tells me that such and such a man has been abusing me i am almost sure on my own side that i have a misliking to such and such a man we like or dislike each other as folks like or dislike the odor of certain flowers or the taste of certain dishes or wines or certain books we cant tell whybut as a general rule all the reasons in the world will not make us love dr fell and as sure as we dislike him we may be sure that he dislikes us so the major said pen my boy your dinner went off a merveille you did the honors very nicelyyou carved welli am glad you learned to carveit is done on the sideboard now in most good houses but is still an important point and may aid you in middlelifeyoung lord plinlimmon is a very amiable young man quite the image of his dear mother whom i knew as lady aquila brownbill and lord magnuss republicanism will wear offit sits prettily enough on a young patrician in early life though nothing is so loathsome among persons of our rankmr broadbent seems to have much eloquence and considerable reading your friend foker is always delightful but your acquaintance mr bloundell struck me as in all respects a most ineligible young man bless my soul sir bloundellbloundell cried pen laughing why sir hes the most popular man of the university we elected him of the barmecides the first week he came uphad a special meeting on purposehes of an excellent familysuffolk bloundells descended from richards blondel bear a harp in chiefand motto o mong roy a man may have a very good coatofarms and be a tiger my boy the major said chipping his egg that man is a tiger mark my worda low man i will lay a wager that he left his regiment which was a good one for not a more respectable man than my friend lord martingale never sate in a saddle in bad odor there is the unmistakable look of slang and bad habits about this mr bloundell he frequents low gambling houses and billiard hells sirhe haunts thirdrate clubsi know he does i know by his style i never was mistaken in my man yet did you remark the quantity of rings and jewelry he wore that person has scamp written on his countenance if any man ever had mark my words and avoid him let us turn the conversation the dinner was a leetle too fine but i dont object to your making a few extra frais when you receive friends of course you dont do it often and only those whom it is your interest to feter the cutlets were excellent and the souffle uncommonly light and good the third bottle of champagne was not necessary but you have a good income and as long as you keep within it i shall not quarrel with you my dear boy poor pen the worthy uncle little knew how often those dinners took place while the reckless young amphitryon delighted to show his hospitality and skill in gourmandise there is no art than that so long to learn so difficult to acquire so impossible and beyond the means of many unhappy people about which boys are more anxious to have an air of knowingness a taste and knowledge of wines and cookery appears to them to be the sign of an accomplished roue and manly gentleman i like to see them wink at a glass of claret as if they had an intimate acquaintance with it and discuss a salmipoor boysit is only when they grow old they know that they know nothing of the science when perhaps their conscience whispers them that the science is in itself little worth and that a leg of mutton and content is as good as the dinners of pontiffs but little pen in his character of admirable crichton thought it necessary to be a great judge and practitioner of dinners we have just said how the collegecook respected him and shall soon have to deplore that that worthy man so blindly trusted our pen in the third year of the lads residence at oxbridge his staircase was by no means encumbered with dishcovers and desserts and waiters carrying in dishes and skips opening iced champagne crowds of different sorts of attendants with faces sulky or piteous hung about the outer oak and assailed the unfortunate lad as he issued out of his den nor did his guardians advice take any effect or induce mr pen to avoid the society of the disreputable mr bloundell what young men like in their companions is what had got pen a great part of his own repute and popularity a real or supposed knowledge of life a man who has seen the world or can speak of it with a knowing aira roue or lovelace who has his adventures to relate is sure of an admiring audience among boys it is hard to confess but so it is we respect that sort of prowess from our schooldays we have been taught to admire it are there five in the hundred out of the hundreds and hundreds of english schoolboys brought up at our great schools and colleges that must not own at one time of their lives to having read and liked don juan awful propagation of evilthe idea of it should make the man tremble who holds the pen lest untruth or impurity or unjust anger or unjust praise escape it one such diseased creature as this is enough to infect a whole colony and the tutors of boniface began to find the moral tone of their college lowered and their young men growing unruly and almost ungentlemanlike soon after mr bloundells arrival at oxbridge the young magnates of the neighboring great college of st georges who regarded pen and in whose society he lived were not taken in by bloundells flashy graces and rakish airs of fashion broadbent called him captain macheath and said he would live to be hanged foker during his brief stay at the university with macheath with characteristic caution declined to say any thing in the captains disfavor but hinted to pen that he had better have him for a partner at whist than play against him and better back him at ecarte than bet on the other side you see he plays better than you do pen was the astute young gentlemans remark he plays uncommonly well the captain doesand pen i wouldnt take the odds too freely from him if i was you i dont think hes too flush of money the captain aint but beyond these dark suggestions and generalities the cautious foker could not be got to speak not that his advice would have had more weight with a headstrong young man than advice commonly has with a lad who is determined on pursuing his own way pens appetite for pleasure was insatiable and he rushed at it wherever it presented itself with an eagerness which bespoke his fiery constitution and youthful health he called taking pleasure seeing life and quoted wellknown maxims from terence from horace from shakspeare to show that one should do all that might become a man he bade fair to be utterly used up and a roue in a few years if he were to continue at the pace at which he was going one night after a supperparty in college at which pen and macheath had been present and at which a little quiet vingtetun had been played an amusement much pleasanter to men in their second and third year than the boisterous custom of singing songs which bring the proctors about the rooms and which have grown quite stale by this time every man having expended his budgetas the men had taken their caps and were going away after no great losses or winnings on any side mr bloundell playfully took up a green wineglass from the suppertable which had been destined to contain iced champagne but into which he inserted something still more pernicious namely a pair of dice which the gentleman took out of his waistcoat pocket and put into the glass then giving the glass a graceful wave which showed that his hand was quite experienced in the throwing of dice he called sevens the main and whisking the ivory cubes gently on the table swept them up lightly again from the cloth and repeated this process two or three times the other men looked on pen of course among the number who had never used the dice as yet except to play a humdrum game of backgammon at home mr bloundell who had a good voice began to troll out the chorus from robert the devil an opera then in great vogue in which chorus many of the men joined especially pen who was in very high spirits having won a good number of shillings and halfcrowns at the vingtetunand presently instead of going home most of the party were seated round the table playing at dice the green glass going round from hand to hand until pen finally shivered it after throwing six mains from that night pen plunged into the delights of the game of hazard as eagerly as it was his custom to pursue any new pleasure dice can be played of mornings as well as after dinner or supper bloundell would come into pens rooms after breakfast and it was astonishing how quick the time passed as the bones were rattling they had little quiet parties with closed doors and bloundell devised a box lined with felt so that the dice should make no noise and their telltale rattle not bring the sharpeared tutors up to the rooms bloundell ringwood and pen were once very nearly caught by mr buck who passing in the quadrangle thought he heard the words two to one on the caster through pens open window but when the tutor got into arthurs rooms he found the lads with three homers before them and pen said he was trying to coach the two other men and asked mr buck with great gravity what was the present condition of the river scamander and whether it was navigable or no mr arthur pendennis did not win much money in these transactions with mr bloundell or indeed gain good of any kind except a knowledge of the odds at hazard which he might have learned out of books captain macheath had other accomplishments which he exercised for pens benefit the captains stories had a great and unfortunate charm for arthur who was never tired of hearing bloundells histories of garrison conquests and of his feats in countryquarters he had been at paris and had plenty of legends about the palais royal and the salon and frascatis he had gone to the salon one night after a dinner at the cafe de paris when we were all devilishly cut by jove and on waking in the morning in my own rooms i found myself with twelve thousand francs under my pillow and a hundred and fortynine napoleons in one of my boots wasnt that a coup hay the captain said pens eyes glistened with excitement as he heard this story he respected the man who could win such a sum of money he sighed and said it would set him all right macheath laughed and told him to drink another drop of maraschino i could tell you stories much more wonderful than that he added and so indeed the captain could have done without any further trouble than that of invention with which portion of the poetic faculty nature had copiously endowed him he laughed to scorn pens love for miss fotheringay when he came to hear of that amour from arthur as he pretty soon did for we have said pen was not averse to telling the story now to his confidential friends and he and they were rather proud of the transaction but macheath took away all pens conceit on this head not by demonstrating the folly of the lads passion for an uneducated woman much his senior in years but by exposing his absurd desire of gratifying his passion in a legitimate way marry her said he you might as well marry and he named one of the most notorious actresses on the stage she hadnt a shred of a character he knew twenty men who were openly admirers of her and named them and the sums each had spent upon her i know no kind of calumny more frightful or frequent than this which takes away the character of women no men more reckless and mischievous than those who lightly use it and no kind of cowards more despicable than the people who invent these slanders is it or not a misfortune that a man himself of a candid disposition and disposed like our friend pen to blurt out the truth on all occasions begins life by believing all that is said to him would it be better for a lad to be less trustful and so less honest it requires no small experience of the world to know that a man who has no especial reason thereto is telling you lies i am not sure whether it is not best to go on being duped for a certain time at all events our honest pen had a natural credulity which enabled him to accept all statements which were made to him and he took every one of captain macheaths figments as if they had been the most unquestioned facts of history so bloundells account about miss fotheringay pained and mortified pen exceedingly if he had been ashamed of his passion beforewhat were his feelings regarding it now when the object of so much pure flame and adoration turned out to be only a worthless impostor an impostor detected by all but him it never occurred to pen to doubt the fact or to question whether the stories of a man who like his new friend never spoke well of any woman were likely to be true one easter vacation when pen had announced to his mother and uncle his intention not to go down but stay at oxbridge and read mr pen was nevertheless induced to take a brief visit to london in company with his friend mr bloundell they put up at a hotel in covent garden where bloundell had a tick as he called it and took the pleasures of town very freely after the wont of young university men bloundell still belonged to a military club whither he took pen to dine once or twice the young men would drive thither in a cab trembling lest they should meet major pendennis on his beat in pall mall and here pen was introduced to a number of gallant young fellows with spurs and mustaches with whom he drank paleale of mornings and beat the town of a night here he saw a deal of life indeed nor in his career about the theaters and singinghouses which these roaring young blades frequented was he very likely to meet his guardian one night nevertheless they were very near to each other a plank only separating pen who was in the boxes of the museum theater from the major who was in lord steynes box along with that venerated nobleman the fotheringay was in the pride of her glory she had made a hit that is she had drawn very good houses for nearly a year had starred the provinces with great eclat had come back to shine in london with somewhat diminished luster and now was acting with ever increasing attraction c triumph of the good old british drama as the playbills avowed to houses in which there was plenty of room for any body who wanted to see her it was not the first time pen had seen her since that memorable day when the two had parted in chatteries in the previous year when the town was making much of her and the press lauded her beauty pen had found a pretext for coming to london in termtime and had rushed off to the theater to see his old flame he recollected it rather than renewed it he remembered how ardently he used to be on the lookout at chatteries when the speech before ophelias or mrs hallers entrance on the stage was made by the proper actor now as the actor spoke he had a sort of feeble thrill as the house began to thunder with applause and ophelia entered with her old bow and sweeping courtesy pen felt a slight shock and blushed very much as he looked at her and could not help thinking that all the house was regarding him he hardly heard her for the first part of the play and he thought with such rage of the humiliation to which she had subjected him that he began to fancy he was jealous and in love with her still but that illusion did not last very long he ran round to the stage door of the theater to see her if possible but he did not succeed she passed indeed under his nose with a female companion but he did not know hernor did she recognize him the next night he came in late and staid very quietly for the afterpiece and on the third and last night of his stay in londonwhy taglioni was going to dance at the operataglioni and there was to be don giovanni which he admired of all things in the world so mr pen went to don giovanni and taglioni this time the illusion about her was quite gone she was not less handsome but she was not the same somehow the light was gone out of her eyes which used to flash there or pens no longer were dazzled by it the rich voice spoke as of old yet it did not make pens bosom thrill as formerly he thought he could recognize the brogue underneath the accents seemed to him coarse and false it annoyed him to hear the same emphasis on the same words only uttered a little louder worse than this it annoyed him to think that he should ever have mistaken that loud imitation for genius or melted at those mechanical sobs and sighs he felt that it was in another life almost that it was another man who had so madly loved her he was ashamed and bitterly humiliated and very lonely ah poor pen the delusion is better than the truth sometimes and fine dreams than dismal waking they went and had an uproarious supper that night and mr pen had a fine headache the next morning with which he went back to oxbridge having spent all his ready money as all this narrative is taken from pens own confessions so that the reader may be assured of the truth of every word of it and as pen himself never had any accurate notion of the manner in which he spent his money and plunged himself in much deeper pecuniary difficulties during his luckless residence at oxbridge university it is of course impossible for me to give any accurate account of all his involvements beyond that general notion of his way of life which has been sketched a few pages back he does not speak too hardly of the roguery of the university tradesmen or of those in london whom he honored with his patronage at the outset of his career even finch the moneylender to whom bloundell introduced him and with whom he had various transactions in which the young rascals signature appeared upon stamped paper treated him according to pens own account with forbearance and never mulcted him of more than a hundred per cent the old collegecook his fervent admirer made him a private bill offered to send him in dinners up to the very last and never would have pressed his account to his dying day there was that kindness and frankness about arthur pendennis which won most people who came in contact with him and which if it rendered him an easy prey to rogues got him perhaps more goodwill than he merited from many honest men it was impossible to resist his good nature or in his worst moments not to hope for his rescue from utter ruin at the time of his full career of university pleasure he would leave the gayest party to go and sit with a sick friend he never knew the difference between small and great in the treatment of his acquaintances however much the unlucky lads tastes which were of the sumptuous order led him to prefer good society he was only too ready to share his guinea with a poor friend and when he got money had an irresistible propensity for paying which he never could conquer through life in his third year at college the duns began to gather awfully round about him and there was a levee at his oak which scandalized the tutors and would have scared many a stouter heart with some of these he used to battle some he would bully under mr bloundells directions who was a master in this art though he took a degree in no other and some deprecate and it is reported of him that little mary frodsham the daughter of a certain poor gilder and framemaker whom mr pen had thought fit to employ and who had made a number of beautiful frames for his fine prints coming to pendennis with a piteous tale that her father was ill with the ague and that there was an execution in their house pen in an anguish of remorse rushed away pawned his grand watch and every single article of jewelry except two old gold sleevebuttons which had belonged to his father and rushed with the proceeds to frodshams shop where with tears in his eyes and the deepest repentance and humility he asked the poor tradesmans pardon this young gentlemen is not told as an instance of pens virtue but rather of his weakness it would have been much more virtuous to have had no prints at all he still owed for the baubles which he sold in order to pay frodshams bill and his mother had cruelly to pinch herself in order to discharge the jewelers account so that she was in the end the sufferer by the lads impertinent fancies and follies we are not presenting pen to you as a hero or a model only as a lad who in the midst of a thousand vanities and weaknesses has as yet some generous impulses and is not altogether dishonest we have said it was to the scandal of mr buck the tutor that pens extravagances became known from the manner in which he entered college the associates he kept and the introductions of doctor portman and the major buck for a long time thought that his pupil was a man of large property and wondered rather that he only wore a plain gown once on going up to london to the levee with an address from his majestys loyal university of oxbridge buck had seen major pendennis at saint jamess in conversation with two knights of the garter in the carriage of one of whom the dazzled tutor saw the major whisked away after the levee he asked pen to wine the instant he came back let him off from chapels and lectures more than ever and felt perfectly sure that he was a young gentleman of large estate thus he was thunderstruck when he heard the truth and received a dismal confession from pen his university debts were large and the tutor had nothing to do and of course pen did not acquaint him with his london debts what man ever does tell all when pressed by his friends about his liabilities the tutor learned enough to know that pen was poor that he had spent a handsome almost a magnificent allowance and had raised around him such a fine crop of debts as it would be very hard work for any man to mow down for there is no plant that grows so rapidly when once it has taken root perhaps it was because she was so tender and good that pen was terrified lest his mother should know of his sins i cant bear to break it to her he said to the tutor in an agony of grief o sir ive been a villain to herand he repented and he wished he had the time to come over again and he asked himself why why did his uncle insist upon the necessity of living with great people and in how much did all his grand acquaintance profit him they were not shy but pen thought they were and slunk from them during his last terms at college he was as gloomy as a deathshead at parties which he avoided of his own part or to which his young friends soon ceased to invite him every body knew that pendennis was hard up that man bloundell who could pay nobody and who was obliged to go down after three terms was his ruin the men said his melancholy figure might be seen shirking about the lonely quadrangles in his battered old cap and torn gown and he who had been the pride of the university but a year before the man whom all the young ones loved to look at was now the object of conversation at freshmens wine parties and they spoke of him with wonder and awe at last came the degree examinations many a young man of his year whose hobnailed shoes pen had derided and whose face or coat he had caricaturedmany a man whom he had treated with scorn in the lectureroom or crushed with his eloquence in the debatingclubmany of his own set who had not half his brains but a little regularity and constancy of occupation took high places in the honors or passed with decent credit and where on the list was pen the superb pen the wit and dandy pen the poet and orator ah where was pen the widows darling and sole pride let us hide our heads and shut up the page the lists came out and a dreadful rumor rushed through the university that pendennis of boniface was plucked chapter xxi flight after defeat illustration every body who has the least knowledge of heraldry and the peerage must be aware that the noble family of which as we know helen pendennis was a member bears for a crest a nest full of little pelicans pecking at the ensanguined bosom of a big maternal bird which plentifully supplies the little wretches with the nutriment on which according to the heraldic legend they are supposed to be brought up very likely female pelicans like so to bleed under the selfish little beaks of their young ones it is certain that women do there must be some sort of pleasure which we men dont understand which accompanies the pain of being scarified and indeed i believe some women would rather actually so suffer than not they like sacrificing themselves in behalf of the object which their instinct teaches them to love be it for a reckless husband a dissipated son a darling scapegrace of a brother how ready their hearts are to pour out their best treasures for the benefit of the cherished person and what a deal of this sort of enjoyment are we on our side ready to give the soft creatures there is scarce a man that reads this but has administered pleasure in this fashion to his womankind and treated them to the luxury of forgiving him they dont mind how they live themselves but when the prodigal comes home they make a rejoicing and kill the fatted calf for him and at the very first hint that the sinner is returning the kind angels prepare their festival and mercy and forgiveness go smiling out to welcome him i hope it may be so always for us all if we have only justice to look to heaven help us during the latter part of pens residence at the university of oxbridge his uncles partiality had greatly increased for the lad the major was proud of arthur who had high spirits frank manners a good person and high gentlemanlike bearing it pleased the old london bachelor to see pen walking with the young patricians of his university and he who was never known to entertain his friends and whose stinginess had passed into a sort of byword among some wags at the club who envied his many engagements and did not choose to consider his poverty was charmed to give his nephew and the young lords snug little dinners at his lodgings and to regale them with good claret and his very best bons mots and stories some of which would be injured by the repetition for the majors manner of telling them was incomparably neat and careful and others whereof the repetition would do good to nobody he paid his court to their parents through the young men and to himself as it were by their company he made more than one visit to oxbridge where the young fellows were amused by entertaining the old gentleman and gave parties and breakfasts and fetes partly to joke him and partly to do him honor he plied them with his stories he made himself juvenile and hilarious in the company of the young lords he went to hear pen at a grand debate at the union crowed and cheered and rapped his stick in chorus with the cheers of the men and was astounded at the boys eloquence and fire he thought he had got a young pitt for a nephew he had an almost paternal fondness for pen he wrote to the lad letters with playful advice and the news of the town he bragged about arthur at his clubs and introduced him with pleasure into his conversation saying that egad the young fellows were putting the old ones to the wall that the lads who were coming up young lord plinlimmon a friend of my boy young lord magnus charters a chum of my scapegrace c would make a greater figure in the world than even their fathers had done before them he asked permission to bring arthur to a grand fete at gaunt house saw him with ineffable satisfaction dancing with the sisters of the young noblemen before mentioned and gave himself as much trouble to procure cards of invitation for the lad to some good houses as if he had been a mamma with a daughter to marry and not an old halfpay officer in a wig and he boasted every where of the boys great talents and remarkable oratorical powers and of the brilliant degree he was going to take lord runnymede would take him on his embassy or the duke would bring him in for one of his boroughs he wrote over and over again to helen who for her part was too ready to believe any thing that any body chose to say in favor of her son and all this pride and affection of uncle and mother had been trampled down by pens wicked extravagance and idleness i dont envy pens feelings as the phrase is as he thought of what he had done he had slept and the tortoise had won the race he had marred at its outset what might have been a brilliant career he had dipped ungenerously into a generous mothers purse basely and recklessly spilt her little cruse o it was a coward hand that could strike and rob a creature so tender and if pen felt the wrong which he had done too thers are we to suppose that a young gentleman of his vanity did not feel still more keenly the shame he had brought upon himself let us be assured that there is no more cruel remorse than that and no groans more piteous than those of wounded selflove like joe millers friend the senior wrangler who bowed to the audience from his box at the play because he and the king happened to enter the theater at the same time only with a fatuity by no means so agreeable to himself poor arthur pendennis felt perfectly convinced that all england would remark the absence of his name from the examinationlists and talk about his misfortune his wounded tutor his many duns the skip and bedmaker who waited upon him the undergraduates of his own time and the years below him whom he had patronized or scornedhow could he bear to look any of them in the face now he rushed to his rooms into which he shut himself and there he penned a letter to his tutor full of thanks regards remorse and despair requesting that his name might be taken off the college books and intimating a wish and expectation that death would speedily end the woes of the disgraced arthur pendennis then he slunk out scarcely knowing whither he went but mechanically taking the unfrequented little lanes by the backs of the colleges until he cleared the university precincts and got down to the banks of the camisis river now deserted but so often alive with the boatraces and the crowds of cheering gownsmen he wandered on and on until he found himself at some miles distance from oxbridge or rather was found by some acquaintances leaving that city as pen went up a hill a drizzling january rain beating in his face and his ragged gown flying behind himfor he had not divested himself of his academical garments since the morninga postchaise came rattling up the road on the box of which was seated a servant while within or rather half out of the carriage window sate a young gentleman smoking a cigar and loudly encouraging the postboy it was our young acquaintance of baymouth mr spavin who had got his degree and was driving homeward in triumph in his yellow postchaise he caught a sight of the figure madly gesticulating as he worked up the hill and of poor pens pale and ghastly face as the chaise whirled by him wo roared mr spavin to the postboy and the horses stopped in their mad career and the carriage pulled up some fifty yards before pen he presently heard his own name shouted and beheld the upper half of the body of mr spavin thrust out of the sidewindow of the vehicle and beckoning pen vehemently toward it pen stopped hesitatednodded his head fiercely and pointed onward as if desirous that the postillion should proceed he did not speak but his countenance must have looked very desperate for young spavin having stared at him with an expression of blank alarm jumped out of the carriage presently ran toward pen holding out his hand and grasping pens said i sayhullo old boy where are you going and whats the row now im going where i deserve to go said pen with an imprecation this aint the way said mr spavin smiling this is the fenbury road i say pen dont take on because you are plucked its nothing when you are used to it ive been plucked three times old boyand after the first time i didnt care glad its over though youll have better luck next time pen looked at his early acquaintancewho had been plucked who had been rusticated who had only after repeated failures learned to read and write correctly and who in spite of all these drawbacks had attained the honor of a degree this man has passed he thought and i have failed it was almost too much for him to bear goodby spavin said he im very glad you are through dont let me keep you im in a hurryim going to town tonight gammon said mr spavin this aint the way to town this is the fenbury road i tell you i was just going to turn back pen said all the coaches are full with the men going down spavin said pen winced youd not get a place for a tenpound note get into my yellow ill drop you at mudford where you have a chance of the fenbury mail ill lend you a hat and a coat ive got lots come along jump in old boygo it leathersand in this way pen found himself in mr spavins postchaise and rode with that gentleman as far as the ram inn at mudford fifteen miles from oxbridge where the fenbury mail changed horses and where pen got a place on to london the next day there was an immense excitement in boniface college oxbridge where for some time a rumor prevailed to the terror of pens tutor and tradesmen that pendennis maddened at losing his degree had made away with himselfa battered cap in which his name was almost discernible together with a seal bearing his crest of an eagle looking at a now extinct sun had been found three miles on the fenbury road near a millstream and for fourandtwenty hours it was supposed that poor pen had flung himself into the stream until letters arrived from him bearing the london postmark the mail reached london at the dreary hour of five and he hastened to the inn at covent garden at which he was accustomed to put up where the everwakeful porter admitted him and showed him to a bed pen looked hard at the man and wondered whether boots knew he was plucked when in bed he could not sleep there he tossed about until the appearance of the dismal london daylight when he sprang up desperately and walked off to his uncles lodgings in burystreet where the maid who was scouring the steps looked up suspiciously at him as he came with an unshaven face and yesterdays linen he thought she knew of his mishap too good evens mr harthur what as appened sir mr morgan the valet asked who had just arranged the wellbrushed clothes and shiny boots at the door of his masters bedroom and was carrying in his wig to the major i want to see my uncle he cried in a ghastly voice and flung himself down on a chair morgan backed before the pale and desperatelooking young man with terrified and wondering glances and disappeared into his masters apartment illustration the major put his head out of the bedroom door as soon as he had his wig on what examination over senior wrangler double first class hay said the old gentlemanill come directly and the head disappeared they dont know what has happened groaned pen what will they say when they know all pen had been standing with his back to the window and to such a dubious light as burystreet enjoys of a foggy january morning so that his uncle could not see the expression of the young mans countenance or the looks of gloom and despair which even mr morgan had remarked but when the major came out of his dressingroom neat and radiant and preceded by faint odors from delcroixs shop from which emporium major pendenniss wig and his pockethandkerchief got their perfume he held out one of his hands to pen and was about addressing him in his cheery hightoned voice when he caught sight of the boys face at length and dropping his hand said good god pen whats the matter youll see it in the papers at breakfast sir pen said see what my name isnt there sir hang it why should it be asked the major more perplexed i have lost every thing sir pen groaned out my honors gone im ruined irretrievably i cant go back to oxbridge lost your honor screamed out the major heaven alive you dont mean to say you have shown the white feather pen laughed bitterly at the word feather and repeated it no it isnt that sir im not afraid of being shot i wish to god any body would i have not got my degree iim plucked sir the major had heard of plucking but in a very vague and cursory way and concluded that it was some ceremony performed corporally upon rebellious university youth i wonder you can look me in the face after such a disgrace sir he said i wonder you submitted to it as a gentleman i couldnt help it sir i did my classical papers well enough it was those infernal mathematics which i have always neglected was itwas it done in public sir the major said what thethe plucking asked the guardian looking pen anxiously in the face pen perceived the error under which his guardian was laboring and in the midst of his misery the blunder caused the poor wretch a faint smile and served to bring down the conversation from the tragedykey in which pen had been disposed to carry it on he explained to his uncle that he had gone in to pass his examination and failed on which the major said that though he had expected far better things of his nephew there was no great misfortune in this and no dishonor as far as he saw and that pen must try again me again at oxbridge pen thought after such a humiliation as that he felt that except he went down to burn the place he could not enter it but it was when he came to tell his uncle of his debts that the other felt surprise and anger most keenly and broke out into speeches most severe upon pen which the lad bore as best he might without flinching he had determined to make a clean breast and had formed a full true and complete list of all his bills and liabilities at the university and in london they consisted of various items such as london tailor oxbridge do haberdasher for shirts and gloves jeweler college cook crump for desserts bootmaker wine merchant in london oxbridge do bill for horses printseller books binding hairdresser and perfumery hotel bill in london sundries all which items the reader may fill in at his pleasuresuch accounts have been inspected by the parents of many university youthand it appeared that mr pens bills in all amounted to about seven hundred pounds and furthermore it was calculated that he had had more than twice that sum of ready money during his stay at oxbridge this sum he had spent and for it had to showwhat you need not press a man who is down sir pen said to his uncle gloomily i know very well sir how wicked and idle i have been my mother wont like to see me dishonored sir he continued with his voice failing and i know she will pay these accounts but i shall ask her for no more money as you like sir the major said you are of age and my hands are washed of your affairs but you cant live without money and have no means of making it that i see though you have a fine talent in spending it and it is my belief that you will proceed as you have begun and ruin your mother before you are five years oldergood morning it is time for me to go to breakfast my engagements wont permit me to see you much during the time that you stay in london i presume that you will acquaint your mother with the news which you have just conveyed to me and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club he saw the oxbridge examinationlists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephews debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous what was to be donethere was nothing for it but to pay wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as muchfive times as muchas arthur and with no means at all to pay the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat after all he was not to pay but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london diningroom that day pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that every body was looking at him and whispering to his neighbor that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over itand the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffeeroom of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermanns window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesnt in the least recollect in what piece on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which every body knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a months application he said he had ordered pens skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentlemans wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pens bills laid on the top on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and there prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone down stairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteries coach for that evening chapter xxii prodigals return illustration such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to communicate he wishes the deed were done and done quickly he is sorry but que voulezvous the tooth must be taken out and he has you into the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigor of wrist he applies the forceps perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out so the doctor having read the epistle out to mira and mrs portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was going deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and dispatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow she had the news already she had read pens letter and it had relieved her somehow a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tenderhearted did she want more all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won why didnt they leave him at home with his mother as for his debts of course they must be paidhis debtswasnt his fathers money all his and hadnt he a right to spend it in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection toward one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious courtesy and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life goodnatured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss lauras eyes were provided with two pairs of vails in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i dare say that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantraps and without the powder which her ladyship uses her nose must be left to the readers imagination if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow any thing larger than a button every body allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth while her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pens general conduct and bearing his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthurs occupations and studies were and how many his engagements it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i dont see that he gets many prizes why doesnt he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses there is nobody there will love him half so much asas you do as i do only laura sighed out mrs pendennis laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helens fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the womans love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthurs latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his wordsneglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressinggown when the gentle widow returned from those duties the hero of lauras early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boys virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbors at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that helens boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said and you would have left me too then helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each others embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterizes not a few of their sex whence came all this indignation of miss laura about arthurs passion perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behavior to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in churchtime perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affectionsuch affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend it was devotionit was passionit was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate do not let us men despise these instincts because we can not feel them these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemenwith all the rest of the minor animals but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tenderhearted she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pens transgressions debts what were his debts they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncles order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented disgraced by not getting his degree the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldnt think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favorites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helens hand and kissed her in the doctors presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mothers pen when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervor to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter there must be some jealousy against pen she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of himnothing more likely altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mothers sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she wont repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr arthurs rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long laura added a postscript to helens letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura in the middle of the nightas these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pens room as they passed to their ownin the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake helen stirred and said yes im awake the truth is though she had been lying quite still and silent she had not been asleep one instant but had been looking at the nightlamp in the chimney and had been thinking of pen for hours and hours then miss laura who had been acting with similar hypocrisy and lying occupied with her own thoughts as motionless as helens brooch with pens and lauras hair in it on the frilled white pincushion on the dressingtable began to tell mrs pendennis of a notable plan which she had been forming in her busy little brains and by which all pens embarrassments would be made to vanish in a moment and without the least trouble to any body you know mamma this young lady said that i have been living with you for ten years during which time you have never taken any of my money and have been treating me just as if i was a charity girl now this obligation has offended me very much because i am proud and do not like to be beholden to people and as if i had gone to schoolonly i wouldntit must have cost me at least fifty pounds a year it is clear that i owe you fifty times ten pounds which i know you have put into the bank at chatteries for me and which doesnt belong to me a bit now tomorrow we will go to chatteries and see that nice old mr rowdy with the bald head and ask him for itnot for his head but for the five hundred pounds and i dare say he will send you two more which we will save and pay back and we will send the money to pen who can pay all his debts without hurting any body and then we will live happy ever after what helen replied to this speech need not be repeated as the widows answer was made up of a great number of incoherent ejaculations embraces and other irrelative matter but the two women slept well after that talk and when the nightlamp went out with a splutter and the sun rose gloriously over the purple hills and the birds began to sing and pipe cheerfully amidst the leafless trees and glistening evergreens on fairoaks lawn helen woke too and as she looked at the sweet face of the girl sleeping beside her her lips parted with a smile blushes on her cheeks her spotless bosom heaving and falling with gentle undulations as if happy dreams were sweeping over itpens mother felt happy and grateful beyond all power of words save such as pious women offer up to the beneficent dispenser of love and mercyin whose honor a chorus of such praises is constantly rising up all round the world although it was january and rather cold weather so sincere was mr pens remorse and so determined his plans of economy that he would not take an inside place in the coach but sate up behind with his friend the guard who remembered his former liberality and lent him plenty of great coats perhaps it was the cold that made his knees tremble as he got down at the lodge gate or it may be that he was agitated at the notion of seeing the kind creature for whose love he had made so selfish a return old john was in waiting to receive his masters baggage but he appeared in a fustian jacket and no longer wore his livery of drab and blue ise garner and stable man and lives in the ladge now this worthy man remarked with a grin of welcome to pen and something of a blush but instantly as pen turned the corner of the shrubbery and was out of eyeshot of the coach helen made her appearance her face beaming with love and forgivenessfor forgiving is what some women love best of all we may be sure that the widow having a certain other object in view had lost no time in writing off to pen an account of the noble the magnanimous the magnificent offer of laura filling up her letter with a profusion of benedictions upon both her children it was probably the knowledge of this moneyobligation which caused pen to blush very much when he saw laura who was in waiting in the hall and who this time and for this time only broke through the little arrangement of which we have spoken as having subsisted between her and arthur for the last few years but the truth is there has been a great deal too much said about kissing in the present chapter so the prodigal came home and the fatted calf was killed for him and he was made as happy as two simple women could make him no allusions were made to the oxbridge mishap or questions asked as to his farther proceedings for some time but pen debated these anxiously in his own mind and up in his own room where he passed much time in cogitation a few days after he came home he rode to chatteries on his horse and came back on the top of the coach he then informed his mother that he had left the horse to be sold and when that operation was effected he handed her over the check which she and possibly pen himself thought was an act of uncommon virtue and selfdenial but which laura pronounced to be only strict justice he had rarely mentioned the loan which she had made and which indeed had been accepted by the widow with certain modifications but once or twice and with great hesitation and stammering he alluded to it and thanked her but it evidently pained his vanity to be beholden to the orphan for succor he was wild to find some means of repaying her he left off drinking wine and betook himself but with great moderation to the refreshment of whiskyandwater he gave up cigar smoking but it must be confessed that of late years he had liked pipes and tobacco as well or even better so that this sacrifice was not a very severe one he fell asleep a great deal after dinner when he joined the ladies in the drawingroom and was certainly very moody and melancholy he watched the coaches with great interest walked in to read the papers at clavering assiduously dined with any body who would ask him and the widow was glad that he should have any entertainment in their solitary place and played a good deal at cribbage with captain glanders he avoided dr portman who in his turn whenever pen passed gave him very severe looks from under his shovelhat he went to church with his mother however very regularly and read prayers for her at home to the little household always humble it was greatly diminished now a couple of maids did the work of the house of fairoaks the silver dishcovers never saw the light at all john put on his livery to go to church and assert his dignity on sundays but it was only for forms sake he was gardener and outdoor man vice upton resigned there was but little fire in fairoaks kitchen and john and the maids drank their evening beer there by the light of a single candle all this was mr pens doing and the state of things did not increase his cheerfulness for some time pen said no power on earth could induce him to go back to oxbridge again after his failure there but one day laura said to him with many blushes that she thought as some sort of reparation of punishment on himself for hisfor his idleness he ought to go back and get his degree if he could fetch it by doing so and so back mr pen went a plucked man is a dismal being in a university belonging to no set of men there and owned by no one pen felt himself plucked indeed of all the fine feathers which he had won during his brilliant years and rarely appeared out of his college regularly going to morning chapel and shutting himself up in his rooms of nights away from the noise and suppers of the undergraduates there were no duns about his door they were all paidscarcely any cards were left there the men of his year had taken their degrees and were gone he went into a second examination and passed with perfect ease he was somewhat more easy in his mind when he appeared in his bachelors gown on his way back from oxbridge he paid a visit to his uncle in london but the old gentleman received him with very cold looks and would scarcely give him his forefinger to shake he called a second time but morgan the valet said his master was from home pen came back to fairoaks and to his books and to his idleness and loneliness and despair he commenced several tragedies and wrote many copies of verses of a gloomy cast he formed plans of reading and broke them he thought about enlistingabout the spanish legionabout a profession he chafed against his captivity and cursed the idleness which had caused it helen said he was breaking his heart and was sad to see his prostration as soon as they could afford it he should go abroadhe should go to londonhe should be freed from the dull society of two poor women it was dullvery certainly the tender widows habitual melancholy seemed to deepen into a sadder gloom and laura saw with alarm that the dear friend became every year more languid and weary and that her pale cheek grew more wan chapter xxiii new faces illustration the inmates of fairoaks were drowsily pursuing this humdrum existence while the great house upon the hill on the other side of the river brawl was shaking off the slumber in which it had lain during the lives of two generations of masters and giving extraordinary signs of renewed liveliness just about the time of pens little mishap and when he was so absorbed in the grief occasioned by that calamity as to take no notice of events which befell persons less interesting to himself than arthur pendennis an announcement appeared in the provincial journals which caused no small sensation in the county at least and in all the towns villages halls and mansions and parsonages for many miles round clavering park at clavering market at cackleby fair at chatteries sessions on gooseberry green as the squires carriage met the vicars onehorse contrivance and the inmates of both vehicles stopped on the road to talk at tinkleton church gate as the bell was tolling in the sunshine and the white smocks and scarlet cloaks came trooping over the green common to sunday worship in a hundred societies round aboutthe word was that clavering park was to be inhabited again some five years before the county papers had advertised the marriage at florence at the british legation of francis clavering esq only son of sir francis clavering bart of clavering park with jemima augusta daughter of samuel snell of calcutta esq and widow of the late j amory esq at that time the legend in the county was that clavering who had been ruined for many a year had married a widow from india with some money some of the county folks caught a sight of the newlymarried pair the kickleburys traveling in italy had seen them clavering occupied the poggi palace at florence gave parties and lived comfortablybut could never come to england another yearyoung peregrine of cackleby making a long vacation tour had fallen in with the claverings occupying schloss schinkenstein on the mummel see at rome at lucca at nice at the baths and gambling places of the rhine and belgium this worthy couple might occasionally be heard of by the curious and rumors of them came as it were by gusts to claverings ancestral place their last place of abode was paris where they appear to have lived in great fashion and splendor after the news of the death of samuel snell esq of calcutta reached his orphan daughter in europe of sir francis claverings antecedents little can be said that would be advantageous to that respected baronet the son of an outlaw living in a dismal old chateau near bruges this gentleman had made a feeble attempt to start in life with a commission in a dragoon regiment and had broken down almost at the outset transactions at the gamblingtable had speedily effected his ruin after a couple of years in the army he had been forced to sell out had passed some time in her majestys prison of the fleet and had then shipped over to ostend to join the gouty exile his father and in belgium france and germany for some years this decayed and abortive prodigal might be seen lurking about billiardrooms and wateringplaces punting at gamblinghouses dancing at boardinghouse balls and riding steeplechases on other folks horses it was at a boardinghouse at lausanne that francis clavering made what he called the lucky coup of marrying the widow amory very lately returned from calcutta his father died soon after by consequence of whose demise his wife became lady clavering the title so delighted mr snell of calcutta that he doubled his daughters allowance and dying himself soon after left a fortune to her and her children the amount of which was if not magnified by rumor something very splendid indeed before this time there had been not rumors unfavorable to lady claverings reputation but unpleasant impressions regarding her ladyship the best english people abroad were shy of making her acquaintance her manners were not the most refined her origin was lamentably low and doubtful the retired east indians who are to be found in considerable force in most of the continental towns frequented by english spoke with much scorn of the disreputable old lawyer and indigosmuggler her father and of amory her first husband who had been mate of the indiaman in which miss snell came out to join her father at calcutta neither father nor daughter were in society at calcutta or had ever been heard of at government house old sir jasper rogers who had been chief justice of calcutta had once said to his wife that he could tell a queer story about lady claverings first husband but greatly to lady rogerss disappointment and that of the young ladies his daughters the old judge could never be got to reveal that mystery they were all however glad enough to go to lady claverings parties when her ladyship took the hotel bouilli in the rue grenelle at paris and blazed out in the polite world there in the winter of the faubourg st germain took her up viscount bagwig our excellent embassador paid her marked attention the princes of the family frequented her salons the most rigid and noted of the english ladies resident in the french capital acknowledged and countenanced her the virtuous lady elderbury the severe lady rockminster the venerable countess of southdownpeople in a word renowned for austerity and of quite a dazzling moral purityso great and beneficent an influence had the possession of ten some said twenty thousand a year exercised upon lady claverings character and reputation and her munificence and goodwill were unbounded any body in society who had a scheme of charity was sure to find her purse open the french ladies of piety got money from her to support their schools and convents she subscribed indifferently for the armenian patriarch for father barbarosa who came to europe to collect funds for his monastery on mount athos for the baptist mission to quashyboo and the orthodox settlement in feefawfoo the largest and most savage of the cannibal islands and it is on record of her that on the same day on which madame de cricri got five napoleons from her in support of the poor persecuted jesuits who were at that time in very bad odor in france lady budelight put her down in her subscriptionlist for the rev j ramshorn who had had a vision which ordered him to convert the pope of rome and more than this and for the benefit of the worldly her ladyship gave the best dinners and the grandest balls and suppers which were known at paris during that season and it was during this time that the goodnatured lady must have arranged matters with her husbands creditors in england for sir francis reappeared in his native country without fear of arrest was announced in the morning post and the county paper as having taken up his residence at mivarts hotel and one day the anxious old housekeeper at clavering house beheld a carriage and four horses drive up the long avenue and stop before the mossgrown steps in front of the vast melancholy portico three gentlemen were in the carriagean open one on the back seat was our old acquaintance mr tatham of chatteries while in the places of honor sate a handsome and portly gentleman enveloped in mustaches whiskers fur collars and braiding and by him a pale languid man who descended feebly from the carriage when the little lawyer and the gentleman in fur had nimbly jumped out of it they walked up the great mossgrown steps to the halldoor and a foreign attendant with earrings and a goldlaced cap pulled strenuously at the great bellhandle at the cracked and sculptured gate the bell was heard clanging loudly through the vast gloomy mansion steps resounded presently upon the marble pavement of the hall within and the doors opened and finally mrs blenkinsop the housekeeper polly her aiddecamp and smart the keeper appeared bowing humbly smart the keeper pulled the wisp of haycolored hair which adorned his sunburned forehead kicked out his left heel as if there were a dog biting at his calves and brought down his head to a bow old mrs blenkinsop dropped a courtesy little polly her aiddecamp made a courtesy and several rapid bows likewise and mrs blenkinsop with a great deal of emotion quavered out welcome to clavering sir francis it du my poor eyes good to see one of the family once more the speech and the greetings were all addressed to the grand gentleman in fur and braiding who wore his hat so magnificently on one side and twirled his mustaches so royally but he burst out laughing and said youve saddled the wrong horse old ladyim not sir francis clavering whats come to revisit the halls of my ancestors friends and vassals behold your rightful lord and he pointed his hand toward the pale languid gentleman who said dont be an ass ned yes mrs blenkinsop im sir francis clavering i recollect you quite well forgot me i supposehowdydo and he took the old ladys trembling hand and nodded in her astonished face in a not unkind manner mrs blenkinsop declared upon her conscience that she would have known sir francis any where that he was the very image of sir francis his father and of sir john who had gone before o yesthankyof coursevery much obligedand that sort of thing sir francis said looking vacantly about the hall dismal old place aint it ned never saw it but once when my governor quarreled with my gwandfather in the year twentythwee dismalbeautifulthe castle of otrantothe mysteries of udolpho by jove said the individual addressed as ned what a fireplace you might roast an elephant in it splendid carved gallery inigo jones by jove id lay five to two its inigo jones the upper part by inigo jones the lower was altered by the eminent dutch architect vanderputty in george the first his time by sir richard fourth baronet said the housekeeper o indeed said the baronet gad ned you know every thing i know a few things frank ned answered i know thats not a snyders over the mantelpiecebet you three to one its a copy well restore it my boy a lick of varnish and it will come out wonderfully sir that old fellow in the red gown i suppose is sir richard sheriff of the county and sate in parliament in the reign of queen anne said the housekeeper wondering at the strangers knowledge that on the right is theodosia wife of harbottle second baronet by lely represented in the character of venus the goddess of beautyher son gregory the third baronet by her side as cupid god of love with a bow and arrows that on the next panel is sir rupert made a knight banneret by charles the first and whose property was confuscated by oliver cromwell thank youneednt go on mrs blenkinsop said the baronet well walk about the place ourselves frosch give me a cigar have a cigar mr tatham little mr tatham tried a cigar which sir franciss courier handed to him and over which the lawyer spluttered fearfully neednt come with us mrs blenkinsop whatshisnameyousmartfeed the horses and wash their mouths shant stay long come along strongi know the way i was here in twentythwee at the end of my gwandfathers time and sir francis and captain strong for such was the style and title of sir franciss friend passed out of the hall into the receptionrooms leaving the discomfited mrs blenkinsop to disappear by a sidedoor which led to her apartments now the only habitable rooms in the longuninhabited mansion it was a place so big that no tenant could afford to live in it and sir francis and his friend walked through room after room admiring their vastness and dreary and deserted grandeur on the right of the hall door were the saloons and drawingrooms and on the other side the oak room the parlor the grand diningroom the library where pen had found books in old days round three sides of the hall ran a gallery by which and corresponding passages the chief bedrooms were approached and of which many were of stately proportions and exhibited marks of splendor on the second story was a labyrinth of little discomfortable garrets destined for the attendants of the great folks who inhabited the mansion in the days when it was first built and i do not know any more cheering mark of the increased philanthropy of our own times than to contrast our domestic architecture with that of our ancestors and to see how much better servants and poor are cared for now than in times when my lord and my lady slept under gold canopies and their servants lay above them not so airy or so clean as stables are now up and down the house the two gentlemen wandered the owner of the mansion being very silent and resigned about the pleasure of possessing it whereas the captain his friend examined the premises with so much interest and eagerness that you would have thought he was the master and the other the indifferent spectator of the place i see capabilities in itcapabilities in it sir cried the captain gad sir leave it to me and ill make it the pride of the country at a small expense what a theater we can have in the library here the curtains between the columns which divide the room what a famous room for a galop it will hold the whole shire well hang the morning parlor with the tapestry in your second salon in the rue de grenelle and furnish the oak room with the moyenage cabinets and the armor armor looks splendid against black oak and theres a venice glass in the quai voltaire which will suit that high mantlepiece to an inch sir the long saloon white and crimson of course the drawingroom yellow satin and the little drawingroom light blue with lace overhay i recollect my old governor caning me in that little room sir francis said sententiously he always hated me my old governor chintz is the dodge i suppose for my ladys roomsthe suite in the landing to the south the bedroom the sittingroom and the dressingroom well throw a conservatory out over the balcony where will you have your rooms put mine in the north wing said the baronet with a yawn and out of the reach of miss amorys confounded piano i cant bear it shes scweeching from morning till night the captain burst out laughing he settled the whole further arrangements of the house in the course of their walk through it and the promenade ended they went into the stewards room now inhabited by mrs blenkinsop and where mr tatham was sitting poring over a plan of the estate and the old housekeeper had prepared a collation in honor of her lord and master then they inspected the kitchen and stables about both of which sir francis was rather interested and captain strong was for examining the gardens but the baronet said d the gardens and that sort of thing and finally he drove away from the house as unconcernedly as he had entered it and that night the people of clavering learned that sir francis clavering had paid a visit to the park and was coming to live in the county when this fact came to be known at chatteries all the folks in the place were set in commotion high church and low church halfpay captains and old maids and dowagers sporting squireens of the vicinage farmers tradesmen and factory peopleall the population in and round about the little place the news was brought to fairoaks and received by the ladies there and by mr pen with some excitement mrs pybus says there is a very pretty girl in the family arthur laura said who was as kind and thoughtful upon this point as women generally are a miss amory lady claverings daughter by her first marriage of course you will fall in love with her as soon as she arrives helen cried out dont talk nonsense laura pen laughed and said well there is the young sir francis for you he is but four years old miss laura replied but i shall console myself with that handsome officer sir franciss friend he was at church last sunday in the clavering pew and his mustaches were beautiful indeed the number of sir franciss family whereof the members have all been mentioned in the above paragraphs was pretty soon known in his town and every thing else as nearly as human industry and ingenuity could calculate regarding his household the park avenue and grounds were dotted now with town folks of the summer evenings who made their way up to the great house peered about the premises and criticised the improvements which were taking place there loads upon loads of furniture arrived in numberless vans from chatteries and london and numerous as the vans were there was not one but captain glanders knew what it contained and escorted the baggage up to the park house he and captain edward strong had formed an intimate acquaintance by this time the younger captain occupied those very lodgings at clavering which the peaceful smirke had previously tenanted and was deep in the good graces of madame fribsby his landlady and of the whole town indeed the captain was splendid in person and raiment freshcolored blueeyed blackwhiskered broadchested athletica slight tendency to fullness did not take away from the comeliness of his jolly figurea braver soldier never presented a broader chest to the enemy as he strode down clavering highstreet his hat on one side his cane clanking on the pavement or waving round him in the execution of military cuts and soldatesque manoeuvreshis jolly laughter ringing through the otherwise silent streethe was as welcome as sunshine to the place and a comfort to every inhabitant in it on the first marketday he knew every pretty girl in the market he joked with all the women had a word with the farmers about their stock and dined at the agricultural ordinary at the clavering arms where he set them all dying with laughing by his fun and jokes tu be sure he be a vine feller tu be sure that he be was the universal opinion of the gentlemen in topboots he shook hands with a score of them as they rode out of the innyard on their old nags waving his hat to them splendidly as he smoked his cigar in the inngate in the course of the evening he was free of the landladys bar knew what rent the landlord paid how many acres he farmed how much malt he put in his strong beer and whether he ever run in a little brandy unexcised by kings from baymouth or the fishing villages along the coast he had tried to live at the great house first but it was so dull he couldnt stand it i am a creature born for society he told captain glanders im down here to see claverings house set in order for between ourselves frank has no energy sir no energy hes not the chest for it sir and he threw out his own trunk as he spoke but i must have social intercourse old mrs blenkinsop goes to bed at seven and takes polly with her there was nobody but me and the ghost for the first two nights at the great house and i own it sir i like company most old soldiers do glanders asked strong where he had served captain strong curled his mustache and said with a laugh that the other might almost ask where he had not served i began sir as cadet of hungarian uhlans and when the war of greek independence broke out quitted that service in consequence of a quarrel with my governor and was one of seven who escaped from missolonghi and was blown up in one of botzariss fireships at the age of seventeen ill show you my cross of the redeemer if youll come over to my lodgings and take a glass of grog with me captain this evening ive a few of those baubles in my desk ive the white eagle of poland skrzynecki gave it me he pronounced skrzyneckis name with wonderful accuracy and gusto upon the field of ostrolenka i was a lieutenant of the fourth regiment sir and we marched through diebitschs linesbang thro em into prussia sir without firing a shot ah captain that was a mismanaged business i received this wound by the side of the king before oportowhere he would have pounded the stockjobbing pedroites had bourmont followed my advice and i served in spain with the kings troops until the death of my dear friend zumalacarreguy when i saw the game was over and hung up my toasting iron captain alava offered me a regiment the queens muleteros but i couldntdamme i couldntand now sir you know ned strongthe chevalier strong they call me abroadas well as he knows himself in this way almost every body in clavering came to know ned strong he told madame fribsby he told the landlord of the george he told baker at the readingrooms he told mrs glanders and the young ones at dinner and finally he told mr arthur pendennis who yawning into clavering one day found the chevalier strong in company with captain glanders and who was delighted with his new acquaintance before many days were over captain strong was as much at home in helens drawingroom as he was in madame fribsbys first floor and made the lonely house very gay with his good humor and ceaseless flow of talk the two women had never before seen such a man he had a thousand stories about battles and dangers to interest themabout greek captives polish beauties and spanish nuns he could sing scores of songs in half a dozen languages and would sit down to the piano and troll them off in a rich manly voice both the ladies pronounced him to be delightfuland so he was though indeed they had not had much choice of mans society as yet having seen in the course of their lives but few persons except old portman and the major and mr pen who was a genius to be sure but then your geniuses are somewhat flat and moody at home and captain strong acquainted his new friends at fairoaks not only with his own biography but with the whole history of the family now coming to clavering it was he who had made the marriage between his friend frank and the widow amory she wanted rank and he wanted money what match could be more suitable he organized it he made those two people happy there was no particular romantic attachment between them the widow was not of an age or a person for romance and sir francis if he had his game at billiards and his dinner cared for little besides but they were as happy as people could be clavering would return to his native place and country his wifes fortune would pay his encumbrances off and his son and heir would be one of the first men in the county and miss amory laura asked laura was uncommonly curious about miss amory strong laughed oh miss amory is a musemiss amory is a mysterymiss amory is a femme incomprise what is that asked simple mrs pendennisbut the chevalier gave her no answer perhaps could not give her one miss amory paints miss amory writes poems miss amory composes music miss amory rides like diana vernon miss amory is a paragon in a word i hate clever women said pen thank you said laura for her part she was sure she should be charmed with miss amory and quite longed to have such a friend and with this she looked pen full in the face as if every word the little hypocrite said was gospel truth thus an intimacy was arranged and prepared beforehand between the fairoaks family and their wealthy neighbors at the park and pen and laura were to the full as eager for their arrivals as even the most curious of the clavering folks a londoner who sees fresh faces and yawns at them every day may smile at the eagerness with which country people expect a visitor a cockney comes among them and is remembered by his rural entertainers for years after he has left them and forgotten them very likelyfloated far away from them on the vast london sea but the islanders remember long after the mariner has sailed away and can tell you what he said and what he wore and how he looked and how he laughed in fine a new arrival is an event in the country not to be understood by us who dont and had rather not know who lives next door when the painters and upholsterers had done their work in the house and so beautified it under captain strongs superintendence that he might well be proud of his taste that gentleman announced that he should go to london where the whole family had arrived by this time and should speedily return to establish them in their renovated mansion detachments of domestics preceded them carriages came down by sea and were brought over from baymouth by horses which had previously arrived under the care of grooms and coachmen one day the alacrity coach brought down on its roof two large and melancholy men who were dropped at the park lodge with their trunks and who were messieurs frederic and james metropolitan footmen who had no objection to the country and brought with them state and other suits of the clavering uniform on another day the mail deposited at the gate a foreign gentleman adorned with many ringlets and chains he made a great riot at the lodge gate to the keepers wife who being a westcountry woman did not understand his english or his gascon french because there was no carriage in waiting to drive him to the house a mile off and because he could not walk entire leagues in his fatigued state and varnished boots this was monsieur alcide mirobolant formerly chef of his highness the duc de borodino of h eminence cardinal beccafico and at present chef of the bouche of sir francis clavering baronetmonsieur mirobolants library pictures and piano had arrived previously in charge of the intelligent young englishman his aiddecamp he was moreover aided by a professed female cook likewise from london who had inferior females under her orders he did not dine in the stewards room but took his nutriment in solitude in his own apartments where a female servant was affected to his private use it was a grand sight to behold him in his dressinggown composing a menu he always sate down and played the piano for some time before that if interrupted he remonstrated pathetically with his little maid every great artist he said had need of solitude to perfectionate his works illustration but we are advancing matters in the fullness of our love and respect for monsieur mirobolant and bringing him prematurely on the stage the chevalier strong had a hand in the engagement of all the london domestics and indeed seemed to be the master of the house there were those among them who said he was the housesteward only he dined with the family howbeit he knew how to make himself respected and two of by no means the least comfortable rooms of the house were assigned to his particular use he was walking upon the terrace finally upon the eventful day when amid an immense jangling of bells from clavering church where the flag was flying an open carriage and one of those traveling chariots or family arks which only english philoprogenitiveness could invent drove rapidly with foaming horses through the park gates and up to the steps of the hall the two battans of the sculptured door flew open two superior officers in black the large and melancholy gentlemen now in livery with their hair in powder the country menials engaged to aid them were in waiting in the hall and bowed like tall elms when autumn winds wail in the park through this avenue passed sir francis clavering with a most unmoved face lady clavering with a pair of bright black eyes and a goodhumored countenance which waggled and nodded very graciously master francis clavering who was holding his mammas skirt and who stopped the procession to look at the largest footman whose appearance seemed to strike the young gentleman and miss blandy governess to master francis and miss amory her ladyships daughter giving her arm to captain strong it was summer but fires of welcome were crackling in the great hall chimney and in the rooms which the family were to occupy monsieur mirobolant had looked at the procession from one of the limetrees in the avenue elle est la he said laying his jeweled hand on his richlyembroidered velvet waistcoat with glass buttons je tai vue je te benis o ma sylphide o mon ange and he dived into the thicket and made his way back to his furnaces and saucepans the next sunday the same party which had just made its appearance at clavering park came and publicly took possession of the ancient pew in the church where so many of the baronets ancestors had prayed and were now kneeling in effigy there was such a run to see the new folks that the low church was deserted to the disgust of its pastor and as the state barouche with the grays and coachman in silver wig and solemn footmen drew up at the old churchyard gate there was such a crowd assembled there as had not been seen for many a long day captain strong knew every body and saluted for all the companythe country people vowed my lady was not handsome to be sure but pronounced her uncommon fine dressed as indeed she waswith the finest of shawls the finest of pelisses the brilliantest of bonnets and wreaths and a power of rings cameos brooches chains bangles and other nameless gimcracks and ribbons of every breadth and color of the rainbow flaming on her person miss amory appeared meek and dovecolor like a vestal virginwhile master francis was in the costume then prevalent of rob roy macgregor a celebrated highland outlaw the baronet was not more animated than ordinarilythere was a happy vacuity about him which enabled him to face a dinner a death a church a marriage with the same indifferent ease a pew for the clavering servants was filled by these domestics and the enraptured congregation saw the gentlemen from london with vlower on their heeds and the miraculous coachman with his silver wig take their places in that pew so soon as his horses were put up at the clavering arms in the course of the service master francis began to make such a yelling in the pew that frederic the tallest of the footmen was beckoned by his master and rose and went and carried out master francis who roared and beat him on the head so that the powder flew round about like clouds of incense nor was he pacified until placed on the box of the carriage where he played at horses with johns whip you see the little beggars never been to church before miss bell the baronet drawled out to a young lady who was visiting him no wonder he should make a row i dont go in town neither but i think its right in the country to give a good exampleand that sort of thing miss bell laughed and said the little boy had not given a particularly good example gad i dont know and that sort of thing said the baronet it aint so bad neither whenever he wants a thing frank always cwies and whenever he cwies he gets it here the child in question began to howl for a dish of sweetmeats on the luncheon table and making a lunge across the tablecloth upset a glass of wine over the best waistcoat of one of the guests present mr arthur pendennis who was greatly annoyed at being made to look foolish and at having his spotless cambric shirt front blotched with wine we do spoil him so said lady clavering to mrs pendennis fondly gazing at the cherub whose hands and face were now frothed over with the species of lather which is inserted in the confection called meringues a la creme it is very wrong said mrs pendennis as if she had never done such a thing herself as spoil a child mamma says she spoils my brotherdo you think any thing could miss bell look at himisnt he like a little angel gad i was quite wight said the baronet he has cwied and he has got it you see go it fwank old boy sir francis is a very judicious parent miss amory whispered dont you think so miss bell i shant call you miss belli shall call you laura i admired you so at church your robe was not well made nor your bonnet very fresh but you have such beautiful gray eyes and such a lovely tint thank you said miss bell laughing your cousin is handsome and thinks so he is uneasy de sa personne he has not seen the world yet has he genius has he suffered a lady a little woman in a rumpled satin and velvet shoesa miss pybuscame here and said he has suffered i too have sufferedand you laura has your heart ever been touched laura said no but perhaps blushed a little at the idea of the question so that the other said ah laura i see it all it is the beau cousin tell me every thing i already love you as a sister you are very kind said miss bell smiling andand it must be owned that it is a very sudden attachment all attachments are so it is electricityspontaneity it is instantaneous i knew i should love you from the moment i saw you do you not feel it yourself not yet said laura but i dare say i shall if i try call me by my name then but i dont know it laura cried out my name is blancheisnt it a pretty name call me by it blancheit is very pretty indeed and while mamma talks with that kind looking ladywhat relation is she to you she must have been pretty once but is rather passee she is not well gantee but she has a pretty handand while mamma talks to her come with me to my own roommy own own room its a darling room though that horrid creature captain strong did arrange it are you eprise of him he says you are but i know better it is the beau cousin yesil a de beaux yeux je naime pas les blonds ordinairement car je suis blonde moije suis blanche et blondeand she looked at her face and made a moue in the glass and never stopped for lauras answer to the questions which she had put blanche was fair and like a sylph she had fair hair with green reflections in it but she had dark eyebrows she had long black eyelashes which vailed beautiful brown eyes she had such a slim waist that it was a wonder to behold and such slim little feet that you would have thought the grass would hardly bend under them her lips were of the color of faint rosebuds and her voice warbled limpidly over a set of the sweetest little pearly teeth ever seen she showed them very often for they were very pretty she was very goodnatured and a smile not only showed her teeth wonderfully but likewise exhibited two lovely little pink dimples that nestled in either cheek she showed laura her drawings which the other thought charming she played her some of her waltzes with a rapid and brilliant finger and laura was still more charmed and she then read her some poems in french and english likewise of her own composition and which she kept locked in her own bookher own dear little book it was bound in blue velvet with a gilt lock and on it was printed the title of mes larmes mes larmesisnt it a pretty name the young lady continued who was pleased with every thing that she did and did every thing very well laura owned that it was she had never seen any thing like it before any thing so lovely so accomplished so fragile and pretty warbling so prettily and tripping about such a pretty room with such a number of pretty books pictures flowers round about her the honest and generous country girl forgot even jealousy in her admiration indeed blanche she said every thing in the room is pretty and you are the prettiest of all the other smiled looked in the glass went up and took both of lauras hands and kissed them and sat down to the piano and shook out a little song as if she had been a nightingale this was the first visit paid by fairoaks to clavering park in return for clavering parks visit to fairoaks in reply to fairoakss cards left a few days after the arrival of sir franciss family the intimacy between the young ladies sprang up like jacks beanstalk to the skies in a single night the large footmen were perpetually walking with little rosecoloredpink notes to fairoaks where there was a pretty housemaid in the kitchen who might possibly tempt those gentlemen to so humble a place miss amory sent music or miss amory sent a new novel or a picture from the journal des modes to laura or my ladys compliments arrived with flowers and fruit or miss amory begged and prayed miss bell to come to dinner and dear mrs pendennis if she was strong enough and mr arthur if a humdrum party were not too stupid for him and would send a ponycarriage for mrs pendennis and would take no denial neither arthur nor laura wished to refuse and helen who was indeed somewhat ailing was glad that the two should have their pleasure and would look at them fondly as they set forth and ask in her heart that she might not be called away until those two beings whom she loved best in the world should be joined together as they went out and crossed over the bridge she remembered summer evenings fiveandtwenty years ago when she too had bloomed in her brief prime of love and happiness it was all over now the moon was looking from the purpling sky and the stars glittering there just as they used in the early wellremembered evenings he was lying dead far away with the billows rolling between them good god how well she remembered the last look of his face as they parted it looked out at her through the vista of long years as sad and as clear as then so mr pen and miss laura found the society at clavering park an uncommonly agreeable resort of summer evenings blanche vowed that she raffoled of laura and very likely mr pen was pleased with blanche his spirits came back he laughed and rattled till laura wondered to hear him it was not the same pen yawning in a shooting jacket in the fairoaks parlor who appeared alert and brisk and smiling and well dressed in lady claverings drawingroom sometimes they had music laura had a sweet contralto voice and sang with blanche who had had the best continental instruction and was charmed to be her friends mistress sometimes mr pen joined in these concerts or oftener looked sweet upon miss blanche as she sang sometimes they had glees when captain strongs chest was of vast service and he boomed out in a prodigious bass of which he was not a little proud good fellow strongaint he miss bell sir francis would say to her plays at ecarte with lady claveringplays any thing pitch and toss pianoforty cwibbage if you like how long do you think hes been staying with me he came for a week with a carpet bag and gad hes been staying here thwee years good fellow aint he dont know how he gets a shillin though begad i dont miss laura and yet the chevalier if he lost his money to lady clavering always paid it and if he lived with his friend for three years paid for that tooin good humor in kindness and joviality in a thousand little services by which he made himself agreeable what gentleman could want a better friend than a man who was always in spirits never in the way or out of it and was ready to execute any commission for his patron whether it was to sing a song or meet a lawyer to fight a duel or to carve a capon although laura and pen commonly went to clavering park together yet sometimes mr pen took walks there unattended by her and about which he did not tell her he took to fishing the brawl which runs through the park and passes not very far from the gardenwall and by the oddest coincidence miss amory would walk out having been to look at her flowers and would be quite surprised to see mr pendennis fishing illustration i wonder what trout pen caught while the young lady was looking on or whether miss blanche was the pretty little fish which played round his fly and which mr pen was endeavoring to hook it must be owned he became very fond of that healthful and invigorating pursuit of angling and was whipping the brawl continually with his fly as for miss blanche she had a kind heart and having as she owned herself suffered a good deal in the course of her brief life and experiencewhy she could compassionate other susceptible beings like pen who had suffered too her love for laura and that dear mrs pendennis redoubled if they were not at the park she was not easy unless she herself was at fairoaks she played with laura she read french and german with laura and mr pen read french and german along with them he turned sentimental ballads of schiller and goethe into english verse for the ladies and blanche unlocked mes larmes for him and imparted to him some of the plaintive outpourings of her own tender muse it appeared from these poems that this young creature had indeed suffered prodigiously she was familiar with the idea of suicide death she repeatedly longed for a faded rose inspired her with such grief that you would have thought she must die in pain of it it was a wonder how a young creature who had had a snug home or been at a comfortable boardingschool and had no outward grief or hardship to complain of should have suffered so muchshould have found the means of getting at such an ocean of despair and passion as a runaway boy who will get to sea and having embarked on it should survive it what a talent she must have had for weeping to be able to pour out so many of mes larmes they were not particularly briny miss blanches tears that is the truth but pen who read her verses thought them very well for a ladyand wrote some verses himself for her his were very violent and passionate very hot sweet and strong and he not only wrote verses buto the villain o the deceiver he altered and adapted former poems in his possession and which had been composed for a certain miss emily fotheringay for the use and to the christian name of miss blanche amory chapter xxiv a little innocent illustration every house has its skeleton in it somewhere and it may be a comfort to some unhappy folks to think that the luckiest and most wealthy of their neighbors have their miseries and causes of disquiet our little innocent muse of a blanche who sang so nicely and talked so sweetly you would have thought she must have made sunshine whereever she went was the skeleton or the misery or the bore or the nemesis of clavering house and of most of the inhabitants thereof as one little stone in your own shoe or your horses suffices to put either to torture and to make your journey miserable so in life a little obstacle is sufficient to obstruct your entire progress and subject you to endless annoyance and disquiet who would have guessed that such a smiling little fairy as blanche amory could be the cause of discord in any family i say strong one day the baronet said as the pair were conversing after dinner over the billiardtable and that great unbosomer of secrets a cigar i say strong i wish to the doose your wife was dead so do i thats a cannon by jove but she wont shell live foreveryou see if she dont why do you wish her off the hooks frank my boy asked captain strong because then you might marry missy she aint badlooking shell have ten thousand and thats a good bit of money for such a poor old devil as you drawled out the other gentleman and gad strong i hate her worse and worse every day i cant stand her strong by gad i cant i wouldnt take her at twice the figure captain strong said laughing i never saw such a little devil in my life i should like to poison her said the sententious baronet by jove i should why what has she been at now asked his friend nothing particular answered sir francis only her old tricks that girl has such a knack of making every body miserable that hang me its quite surprising last night she sent the governess crying away from the dinnertable afterward as i was passing franks room i heard the poor little beggar howling in the dark and found his sister had been frightening his soul out of his body by telling him stories about the ghost thats in the house at lunch she gave my lady a turn and though my wifes a fool shes a good soulim hanged if she aint what did missy do to her strong asked why hang me if she didnt begin talking about the late amory my predecessor the baronet said with a grin she got some picture out of the keepsake and said she was sure it was like her dear father she wanted to know where her fathers grave was hang her father whenever miss amory talks about him lady clavering always bursts out crying and the little devil will talk about him in order to spite her mother today when she began i got in a confounded rage said i was her father andand that sort of thing and then sir she took a shy at me and what did she say about you frank mr strong still laughing inquired of his friend and patron gad she said i wasnt her father that i wasnt fit to comprehend her that her father must have been a man of genius and fine feelings and that sort of thing whereas i had married her mother for money well didnt you asked strong it dont make it any the pleasanter to hear because its true dont you know sir francis clavering answered i aint a literary man and that but i aint such a fool as she makes me out i dont know how it is but she always manages toto put me in the hole dont you understand she turns all the house round her in her quiet way and with her confounded sentimental airs i wish she was dead ned it was my wife whom you wanted dead just now strong said always in perfect good humor upon which the baronet with his accustomed candor said well when people bore my life out i do wish they were dead and i wish missy were down a well with all my heart thus it will be seen from the above report of this candid conversation that our accomplished little friend had some peculiarities or defects of character which rendered her not very popular she was a young lady of some genius exquisite sympathies and considerable literary attainments living like many another genius with relatives who could not comprehend her neither her mother nor her stepfather were persons of a literary turn bells life and the racing calendar were the extent of the baronets reading and lady clavering still wrote like a school girl of thirteen and with an extraordinary disregard to grammar and spelling and as miss amory felt very keenly that she was not appreciated and that she lived with persons who were not her equals in intellect or conversational power she lost no opportunity to acquaint her family circle with their inferiority to herself and not only was a martyr but took care to let every body know that she was so if she suffered as she said and thought she did severely are we to wonder that a young creature of such delicate sensibilities should shriek and cry out a good deal without sympathy life is nothing and would it not have been a want of candor on her part to affect a cheerfulness which she did not feel or pretend a respect for those toward whom it was quite impossible she should entertain any reverence if a poetess may not bemoan her lot of what earthly use is her lyre blanche struck hers only to the saddest of tunes and sang elegies over her dead hopes dirges over her early frostnipt buds of affection as became such a melancholy fate and muse her actual distresses as we have said had not been up to the present time very considerable but her griefs lay like those of most of us in her own soulthat being sad and habitually dissatisfied what wonder that she should weep so mes larmes dribbled out of her eyes any day at command she could furnish an unlimited supply of tears and her faculty of shedding them increased by practice for sentiment is like another complaint mentioned by horace as increasing by selfindulgence i am sorry to say ladies that the complaint in question is called the dropsy and the more you cry the more you will be able and desirous to do so missy had begun to gush at a very early age lamartine was her favorite bard from the period when she first could feel and she had subsequently improved her mind by a sedulous study of novels of the great modern authors of the french language there was not a romance of balzac and george sand which the indefatigable little creature had not devoured by the time she was sixteen and however little she sympathized with her relatives at home she had friends as she said in the spiritworld meaning the tender indiana the passionate and poetic lelia the amiable trenmor that highsouled convict that angel of the galleysthe fiery stenioand the other numberless heroes of the french romances she had been in love with prince rodolph and prince djalma while she was yet at school and had settled the divorce question and the rights of woman with indiana before she had left off pinafores the impetuous little lady played at love with these imaginary worthies as a little while before she had played at maternity with her doll pretty little poetical spirits it is curious to watch them with those playthings today the blueeyed one is the favorite and the blackeyed one is pushed behind the drawers tomorrow blueeyes may take its turn of neglect and it may be an odious little wretch with a burned nose or torn head of hair and no eyes at all that takes the first place in misss affection and is dandled and caressed in her arms as novelists are supposed to know every thing even the secrets of female hearts which the owners themselves do not perhaps know we may state that at eleven years of age mademoiselle betsi as miss amory was then called had felt tender emotions toward a young savoyard organgrinder at paris whom she persisted in believing to be a prince carried off from his parents that at twelve an old and hideous drawingmasterbut ah what age or personal defects are proof against womans love had agitated her young heart and that at thirteen being at madame de caramels boardingschool in the champs elysees which as every body knows is next door to monsieur rogrons chevalier of the legion of honor pension for young gentlemen a correspondence by letter took place between the seduisante miss betsi and two young gentlemen of the college of charlemagne who were pensioners of the chevalier rogron in the above paragraph our young friend has been called by a christian name different to that tinder which we were lately presented to her the fact is that miss amory called missy at home had really at the first been christened betsybut assumed the name of blanche of her own will and fantasy and crowned herself with it and the weapon which the baronet her stepfather held in terror over her was the threat to call her publicly by her name of betsy by which menace he sometimes managed to keep the young rebel in order we have spoken just now of childrens dolls and of the manner in which those little people take up and neglect their darling toys and very likely this history will show that miss blanche assumed and put away her live dolls with a similar girlish inconstancy she had had hosts of dear dear darling friends ere now and had quite a little museum of locks of hair in her treasurechest which she had gathered in the course of her sentimental progress some dear friends had married some had gone to other schools one beloved sister she had lost from the pension and found again o horror her darling her leocadie keeping the books in her fathers shop a grocer in the rue du bac in fact she had met with a number of disappointments estrangements disillusionments as she called them in her pretty french jargon and had seen and suffered a great deal for so young a woman but it is the lot of sensibility to suffer and of confiding tenderness to be deceived and she felt that she was only undergoing the penalties of genius in these pangs and disappointments of her young career meanwhile she managed to make the honest lady her mother as uncomfortable as circumstances would permit and caused her worthy stepfather to wish she was dead with the exception of captain strong whose invincible good humor was proof against her sarcasms the little lady ruled the whole house with her tongue if lady clavering talked about sparrowgrass instead of asparagus or called an object a hobject as this unfortunate lady would sometimes do missy calmly corrected her and frightened the good soul her mother into errors only the more frequent as she grew more nervous under her daughters eye it is not to be supposed considering the vast interest which the arrival of the family at clavering park inspired in the inhabitants of the little town that madame fribsby alone of all the folks in clavering should have remained unmoved and incurious at the first appearance of the park family in church madame noted every article of toilet which the ladies wore from their bonnets to their brodequins and took a survey of the attire of the ladies maids in the pew allotted to them we fear that doctor portmans sermon though it was one of his oldest and most valued compositions had little effect upon madame fribsby on that day in a very few days afterward she had managed for herself an interview with lady claverings confidential attendant in the housekeepers room at the park and her cards in french and english stating that she received the newest fashions from paris from her correspondent madame victorine and that she was in the custom of making court and ball dresses for the nobility and gentry of the shire were in the possession of lady clavering and miss amory and favorably received as she was happy to hear by those ladies mrs bonner lady claverings lady became soon a great frequenter of madame fribsbys drawingroom and partook of many entertainments at the milliners expense a meal of green tea scandal hot sallylunn cakes and a little novel reading were always at the service of mrs bonner whenever she was free to pass an evening in the town and she found much more time for these pleasures than her junior officer miss amorys maid who seldom could be spared for a holiday and was worked as hard as any factory girl by that inexorable little muse her mistress the muse loved to be dressed becomingly and having a lively fancy and a poetic desire for change was for altering her attire every day her maid having a taste in dressmakingto which art she had been an apprentice at paris before she entered into miss blanches service therewas kept from morning till night altering and remodeling miss amorys habiliments and rose very early and went to bed very late in obedience to the untiring caprices of her little taskmistress the girl was of respectable english parents there are many of our people colonists of paris who have seen better days who are not quite ruined who do not quite live upon charity and yet can not get on without it and as her father was a cripple incapable of work and her return home would only increase the burthen and add to the misery of the family poor pincott was fain to stay where she could maintain herself and spare a little relief to her parents our muse with the candor which distinguished her never failed to remind her attendant of the real state of matters i should send you away pincott for you are a great deal too weak and your eyes are failing you and you are always crying and sniveling and wanting the doctor but i wish that your parents at home should be supported and i go on enduring you for their sake mind the dear blanche would say to her timid little attendant or pincott your wretched appearance and slavish manner and red eyes positively give me the migraine and i think i shall make you wear rouge so that you may look a little cheerful or pincott i cant bear even for the sake of your starving parents that you should tear my hair out of my head in that manner and i will thank you to write to them and say that i dispense with your services after which sort of speeches and after keeping her for an hour trembling over her hair which the young lady loved to have combed as she perused one of her favorite french novels she would go to bed at one oclock and say pincott you may kiss me good night i should like you to have the pink dress ready for the morning and so with a blessing upon her attendant she would turn round and go to sleep the muse might lie in bed as long as she chose of a morning and availed herself of that privilege but pincott had to rise very early indeed to get her mistresss task done and had to appear next day with the same red eyes and the same wan face which displeased miss amory by their want of gayety and caused the mistress to be so angry because the servant persisted in being and looking unwell and unhappy not that blanche ever thought she was a hard mistress indeed she made quite a friend of pincott at times and wrote some very pretty verses about the lonely little tiringmaid whose heart was far away our beloved blanche was a superior being and expected to be waited upon as such and i do not know whether there are any other ladies in this world who treat their servants or dependents so but it may be that there are such and that the tyranny which they exercise over their subordinates and the pangs which they can manage to inflict with a soft voice and a wellbred simper are as cruel as those which a slavedriver administers with an oath and a whip but blanche was a musea delicate little creature quite tremulous with excitability whose eyes filled with tears at the smallest emotion and who knows but that it was the very fineness of her feelings which caused them to be froissed so easily you crush a butterfly by merely touching it vulgar people have no idea of the sensibility of a muse so little pincott being occupied all day and night in stitching hemming ripping combing ironing crimping for her mistress in reading to her when in bedfor the girl was mistress of the two languages and had a sweet voice and mannercould take no share in madame fribsbys soirees nor indeed was she much missed or considered of sufficient consequence to appear at their entertainments but there was another person connected with the clavering establishment who became a constant guest of our friend the milliner this was the chief of the kitchen monsieur mirobolant with whom madame fribsby soon formed an intimacy not having been accustomed to the appearance or society of persons of the french nation the rustic inhabitants of clavering were not so favorably impressed by monsieur alcides manners and appearance as that gentleman might have desired that they should be he walked among them quite unsuspiciously upon the afternoon of a summer day when his services were not required at the house in his usual favorite costume namely his light green frock or paletot his crimson velvet waistcoat with blue glass buttons his pantalon ecossais of a very large and decided check pattern his orange satin neckcloth and his jeanboots with tips of shiny leatherthese with a gold embroidered cap and a richlygilt cane or other varieties of ornament of a similar tendency formed his usual holiday costume in which he flattered himself there was nothing remarkable unless indeed the beauty of his person should attract observation and in which he considered that he exhibited the appearance of a gentleman of good parisian ton he walked then down the street grinning and ogling every woman he met with glances which he meant should kill them outright and peered over the railings and in at the windows where females were in the tranquil summer evening but betsy mrs pybuss maid shrank back with a lor bless us as alcide ogled her over the laurel bush the miss bakers and their mamma stared with wonder and presently a crowd began to follow the interesting foreigner of ragged urchins and children who left their dirtpies in the street to pursue him for some time he thought that admiration was the cause which led these persons in his wake and walked on pleased himself that he could so easily confer on others so much harmless pleasure but the little children and dirtpie manufacturers were presently succeeded by followers of a larger growth and a number of lads and girls from the factory being let loose at this hour joined the mob and began laughing jeering hooting and calling opprobrious names at the frenchman some cried out frenchy frenchy some exclaimed frogs one asked for a lock of his hair which was long and in richlyflowing ringlets and at length the poor artist began to perceive that he was an object of derision rather than of respect to the rude grinning mob it was at this juncture that madame fribsby spied the unlucky gentleman with the train at his heels and heard the scornful shouts with which they assailed him she ran out of her room and across the street to the persecuted foreigner she held out her hand and addressing him in his own language invited him into her abode and when she had housed him fairly within her door she stood bravely at the threshold before the gibing factory girls and boys and said they were a pack of cowards to insult a poor man who could not speak their language and was alone and without protection the little crowd with some ironical cheers and hooting nevertheless felt the force of madame fribsbys vigorous allocution and retreated before her for the old lady was rather respected in the place and her oddity and her kindness had made her many friends there poor mirobolant was grateful indeed to hear the language of his country ever so ill spoken frenchmen pardon our faults in their language much more readily than we excuse their bad english and will face our blunders throughout a long conversation without the least propensity to grin the rescued artist vowed that madame fribsby was his guardian angel and that he had not as yet met with such suavity and politeness among les anglaises he was as courteous and complimentary to her as if it was the fairest and noblest of ladies whom he was addressing for alcide mirobolant paid homage after his fashion to all womankind and never dreamed of a distinction of ranks in the realms of beauty as his phrase was a cream flavored with pineapplea mayonnaise of lobster which he flattered himself was not unworthy of his hand or of her to whom he had the honor to offer it as an homage and a box of preserved fruits of provence were brought by one of the chefs aidsdecamp in a basket the next day to the milliners and were accompanied with a gallant note to the amiable madame fribsbi her kindness alcide said had made a green place in the desert of his existenceher suavity would ever contrast in memory with the grossierete of the rustic population who were not worthy to possess such a jewel an intimacy of the most confidential nature thus sprang up between the milliner and the chef of the kitchen but i do not know whether it was with pleasure or mortification that madame received the declarations of friendship which the young alcide proffered to her for he persisted in calling her la respectable fribsbi la vertueuse fribsbiand in stating that he should consider her as his mother while he hoped she would regard him as her son ah it was not very long ago fribsby thought that words had been addressed to her in that dear french language indicating a different sort of attachment and she sighed as she looked up at the picture of her carabineer for it is surprising how young some peoples hearts remain when their heads have need of a front or a little hairdyeand at this moment madame fribsby as she told young alcide felt as romantic as a girl of eighteen when the conversation took this turnand at their first intimacy madame fribsby was rather inclined so to lead italcide always politely diverged to another subject it was as his mother that he persisted in considering the good milliner he would recognize her in no other capacity and with that relationship the gentle lady was forced to content herself when she found how deeply the artists heart was engaged elsewhere he was not long before he described to her the subject and origin of his passion i declared myself to her said alcide laying his hand on his heart in a manner which was as novel as i am charmed to think it was agreeable where can not love penetrate respectable madame fribsbi cupid is the father of inventioni inquired of the domestics what were the plats of which mademoiselle partook with most pleasure and built up my little battery accordingly on a day when her parents had gone to dine in the world and i am grieved to say that a grossier dinner at a restaurateur in the boulevard or in the palais royal seemed to form the delights of these unrefined persons the charming miss entertained some comrades of the pension and i advised myself to send up a little repast suitable to so delicate young palates her lovely name is blanche the vail of the maiden is white the wreath of roses which she wears is white i determined that my dinner should be as spotless as the snow at her accustomed hour and instead of the rude gigot a leau which was ordinarily served at her too simple table i sent her up a little potage a la reinea la reine blanche i called itas white as her own tintand confectioned with the most fragrant cream and almonds i then offered up at her shrine a filet de merlan a lagnes and a delicate plat which i have designated as eperlan a la saintetherese and of which my charming miss partook with pleasure i followed this by two little entrees of sweetbread and chicken and the only brown thing which i permitted myself in the entertainment was a little roast of lamb which i laid in a meadow of spinaches surrounded with croustillons representing sheep and ornamented with daisies and other savage flowers after this came my second service a pudding a la reine elizabeth who madame fribsbi knows was a maiden princess a dish of opalcolored plovers eggs which i called nid de tourtereaux a la roucoule placing in the midst of them two of those tender volatiles billing each other and confectioned with butter a basket containing little gateaux of apricots which i know all young ladies adore and a jelly of marasquin bland insinuating intoxicating as the glance of beauty this i designated ambroisie de calypso a la souveraine de mon coeur and when the ice was brought inan ice of plombiere and cherrieshow do you think i had shaped them madame fribsbi in the form of two hearts united with an arrow on which i had laid before it entered a bridal vail in cutpaper surmounted by a wreath of virginal orangeflowers i stood at the door to watch the effect of this entry it was but one cry of admiration the three young ladies filled their glasses with the sparkling ay and carried me in a toast i heard iti heard miss speak of mei heard her say tell monsieur mirobolant that we thank himwe admire himwe love him my feet almost failed me as i spoke since that can i have any reason to doubt that the young artist has made some progress in the heart of the english miss i am modest but my glass informs me that i am not illlooking other victories have convinced me of the fact dangerous man cried the milliner the blond misses of albion see nothing in the dull inhabitants of their brumous isle which can compare with the ardor and vivacity of the children of the south we bring our sunshine with us we are frenchmen and accustomed to conquer were it not for this affair of the heart and my determination to marry an anglaise do you think i would stop in this island which is not altogether ungrateful since i have found here a tender mother in the respectable madame fribsbi in this island in this family my genius would use itself in the company of these rusticsthe poesy of my art can not be understood by these carnivorous insularies nothe men are odious but the womenthe women i own dear fribsbi are seducing i have vowed to marry one and as i can not go into your markets and purchase according to the custom of the country i am resolved to adopt another custom and fly with one to gretna green the blonde miss will go she is fascinated her eyes have told me so the white dove wants but the signal to fly have you any correspondence with her asked fribsby in amazement and not knowing whether the young lady or the lover might be laboring under a romantic delusion i correspond with her by means of my art she partakes of dishes which i make expressly for her i insinuate to her thus a thousand hints which as she is perfectly spiritual she receives but i want other intelligences near her there is pincott her maid said madame fribsby who by aptitude or education seemed to have some knowledge of affairs of the heart but the great artists brow darkened at this suggestion madame he said there are points upon which a gallant man ought to silence himself though if he break the secret he may do so with the least impropriety to his best friendhis adopted mother know then that there is a cause why miss pincott should be hostile to mea cause not uncommon with your sexjealousy perfidious monster said the confidante ah no said the artist with a deep bass voice and a tragic accent worthy of the porte st martin and his favorite melodrames not perfidious but fatal yes i am a fatal man madame fribsbi to inspire hopeless passion is my destiny i can not help it that women love me is it my fault that that young woman deperishes and languishes to the view of the eye consumed by a flame which i can not return listen there are others in this family who are similarly unhappy the governess of the young milor has encountered me in my walks and looked at me in a way which can bear but one interpretation and milady herself who is of mature age but who has oriental blood has once or twice addressed compliments to the lonely artist which can admit of no mistake i avoid the household i seek solitude i undergo my destiny i can marry but one and am resolved it shall be to a lady of your nation and if her fortune is sufficient i think miss would be the person who would be most suitable i wish to ascertain what her means are before i lead her to gretna grin whether alcide was as irresistible a conqueror as his namesake or whether he was simply crazy is a point which must be left to the readers judgment but the latter if he has had the benefit of much french acquaintance has perhaps met with men among them who fancied themselves almost as invincible and who if you credit them have made equal havoc in the hearts of les anglaises chapter xxv contains both love and jealousy illustration our readers have already heard sir francis claverings candid opinion of the lady who had given him her fortune and restored him to his native country and home and it must be owned that the baronet was not far wrong in his estimate of his wife and that lady clavering was not the wisest or the best educated of women she had had a couple of years education in europe in a suburb of london which she persisted in calling ackney to her dying day whence she had been summoned to join her father at calcutta at the age of fifteen and it was on her voyage thither on board the ramchunder east indiaman captain bragg in which ship she had two years previously made her journey to europe that she formed the acquaintance of her first husband mr amory who was third mate of the vessel in question we are not going to enter into the early part of lady claverings history but captain bragg under whose charge miss snell went out to her father who was one of the captains consignees and part owner of the ramchunder and many other vessels found reason to put the rebellious rascal of a mate in irons until they reached the cape where the captain left his officer behind and finally delivered his ward to her father at calcutta after a stormy and perilous voyage in which the ramchunder and the cargo and passengers incurred no small danger and damage some months afterward amory made his appearance at calcutta having worked his way out before the mast from the capemarried the rich attorneys daughter in spite of that old speculatorset up as indigo planter and failedset up as agent and failed againset up as editor of the sunderbund pilot and failed againquarreling ceaselessly with his fatherinlaw and his wife during the progress of all these mercantile transactions and disasters and ending his career finally with a crash which compelled him to leave calcutta and go to new south wales it was in the course of these luckless proceedings that mr amory probably made the acquaintance of sir jasper rogers the respected judge of the supreme court of calcutta who has been mentioned before and as the truth must out it was by making an improper use of his fatherinlaws name who could write perfectly well and had no need of an amanuensis that fortune finally forsook mr amory and caused him to abandon all further struggles with her not being in the habit of reading the calcutta lawreports very assiduously the european public did not know of these facts as well as people did in bengal and mrs amory and her father finding her residence in india not a comfortable one it was agreed that the lady should return to europe whither she came with her little daughter betsy or blanche then four years old they were accompanied by betsys nurse who has been presented to the reader in the last chapter as the confidential maid of lady clavering mrs bonner and captain bragg took a house for them in the near neighborhood of his residence in pocklingtonstreet it was a very hard bitter summer and the rain it rained every day for some time after mrs amorys arrival bragg was very pompous and disagreeable perhaps ashamed perhaps anxious to get rid of the indian lady she believed that all the world in london was talking about her husbands disaster and that the king and queen and the court of directors were aware of her unlucky history she had a good allowance from her father she had no call to live in england and she determined to go abroad away she went then glad to escape the gloomy surveillance of the odious bully captain bragg people had no objection to receive her at the continental towns where she stopped and at the various boardinghouses where she royally paid her way she called hackney ackney to be sure though otherwise she spoke english with a little foreign twang very curious and not unpleasant she dressed amazingly she was conspicuous for her love of eating and drinking and prepared curries and pillaws at every boardinghouse which she frequented but her singularities of language and behavior only gave a zest to her society and mrs amory was deservedly popular she was the most goodnatured jovial and generous of women she was up to any party of pleasure by whomsoever proposed she brought three times more champagne and fowls and ham to the picnics than any one else she took endless boxes for the play and tickets for the masked balls and gave them away to every body she paid the boardinghouse people months beforehand she helped poor shabby mustached bucks and dowagers whose remittances had not arrived with constant supplies from her purse and in this way she tramped through europe and appeared at brussels at paris at milan at naples at rome as her fancy led her news of amorys death reached her at the latter place where captain clavering was then staying unable to pay his hotel bill as indeed was his friend the chevalier strong and the goodnatured widow married the descendant of the ancient house of claveringprofessing indeed no particular grief for the scapegrace of a husband whom she had lost we have brought her thus up to the present time when she was mistress of clavering park in the midst of which mr pinckney the celebrated painter portrayed her with her little boy by her side illustration missy followed her mamma in most of her peregrinations and so learned a deal of life she had a governess for some time and after her mothers second marriage the benefit of madame de caramels select pension in the champs elysees when the claverings came to england she of course came with them it was only within a few years after the death of her grandfather and the birth of her little brother that she began to understand that her position in life was altered and that miss amory nobodys daughter was a very small personage in a house compared with master francis clavering heir to an ancient baronetcy and a noble estate but for little frank she would have been an heiress in spite of her father and though she knew and cared not much about money of which she never had any stint and though she was a romantic little muse as we have seen yet she could not reasonably be grateful to the persons who had so contributed to change her condition nor indeed did she understand what the latter really was until she had made some further progress and acquired more accurate knowledge in the world but this was clear that her stepfather was dull and weak that mamma dropped her hs and was not refined in manners or appearance and that little frank was a spoiled quarrelsome urchin always having his way always treading upon her feet always upsetting his dinner on her dresses and keeping her out of her inheritance none of these as she felt could comprehend her and her solitary heart naturally pined for other attachments and she sought around her where to bestow the precious boon of her unoccupied affection this dear girl then from want of sympathy or other cause made herself so disagreeable at home and frightened her mother and bored her stepfather so much that they were quite as anxious as she could be that she should settle for herself in life and hence sir francis claverings desire expressed to his friend in the last chapter that mrs strong should die and that he would take blanche to himself as a second mrs strong but as this could not be any other person was welcome to win her and a smart young fellow welllooking and welleducated like our friend arthur pendennis was quite free to propose for her if he had a mind and would have been received with open arms by lady clavering as a soninlaw had he had the courage to come forward as a competitor for miss amorys hand mr pen however besides other drawbacks chose to entertain an extreme diffidence about himself he was ashamed of his late failures of his idle and nameless condition of the poverty which he had brought on his mother by his folly and there was as much of vanity as remorse in his present state of doubt and distrust how could he ever hope for such a prize as this brilliant blanche amory who lived in a fine park and mansion and was waited on by a score of grand domestics while a maidservant brought in their meager meal at fairoaks and his mother was obliged to pinch and manage to make both ends meet obstacles seemed to him insurmountable which would have vanished had he marched manfully upon them and he preferred despairing or dallying with his wishesor perhaps he had not positively shaped them as yetto attempting to win gallantly the object of his desire many a young man fails by that species of vanity called shyness who might for the asking have his will but we do not pretend to say that pen had as yet ascertained his or that he was doing much more than thinking about falling in love miss amory was charming and lively she fascinated and cajoled him by a thousand arts or natural graces or flatteries but there were lurking reasons and doubts besides shyness and vanity withholding him in spite of her cleverness and her protestations and her fascinations pens mother had divined the girl and did not trust her mrs pendennis saw blanche lightminded and frivolous detected many wants in her which offended the pure and piousminded lady a want of reverence for her parents and for things more sacred helen thought worldliness and selfishness couched under pretty words and tender expressions laura and pen battled these points strongly at first with the widowlaura being as yet enthusiastic about her new friend and pen not fargone enough in love to attempt any concealment of his feelings he would laugh at these objections of helens and say psha mother you are jealous about lauraall women are jealous but when in the course of a month or two and by watching the pair with that anxiety with which brooding women watch over their sons affectionsand in acknowledging which i have no doubt there is a sexual jealousy on the mothers part and a secret pangwhen helen saw that the intimacy appeared to make progress that the two young people were perpetually finding pretexts to meet and that miss blanche was at fairoaks or mr pen at the park every day the poor widows heart began to fail herher darling project seemed to vanish before her and giving way to her weakness she fairly told pen one day what her views and longings were that she felt herself breaking and not long for this world and that she hoped and prayed before she went that she might see her two children one the late events pens life and career and former passion for the actress had broken the spirit of this tender lady she felt that he had escaped her and was in the maternal nest no more and she clung with a sickening fondness to laura laura who had been left to her by francis in heaven pen kissed and soothed her in his grand patronizing way he had seen something of this he had long thought his mother wanted to make this marriagedid laura know any thing of it not shemrs pendennis saidnot for worlds would she have breathed a word of it to laurawell well there was time enough his mother wouldnt die pen said laughingly he wouldnt hear of any such thing and as for the muse she is too grand a lady to think about poor little meand as for laura who knows that she would have me she would do any thing you told her to be sure but am i worthy of her oh pen you might be was the widows reply not that mr pen ever doubted that he was and a feeling of indefinable pleasure and selfcomplacency came over him as he thought over this proposal and imaged laura to himself as his memory remembered her for years past always fair and open kindly and pious cheerful tender and true he looked at her with brightening eyes as she came in from the garden at the end of this talk her cheeks rather flushed her looks frank and smilinga basket of roses in her hand she took the finest of them and brought it to mrs pendennis who was refreshed by the odor and color of these flowers and hung over her fondly and gave it to her and i might have this prize for the asking pen thought with a thrill of triumph as he looked at the kindly girl why she is as beautiful and as generous as her roses the image of the two women remained forever after in his mind and he never recalled it but the tears came into his eyes before very many weeks intimacy with her new acquaintance however miss laura was obliged to give in to helens opinion and own that the muse was selfish unkind and inconstant of course blanche confided to her bosom friend all the little griefs and domestic annoyances how the family could not comprehend her and she moved among them an isolated being how her poor mammas education had been neglected and she was forced to blush for her blunders how sir francis was a weak person deplorably unintellectual and only happy when smoking his odious cigars how since the birth of her little brother she had seen her mothers precious affection which she valued more than any thing in life estranged from her once darling daughter how she was alone alone alone in the world but these griefs real and heartrending though they might be to a young lady of exquisite sensibility did not convince laura of the propriety of blanches conduct in many small incidents of life little frank for instance might be very provoking and might have deprived blanche of her mammas affection but this was no reason why blanche should box the childs ears because he upset a glass of water over her drawing and why she should call him many opprobrious names in the english and french language and the preference accorded to little frank was certainly no reason why blanche should give herself imperial airs of command toward the boys governess and send that young lady upon messages through the house to bring her book or to fetch her pockethandkerchief when a domestic performed an errand for honest laura she was always thankful and pleased whereas she could not but perceive that the little muse had not the slightest scruple in giving her commands to all the world round about her and in disturbing any bodys ease or comfort in order to administer to her own it was lauras first experience in friendship and it pained the kind creatures heart to be obliged to give up as delusions one by one those charms and brilliant qualities in which her fancy had dressed her new friend and to find that the fascinating little fairy was but a mortal and not a very amiable mortal after all what generous person is there that has not been so deceived in his timewhat person perhaps that has not so disappointed others in his turn illustrationmoved up from after the scene with little frank in which that refractory son and heir of the house of clavering had received the compliments in french and english and the accompanying box on the ear from his sister miss laura who had plenty of humor could not help calling to mind some very touching and tender verses which the muse had read to her out of mes larmes and which began my pretty baby brother may angels guard thy rest in which the muse after complimenting the baby upon the station in life which it was about to occupy and contrasting it with her own lonely condition vowed nevertheless that the angel boy would never enjoy such affection as hers was or find in the false world before him any thing so constant and tender as a sisters heart it may be the forlorn one said it may be you will slight it my pretty baby sweet you will spurn me from your bosom ill cling around your feet oh let me let me love you the world will prove to you as false as tis to others but i am ever true and behold the muse was boxing the darling brothers ears instead of kneeling at his feet and giving miss laura her first lesson in the cynical philosophynot quite her first howeversomething like this selfishness and waywardness something like this contrast between practice and poetry between grand versified aspirations and everyday life she had witnessed at home in the person of our young friend mr pen but then pen was different pen was a man it seemed natural somehow that he should be selfwilled and should have his own way and under his waywardness and selfishness indeed there was a kind and generous heart o it was hard that such a diamond should be changed away against such a false stone as this in a word laura began to be tired of her admired blanche she had assayed her and found her not true and her former admiration and delight which she had expressed with her accustomed generous artlessness gave way to a feeling which we shall not call contempt but which was very near it and which caused laura to adopt toward miss amory a grave and tranquil tone of superiority which was at first by no means to the muses liking nobody likes to be found out or having held a high place to submit to step down the consciousness that this event was impending did not serve to increase miss blanches good humor and as it made her peevish and dissatisfied with herself it probably rendered her even less agreeable to the persons round about her so there arose one fatal day a battleroyal between dearest blanche and dearest laura in which the friendship between them was all but slain outright dearest blanche had been unusually capricious and wicked on this day she had been insolent to her mother savage with little frank odiously impertinent in her behavior to the boys governess and intolerably cruel to pincott her attendant not venturing to attack her friend for the little tyrant was of a timid feline nature and only used her claws upon those who were weaker than herself she maltreated all these and especially poor pincott who was menial confidante companion slave always according to the caprice of her young mistress this girl who had been sitting in the room with the young ladies being driven thence in tears occasioned by the cruelty of her mistress and raked with a parting sarcasm as she went sobbing from the door laura fairly broke out into a loud and indignant invectivewondered how one so young could forget the deference owing to her elders as well as to her inferiors in station and professing so much sensibility of her own could torture the feelings of others so wantonly laura told her friend that her conduct was absolutely wicked and that she ought to ask pardon of heaven on her knees for it and having delivered herself of a hot and voluble speech whereof the delivery astonished the speaker as much almost as her auditor she ran to her bonnet and shawl and went home across the park in a great flurry and perturbation and to the surprise of mrs pendennis who had not expected her until night alone with helen laura gave an account of the scene and gave up her friend henceforth o mamma she said you were right blanche who seems so soft and so kind is as you have said selfish and cruel she who is always speaking of her affections can have no heart no honest girl would afflict a mother so or torture a dependent andand i give her up from this day and i will have no other friend but you on this the two ladies went through the osculatory ceremony which they were in the habit of performing and mrs pendennis got a great secret comfort from the little quarrelfor lauras confession seemed to say that girl can never be a wife for pen for she is lightminded and heartless and quite unworthy of our noble hero he will be sure to find out her unworthiness for his own part and then he will be saved from this flighty creature and awake out of his delusion but miss laura did not tell mrs pendennis perhaps did not acknowledge to herself what had been the real cause of the days quarrel being in a very wicked mood and bent upon mischief every where the little wicked muse of a blanche had very soon begun her tricks her darling laura had come to pass a long day and as they were sitting in her own room together had chosen to bring the conversation round to the subject of mr pen i am afraid he is sadly fickle miss blanche observed mrs pybus and many more clavering people have told us all about the actress i was quite a child when it happened and i dont know any thing about it laura answered blushing very much he used her very ill blanche said wagging her little head he was false to her i am sure he was not laura cried out he acted most generously by her he wanted to give up every thing to marry her it was she that was false to him he nearly broke his heart about it he i thought you didnt know any thing about the story dearest interposed miss blanche mamma has said so said laura well he is very clever continued the other little dear what a sweet poet he is have you ever read his poems only the fisherman and the diver which he translated for us and his prize poem which didnt get the prize and indeed i thought it very pompous and prosy laura said laughing has he never written you any poems then love asked miss amory no my dear said miss bell blanche ran up to her friend kissed her fondly called her my dearest laura at least three times looked her archly in the face nodded her head and said promise to tell noobody and i will show you something and tripping across the room daintily to a little motherofpearl inlaid desk she opened it with a silver key and took out two or three papers crumpled and rather stained with green which she submitted to her friend laura took them and read them they were loveverses sure enoughsomething about undineabout a naiadabout a river she looked at them for a long time but in truth the lines were not very distinct before her eyes and you have answered them blanche she asked putting them back o no not for worlds dearest the other said and when her dearest laura had quite done with the verses she tripped back and popped them again into the pretty desk then she went to her piano and sang two or three songs of rossini whose flourishes of music her flexible little voice could execute to perfection and laura sate by vaguely listening as she performed these pieces what was miss bell thinking about the while she hardly knew but sate there silent as the songs rolled by after this concert the young ladies were summoned to the room where luncheon was served and whither they of course went with their arms round each others waists and it could not have been jealousy or anger on lauras part which had made her silent for after they had tripped along the corridor and descended the steps and were about to open the door which leads into the hall laura paused and looking her friend kindly and frankly in the face kissed her with a sisterly warmth something occurred after thismaster franks manner of eating probably or mammas blunders or sir francis smelling of cigarswhich vexed miss blanche and she gave way to that series of naughtinesses whereof we have spoken and which ended in the above little quarrel chapter xxvi a house full of visitors illustration the difference between the girls did not last long laura was always too eager to forgive and be forgiven and as for miss blanche her hostilities never very long or durable had not been provoked by the above scene nobody cares about being accused of wickedness no vanity is hurt by that sort of charge blanche was rather pleased than provoked by her friends indignation which never would have been raised but for a cause which both knew though neither spoke of and so laura with a sigh was obliged to confess that the romantic part of her first friendship was at an end and that the object of it was only worthy of a very ordinary sort of regard as for blanche she instantly composed a copy of touching verses setting forth her desertion and disenchantment it was only the old story she wrote of love meeting with coldness and fidelity returned by neglect and some new neighbors arriving from london about this time in whose family there were daughters miss amory had the advantage of selecting an eternal friend from one of these young ladies and imparting her sorrows and disappointments to this new sister the tall footmen came but seldom now with notes to the sweet laura the ponycarriage was but rarely dispatched to fairoaks to be at the orders of the ladies there blanche adopted a sweet look of suffering martyrdom when laura came to see her the other laughed at her friends sentimental mood and treated it with a good humor that was by no means respectful but if miss blanche found new female friends to console her the faithful historian is also bound to say that she discovered some acquaintances of the other sex who seemed to give her consolation too if ever this artless young creature met a young man and had ten minutes conversation with him in a garden walk in a drawingroom window or in the intervals of a waltz she confided in him so to speakmade play with her beautiful eyesspoke in a tone of tender interest and simple and touching appeal and left him to perform the same pretty little drama in behalf of his successor when the claverings first came down to the park there were very few audiences before whom miss blanche could perform hence pen had all the benefits of her glances and confidences and the drawingroom window or the garden walk all to himself in the town of clavering it has been said there were actually no young men in the near surrounding country only a curate or two or a rustic young squire with large feet and illmade clothes to the dragoons quartered at chatteries the baronet made no overtures it was unluckily his own regiment he had left it on bad terms with some officers of the corpsan ugly business about a horse bargaina disputed play accountblindhookeya white featherwho need askit is not our business to inquire too closely into the bygones of our characters except in so far as their previous history appertains to the development of this present story but the autumn and the end of the parliamentary session and the london season brought one or two country families down to their houses and filled tolerably the neighboring little wateringplace of baymouth and opened our friend mr bingleys theater royal at chatteries and collected the usual company at the assizes and raceballs there up to this time the old county families had been rather shy of our friends of clavering park the fogys of drummington the squares of tozely park the welbores of the barrow c all sorts of stories were current among these folks regarding the family at claveringindeed nobody ought to say that people in the country have no imagination who heard them talk about new neighbors about sir francis and his lady and her birth and parentage about miss amory about captain strong there had been endless histories which need not be recapitulated and the family of the park had been three months in the country before the great people around began to call but at the end of the season the earl of trehawke lord lieutenant of the county coming to eyrie castle and the countess dowager of rockminster whose son was also a magnate of the land to occupy a mansion on the marine parade at baymouththese great folks came publicly immediately and in state to call upon the family of clavering park and the carriages of the county families speedily followed in the track which had been left in the avenue by their lordly wheels it was then that mirobolant began to have an opportunity of exercising that skill which he possessed and of forgetting in the occupations of his art the pangs of love it was then that the large footmen were too much employed at clavering park to be able to bring messages or dally over the cup of small beer with the poor little maids at fairoaks it was then that blanche found other dear friends than laura and other places to walk in besides the river side where pen was fishing he came day after day and whipped the stream but the fish fish wouldnt do their duty nor the peri appear and here though in strict confidence and with a request that the matter go no further we may as well allude to a delicate business of which previous hint has been given mention has been made in a former page of a certain hollow tree at which pen used to take his station when engaged in his passion for miss fotheringay and the cavity of which he afterward used for other purposes than to insert his baits and fishingcans in the truth is he converted this tree into a postoffice under a piece of moss and a stone he used to put little poems or letters equally poetical which were addressed to a certain undine or naiad who frequented the stream and which once or twice were replaced by a receipt in the shape of a flower or by a modest little word or two of acknowledgment written in a delicate hand in french or english and on pink scented paper certainly miss amory used to walk by this stream as we have seen and it is a fact that she used pink scented paper for her correspondence but after the great folks had invaded clavering park and the family coach passed out of the lodgegates evening after evening on their way to the other great country houses nobody came to fetch pens letters at the postoffice the white paper was not exchanged for the pink but lay undisturbed under its stone and its moss while the tree was reflected into the stream and the brawl went rolling by there was not much in the letters certainly in the pink notes scarcely any thingmerely a little word or two half jocular half sympathetic such as might be written by any young lady but oh you silly pendennis if you wanted this one why did you not speak perhaps neither party was in earnest you were only playing at being in love and the sportive little undine was humoring you at the same play but if a man is balked at this game he not unfrequently loses his temper and when nobody came any more for pens poems he began to look upon those compositions in a very serious light he felt almost tragical and romantic again as in his first affair of the heartat any rate he was bent upon having an explanation one day he went to the hall and there was a roomfull of visitors on another miss amory was not to be seen she was going to a ball that night and was lying down to take a little sleep pen cursed balls and the narrowness of his means and the humility of his position in the county that caused him to be passed over by the givers of these entertainments on a third occasion miss amory was in the garden and he ran thither she was walking there in state with no less personages than the bishop and bishopess of chatteries and the episcopal family who scowled at him and drew up in great dignity when he was presented to them and they heard his name the right reverend prelate had heard it before and also of the little transaction in the deans garden the bishop says youre a sad young man goodnatured lady clavering whispered to him what have you been a doing of nothink i hope to vex such a dear mar as yours how is your dear mar why dont she come and see me we ant seen her this ever such a time were a goin about a gaddin so that we dont see no neighbors now give my love to her and laurar and come all to dinner tomorrow mrs pendennis was too unwell to come out but laura and pen came and there was a great party and pen only got an opportunity of a hurried word with miss amory you never come to the river now he said i cant said blanche the house is full of people undine has left the stream mr pen went on choosing to be poetical she never ought to have gone there miss amory answered she wont go again it was very foolish very wrong it was only play besides you have other consolations at home she added looking him full in the face an instant and dropping her eyes if he wanted her why did he not speak then she might have said yes even then but as she spoke of other consolations at home he thought of laura so affectionate and so pure and of his mother at home who had bent her fond heart upon uniting him with her adopted daughter blanche he began in a vexed tonemiss amory laura is looking at us mr pendennis the young lady said i must go back to the company and she ran off leaving mr pendennis to bite his nails in perplexity and to look out into the moonlight in the garden laura indeed was looking at pen she was talking with or appearing to listen to the talk of mr pynsent lord rockminsters son and grandson of the dowager lady who was seated in state in the place of honor gravely receiving lady claverings bad grammar and patronizing the vacuous sir francis whose interest in the county she was desirous to secure pynsent and pen had been at oxbridge together where the latter during his heyday of good fortune and fashion had been the superior of the young patrician and perhaps rather supercilious toward him they had met for the first time since they parted at the university at the table today and given each other that exceedingly impertinent and amusing deminod of recognition which is practiced in england only and only to perfection by university menand which seems to say confound youwhat do you do here i knew that man at oxbridge mr pynsent said to miss bella mr pendennis i think yes said miss bell he seems rather sweet upon miss amory the gentleman went on laura looked at them and perhaps thought so too but said nothing a man of large property in the county aint he he used to talk about representing it he used to speak at the union whereabouts do his estates lie laura smiled his estates lie on the other side of the river near the lodge gate he is my cousin and i live there where asked mr pynsent with a laugh why on the other side of the river at fairoaks answered miss bell many pheasants there cover looks rather good said the simple gentleman laura smiled again we have nine hens and a cock a pig and an old pointer pendennis dont preserve then continued mr pynsent you should come and see him the girl said laughing and greatly amused at the notion that her pen was a great county gentleman and perhaps had given himself out to be such indeed i quite long to renew our acquaintance mr pynsent said gallantly and with a look which fairly said it is you that i would like to come and seeto which look and speech miss laura vouchsafed a smile and made a little bow here blanche came stepping up with her most fascinating smile and ogle and begged dear laura to come and take the second in a song laura was ready to do any thing goodnatured and went to the piano by which mr pynsent listened as long as the duet lasted and until miss amory began for herself when he strode away what a nice frank amiable wellbred girl that is wagg said mr pynsent to a gentleman who had come over with him from baymouththe tall one i mean with the ringlets and the red lipsmonstrous red aint they what do you think of the girl of the house asked mr wagg i think shes a lean scraggy humbug said mr pynsent with great candor she drags her shoulders out of her dress she never lets her eyes alone and she goes simpering and ogling about like a french waitingmaid pynsent be civil cried the other somebody can hear oh its pendennis of boniface mr pynsent said fine evening mr pendennis we were just talking of your charming cousin any relation to my old friend major pendennis asked mr wagg his nephew had the pleasure of meeting you at gaunt house mr pen said with his very best airthe acquaintance between the gentleman was made in an instant in the afternoon of the next day the two gentleman who were staying at clavering park were found by mr pen on his return from a fishing excursion in which he had no sport seated in his mothers drawingroom in comfortable conversation with the widow and her ward mr pynsent tall and gaunt with large red whiskers and an imposing tuft to his chin was striding over a chair in the intimate neighborhood of miss laura she was amused by his talk which was simple straightforward rather humorous and keen and interspersed with homely expressions of a style which is sometimes called slang it was the first specimen of a young london dandy that laura had seen or heard for she had been but a chit at the time of mr fokers introduction at fairoaks nor indeed was that ingenuous gentleman much more than a boy and his refinement was only that of a school and college mr wagg as he entered the fairoaks premises with his companion eyed and noted every thing old gardener he said seeing mr john at the lodgeold red livery waistcoatclothes hanging out to dry on the gooseberry bushesblue aprons white ducksgad they must be young pendenniss white ducksnobody else wears em in the family rather a shy place for a sucking county member ay pynsent snug little crib said mr pynsent pretty cozy little lawn mr pendennis at home old gentleman mr wagg said to the old domestic john answered no master pendennis was agone out are the ladies at home asked the younger visitor mr john answered yes they be and as the pair walked over the trim gravel and by the neat shrubberies up the steps to the halldoor which old john opened mr wagg noted every thing that he saw the barometer and the letterbag the umbrellas and the ladies clogs pens hats and tartan wrapper and old john opening the drawingroom door to introduce the new comers such minutiae attracted wagg instinctively he seized them in spite of himself old fellow does all the work he whispered to pynsent caleb balderstone shouldnt wonder if hes the housemaid the next minute the pair were in the presence of the fairoaks ladies in whom pynsent could not help recognizing two perfectly wellbred ladies and to whom mr wagg made his obeisance with florid bows and extra courtesy accompanied with an occasional knowing leer at his companion mr pynsent did not choose to acknowledge these signals except by extreme haughtiness toward mr wagg and particular deference to the ladies if there was one thing laughable in mr waggs eyes it was poverty he had the soul of a butler who had been brought from his pantry to make fun in the drawingroom his jokes were plenty and his goodnature thoroughly genuine but he did not seem to understand that a gentleman could wear an old coat or that a lady could be respectable unless she had her carriage or employed a french milliner charming place maam said he bowing to the widow noble prospectdelightful to us cockneys who seldom see any thing but pallmall the widow said simply she had never been in london but once in her lifebefore her son was born fine village maam fine village said mr wagg and increasing every day itll be quite a large town soon its not a bad place to live in for those who cant get the country and will repay a visit when you honor it my brother major pendennis has often mentioned your name to us the widow said and we have been very much amused by some of your droll books sir helen continued who never could be brought to like mr waggs books and detested their tone most thoroughly he is my very good friend mr wagg said with a low bow and one of the best known men about town and where known maam appreciatedi assure you appreciated he is with our friend steyne at aixlachapelle steyne has a touch of the gout and so between ourselves has your brother i am going to stillbrook for the pheasantshooting and afterward to bareacres where pendennis and i shall probably meet and he poured out a flood of fashionable talk introducing the names of a score of peers and rattling on with breathless spirits while the simple widow listened in silent wonder what a man she thought are all the men of fashion in london like this i am sure pen will never be like him mr pynsent was in the mean while engaged with miss laura he named some of the houses in the neighborhood whither he was going and hoped very much that he should see miss bell at some of them he hoped that her aunt would give her a season in london he said that in the next parliament it was probable that he should canvass the county and he hoped to get pendenniss interest here he spoke of pens triumph as an orator at oxbridge and asked was he coming into parliament too he talked on very pleasantly and greatly to lauras satisfaction until pen himself appeared and as has been said found these gentlemen pen behaved very courteously to the pair now that they had found their way into his quarters and though he recollected with some twinges a conversation at oxbridge when pynsent was present and in which after a great debate at the union and in the midst of considerable excitement produced by a supper and champagnecuphe had announced his intention of coming in for his native county and had absolutely returned thanks in a fine speech as the future member yet mr pynsents manner was so frank and cordial that pen hoped pynsent might have forgotten his little fanfaronade and any other braggadocio speeches or actions which he might have made he suited himself to the tone of the visitors then and talked about plinlimmon and magnus charters and the old set at oxbridge with careless familiarity and highbred ease as if he lived with marquises every day and a duke was no more to him than a village curate but at this juncture and it being then six oclock in the evening betsy the maid who did not know of the advent of strangers walked into the room without any preliminary but that of flinging the door wide open before her and bearing in her arms a tray containing three teacups a teapot and a plate of thick breadandbutter all pens splendor and magnificence vanished away at thisand he faltered and became quite abashed what will they think of us he thought and indeed wagg thrust his tongue in his cheek thought the tea infinitely contemptible and leered and winked at pynsent to that effect but to mr pynsent the transaction appeared perfectly simplethere was no reason present to his mind why people should not drink tea at six if they were minded as well as at any other hour and he asked of mr wagg when they went away what the devil he was grinning and winking at and what amused him didnt you see how the cub was ashamed of the thick breadandbutter i dare say theyre going to have treacle if they are good ill take an opportunity of telling old pendennis when we get back to town mr wagg chuckled out dont see the fun said mr pynsent never thought you did growled wagg between his teeth and they walked home rather sulkily wagg told the story at dinner very smartly with wonderful accuracy of observation he described old john the clothes that were drying the clogs in the hall the drawingroom and its furniture and picturesold man with a beak and bald headfeu pendennis i bet two to one stickingplaster fulllength of a youth in a cap and gownthe present marquis of fairoaks of course the widow when young in a miniature mrs mee she had the gown on when we came or a dress made the year after and the tips cut off the fingers of her gloves which she stitches her sons collars with and then the sarving maid came in with their teas and so we left the earl and the countess to their breadandbutter blanche near whom he sate as he told this story and who adored les hommes desprit burst out laughing and called him such an odd droll creature but pynsent who began to be utterly disgusted with him broke out in a loud voice and said i dont know mr wagg what sort of ladies you are accustomed to meet in your own family but by gad as far as a first acquaintance can show i never met two betterbred women in my life and i hope maam youll call upon em he added addressing lady rockminster who was seated at sir francis claverings right hand sir francis turned to the guest on his left and whispered thats what i call a sticker for wagg and lady clavering giving the young gentleman a delighted tap with her fan winked her black eyes at him and said mr pynsent youre a good feller after the affair with blanche a difference ever so slight a tone of melancholy perhaps a little bitter might be perceived in lauras converse with her cousin she seemed to weigh him and find him wanting too the widow saw the girls clear and honest eyes watching the young man at times and a look of almost scorn pass over her face as he lounged in the room with the women or lazily sauntered smoking upon the lawn or lolled under a tree there over a book which he was too listless to read what has happened between you eagersighted helen asked of the girl something has happened has that wicked little blanche been making mischief tell me laura nothing has happened at all laura said then why do you look at pen so asked his mother quickly look at him dear mother said the girl we two women are no society for him we dont interest him we are not clever enough for such a genius as pen he wastes his life and energies away among us tied to our apronstrings he interests himself in nothing he scarcely cares to go beyond the gardengate even captain glanders and captain strong pall upon him she added with a bitter laugh and they are men you know and our superiors he will never be happy while he is here why is he not facing the world and without a profession we have got enough with great economy said the widow her heart beginning to beat violently pen has spent nothing for months im sure he is very good i am sure he might be very happy with us dont agitate yourself so dear mother the girl answered i dont like to see you so you should not be sad because pen is unhappy here all men are so they must work they must make themselves names and a place in the world look the two captains have fought and seen battles that mr pynsent who came here and who will be very rich is in a public office he works very hard he aspires to a name and a reputation he says pen was one of the best speakers at oxbridge and had as great a character for talent as any of the young gentlemen there pen himself laughs at mr waggs celebrity and indeed he is a horrid person and says he is a dunce and that any body could write his books i am sure they are odious and vulgar interposed the widow yet he has a reputationyou see the county chronicle says the celebrated mr wagg has been sojourning at baymouthlet our fashionables and eccentrics look out for something from his caustic pen if pen can write better than this gentleman and speak better than mr pynsent why doesnt he mamma he cant make speeches to us or distinguish himself here he ought to go away indeed he ought dear laura said helen taking the girls hand is it kind of you to hurry him so i have been waiting i have been saving up money these many monthstoto pay back your advance to us hush mother laura cried embracing her friend hastily it was your money not mine never speak about that again how much money have you saved helen said there were more than two hundred pounds at the bank and that she would be enabled to pay off all lauras money by the end of the next year give it himlet him have the two hundred pounds let him go to london and be a lawyer be something be worthy of his motherand of mine dearest mamma said the good girl upon which and with her usual tenderness and emotion the fond widow declared that laura was a blessing to her and the best of girlsand i hope no one in this instance will be disposed to contradict her the widow and her daughter had more than one conversation on this subject and the elder gave way to the superior reason of the honest and stronger minded girl and indeed whenever there was a sacrifice to be made on her part this kind lady was only too eager to make it but she took her own way and did not lose sight of the end she had in view in imparting these new plans to pen one day she told him of these projects and who it was that had formed them how it was laura who insisted upon his going to london and studying how it was laura who would not hear of thethe money arrangements when he came back from oxbridgebeing settled just then how it was laura whom he had to thank if indeed he thought that he ought to go at that news pens countenance blazed up with pleasure and he hugged his mother to his heart with an ardor that i fear disappointed the fond lady but she rallied when he said by heaven she is a noble girl and may god almighty bless her o mother i have been wearing myself away for months here longing to work and not knowing how ive been fretting over the thoughts of my shame and my debts and my past cursed extravagance and follies ive suffered infernally my heart has been halfbrokennever mind about thatif i can get a chance to redeem the past and to do my duty to myself and the best mother in the world indeed indeed i will ill be worthy of you yet heaven bless you god bless laura why isnt she here that i may go and thank her pen went on with more incoherent phrases paced up and down the room drank glasses of water jumped about his mother with a thousand embracesbegan to laughbegan to singwas happier than she had seen him since he was a boysince he had tasted of the fruit of that awful tree of life which from the beginning has tempted all mankind laura was not at home laura was on a visit to the stately lady rockminster daughter to my lord bareacres sister to the late lady pontypool and by consequence a distant kinswoman of helens as her ladyship who was deeply versed in genealogy was the first graciously to point out to the modest country lady mr pen was greatly delighted at the relationship being acknowledged though perhaps not over well pleased that lady rockminster took miss bell home with her for a couple of days to baymouth and did not make the slightest invitation to mr arthur pendennis there was to be a ball at baymouth and it was to be miss lauras first appearance the dowager came to fetch her in her carriage and she went off with a white dress in her box happy and blushing like the rose to which pen compared her this was the night of the balla public entertainment at the baymouth hotel by jove said pen ill ride overno i wont ride but ill go too his mother was charmed that he should do so and as he was debating about the conveyance in which he should start for baymouth captain strong called opportunely said he was going himself and that he would put his horse the butcher boy into the gig and drive pen over when the grand company began to fill the house at clavering park the chevalier strong who as his patron said was never in the way or out of it seldom intruded himself upon its society but went elsewhere to seek his relaxation ive seen plenty of grand dinners in my time he said and dined by jove in a company where there was a king and royal duke at top and bottom and every man along the table had six stars on his coat but dammy glanders this finery dont suit me and the english ladies with their confounded buckram airs and the squires with their politics after dinner send me to sleepsink me dead if they dont i like a place where i can blow my cigar when the cloth is removed and when im thirsty have my beer in its native pewter so on a gala day at clavering park the chevalier would content himself with superintending the arrangements of the table and drilling the majordomo and servants and having looked over the bill of fare with monsieur mirobolant would not care to take the least part in the banquet send me up a cutlet and a bottle of claret to my room this philosopher would say and from the windows of that apartment which commanded the terrace and avenue he would survey the company as they arrived in their carriages or take a peep at the ladies in the hall through an oeildeboeuf which commanded it from his corridor and the guests being seated strong would cross the park to captain glanderss cottage at clavering or to pay the landlady a visit at the clavering arms or to drop in upon madame fribsby over her novel and tea wherever the chevalier went he was welcome and whenever he came away a smell of hot brandy and water lingered behind him the butcher boynot the worst horse in sir franciss stablewas appropriated to captain strongs express use and the old campaigner saddled him or brought him home at all hours of the day or night and drove or rode him up and down the country where there was a publichouse with a good tap of beerwhere there was a tenant with a pretty daughter who played on the pianoto chatteries to the play or the barracksto baymouth if any fun was on foot there to the rural fairs or races the chevalier and his brown horse made their way continually and this worthy gentleman lived at free quarters in a friendly country the butcher boy soon took pen and the chevalier to baymouth the latter was as familiar with the hotel and landlord there as with every other inn round about and having been accommodated with a bedroom to dress they entered the ballroom the chevalier was splendid he wore three little gold crosses in a brochette on the portly breast of his blue coat and looked like a foreign fieldmarshal the ball was public and all sorts of persons were admitted and encouraged to come young pynsent having views upon the county and lady rockminster being patroness of the ball there was a quadrille for the aristocracy at one end and select benches for the people of fashion toward this end the chevalier did not care to penetrate far as he said he did not care for the nobs but in the other part of the room he knew every bodythe winemerchants innkeepers tradesmens solicitors squirefarmers daughters their sires and brothers and plunged about shaking hands who is that man with the blue ribbon and the threepointed star asked pen a gentleman in black with ringlets and a tuft stood gazing fiercely about him with one hand in the armhole of his waistcoat and the other held his claque by jupiter its mirobolant cried strong bursting out laughing bon jour chefbon jour chevalier de la croix de juillet chevalier said the chef laying his hand on his decoration by jove heres some more ribbon said pen amused a man with very black hair and whiskers dyed evidently with the purple of tyre with twinkling eyes and white eyelashes and a thousand wrinkles in his face which was of a strange red color with two undervests and large gloves and hands and a profusion of diamonds and jewels in his waistcoat and stock with coarse feet crumpled into immense shiny boots and a piece of particolored ribbon in his buttonhole here came up and nodded familiarly to the chevalier the chevalier shook hands my friend mr pendennis strong said colonel altamont of the body guard of his highness the nawaub of lucknow that officer bowed to the salute of pen who was now looking out eagerly to see if the person he wanted had entered the room not yet but the band began presently performing see the conquering hero comes and a host of fashionablesdowager countess of rockminster mr pynsent and miss bell sir francis clavering bart of clavering park lady clavering and miss amory sir horace fogey bart lady fogey colonel and mrs higgs wagg esq as the county paper afterward described them entered the room pen rushed by blanche ran up to laura and seized her hand god bless you he said i want to speak to youi must speak to youlet me dance with you not for three dances dear pen she said smiling and he fell back biting his nails with vexation and forgetting to salute pynsent after lady rockminsters party lady claverings followed in the procession colonel altamont eyed it hard holding a most musky pockethandkerchief up to his face and bursting with laughter behind it whos the gal in green along with em capn he asked of strong thats miss amory lady claverings daughter replied the chevalier the colonel could hardly contain himself for laughing chapter xxvii contains some ballpracticing illustration under some calico draperies in the shady embrasure of a window arthur pendennis chose to assume a very gloomy and frowning countenance and to watch miss bell dance her first quadrille with mr pynsent for a partner that gentleman was as solemn and severe as englishmen are upon such occasions and walked through the dance as he would have walked up to his pew in church without a smile upon his face or allowing any outward circumstance to interfere with his attention to the grave duty in which he was engaged but miss lauras face was beaming with pleasure and goodnature the lights and the crowd and music excited her as she spread out her white robes and performed her part of the dance smiling and happy her brown ringlets flowing back over her fair shoulders from her honest rosy face more than one gentleman in the room admired and looked after her and lady fogey who had a house in london and gave herself no small airs of fashion when in the country asked of lady rockminster who the young person was mentioned a reigning beauty in london whom in her ladyships opinion laura was rather like and pronounced that she would do lady rockminster would have been very much surprised if any protegee of hers would not do and wondered at lady fogeys impudence in judging upon the point at all she surveyed laura with majestic glances through her eyeglass she was pleased with the girls artless looks and gay innocent manner her manner is very good her ladyship thought her arms are rather red but that is a defect of her youth her ton is far better than that of the little pert miss amory who is dancing opposite to her miss blanche was indeed the visavis of miss laura and smiled most killingly upon her dearest friend and nodded to her and talked to her when they met during the quadrille evolutions and patronized her a great deal her shoulders were the whitest in the whole room and they were never easy in her frock for one single instant nor were her eyes which rolled about incessantly nor was her little figureit seemed to say to all the people come and look at menot at that pink healthy bouncing country lass miss bell who scarcely knew how to dance till i taught her this is the true parisian mannerthis is the prettiest little foot in the room and the prettiest little chaussure too look at it mr pynsent look at it mr pendennis you who are scowling behind the curtaini know you are longing to dance with me laura went on dancing and keeping an attentive eye upon mr pen in the embrasure of the window he did not quit that retirement during the first quadrille nor until the second when the goodnatured lady clavering beckoned to him to come up to her to the dais or place of honor where the dowagers were and whither pen went blushing and exceedingly awkward as most conceited young fellows are he performed a haughty salutation to lady rockminster who hardly acknowledged his bow and then went and paid his respects to the widow of the late amory who was splendid in diamonds velvet lace feathers and all sorts of millinery and goldsmiths ware young mr fogey then in the fifth form at eton and ardently expecting his beard and his commission in a dragoon regiment was the second partner who was honored with miss bells hand he was rapt in admiration of that young lady he thought he had never seen so charming a creature i like you much better than the french girl for this young gentleman had been dancing with miss amory before he candidly said to her laura laughed and looked more goodhumored than ever and in the midst of her laughter caught a sight of pen and continued to laugh as he on his side continued to look absurdly pompous and sulky the next dance was a waltz and young fogey thought with a sigh that he did not know how to waltz and vowed he would have a master the next holidays mr pynsent again claimed miss bells hand for this dance and pen beheld her in a fury twirling round the room her waist encircled by the arm of that gentleman he never used to be angry before when on summer evenings the chairs and tables being removed and the governess called down stairs to play the piano he and the chevalier strong who was a splendid performer and could dance a british hornpipe a german waltz or a spanish fandango if need were and the two young ladies blanche and laura improvised little balls at clavering park laura enjoyed this dancing so much and was so animated that she even animated mr pynsent blanche who could dance beautifully had an unlucky partner captain broadfoot of the dragoons then stationed at chatteries for captain broadfoot though devoting himself with great energy to the object in view could not get round in time and not having the least ear for music was unaware that his movements were too slow so in the waltz as in the quadrille miss blanche saw that her dear friend laura had the honors of the dance and was by no means pleased with the latters success after a couple of turns with the heavy dragoon she pleaded fatigue and requested to be led back to her place near her mamma to whom pen was talking and she asked him why he had not asked her to waltz and had left her to the mercies of that great odious man in spurs and a red coat i thought spurs and scarlet were the most fascinating objects in the world to young ladies pen answered i never should have dared to put my black coat in competition with that splendid red jacket you are very unkind and cruel and sulky and naughty said miss amory with another shrug of the shoulders you had better go away your cousin is looking at us over mr pynsents shoulder will you waltz with me said pen not this waltz i cant having just sent away that great hot captain broadfoot look at mr pynsent did you ever see such a creature but i will dance the next waltz with you and the quadrille too i am promised but i will tell mr poole that i had forgotten my engagement to you women forget very readily pendennis said but they always come back and are very repentant and sorry for what theyve done blanche said see here comes the poker and dear laura leaning on him how pretty she looks laura came up and put out her hand to pen to whom pynsent made a sort of bow appearing to be not much more graceful than that domestic instrument to which miss amory compared him but lauras face was full of kindness i am so glad you have come dear pen she said i can speak to you now how is mamma the three dances are over and i am engaged to you for the next pen i have just engaged myself to miss amory said pen and miss amory nodded her head and made her usual little courtesy i dont intend to give him up dearest laura she said well then hell waltz with me dear blanche said the other wont you pen i promised to waltz with miss amory provoking said laura and making a courtesy in her turn she went and placed herself under the ample wing of lady rockminster pen was delighted with his mischief the two prettiest girls in the room were quarreling about him he flattered himself he had punished miss laura he leaned in a dandified air with his elbow over the wall and talked to blanche he quizzed unmercifully all the men in the roomthe heavy dragoons in their tight jacketsthe country dandies in their queer attirethe strange toilets of the ladies one seemed to have a birds nest in her head another had six pounds of grapes in her hair besides her false pearls its a coiffure of almonds and raisins said pen and might be served up for dessert in a word he was exceedingly satirical and amusing during the quadrille he carried on this kind of conversation with unflinching bitterness and vivacity and kept blanche continually laughing both at his wickedness and jokes which were good and also because laura was again their visavis and could see and hear how merry and confidential they were arthur is charming tonight she whispered to laura across cornet perchs shell jacket as pen was performing cavalier seul before them drawling through that figure with a thumb in the pocket of each waistcoat who said laura arthur answered blanche in french oh its such a pretty name and now the young ladies went over to pens side and cornet perch performed a pas seul in his turn he had no waistcoat pocket to put his hands into and they looked large and swollen as they hung before him depending from the tight arms in the jacket during the interval between the quadrille and the succeeding waltz pen did not take any notice of laura except to ask her whether her partner cornet perch was an amusing youth and whether she liked him so well as her other partner mr pynsent having planted which two daggers in lauras gentle bosom mr pendennis proceeded to rattle on with blanche amory and to make jokes good or bad but which were always loud laura was at a loss to account for her cousins sulky behavior and ignorant in what she had offended him however she was not angry in her turn at pens splenetic mood for she was the most goodnatured and forgiving of women and besides an exhibition of jealousy on a mans part is not always disagreeable to a lady as pen would not dance with her she was glad to take up with the active chevalier strong who was a still better performer than pen and being very fond of dancing as every brisk and innocent young girl should be when the waltz music began she set off and chose to enjoy herself with all her heart captain broadfoot on this occasion occupied the floor in conjunction with a lady of proportions scarcely inferior to his own miss roundle a large young woman in a strawberryice colored crape dress the daughter of the lady with the grapes in her head whose bunches pen had admired and now taking his time and with his fair partner blanche hanging lovingly on the arm which encircled her mr arthur pendennis set out upon his waltzing career and felt as he whirled round to the music that he and blanche were performing very brilliantly indeed very likely he looked to see if miss bell thought so too but she did not or would not see him and was always engaged with her partner captain strong but pens triumph was not destined to last long and it was doomed that poor blanche was to have yet another discomfiture on that unfortunate night while she and pen were whirling round as light and brisk as a couple of operadancers honest captain broadfoot and the lady round whose large waist he was clinging were twisting round very leisurely according to their natures and indeed were in every bodys way but they were more in pendenniss way than in any bodys else for he and blanche while executing their rapid gyrations came bolt up against the heavy dragoon and his lady and with such force that the center of gravity was lost by all four of the circumvolving bodies captain broadfoot and miss roundle were fairly upset as was pen himself who was less lucky than his partner miss amory who was only thrown upon a bench against a wall but pendennis came fairly down upon the floor sprawling in the general ruin with broadfoot and miss roundle the captain though heavy was goodnatured and was the first to burst out into a loud laugh at his own misfortune which nobody therefore heeded but miss amory was savage at her mishap miss roundle placed on her seant and looking pitifully round presented an object which very few people could see without laughing and pen was furious when he heard the people giggling about him he was one of those sarcastic young fellows that did not bear a laugh at his own expense and of all things in the world feared ridicule most as he got up laura and strong were laughing at him every body was laughing pynsent and his partner were laughing and pen boiled with wrath against the pair and could have stabbed them both on the spot he turned away in a fury from them and began blundering out apologies to miss amory it was the other couples faultthe woman in pink had done itpen hoped miss amory was not hurtwould she not have the courage to take another turn miss amory in a pet said she was very much hurt indeed and she would not take another turn and she accepted with great thanks a glass of water which a cavalier who wore a blue ribbon and a threepointed star rushed to fetch for her when he had seen the deplorable accident she drank the water smiled upon the bringer gracefully and turning her white shoulder at mr pen in the most marked and haughty manner besought the gentleman with the star to conduct her to her mamma and she held out her hand in order to take his arm the man with the star trembled with delight at this mark of her favor he bowed over her hand pressed it to his coat fervidly and looked round him with triumph it was no other than the happy mirobolant whom blanche had selected as an escort but the truth is that the young lady had never fairly looked in the artists face since he had been employed in her mothers family and had no idea but it was a foreign nobleman on whose arm she was leaning as she went off pen forgot his humiliation in his surprise and cried out by jove its the cook the instant he had uttered the words he was sorry for having spoken themfor it was blanche who had herself invited mirobolant to escort her nor could the artist do otherwise than comply with a ladys command blanche in her flutter did not hear what arthur said but mirobolant heard him and cast a furious glance at him over his shoulder which rather amused mr pen he was in a mischievous and sulky humor wanting perhaps to pick a quarrel with somebody but the idea of having insulted a cook or that such an individual should have any feeling of honor at all did not much enter into the mind of this lofty young aristocrat the apothecarys son it had never entered that poor artists head that he as a man was not equal to any other mortal or that there was any thing in his position so degrading as to prevent him from giving his arm to a lady who asked for it he had seen in the fetes in his own country fine ladies not certainly demoiselles but the demoiselle anglaise he knew was a great deal more free than the spinster in france join in the dance with blaise or pierre and he would have taken blanche up to lady clavering and possibly have asked her to dance too but he heard pens exclamation which struck him as if it had shot him and cruelly humiliated and angered him she did not know what caused him to start and to grind a gascon oath between his teeth but strong who was acquainted with the poor fellows state of mind having had the interesting information from our friend madame fribsby was luckily in the way when wanted and saying something rapidly in spanish which the other understood the chevalier begged miss amory to come and take an ice before she went back to lady clavering upon which the unhappy mirobolant relinquished the arm which he had held for a minute and with a most profound and piteous bow fell back dont you know who it is strong asked of miss amory as he led her away it is the chef mirobolant how should i know asked blanche he has a croix he is very distingue he has beautiful eyes the poor fellow is mad for your beaux yeux i believe strong said he is a very good cook but he is not quite right in the head what did you say to him in the unknown tongue asked miss blanche he is a gascon and comes from the borders of spain strong answered i told him he would lose his place if he walked with you poor monsieur mirobolant said blanche did you see the look he gave pendennisstrong asked enjoying the idea of the mischiefi think he would like to run little pen through with one of his spits he is an odious conceited clumsy creature that mr pen said blanche broadfoot looked as if he would like to kill him too so did pynsent strong said what ice will you havewater ice or cream ice water ice who is that odd man staring at mehe is decore too that is my friend colonel altamont a very queer character in the service of the nawaub of lucknow hallo whats that noise ill be back in an instant said the chevalier and sprang out of the room to the ballroom where a scuffle and a noise of high voices was heard the refreshment room in which miss amory now found herself was a room set apart for the purposes of supper which mr rincer the landlord had provided for those who chose to partake at the rate of five shillings per head also refreshments of a superior class were here ready for the ladies and gentlemen of the county families who came to the ball but the commoner sort of persons were kept out of the room by a waiter who stood at the portal and who said that was a select room for lady clavering and lady rockminsters parties and not to be opened to the public till suppertime which was not to be until past midnight pynsent who danced with his constituents daughters took them and their mammas in for their refreshment there strong who was manager and master of the revels wherever he went had of course the entreeand the only person who was now occupying the room was the gentleman with the black wig and the orders in his buttonhole the officer in the service of his highness the nawaub of lucknow this gentleman had established himself very early in the evening in this apartment where saying he was confoundedly thirsty he called for a bottle of champagne at this order the waiter instantly supposed that he had to do with a grandee and the colonel sate down and began to eat his supper and absorb his drink and enter affably into conversation with any body who entered the room sir francis clavering and mr wagg found him there when they left the ballroom which they did pretty earlysir francis to go and smoke a cigar and look at the people gathered outside the ballroom on the shore which he declared was much better fun than to remain within mr wagg to hang on to a baronets arm as he was always pleased to do on the arm of the greatest man in the company colonel altamont had stared at these gentleman in so odd a manner as they passed through the select room that clavering made inquiries of the landlord who he was and hinted a strong opinion that the officer of the nawaubs service was drunk mr pynsent too had had the honor of a conversation with the servant of the indian potentate it was pynsents cue to speak to every body which he did to do him justice in the most ungracious manner and he took the gentleman in the black wig for some constituent some merchant captain or other outlandish man of the place mr pynsent then coming into the refreshmentroom with a lady the wife of a constituent on his arm the colonel asked him if he would try a glass of sham pynsent took it with great gravity bowed tasted the wine and pronounced it excellent and with the utmost politeness retreated before colonel altamont this gravity and decorum routed and surprised the colonel more than any other kind of behavior probably would he stared after pynsent stupidly and pronounced to the landlord over the counter that he was a rum one mr rincer blushed and hardly knew what to say mr pynsent was a county earls grandson going to set up as a parliament man colonel altamont on the other hand wore orders and diamonds jingled sovereigns constantly in his pocket and paid his way like a man so not knowing what to say mr rincer said yes colonelyes maam did you say tea cup a tea for mrs jones mrs r and so got off that discussion regarding mr pynsents qualities into which the nizams officer appeared inclined to enter illustration in fact if the truth must be told mr altamont having remained at the buffet almost all night and employed himself very actively while there had considerably flushed his brain by drinking and he was still going on drinking when mr strong and miss amory entered the room when the chevalier ran out of the apartment attracted by the noise in the dancingroom the colonel rose from his chair with his little red eyes glowing like coals and with rather an unsteady gait advanced toward blanche who was sipping her ice she was absorbed in absorbing it for it was very fresh and good or she was not curious to know what was going on in the adjoining room although the waiters were who ran after chevalier strong so that when she looked up from the glass she beheld this strange man staring at her out of his little red eyes who was he it was quite exciting and so youre betsy amory said he after gazing at her betsy amory by jove whowho speaks to me said betsy alias blanche but the noise in the ballroom is really becoming so loud that we must rush back thither and see what is the cause of the disturbance chapter xxviii which is both quarrelsome and sentimental illustration civil war was raging high words passing people pushing and squeezing together in an unseemly manner round a window in the corner of the ballroom close by the door through which the chevalier strong shouldered his way through the opened window the crowd in the street below was sending up sarcastic remarks such as pitch into him where are the police and the like and a ring of individuals among whom madame fribsby was conspicuous was gathered round monsieur alcide mirobolant on the one side while several gentlemen and ladies surrounded our friend arthur pendennis on the other strong penetrated into this assembly elbowing by madame fribsby who was charmed at the chevaliers appearance and cried save him save him in frantic and pathetic accents the cause of the disturbance it appeared was the angry little chef of sir francis claverings culinary establishment shortly after strong had quitted the room and while mr pen greatly irate at his downfall in the waltz which had made him look ridiculous in the eyes of the nation and by miss amorys behavior to him which had still further insulted his dignity was endeavoring to get some coolness of body and temper by looking out of window toward the sea which was sparkling in the distance and murmuring in a wonderful calmwhile he was really trying to compose himself and owning to himself perhaps that he had acted in a very absurd and peevish manner during the nighthe felt a hand upon his shoulder and on looking round beheld to his utter surprise and horror that the hand in question belonged to monsieur mirobolant whose eyes were glaring out of his pale face and ringlets at mr pen to be tapped on the shoulder by a french cook was a piece of familiarity which made the blood of the pendennises to boil up in the veins of their descendant and he was astounded almost more than enraged at such an indignity you speak french mirobolant said in his own language to pen what is that to you pray said pen in english at any rate you understand it continued the other with a bow yes sir said pen with a stamp of his foot i understand it pretty well vous me comprendrez alors monsieur pendennis replied the other rolling out his r with gascon force quand je vous dis que vous etes un lache monsieur pendennisun lache entendezvous what said pen starting round on him you understand the meaning of the word and its consequences among men of honor the artist said putting his hand on his hip and staring at pen the consequences are that i will fling you out of window youimpudent scoundrel bawled out mr pen and darting upon the frenchman he would very likely have put his threat into execution for the window was at hand and the artist by no means a match for the young gentlemanhad not captain broadfoot and another heavy officer flung themselves between the combatantshad not the ladies begun to screamhad not the fiddles stoppedhad not the crowd of people come running in that directionhad not laura with a face of great alarm looked over their heads and asked for heavens sake what was wronghad not the opportune strong made his appearance from the refreshmentroom and found alcides grinding his teeth and jabbering oaths in his gascon french and pen looking uncommonly wicked although trying to appear as calm as possible when the ladies and the crowd came up what has happened strong asked of the chef in spanish i am chevalier de juillet said the other slapping his breast and he has insulted me what has he said to you asked strong il ma appelecuisinier hissed out the little frenchman strong could hardly help laughing come away with me my poor chevalier he said we must not quarrel before ladies come away i will carry your message to mr pendennisthe poor fellow is not right in his head he whispered to one or two people about himand others and anxious lauras face visible among these gathered round pen and asked the cause of the disturbance pen did not know the man was going to give his arm to a young lady on which i said that he was a cook and the man called me a coward and challenged me to fight i own i was so surprised and indignant that if you gentlemen had not stopped me i should have thrown him out of window pen said d him serve him right toothe d impudent foreign scoundrel the gentlemen said iim very sorry if i hurt his feelings though pen added and laura was glad to hear him say that although some of the young bucks said no hang the fellowhang those impudent foreignerslittle thrashing would do them good you will go and shake hands with him before you go to sleepwont you pen said laura coming up to him foreigners may be more susceptible than we are and have different manners if you hurt a poor mans feelings i am sure you would be the first to ask his pardon wouldnt you dear pen she looked all forgiveness and gentleness like an angel as she spoke and pen took both her hands and looked into her kind face and said indeed he would how fond that girl is of me he thought as she stood gazing at him shall i speak to her now nonot now i must have this absurd business with the frenchman over laura askedwouldnt he stop and dance with her she was as anxious to keep him in the room as he to quit it wont you stop and waltz with me pen im not afraid to waltz with you this was an affectionate but an unlucky speech pen saw himself prostrate on the ground having tumbled over miss roundle and the dragoon and flung blanche up against the wallsaw himself on the ground and all the people laughing at him laura and pynsent among them i shall never dance again he replied with a dark and determined face never im surprised you should ask me is it because you cant get blanche for a partner asked laura with a wicked unlucky captiousness because i dont wish to make a fool of myself for other people to laugh at me pen answeredfor you to laugh at me laura i saw you and pynsent by jove no man shall laugh at me pen pen dont be so wicked cried out the poor girl hurt at the morbid perverseness and savage vanity of pen he was glaring round in the direction of mr pynsent as if he would have liked to engage that gentleman as he had done the cook who thinks the worse of you for stumbling in a waltz if laura does we dont why are you so sensitive and ready to think evil here again by ill luck mr pynsent came up to laura and said i have it in command from lady rockminster to ask whether i may take you in to supper ii was going in with my cousin laura said opray no said pen you are in such good hands that i cant do better than leave you and im going home good night mr pendennis pynsent said drilyto which speech which in fact meant go to the deuce for an insolent jealous impertinent jackanapes whose ears i should like to box mr pendennis did not vouchsafe any reply except a bow and in spite of lauras imploring looks he left the room how beautifully calm and bright the night outside is said mr pynsent and what a murmur the sea is making it would be pleasanter to be walking on the beach than in this hot room very said laura what a strange congregation of people continued pynsent i have had to go up and perform the agreeable to most of themthe attorneys daughtersthe apothecarys wifei scarcely know whom there was a man in the refreshment room who insisted upon treating me to champagnea seafaring looking manextraordinarily dressed and seeming half tipsy as a public man one is bound to conciliate all these people but it is a hard taskespecially when one would so very much like to be elsewhereand he blushed rather as he spoke i beg your pardon said lauraii was not listening indeedi was frightened about that quarrel between my cousin and thatthatthatfrench person your cousin has been rather unlucky tonight pynsent said there are three or four persons whom he has not succeeded in pleasingcaptain broadwood what is his namethe officerand the young lady in red with whom he dancedand miss blancheand the poor chefand i dont think he seemed particularly pleased with me didnt he leave me in charge to you laura said looking up into mr pynsents face and dropping her eyes instantly like a guilty little storytelling coquette indeed i can forgive him a good deal for that pynsent eagerly cried out and she took his arm and he led off his little prize in the direction of the supperroom she had no great desire for that repast though it was served in rincers well known style as the county paper said giving an account of the entertainment afterward indeed she was very distraite and exceedingly pained and unhappy about pen captious and quarrelsome jealous and selfish fickle and violent and unjust when his anger led him astray how could her mother as indeed helen had by a thousand words and hints ask her to give her heart to such a man and suppose she were to do so would it make him happy but she got some relief at length when at the end of half an houra long halfhour it had seemed to hera waiter brought her a little note in pencil from pen who said i met cooky below ready to fight me and i asked his pardon im glad i did it i wanted to speak to you tonight but will keep what i had to say till you come home god bless you dance away all night with pynsent and be very happy penlaura was very thankful for this letter and to think that there was goodness and forgiveness still in her mothers boy pen went down stairs his heart reproaching him for his absurd behavior to laura whose gentle and imploring looks followed and rebuked him and he was scarcely out of the ballroom door but he longed to turn back and ask her pardon but he remembered that he had left her with that confounded pynsent he could not apologize before him he would compromise and forget his wrath and make his peace with the frenchman the chevalier was pacing down below in the hall of the inn when pen descended from the ballroom and he came up to pen with all sorts of fun and mischief lighting up his jolly face i have got him in the coffeeroom he said with a brace of pistols and a candle or would you like swords on the beach mirobolant is a dead hand with the foils and killed four gardesducorps with his own point in the barricades of july confound it said pen in a fury i cant fight a cook he is a chevalier of july replied the other they present arms to him in his own country and do you ask me captain strong to go out with a servant pen asked fiercely ill call a policeman for him butbut youll invite me to hair triggers cried strong with a laugh thank you for nothing i was but joking i came to settle quarrels not to fight them i have been soothing down mirobolant i have told him that you did not apply the word cook to him in an offensive sense that it was contrary to all the customs of the country that a hired officer of a household as i called it should give his arm to the daughter of the house and then he told pen the grand secret which he had had from madame fribsby of the violent passion under which the poor artist was laboring when arthur heard this tale he broke out into a hearty laugh in which strong joined and his rage against the poor cook vanished at once he had been absurdly jealous himself all the evening and had longed for a pretext to insult pynsent he remembered how jealous he had been of oaks in his first affair he was ready to pardon any thing to a man under a passion like that and he went into the coffeeroom where mirobolant was waiting with an outstretched hand and made him a speech in french in which he declared that he was sincerement fache davoir use une expression qui avoit pu blesser monsieur mirobolant et quil donnoit sa parole comme un gentlehomme quil ne lavoit jamais jamaisintende said pen who made a shot at a french word for intended and was secretly much pleased with his own fluency and correctness in speaking that language bravo bravo cried strong as much amused with pens speech as pleased by his kind manner and the chevalier mirobolant of course withdraws and sincerely regrets the expression of which he made use monsieur pendennis has disproved my words himself said alcide with great politeness he has shown that he is a galant homme and so they shook hands and parted arthur in the first place dispatching his note to laura before he and strong committed themselves to the butcher boy as they drove along strong complimented pen upon his behavior as well as upon his skill in french youre a good fellow pendennis and you speak french like chateaubriand by jove ive been accustomed to it from my youth upward said pen and strong had the grace not to laugh for five minutes when he exploded into fits of hilarity which pendennis has never perhaps understood up to this day it was daybreak when they got to the brawl where they separated by that time the ball at baymouth was over too madame fribsby and mirobolant were on their way home in the clavering fly laura was in bed with an easy heart and asleep at lady rockminsters and the claverings at rest at the inn at baymouth where they had quarters for the night a short time after the disturbance between pen and the chef blanche had come out of the refreshmentroom looking as pale as a lemonice she told her maid having no other confidante at hand that she had met with the most romantic adventurethe most singular manone who had known the author of her beingher persecutedher unhappyher heroicher murdered father and she began a sonnet to his manes before she went to sleep so pen returned to fairoaks in company with his friend the chevalier without having uttered a word of the message which he had been so anxious to deliver to laura at baymouth he could wait however until her return home which was to take place on the succeeding day he was not seriously jealous of the progress made by mr pynsent in her favor and he felt pretty certain that in this as in any other family arrangement he had but to ask and have and laura like his mother could refuse him nothing when helens anxious looks inquired of him what had happened at baymouth and whether her darling project was fulfilled pen in a gay tone told of the calamity which had befallen laughingly said that no man could think about declarations under such a mishap and made light of the matter there will be plenty of time for sentiment dear mother when laura comes back he said and he looked in the glass with a killing air and his mother put his hair off his forehead and kissed him and of course thought for her part that no woman could resist him and was exceedingly happy that day when he was not with her mr pen occupied himself in packing books and portmanteaus burning and arranging papers cleaning his gun and putting it into its case in fact in making dispositions for departure for though he was ready to marry this gentleman was eager to go to london too rightly considering that at threeandtwenty it was quite time for him to begin upon the serious business of life and to set about making a fortune as quickly as possible the means to this end he had already shaped out for himself i shall take chambers he said and enter myself at an inn of court with a couple of hundred pounds i shall be able to carry through the first year very well after that i have little doubt my pen will support me as it is doing with several oxbridge men now in town i have a tragedy a comedy and a novel all nearly finished and for which i cant fail to get a price and so i shall be able to live pretty well without drawing upon my poor mother until i have made my way at the bar then some day i will come back and make her dear soul happy by marrying laura she is as good and as sweettempered a girl as ever lived besides being really very goodlooking and the engagement will serve to steady mewont it ponto thus smoking his pipe and talking to his dog as he sauntered through the gardens and orchards of the little domain of fairoaks this young daydreamer built castles in the air for himself yes shell steady me wont she and youll miss me when ive gone wont you old boy he asked of ponto who quivered his tail and thrust his brown nose into his masters fist ponto licked his hand and shoe as they all did in that house and mr pen received their homage as other folks do the flattery which they get laura came home rather late in the evening of the second day and mr pynsent as ill luck would have it drove her from clavering the poor girl could not refuse his offer but his appearance brought a dark cloud upon the brow of arthur pendennis laura saw this and was pained by it the eager widow however was aware of nothing and being anxious doubtless that the delicate question should be asked at once was for going to bed very soon after lauras arrival and rose for that purpose to leave the sofa where she now generally lay and where laura would come and sit and work or read by her but when helen rose laura said with a blush and rather an alarmed voice that she was also very tired and wanted to go to bed so that the widow was disappointed in her scheme for that night at least and mr pen was left another day in suspense regarding his fate his dignity was offended at being thus obliged to remain in the antechamber when he wanted an audience such a sultan as he could not afford to be kept waiting however he went to bed and slept upon his disappointment pretty comfortably and did not wake until the early morning when he looked up and saw his mother standing in his room dear pen rouse up said this lady do not be lazy it is the most beautiful morning in the world i have not been able to sleep since daybreak and laura has been out for an hour she is in the garden every body ought to be in the garden and out on such a morning as this pen laughed he saw what thoughts were uppermost in the simple womans heart his goodnatured laughter cheered the widow oh you profound dissembler he said kissing his mother oh you artful creature can nobody escape from your wicked tricks and will you make your only son your victim helen too laughed she blushed she fluttered and was agitated she was as happy as she could bea good tender matchmaking woman the dearest project of whose heart was about to be accomplished so after exchanging some knowing looks and hasty words helen left arthur and this young hero rising from his bed proceeded to decorate his beautiful person and shave his ambrosial chin and in half an hour he issued out from his apartment into the garden in quest of laura his reflections as he made his toilet were rather dismal i am going to tie myself for life he thought to please my mother laura is the best of women andand she has given me her money i wish to heaven i had not received it i wish i had not this duty to perform just yet but as both the women have set their hearts on the match why i suppose i must satisfy themand now for it a man may do worse than make happy two of the best creatures in the world so pen now he was actually come to the point felt very grave and by no means elated and indeed thought it was a great sacrifice he was going to perform it was miss lauras custom upon her garden excursions to wear a sort of uniform which though homely was thought by many people to be not unbecoming she had a large straw hat with a streamer of broad ribbon which was useless probably but the hat sufficiently protected the owners pretty face from the sun over her accustomed gown she wore a blouse or pinafore which being fastened round her little waist by a smart belt looked extremely well and her hands were guaranteed from the thorns of her favorite rosebushes by a pair of gauntlets which gave this young lady a military and resolute air somehow she had the very same smile with which she had laughed at him on the night previous and the recollection of his disaster again offended pen but laura though she saw him coming down the walk looking so gloomy and full of care accorded to him a smile of the most perfect and provoking goodhumor and went to meet him holding one of the gauntlets to him so that he might shake it if he likedand mr pen condescended to do so his face however did not lose its tragic expression in consequence of this favor and he continued to regard her with a dismal and solemn air excuse my glove said laura with a laugh pressing pens hand kindly with it we are not angry again are we pen why do you laugh at me said pen you did the other night and made a fool of me to the people at baymouth my dear arthur i meant you no wrong the girl answered you and miss roundle looked so droll as youas you met with your little accident that i could not make a tragedy of it dear pen it wasnt a serious fall and besides it was miss roundle who was the most unfortunate confound miss roundle bellowed out pen im sure she looked so said laura archly you were up in an instant but that poor lady sitting on the ground in her red crape dress and looking about her with that piteous facecan i ever forget herand laura began to make a face in imitation of miss roundles under the disaster but she checked herself repentantly saying well we must not laugh at her but i am sure we ought to laugh at you pen if you were angry about such a trifle illustration you should not laugh at me laura said pen with some bitterness not you of all people and why not are you such a great man asked laura ah no laura im such a poor one pen answered havent you baited me enough already my dear pen and how cried laura indeed indeed i didnt think to vex you by such a trifle i thought such a clever man as you could bear a harmless little joke from his sister she said holding her hand out again dear arthur if i have hurt you i beg your pardon it is your kindness that humiliates me more even than your laughter laura pen said you are always my superior what superior to the great arthur pendennis how can it be possible said miss laura who may have had a little wickedness as well as a great deal of kindness in her composition you cant mean that any woman is your equal those who confer benefits should not sneer said pen i dont like my benefactor to laugh at me laura it makes the obligation very hard to bear you scorn me because i have taken your money and i am worthy to be scorned but the blow is hard coming from you money obligation for shame pen this is ungenerous laura said flushing red may not our mother claim every thing that belongs to us dont i owe her all my happiness in this world arthur what matters about a few paltry guineas if we can set her tender heart at rest and ease her mind regarding you i would dig in the fields i would go out and be a servanti would die for her you know i would said miss laura kindling up and you call this paltry money an obligation oh pen its cruelits unworthy of you to take it so if my brother may not share with me my superfluity who mayminei tell you it was not mine it was all mammas to do with as she chose and so is every thing i have said laura my life is hers and the enthusiastic girl looked toward the windows of the widows room and blessed in her heart the kind creature within helen was looking unseen out of that window toward which lauras eyes and heart were turned as she spoke and was watching her two children with the deepest interest and emotion longing and hoping that the prayer of her life might be fulfilled and if laura had spoken as helen hoped who knows what temptations arthur pendennis might have been spared or what different trials he would have had to undergo he might have remained at fairoaks all his days and died a country gentleman but would he have escaped then temptation is an obsequious servant that has no objection to the country and we know that it takes up its lodging in hermitages as well as in cities and that in the most remote and inaccessible desert it keeps company with the fugitive solitary is your life my mothers said pen beginning to tremble and speak in a very agitated manner you know laura what the great object of hers is and he took her hand once more what arthur she said dropping it and looking at him at the window again and then dropping her eyes to the ground so that they avoided pens gaze she too trembled for she felt that the crisis for which she had been secretly preparing was come our mother has one wish above all others in the world laura pen said and i think you know it i own to you that she has spoken to me of it and if you will fulfill it dear sister i am ready i am but very young as yet but i have had so many pains and disappointments that i am old and weary i think i have hardly got a heart to offer before i have almost begun the race in life i am a tired man my career has been a failure i have been protected by those whom i by right should have protected i own that your nobleness and generosity dear laura shame me while they render me grateful when i heard from our mother what you had done for me that it was you who armed me and bade me go out for one struggle more i longed to go and throw myself at your feet and say laura will you come and share the contest with me your sympathy will cheer me while it lasts i shall have one of the tenderest and most generous creatures under heaven to aid and bear me company will you take me dear laura and make our mother happy do you think mamma would be happy if you were otherwise arthur laura said in a low sad voice and why should i not be asked pen eagerly with so dear a creature as you by my side i have not my first love to give you i am a broken man but indeed i would love you fondly and truly i have lost many an illusion and ambition but i am not without hope still talents i know i have wretchedly as i have misapplied them they may serve me yet they would had i a motive for action let me go away and think that i am pledged to return to you let me go and work and hope that you will share my success if i gain it you have given me so much dear laura will you take from me nothing what have you got to give arthur laura said with a grave sadness of tone which made pen start and see that his words had committed him indeed his declaration had not been such as he would have made it two days earlier when full of hope and gratitude he had run over to laura his liberatress to thank her for his recovered freedom had he been permitted to speak then he had spoken and she perhaps had listened differently it would have been a grateful heart asking for hers not a weary one offered to her to take or to leave laura was offended with the terms in which pen offered himself to her he had in fact said that he had no love and yet would take no denial i give myself to you to please my mother he had said take me as she wishes that i should make this sacrifice the girls spirit would brook a husband under no such conditions she was not minded to run forward because pen chose to hold out the handkerchief and her tone in reply to arthur showed her determination to be independent no arthur she said our marriage would not make mamma happy as she fancies for it would not content you very long i too have known what her wishes were for she is too open to conceal any thing she has at heart and once perhaps i thoughtbut that is over nowthat i could have made youthat it might have been as she wished you have seen somebody else said pen angry at her tone and recalling the incidents of the past days that allusion might have been spared laura replied flinging up her head a heart which has worn out love at threeandtwenty as yours has you say should have survived jealousy too i do not condescend to say whether i have seen or encouraged any other person i shall neither admit the charge nor deny it and beg you also to allude to it no more i ask your pardon laura if i have offended you but if i am jealous does it not prove that i have a heart not for me arthur perhaps you think you love me now but it is only for an instant and because you are foiled were there no obstacle you would feel no ardor to overcome it no arthur you dont love me you would weary of me in three months asas you do of most things and mamma seeing you tired of me would be more unhappy than at my refusal to be yours let us be brother and sister arthur as heretoforebut no more you will get over this little disappointment i will try said arthur in a great indignation have you not tried before laura said with some anger for she had been angry with arthur for a very long time and was now determined i suppose to speak her mind and the next time arthur when you offer yourself to a woman do not say as you have done to me i have no hearti do not love you but i am ready to marry you because my mother wishes for the match we require more than this in return for our lovethat is i think so i have had no experience hitherto and have not had thethe practice which you supposed me to have when you spoke but now of my having seen somebody else did you tell your first love that you had no heart arthur or your second that you did not love her but that she might have you if she liked whatwhat do you mean asked arthur blushing and still in great wrath i mean blanche amory arthur pendennis laura said proudly it is but two months since you were sighing at her feetmaking poems to herplacing them in hollow trees by the riverside i knew all i watched youthat is she showed them to me neither one nor the other were in earnest perhaps but it is too soon now arthur to begin a new attachment go through the time of youryour widowhood at least and do not think of marrying until you are out of mourninghere the girls eyes filled with tears and she passed her hand across them i am angry and hurt and i have no right to be so and i ask your pardon in my turn now dear arthur you had a right to love blanche she was a thousand times prettier and more accomplished thanthan any girl near us here and you could not know that she had no heart and so you were right to leave her too i ought not to rebuke you about blanche amory and because she deceived you pardon me penand she held the kind hand out to pen once more we were both jealous said pen dear laura let us both forgiveand he seized her hand and would have drawn her toward him he thought that she was relenting and already assumed the airs of a victor but she shrank back and her tears passed away and she fixed on him a look so melancholy and severe that the young man in his turn shrank before it do not mistake me arthur she said it can not be you do not know what you ask and do not be too angry with me for saying that i think you do not deserve it what do you offer in exchange to a woman for her love honor and obedience if ever i say these words dear pen i hope to say them in earnest and by the blessing of god to keep my vow but youwhat tie binds you you do not care about many things which we poor women hold sacred i do not like to think or ask how far your incredulity leads you you offer to marry to please our mother and own that you have no heart to give away oh arthur what is it you offer me what a rash compact would you enter into so lightly a month ago and you would have given yourself to another i pray you do not trifle with your own or others hearts so recklessly go and work go and mend dear arthur for i see your faults and dare speak of them now go and get fame as you say that you can and i will pray for my brother and watch our dearest mother at home is that your final decision laura arthur cried yes said laura bowing her head and once more giving him her hand she went away he saw her pass under the creepers of the little porch and disappear into the house the curtains of his mothers window fell at the same minute but he did not mark that or suspect that helen had been witnessing the scene was he pleased or was he angry at its termination he had asked her and a secret triumph filled his heart to think that he was still free she had refused him but did she not love him that avowal of jealousy made him still think that her heart was his own whatever her lips might utter and now we ought perhaps to describe another scene which took place at fairoaks between the widow and laura when the latter had to tell helen that she had refused arthur pendennis perhaps it was the hardest task of all which laura had to go through in this matter and the one which gave her the most pain but as we do not like to see a good woman unjust we shall not say a word more of the quarrel which now befell between helen and her adopted daughter or of the bitter tears which the poor girl was made to shed it was the only difference which she and the widow had ever had as yet and the more cruel from this cause pen left home while it was as yet pendingand helen who could pardon almost every thing could not pardon an act of justice in laura chapter xxix babylon illustration our reader must now please to quit the woods and seashore of the west and the gossip of clavering and the humdrum life of poor little fairoaks and transport himself with arthur pendennis on the alacrity coach to london whither he goes once for all to face the world and to make his fortune as the coach whirls through the night away from the friendly gates of home many a plan does the young man cast in his mind of future life and conduct prudence and peradventure success and fame he knows he is a better man than many who have hitherto been ahead of him in the race his first failure has caused him remorse and brought with it reflection it has not taken away his courage or let us add his good opinion of himself a hundred eager fancies and busy hopes keep him awake how much older his mishaps and a years thought and selfcommunion have made him than when twelve months since he passed on this road on his way to and from oxbridge his thoughts turn in the night with inexpressible fondness and tenderness toward the fond mother who blessed him when parting and who in spite of all his past faults and follies trusts him and loves him still blessings be on her he prays as he looks up to the stars overhead o heaven give him strength to work to endure to be honest to avoid temptation to be worthy of the loving soul who loves him so entirely very likely she is awake too at that moment and sending up to the same father purer prayers than his for the welfare of her boy that womans love is a talisman by which he holds and hopes to get his safety and laurashe would have fain carried her affection with him too but she has denied it as he is not worthy of it he owns as much with shame and remorse confesses how much better and loftier her nature is than his ownconfesses it and yet is glad to be free i am not good enough for such a creature he owns to himself he draws back before her spotless beauty and innocence as from something that scares him he feels he is not fit for such a mate as that as many a wild prodigal who has been pious and guiltless in early days keeps away from a church which he used to frequent onceshunning it but not hostile to itonly feeling that he has no right in that pure place with these thoughts to occupy him pen did not fall asleep until the nipping dawn of an october morning and woke considerably refreshed when the coach stopped at the old breakfasting place at b where he had had a score of merry meals on his way to and from school and college many times since he was a boy as they left that place the sun broke out brightly the pace was rapid the horn blew the milestones flew by pen smoked and joked with guard and fellowpassengers and people along the familiar road it grew more busy and animated at every instant the last team of grays came out at h and the coach drove into london what young fellow has not felt a thrill as he entered the vast place hundreds of other carriages crowded with their thousands of men were hastening to the great city here is my place thought pen here is my battle beginning in which i must fight and conquer or fall i have been a boy and a dawdler as yet oh i long i long to show that i can be a man and from his place on the coachroof the eager young fellow looked down upon the city with the sort of longing desire which young soldiers feel on the eve of a campaign as they came along the road pen had formed an acquaintance with a cheery fellowpassenger in a shabby cloak who talked a great deal about men of letters with whom he was very familiar and who was in fact the reporter of a london newspaper as whose representative he had been to attend a great wrestlingmatch in the west this gentleman knew intimately as it appeared all the leading men of letters of his day and talked about tom campbell and tom hood and sydney smith and this and the other as if he had been their most intimate friend as they passed by brompton this gentleman pointed out to pen mr hurtle the reviewer walking with his umbrella pen craned over the coach to have a long look at the great hurtle he was a boniface man said pen and mr doolan of the star newspaper for such was the gentlemans name and address upon the card which he handed to pen said faith he was and he knew him very well pen thought it was quite an honor to have seen the great mr hurtle whose works he admired he believed fondly as yet in authors reviewers and editors of newspapers even wagg whose books did not appear to him to be masterpieces of human intellect he yet secretly revered as a successful writer he mentioned that he had met wagg in the country and doolan told him how that famous novelist received three hundred pounds a volume for every one of his novels pen began to calculate instantly whether he might not make five thousand a year the very first acquaintance of his own whom arthur met as the coach pulled up at the gloster coffee house was his old friend harry foker who came prancing down arlingtonstreet behind an enormous cabhorse he had white kid gloves and white reins and nature had by this time decorated him with a considerable tuft on the chin a very small cabboy vice stoopid retired swung on behind fokers vehicle knockkneed and in the tightest leather breeches foker looked at the dusty coach and the smoking horses of the alacrity by which he had made journeys in former timeswhat foker cried out pendennishullo pen my boy said the other and he waved his whip by way of amity and salute to arthur who was very glad to see his queer friends kind old face mr doolan had a great respect for pen who had an acquaintance in such a grand cab and pen was greatly excited and pleased to be at liberty and in london he asked doolan to come and dine with him at the covent garden coffee house where he put up he called a cab and rattled away thither in the highest spirits he was glad to see the bustling waiter and polite bowing landlord again and asked for the landlady and missed the old boots and would have liked to shake hands with every body he had a hundred pounds in his pocket he dressed himself in his very best dined in the coffeeroom with a modest pint of sherry for he was determined to be very economical and went to the theater adjoining the lights and the music the crowd and the gayety charmed and exhilarated pen as those sights will do young fellows from college and the country to whom they are tolerably new he laughed at the jokes he applauded the songs to the delight of some of the dreary old habitues of the boxes who had ceased long ago to find the least excitement in their place of nightly resort and were pleased to see any one so fresh and so much amused at the end of the first piece he went and strutted about the lobbies of the theater as if he was in a resort of the highest fashion what tired frequenter of the london pave is there that can not remember having had similar early delusions and would not call them back again here was young foker again like an ardent votary of pleasure as he was he was walking with granby tiptoff of the household brigade lord tiptoffs brother and lord colchicum captain tiptoffs uncle a venerable peer who had been a man of pleasure since the first french revolution foker rushed upon pen with eagerness and insisted that the latter should come into his private box where a lady with the longest ringlets and the fairest shoulders was seated this was miss blenkinsop the eminent actress of high comedy and in the back of the box snoozing in a wig sate old blenkinsop her papa he was described in the theatrical prints as the veteran blenkinsopthe useful blenkinsopthat old favorite of the public blenkinsopthose parts in the drama which are called the heavy fathers were usually assigned to this veteran who indeed acted the heavy father in public as in private life at this time it being about eleven oclock mrs pendennis was gone to bed at fairoaks and wondering whether her dearest arthur was at rest after his journey at this time laura too was awake and at this time yesterday night as the coach rolled over silent commons where cottage windows twinkled and by darkling woods under calm starlit skies pen was vowing to reform and to resist temptation and his heart was at home meanwhile the farce was going on very successfully and mrs leary in a hussar jacket and braided pantaloons was enchanting the audience with her archness her lovely figure and her delightful ballads pen being new to the town would have liked to listen to mrs leary but the other people in the box did not care about her song or her pantaloons and kept up an incessant chattering tiptoff knew where her maillots came from colchicum saw her when she came out in miss blenkinsop said she sang out of all tune to the pain and astonishment of pen who thought that she was as beautiful as an angel and that she sang like a nightingale and when hoppus came on as sir harcourt featherby the young man of the piece the gentlemen in the box declared that hoppus was getting too stale and tiptoff was for flinging miss blenkinsops bouquet to him not for the world cried the daughter of the veteran blenkinsop lord colchicum gave it to me pen remembered that noblemans name and with a bow and a blush said he believed he had to thank lord colchicum for having proposed him at the megatherium club at the request of his uncle major pendennis what youre wigsbys nephew are you said the peer i beg your pardon we always call him wigsby pen blushed to hear his venerable uncle called by such a familiar name we balloted you in last week didnt we yes last wednesday night your uncle wasnt there here was delightful news for pen he professed himself very much obliged indeed to lord colchicum and made him a handsome speech of thanks to which the other listened with his double operaglass up to his eyes pen was full of excitement at the idea of being a member of this polite club dont be always looking at that box you naughty creature cried miss blenkinsop shes a devlish fine woman that mirabel said tiptoff though mirabel was a dd fool to marry her a stupid old spooney said the peer mirabel cried out pendennis ha ha laughed out harry foker weve heard of her before havent we pen it was pens first love it was miss fotheringay the year before she had been led to the altar by sir charles mirabel gcb and formerly envoy to the court of pumpernickel who had taken so active a part in the negotiations before the congress of swammerdam and signed on behalf of hbm the peace of pultusk emily was always as stupid as an owl said miss blenkinsop eh eh pas si bete the old peer said oh for shame cried the actress who did not in the least know what he meant and pen looked out and beheld his first love once againand wondered how he ever could have loved her thus on the very first night of his arrival in london mr arthur pendennis found himself introduced to a club to an actress of genteel comedy and a heavy father of the stage and to a dashing society of jovial blades old and young for my lord colchicum though stricken in years bald of head and enfeebled in person was still indefatigable in the pursuit of enjoyment and it was the venerable viscounts boast that he could drink as much claret as the youngest member of the society which he frequented he lived with the youth about town he gave them countless dinners at richmond and greenwich an enlightened patron of the drama in all languages and of the terpsichorean art he received dramatic professors of all nations at his banquetsenglish from the covent garden and strand houses italians from the haymarket french from their own pretty little theater or the boards of the opera where they danced and at his villa on the thames this pillar of the state gave sumptuous entertainments to scores of young men of fashion who very affably consorted with the ladies and gentlemen of the greenroomwith the former chiefly for viscount colchicum preferred their society as more polished and gay than that of their male brethren pen went the next day and paid his entrancemoney at the club which operation carried off exactly onethird of his hundred pounds and took possession of the edifice and ate his luncheon there with immense satisfaction he plunged into an easy chair in the library and tried to read all the magazines he wondered whether the members were looking at him and that they could dare to keep on their hats in such fine rooms he sate down and wrote a letter to fairoaks on the club paper and said what a comfort this place would be to him after his days work was over he went over to his uncles lodgings in burystreet with some considerable tremor and in compliance with his mothers earnest desire that he should instantly call on major pendennis and was not a little relieved to find that the major had not yet returned to town his apartments were blank brown hollands covered his librarytable and bills and letters lay on the mantlepiece grimly awaiting the return of their owner the major was on the continent the landlady of the house said at badnbadn with the marcus of steyne pen left his card upon the shelf with the rest fairoaks was written on it still when the major returned to london which he did in time for the fogs of november after enjoying which he proposed to spend christmas with some friends in the country he found another card of arthurs on which lamb court temple was engraved and a note from that young gentleman and from his mother stating that he was come to town was entered a member of the upper temple and was reading hard for the bar lamb court templewhere was it major pendennis remembered that some ladies of fashion used to talk of dining with mr ayliffe the barrister who was in society and who lived there in the kings bench of which prison there was probably a branch in the temple and ayliffe was very likely an officer mr deuceace lord crabs son had also lived there he recollected he dispatched morgan to find out where lamb court was and to report upon the lodging selected by mr arthur that alert messenger had little difficulty in discovering mr pens abode discreet morgan had in his time traced people far more difficult to find than arthur what sort of a place is it morgan asked the major out of the bedcurtains in burystreet the next morning as the valet was arranging his toilet in the deep yellow london fog i should say rayther a shy place said mr morgan the lawyers lives there and has their names on the doors mr harthur lives three pair high sir mr warrington live there too sir suffolk warringtons i shouldnt wonder a good family thought the major the cadets of many of our good families follow the robe as a profession comfortable rooms eh honly saw the outside of the door sir with mr warringtons name and mr arthurs painted up and a piece of paper with back at but i couldnt see no servant sir economical at any rate said the major very sir three pair sir nasty black staircase as ever i see wonder how a gentleman can live in such a place pray who taught you where gentlemen should or should not live morgan mr arthur sir is going to study for the bar sir the major said with much dignity and closed the conversation and began to array himself in the yellow fog boys will be boys the mollified uncle thought to himself he has written to me a devlish good letter colchicum says he has had him to dine and thinks him agentleman like lad his mother is one of the best creatures in the world if he has sown his wild oats and will stick to his business he may do well yet think of charley mirabel the old fool marrying that flame of his that fotheringay he doesnt like to come here until i give him leave and puts it in a very manly nice way i was deuced angry with him after his oxbridge escapadesand showed it too when he was here beforegad ill go and see him hang me if i dont and having ascertained from morgan that he could reach the temple without much difficulty and that a city omnibus would put him down at the gate the major one day after breakfast at his clubnot the polyanthus whereof mr pen was just elected a member but another club for the major was too wise to have a nephew as a constant inmate of any house where he was in the habit of passing his timethe major one day entered one of those public vehicles and bade the conductor to put him down at the gate of the upper temple when major pendennis reached that dingy portal it was about twelve oclock in the day and he was directed by a civil personage with a badge and a white apron through some dark alleys and under various melancholy archways into courts each more dismal than the other until finally he reached lamb court if it was dark in pall mall what was it in lamb court candles were burning in many of the rooms therein the pupilroom of mr hodgeman the special pleader where six pupils were scribbling declarations under the tallow in sir hokey walkers clerks room where the clerk a person far more gentlemanlike and cheerful in appearance than the celebrated counsel his master was conversing in a patronizing manner with the managing clerk of an attorney at the door and in curling the wigmakers melancholy shop where from behind the feeble glimmer of a couple of lights large sergeants and judges wigs were looming drearily with the blank blocks looking at the lamppost in the court two little clerks were playing at tosshalfpenny under that lamp a laundress in pattens passed in at one door a newspaper boy issued from another a porter whose white apron was faintly visible paced up and down it would be impossible to conceive a place more dismal and the major shuddered to think that any one should select such a residence good ged he said the poor boy mustnt live on here the feeble and filthy oillamps with which the staircases of the upper temple are lighted of night were of course not illuminating the stairs by day and major pendennis having read with difficulty his nephews name under mr warringtons on the wall of no found still greater difficulty in climbing the abominable black stairs up the banisters of which which contributed their damp exudations to his gloves he groped painfully until he came to the third story a candle was in the passage of one of the two sets of rooms the doors were open and the names of mr warrington and mr a pendennis were very clearly visible to the major as he went in an irish charwoman with a pail and broom opened the door for the major is that the beer cried out a great voice give us hold of it the gentleman who was speaking was seated on a table unshorn and smoking a short pipe in a farther chair sate pen with a cigar and his legs near the fire a little boy who acted as the clerk of these gentlemen was grinning in the majors face at the idea of his being mistaken for beer here upon the third floor the rooms were somewhat lighter and the major could see the place pen my boy its iits your uncle he said choking with the smoke but as most young men of fashion used the weed he pardoned the practice easily enough mr warrington got up from the table and pen in a very perturbed manner from his chair beg your pardon for mistaking you said warrington in a frank loud voice will you take a cigar sir clear those things off the chair pidgeon and pull it round to the fire pen flung his cigar into the grate and was pleased with the cordiality with which his uncle shook him by the hand as soon as he could speak for the stairs and the smoke the major began to ask pen very kindly about himself and about his mother for blood is blood and he was pleased once more to see the boy pen gave his news and then introduced mr warringtonan old boniface manwhose chambers he shared the major was quite satisfied when he heard that mr warrington was a younger son of sir miles warrington of suffolk he had served with an uncle of his in india and in new south wales years ago took a sheepfarm there sir made a fortunebetter thing than law or soldiering warrington said think i shall go there too and here the expected beer coming in in a tankard with a glass bottom mr warrington with a laugh said he supposed the major would not have any and took a long deep draught himself after which he wiped his wrist across his beard with great satisfaction the young man was perfectly easy and unembarrassed he was dressed in a ragged old shootingjacket and had a bristly blue beard he was drinking beer like a coalheaver and yet you couldnt but perceive that he was a gentleman when he had sate for a minute or two after his draught he went out of the room leaving it to pen and his uncle that they might talk over family affairs were they so inclined rough and ready your chum seems the major said somewhat different from your dandy friends at oxbridge times are altered arthur replied with a blush warrington is only just called and has no business but he knows law pretty well and until i can afford to read with a pleader i use his books and get his help is that one of the books the major asked with a smile a french novel was lying at the foot of pens chair this is not a working day sir the lad said we were out very late at a party last nightat lady whistons pen added knowing his uncles weakness every body in town was there except you sir counts embassadors turks stars and gartersi dont know whoits all in the paperand my name too said pen with great glee i met an old flame of mine there sir he added with a laugh you know whom i mean sirlady mirabelto whom i was introduced over again she shook hands and was gracious enough i may thank you for being out of that scrape sir she presented me to the husband tooan old beau in a star and a blonde wig he does not seem very wise she has asked me to call on her sir and i may go now without any fear of losing my heart what we have had some new loves have we the major asked in high goodhumor some two or three mr pen said laughing but i dont put on my grand serieux any more sir that goes off after the first flame very right my dear boy flames and darts and passion and that sort of thing do very well for a lad and you were but a lad when that affair with the fotheringillfotheringaywhats her name came off but a man of the world gives up those follies you still may do very well you have been hit but you may recover you are heir to a little independence which every body fancies is a doosid deal more you have a good name good wits good manners and a good personand begad i dont see why you shouldnt many a woman with moneyget into parliamentdistinguish yourself andand in fact that sort of thing remember its as easy to marry a rich woman as a poor woman and a devilish deal pleasanter to sit down to a good dinner than to a scrag of mutton in lodgings make up your mind to that a woman with a good jointure is a doosid deal easier a profession than the law let me tell you look out i shall be on the watch for you and i shall die content my boy if i can see you with a good ladylike wife and a good carriage and a good pair of horses living in society and seeing your friends like a gentleman would you like to vegetate like your dear good mother at fairoaks dammy sir life without money and the best society isnt worth having it was thus this affectionate uncle spoke and expounded to pen his simple philosophy what would my mother and laura say to this i wonder thought the lad indeed old pendenniss morals were not their morals nor was his wisdom theirs this affecting conversation between uncle and nephew had scarcely concluded when warrington came out of his bedroom no longer in rags but dressed like a gentleman straight and tall and perfectly frank and goodhumored he did the honors of his ragged sittingroom with as much ease as if it had been the finest apartment in london and queer rooms they were in which the major found his nephew the carpet was full of holesthe table stained with many circles of warringtons previous alepots there was a small library of lawbooks books of poetry and of mathematics of which he was very fond he had been one of the hardest livers and hardest readers of his time at oxbridge where the name of stunning warrington was yet famous for beating bargemen pulling matches winning prizes and drinking milkpunch a print of the old college hung up over the mantlepiece and some battered volumes of plato bearing its wellknown arms were on the bookshelves there were two easy chairs a standing readingdesk piled with bills a couple of very meager briefs on a brokenlegged studytable indeed there was scarcely any article of furniture that had not been in the wars and was not wounded look here sir here is pens room he is a dandy and has got curtains to his bed and wears shiny boots and a silver dressingcase indeed pens room was rather coquettishly arranged and a couple of neat prints of operadancers besides a drawing of fairoaks hung on the walls in warringtons room there was scarcely any article of furniture save a great showerbath and a heap of books by the bedside where he lay upon straw like margery daw and smoked his pipe and read half through the night his favorite poetry or mathematics when he had completed his simple toilet mr warrington came out of this room and proceeded to the cupboard to search for his breakfast might i offer you a muttonchop sir we cook em ourselves hot and hot and i am teaching pen the first principles of law cooking and morality at the same time hes a lazy beggar sir and too much of a dandy and so saying mr warrington wiped a gridiron with a piece of paper put it on the fire and on it two muttonchops and took from the cupboard a couple of plates and some knives and silver forks and castors say but a word major pendennis he said theres another chop in the cupboard or pidgeon shall go out and get you any thing you like major pendennis sate in wonder and amusement but he said he had just breakfasted and wouldnt have any lunch so warrington cooked the chops and popped them hissing hot upon the plates pen fell to at his chop with a good appetite after looking up at his uncle and seeing that gentleman was still in goodhumor you see sir warrington said mrs flanagan isnt here to do em and we cant employ the boy for the little beggar is all day occupied cleaning pens boots and now for another swig at the beer pen drinks tea its only fit for old women and so you were at lady whistons last night the major said not in truth knowing what observation to make to this rough diamond i at lady whistons not such a flat sir i dont care for female society in fact it bores me i spent my evening philosophically at the back kitchen the back kitchen indeed said the major i see you dont know what it means warrington said ask pen he was there after lady whistons tell major pendennis about the back kitchen pendont be ashamed of yourself so pen said it was a little eccentric society of men of letters and men about town to which he had been presented and the major began to think that the young fellow had seen a good deal of the world since his arrival in london chapter xxx the knights of the temple illustration colleges schools and inns of court still have some respect for antiquity and maintain a great number of the customs and institutions of our ancestors with which those persons who do not particularly regard their forefathers or perhaps are not very well acquainted with them have long since done away a wellordained workhouse or prison is much better provided with the appliances of health comfort and cleanliness than a respectable foundation school a venerable college or a learned inn in the latter place of residence men are contented to sleep in dingy closets and to pay for the sittingroom and the cupboard which is their dormitory the price of a good villa and garden in the suburbs or of a roomy house in the neglected squares of the town the poorest mechanic in spitalfields has a cistern and an unbounded supply of water at his command but the gentlemen of the inns of court and the gentlemen of the universities have their supply of this cosmetic fetched in jugs by laundresses and bedmakers and live in abodes which were erected long before the custom of cleanliness and decency obtained among us there are individuals still alive who sneer at the people and speak of them with epithets of scorn gentlemen there can be but little doubt that your ancestors were the great unwashed and in the temple especially it is pretty certain that only under the greatest difficulties and restrictions the virtue which has been pronounced to be next to godliness could have been practiced at all old grump of the norfolk circuit who had lived for more than thirty years in the chambers under those occupied by warrington and pendennis and who used to be awakened by the roaring of the showerbaths which those gentlemen had erected in their apartmentsa part of the contents of which occasionally trickled through the roof into mr grumps roomdeclared that the practice was an absurd newfangled dandyfied folly and daily cursed the laundress who slopped the staircase by which he had to pass grump now much more than half a century old had indeed never used the luxury in question he had done without water very well and so had our fathers before him of all those knights and baronets lords and gentlemen bearing arms whose escutcheons are painted upon the walls of the famous hall of the upper temple was there no philanthropist goodnatured enough to devise a set of hummums for the benefit of the lawyers his fellows and successors the temple historian makes no mention of such a scheme there is pump court and fountain court with their hydraulic apparatus but one never heard of a bencher disporting in the fountain and cant but think how many a counsel learned in the law of old days might have benefited by the pump nevertheless those venerable inns which have the lamb and flag and the winged horse for their ensigns have attractions for persons who inhabit them and a share of rough comforts and freedom which men always remember with pleasure i dont know whether the student of law permits himself the refreshment of enthusiasm or indulges in poetical reminiscences as he passes by historical chambers and says yonder eldon livedupon this site coke mused upon lyttletonhere chitty toiledhere barnwell and alderson joined in their famous laborshere byles composed his great work upon bills and smith compiled his immortal leading caseshere gustavus still toils with solomon to aid him but the man of letters cant but love the place which has been inhabited by so many of his brethren or peopled by their creations as real to us at this day as the authors whose children they wereand sir roger de coverley walking in the temple garden and discoursing with mr spectator about the beauties in hoops and patches who are sauntering over the grass is just as lively a figure to me as old samuel johnson rolling through the fog with the scotch gentleman at his heels on their way to dr goldsmiths chambers in brick court or harry fielding with inked ruffles and a wet towel round his head dashing off articles at midnight for the covent garden journal while the printers boy is asleep in the passage if we could but get the history of a single day as it passed in any one of those fourstoried houses in the dingy court where our friends pen and warrington dwelt some temple asmodeus might furnish us with a queer volume there may be a great parliamentary counsel on the groundfloor who drives off to belgravia at dinner time when his clerk too becomes a gentleman and goes away to entertain his friends and to take his pleasure but a short time since he was hungry and briefless in some garret of the inn lived by stealthy literature hoped and waited and sickened and no clients came exhausted his own means and his friends kindness had to remonstrate humbly with duns and to implore the patience of poor creditors ruin seemed to be staring him in the face when behold a turn of the wheel of fortune and the lucky wretch in possession of one of those prodigious prizes which are sometimes drawn in the great lottery of the bar many a better lawyer than himself does not make a fifth part of the income of his clerk who a few months since could scarcely get credit for blacking for his masters unpaid boots on the firstfloor perhaps you will have a venerable man whose name is famous who has lived for half a century in the inn whose brains are full of books and whose shelves are stored with classical and legal lore he has lived alone all these fifty years alone and for himself amassing learning and compiling a fortune he comes home now at night alone from the club where he has been dining freely to the lonely chambers where he lives a godless old recluse when he dies his inn will erect a tablet to his honor and his heirs burn a part of his library would you like to have such a prospect for your old age to store up learning and money and end so but we must not linger too long by mr doomsdays door worthy mr grump lives over him who is also an ancient inhabitant of the inn and who when doomsday comes home to read catullus is sitting down with three steady seniors of his standing to a steady rubber at whist after a dinner at which they have consumed their three steady bottles of port you may see the old boys asleep at the temple church of a sunday attorneys seldom trouble them and they have small fortunes of their own on the other side of the third landing where pen and warrington live till long after midnight sits mr paley who took the highest honors and who is a fellow of his college who will sit and read and note cases until two oclock in the morning who will rise at seven and be at the pleaders chambers as soon as they are open where he will work until an hour before dinnertime who will come home from hall and read and note cases again until dawn next day when perhaps mr arthur pendennis and his friend mr warrington are returning from some of their wild expeditions how differently employed mr paley has been he has not been throwing himself away he has only been bringing a great intellect laboriously down to the comprehension of a mean subject and in his fierce grasp of that resolutely excluding from his mind all higher thoughts all better things all the wisdom of philosophers and historians all the thoughts of poets all wit fancy reflection art love truth altogetherso that he may master that enormous legend of the law which he proposes to gain his livelihood by expounding warrington and paley had been competitors for university honors in former days and had run each other hard and every body said now that the former was wasting his time and energies while all people praised paley for his industry there may be doubts however as to which was using his time best the one could afford time to think and the other never could the one could have sympathies and do kindnesses and the other must needs be always selfish he could not cultivate a friendship or do a charity or admire a work of genius or kindle at the sight of beauty or the sound of a sweet songhe had no time and no eyes for any thing but his lawbooks all was dark outside his readinglamp love and nature and art which is the expression of our praise and sense of the beautiful world of god were shut out from him and as he turned off his lonely lamp at night he never thought but that he had spent the day profitably and went to sleep alike thankless and remorseless but he shuddered when he met his old companion warrington on the stairs and shunned him as one that was doomed to perdition it may have been the sight of that cadaverous ambition and selfcomplacent meanness which showed itself in paleys yellow face and twinkled in his narrow eyes or it may have been a natural appetite for pleasure and joviality of which it must be confessed mr pen was exceedingly fond which deterred that luckless youth from pursuing his designs upon the bench or the woolsack with the ardor or rather steadiness which is requisite in gentlemen who would climb to those seats of honor he enjoyed the temple life with a great deal of relish his worthy relatives thought he was reading as became a regular student and his uncle wrote home congratulatory letters to the kind widow at fairoaks announcing that the lad had sown his wild oats and was becoming quite steady the truth is that it was a new sort of excitement to pen the life in which he was now engaged and having given up some of the dandyfied pretensions and finegentleman airs which he had contracted among his aristocratic college acquaintances of whom he now saw but little the rough pleasures and amusements of a london bachelor were very novel and agreeable to him and he enjoyed them all time was he would have envied the dandies their fine horses in rotten row but he was contented now to walk in the park and look at them he was too young to succeed in london society without a better name and a larger fortune than he had and too lazy to get on without these adjuncts old pendennis fondly thought he was busied with law because he neglected the social advantages presented to him and having been at half a dozen balls and evening parties retreated before their dullness and sameness and whenever any body made inquiries of the worthy major about his nephew the old gentleman said the young rascal was reformed and could not be got away from his books but the major would have been almost as much horrified as mr paley was had he known what was mr pens real course of life and how much pleasure entered into his law studies illustrationmoved up from a long mornings reading a walk in the park a pull on the river a stretch up the hill to hampstead and a modest tavern dinner a bachelor night passed here or there in joviality not vice for arthur pendennis admired women so heartily that he never could bear the society of any of them that were not in his fancy at least good and pure a quiet evening at home alone with a friend and a pipe or two and a humble potation of british spirits whereof mrs flanagan the laundress invariably tested the quality these were our young gentlemans pursuits and it must be owned that his life was not unpleasant in termtime mr pen showed a most praiseworthy regularity in performing one part of the lawstudents course of duty and eating his dinners in hall indeed that hall of the upper temple is a sight not uninteresting and with the exception of some trifling improvements and anachronisms which have been introduced into the practice there a man may sit down and fancy that he joins in a meal of the seventeenth century the bar have their messes the students their tables apart the benchers sit at the high table on the raised platform surrounded by pictures of judges of the law and portraits of royal personages who have honored its festivities with their presence and patronage pen looked about on his first introduction not a little amused with the scene which he witnessed among his comrades of the student class there were gentlemen of all ages from sixty to seventeen stout grayheaded attorneys who were proceeding to take the superior dignitydandies and menabouttown who wished for some reason to be barristers of seven years standingswarthy blackeyed natives of the colonies who came to be called here before they practiced in their own islandsand many gentlemen of the irish nation who make a sojourn in middle temple lane before they return to the green country of their birth there were little squads of reading students who talked law all dinnertime there were rowing men whose discourse was of sculling matches the red house vauxhall and the opera there were others great in politics and orators of the students debating clubs with all of which sets except the first whose talk was an almost unknown and a quite uninteresting language to him mr pen made a gradual acquaintance and had many points of sympathy the ancient and liberal inn of the upper temple provides in its hall and for a most moderate price an excellent wholesome dinner of soup meat tarts and port wine or sherry for the barristers and students who attend that place of refection the parties are arranged in messes of four each of which quarters has its piece of beef or leg of mutton its sufficient applepie and its bottle of wine but the honest habitues of the hall among the lower rank of students who have a taste for good living have many harmless arts by which they improve their banquet and innocent dodges if we may be permitted to use an excellent phrase that has become vernacular since the appearance of the last dictionaries by which they strive to attain for themselves more delicate food than the common everyday roast meat of the students tables wait a bit said mr lowton one of these temple gourmands wait a bit said mr lowton tugging at pens gownthe tables are very full and theres only three benchers to eat ten side dishesif we wait perhaps we shall get something from their table and pen looked with some amusement as did mr lowton with eyes of fond desire toward the benchers high table where three old gentlemen were standing up before a dozen silver dishcovers while the clerk was quavering out a grace lowton was great in the conduct of the dinner his aim was to manage so as to be the first a captain of the mess and to secure for himself the thirteenth glass of the bottle of port wine thus he would have the command of the joint on which he operated his favorite cuts and made rapid dexterous appropriations of gravy which amused pen infinitely poor jack lowton thy pleasures in life were very harmless an eager epicure thy desires did not go beyond eighteenpence pen was somewhat older than many of his fellowstudents and there was that about his style and appearance which as we have said was rather haughty and impertinent that stamped him as a man of tonvery unlike those pale students who were talking law to one another and those ferocious dandies in rowing shirts and astonishing pins and waistcoats who represented the idle part of the little community the humble and goodnatured lowton had felt attracted by pens superior looks and presenceand had made acquaintance with him at the mess by opening the conversation this is boiledbeef day i believe sir said lowton to pen upon my word sir im not aware said pen hardly able to contain his laughter but added im a stranger this is my first term on which lowton began to point out to him the notabilities in the hall thats boosey the bencher the bald one sitting under the picture and aving soup i wonder whether its turtle they often ave turtle next is balls the kings counsel and swettenhamhodge and swettenham you know thats old grump the senior of the bar they say hes dined here forty years they often send em down their fish from the benchers to the senior table do you see those four fellows seated opposite us those are regular swellstiptop fellows i can tell youmr trail the bishop of ealings son honorable fred ringwood lord cinqbars brother you know hell have a good place i bet any money and bob suckling whos always with thema high fellow too ha ha here lowton burst into a laugh what is it said pen still amused i say i like to mess with those chaps lowton said winking his eye knowingly and pouring out his glass of wine and why asked pen why they dont come down here to dine you know they only make believe to dine they dine here law bless you they go to some of the swell clubs or else to some grand dinner party you see their names in the morning post at all the fine parties in london why i bet any thing that ringwood has his cab or trail his brougham hes a devil of a fellow and makes the bishops money spin i can tell you at the corner of essexstreet at this minute they dine they wont dine these two hours i dare say but why should you like to mess with them if they dont eat any dinner pen asked still puzzled theres plenty isnt there how green you are said lowton excuse me but you are green they dont drink any wine dont you see and a fellow gets the bottle to himself if he likes it when he messes with those three chaps thats why corkoran got in with em ah mr lowton i see you are a sly fellow pen said delighted with his acquaintance on which the other modestly replied that he had lived in london the better part of his life and of course had his eyes about him and went on with his catalogue to pen theres a lot of irish here he said that corkorans one and i cant say i like him you see that handsome chap with the blue neckcloth and pink shirt and yellow waistcoat thats another thats molloy maloney of ballymaloney and nephew to majorgeneral sir hector odowd he he lowton said trying to imitate the hibernian accent hes always bragging about his uncle and came into hall in silverstriped trowsers the day he had been presented that other near him with the long black hair is a tremendous rebel by jove sir to hear him at the forum it makes your blood freeze and the next is an irishman too jack finucane reporter of a newspaper they all stick together those irish its your turn to fill your glass what you wont have any port dont like port with your dinner heres your health and this worthy man found himself not the less attached to pendennis because the latter disliked port wine at dinner it was while pen was taking his share of one of these dinners with his acquaintance lowton as the captain of his mess that there came to join them a gentleman in a barristers gown who could not find a seat as it appeared among the persons of his own degree and who strode over the table and took his seat on the bench where pen sate he was dressed in old clothes and a faded gown which hung behind him and he wore a shirt which though clean was extremely ragged and very different to the magnificent pink raiment of mr molloy maloney who occupied a commanding position in the next mess in order to notify their appearance at dinner it is the custom of the gentlemen who eat in the upper temple hall to write down their names upon slips of paper which are provided for that purpose with a pencil for each mess lowton wrote his name first then came arthur pendennis and the next was that of the gentleman in the old clothes he smiled when he saw pens name and looked at him we ought to know each other he said were both boniface men my names warrington are you st warrington pen said delighted to see this hero warrington laughedstunning warringtonyes he said i recollect you in your freshmans term but you appear to have quite cut me out the college talks about you still said pen who had a generous admiration for talent and pluck the bargeman you thrashed bill simes dont you remember wants you up again at oxbridge the miss notleys the haberdashers hush said warringtonglad to make your acquaintance pendennis heard a good deal about you the young men were friends immediately and at once deep in collegetalk and pen who had been acting rather the fine gentleman on a previous day when he pretended to lowton that he could not drink port wine at dinner seeing warrington take his share with a great deal of gusto did not scruple about helping himself any more rather to the disappointment of honest lowton when the dinner was over warrington asked arthur where he was going i thought of going home to dress and hear grisi in norma pen said are you going to meet any body there he asked pen said noonly to hear the music of which he was very fond you had much better come home and smoke a pipe with me said warringtona very short one come i live close by in lamb court and well talk over boniface and old times they went away lowton sighed after them he knew that warrington was a baronets son and he looked up with simple reverence to all the aristocracy pen and warrington became sworn friends from that night warringtons cheerfulness and jovial temper his good sense his rough welcome and his neverfailing pipe of tobacco charmed pen who found it more pleasant to dive into shilling taverns with him than to dine in solitary state among the silent and polite frequenters of the polyanthus ere long pen gave up the lodgings in st jamess to which he had migrated on quitting his hotel and found it was much more economical to take up his abode with warrington in lamb court and furnish and occupy his friends vacant room there for it must be said of pen that no man was more easily led than he to do a thing when it was a novelty or when he had a mind to it and pidgeon the youth and flanagan the laundress divided their allegiance now between warrington and pen chapter xxxi old and new acquaintances illustration elated with the idea of seeing life pen went into a hundred queer london haunts he liked to think he was consorting with all sorts of menso he beheld coalheavers in their taprooms boxers in their innparlors honest citizens disporting in the suburbs or on the river and he would have liked to hob and nob with celebrated pickpockets or drink a pot of ale with a company of burglars and cracksmen had chance afforded him an opportunity of making the acquaintance of this class of society it was good to see the gravity with which warrington listened to the tutbury pet or the brighton stunner at the champions arms and behold the interest which he took in the coalheaving company assembled at the foxunderthehill his acquaintance with the publichouses of the metropolis and its neighborhood and with the frequenters of their various parlors was prodigious he was the personal friend of the landlord and landlady and welcome to the bar as to the clubroom he liked their society he said better than that of his own class whose manners annoyed him and whose conversation bored him in society he used to say ever body is the same wears the same dress eats and drinks and says the same things one young dandy at the club talks and looks just like another one miss at a ball exactly resembles another whereas theres character here i like to talk with the strongest man in england or the man who can drink the most beer in england or with that tremendous republican of a hatter who thinks thistlewood was the greatest character in history i like ginandwater better than claret i like a sanded floor in carnaby market better than a chalked one in mayfair i prefer snobs i own it indeed this gentleman was a social republican and it never entered his head while conversing with jack and tom that he was in any respect their better although perhaps the deference which they paid him might secretly please him pen followed him then to these various resorts of men with great glee and assiduity but he was considerably younger and therefore much more pompous and stately than warrington in fact a young prince in disguise visiting the poor of his fathers kingdom they respected him as a high chap a fine fellow a regular young swell he had somehow about him an air of imperious goodhumor and a royal frankness and majesty although he was only heir apparent to twopencehalfpenny and but one in descent from a gallypot if these positions are made for us we acquiesce in them very easily and are always pretty ready to assume a superiority over those who are as good as ourselves pens condescension at this time of his life was a fine thing to witness among men of ability this assumption and impertinence passes off with extreme youth but it is curious to watch the conceit of a generous and clever ladthere is something almost touching in that early exhibition of simplicity and folly so after reading pretty hard of a morning and i fear not law merely but politics and general history and literature which were as necessary for the advancement and instruction of a young man as mere dry law after applying with tolerable assiduity to letters to reviews to elemental books of law and above all to the newspaper until the hour of dinner was drawing nigh these young gentlemen would sally out upon the town with great spirits and appetite and bent upon enjoying a merry night as they had passed a pleasant forenoon it was a jovial time that of fourandtwenty when every muscle of mind and body was in healthy action when the world was new as yet and one moved over it spurred onward by good spirits and the delightful capability to enjoy if ever we feel young afterward it is with the comrades of that time the tunes we hum in our old age are those we learned then sometimes perhaps the festivity of that period revives in our memory but how dingy the pleasuregarden has grown how tattered the garlands look how scant and old the company and what a number of the lights have gone out since that day gray hairs have come on like daylight streaming indaylight and a headache with it pleasure has gone to bed with the rouge on her cheeks well friend let us walk through the day sober and sad but friendly i wonder what laura and helen would have said could they have seen as they might not unfrequently have done had they been up and in london in the very early morning when the bridges began to blush in the sunrise and the tranquil streets of the city to shine in the dawn mr pen and mr warrington rattling over the echoing flags toward the temple after one of their wild nights of carousenights wild but not so wicked as such nights sometimes are for warrington was a womanhater and pen as we have said too lofty to stoop to a vulgar intrigue our young prince of fairoaks never could speak to one of the sex but with respectful courtesy and shrank from a coarse word or gesture with instinctive delicacyfor though we have seen him fall in love with a fool as his betters and inferiors have done and as it is probable that he did more than once in his life yet for the time of the delusion it was always as a goddess that he considered her and chose to wait upon her men serve women kneelingwhen they get on their feet they go away that was what on acquaintance of pens said to him in his hard homely way an old friend with whom he had fallen in again in londonno other than honest mr bows of the chatteries theater who was now employed as pianoforte player to accompany the eminent lyrical talent which nightly delighted the public at the fieldings head in covent garden and where was held the little club called the back kitchen numbers of pens friends frequented this very merry meeting the fieldings head had been a house of entertainment almost since the time when the famous author of tom jones presided as magistrate in the neighboring bowstreet his place was pointed out and the chair said to have been his still occupied by the president of the nights entertainment the worthy cutts the landlord of the fieldings head generally occupied this post when not disabled by gout or other illness his jolly appearance and fine voice may be remembered by some of my male readers he used to sing profusely in the course of the harmonic meeting and his songs were of what may be called the british brandyandwater school of songsuch as the good old english gentleman dear tom this brown jug and so forthsongs in which pathos and hospitality are blended and the praises of good liquor and the social affections are chanted in a barytone voice the charms of our women the heroic deeds of our naval and military commanders are often sung in the ballads of this school and many a time in my youth have i admired how cutts the singer after he had worked us all up to patriotic enthusiasm by describing the way in which the brave abercrombie received his deathwound or made us join him in tears which he shed liberally himself as in faltering accents he told how autumns falling leaf proclaimed the old man he must diehow cutts the singer became at once cutts the landlord and before the applause which we were making with our fists on his table in compliment to his heartstirring melody had died away was calling now gentlemen give your orders the waiters in the roomjohn a champagne cup for mr green i think sir you said sausages and mashed potatoes john attend on the gentleman and ill thank ye give me a glass of punch too john and take care the wather boils a voice would cry not unfrequently a wellknown voice to pen which made the lad blush and start when he heard it firstthat of the venerable captain costigan who was now established in london and one of the great pillars of the harmonic meetings at the fieldings head the captains manners and conversation brought very many young men to the place he was a character and his fame had begun to spread soon after his arrival in the metropolis and especially after his daughters marriage he was great in his conversation to the friend for the time being who was the neighbor drinking by his side about me daughter he told of her marriage and of the events previous and subsequent to that ceremony of the carriages she kept of mirabels adoration for her and for him of the hundther pounds which he was at perfect liberty to draw from his soninlaw whenever necessity urged him and having stated that it was his firm intention to dthraw next sathurday i give ye me secred word and honor next sathurday the fourteenth when yell see the money will be handed over to me at couttss the very instant i present the check the captain would not unfrequently propose to borrow a halfcrown of his friend until the arrival of that day of greek calends when on the honor of an officer and gentleman he would repee the thrifling obligetion sir charles mirabel had not that enthusiastic attachment to his fatherinlaw of which the latter sometimes boasted although in other stages of emotion cos would inveigh with tears in his eyes against the ingratitude of the child of his bosom and the stinginess of the wealthy old man who had married her but the pair had acted not unkindly toward costigan had settled a small pension on him which was paid regularly and forestalled with even more regularity by poor cos and the period of the payments were always well known by his friend at the fieldings head whither the honest captain took care to repair bank notes in hand calling loudly for change in the midst of the full harmonic meeting i think yell find that note wont be refused at the bank of england cutts my boy captain costigan would say bows have a glass ye neednt stint yourself tonight any how and a glass of punch will make ye play con spirito for he was lavishly free with his money when it came to him and was scarcely known to button his breeches pocket except when the coin was gone or sometimes indeed when a creditor came by it was in one of these moments of exultation that pen found his old friend swaggering at the singers table at the back kitchen of the fieldings head and ordering glasses of brandy and water for any of his acquaintances who made their appearance in the apartment warrington who was on confidential terms with the bass singer made his way up to this quarter of the room and pen walked at his friends heels pen started and blushed to see costigan he had just come from lady whistons party where he had met and spoken with the captains daughter again for the first time after very old old days he came up with outstretched hand very kindly and warmly to greet the old man still retaining a strong remembrance of the time when costigans daughter had been every thing in the world to him for though this young gentleman may have been somewhat capricious in his attachments and occasionally have transferred his affections from one woman to another yet he always respected the place where love had dwelt and like the sultan of turkey desired that honors should be paid to the lady toward whom he had once thrown the royal pockethandkerchief the tipsy captain returning the clasp of pens hand with all the strength of a palm which had become very shaky by the constant lifting up of weights of brandyandwater looked hard in pens face and said grecious heavens is it possible me dear boy me dear fellow me dear friend and then with a look of muddled curiosity fairly broke down with i know your face me dear dear friend but bedad ive forgot your name five years of constant punch had passed since pen and costigan met arthur was a good deal changed and the captain may surely be excused for forgetting him when a man at the actual moment sees things double we may expect that his view of the past will be rather muzzy pen saw his condition and laughed although perhaps he was somewhat mortified dont you remember me captain he said i am pendennisarthur pendennis of chatteries the sound of the young mans friendly voice recalled and steadied coss tipsy remembrance and he saluted arthur as soon as he knew him with a loud volley of friendly greetings pen was his dearest boy his gallant young friend his noble collagian whom he had held in his inmost heart ever since they had partedhow was his fawther no his mother and his guardian the general the major i preshoom from your apparance that youve come into your prawpertee and bedad yeell spend it like a man of spiritill go bail for that no not yet come into your estete if ye want any thrifle heark ye theres poor old jack costigan has got a guinea or two in his pocketand be heavens you shall never want awthur me dear boy whatll ye have john come hither and look aloive give this gentleman a glass of punch and ill pay fortyour friend ive seen him before permit me to have the honor of making meself known to ye sir and requesting yell take a glass of punch i dont envy sir charles mirabel his fatherinlaw thought pendennis and how is my old friend mr bows captain have you any news of him and do you see him still no doubt hes very well said the captain jingling his money and whistling the air of a songthe little doodeenfor the singing of which he was celebrated at the fieldings head me dear boyive forgot your name againbut my names costigan jack costigan and id loike ye to take as many tumblers of punch in my name as ever ye loike ye know my name im not ashamed of it and so the captain went maundering on its payday with the general said mr hodgen the bass singer with whom warrington was in deep conversation and hes a precious deal more than half seas over he has already tried that little doodeen of his and broke it too just before i sang king death have you heard my new song the body snatcher mr warringtonangcored at saint bartholomews the other nightcomposed expressly for me peraps you or your friend would like a copy of the song sir john just ave the kyndness to and over a body snatcher ere will yertheres a portrait of me sir as i sing itas the snatcherconsidered rather like thank you said warrington heard it nine timesknow it by heart hodgen here the gentleman who presided at the pianoforte began to play upon his instrument and pen looking in the direction of the music beheld that very mr bows for whom he had been asking but now and whose existence costigan had momentarily forgotten the little old man sate before the battered piano which had injured its constitution woefully by sitting up so many nights and spoke with a voice as it were at once hoarse and faint and accompanied the singers or played with taste and grace in the intervals of the songs bows had seen and recollected pen at once when the latter came into the room and had remarked the eager warmth of the young mans recognition of costigan he now began to play an air which pen instantly remembered as one which used to be sung by the chorus of villagers in the stranger just before mrs haller came in it shook pen as he heard it he remembered how his heart used to beat as that air was played and before the divine emily made her entry nobody save arthur took any notice of old bows playing it was scarcely heard amid the clatter of knives and forks the calls for poached eggs and kidneys and the tramp of guests and waiters pen went up and kindly shook the player by the hand at the end of his performance and bows greeted arthur with great respect and cordiality what you havent forgot the old tune mr pendennis he said i thought youd remember it i take it it was the first tune of that sort you ever heard playedwasnt it sir you were quite a young chap then i fear the captains very bad tonight he breaks out on a payday and i shall have the deuces own trouble in getting home we live together we still hang on sir in partnership though miss emthough my lady mirabel has left the firm and so you remember old times do you wasnt she a beauty sir your health and my service to youand he took a sip at the pewter measure of porter which stood by his side as he played pen had many opportunities of seeing his early acquaintances afterward and of renewing his relations with costigan and the old musician as they sate thus in friendly colloquy men of all sorts and conditions entered and quitted the house of entertainment and pen had the pleasure of seeing as many different persons of his race as the most eager observer need desire to inspect healthy country tradesmen and farmers in london for their business came and recreated themselves with the jolly singing and suppers of the back kitchensquads of young apprentices and assistants the shutters being closed over the scene of their labors came hither for fresh air doubtlessrakish young medical students gallant dashing what is called loudly dressed and must it be owned somewhat dirtywere here smoking and drinking and vociferously applauding the songs young university bucks were to be found here too with that indescribable genteel simper which is only learned at the knees of alma mater and handsome young guardsmen and florid bucks from the st jamessstreet clubs nay senators english and irish and even members of the house of peers the bass singer had made an immense hit with his song of the body snatcher and the town rushed to listen to it a curtain drew aside and mr hodgen appeared in the character of the snatcher sitting on a coffin with a flask of gin before him with a spade and a candle stuck in a skull the song was sung with a really admirable terrific humor the singers voice went down so low that its grumbles rumbled into the hearers awestricken soul and in the chorus he clamped with his spade and gave a demoniac ha ha which caused the very glasses to quiver on the table as with terror none of the other singers not even cutts himself as that highminded man owned could stand up before the snatcher and he commonly used to retire to mrs cutts private apartments or into the bar before that fatal song extinguished him poor coss ditty the little doodeen which bows accompanied charmingly on the piano was sung but to a few admirers who might choose to remain after the tremendous resurrectionist chant the room was commonly emptied after that or only left in possession of a very few and persevering votaries of pleasure while pen and his friend were sitting here together one night or rather morning two habitues of the house entered almost together mr hoolan and mr doolan whispered warrington to pen saluting these gentlemen and in the latter pen recognized his friend of the alacrity coach who could not dine with pen on the day on which the latter had invited him being compelled by his professional duties to decline dinnerengagements on fridays he had stated with his compliments to mr pendennis doolans paper the dawn was lying on the table much bestained by porter and cheekbyjowl with hoolans paper which we shall call the day the dawn was liberalthe day was ultraconservative many of our journals are officered by irish gentlemen and their gallant brigade does the penning among us as their ancestors used to transact the fighting in europe and engage under many a flag to be good friends when the battle is over kidneys john and a glass of stout says hoolan how are you morgan hows mrs doolan doing pretty well thank ye mick my boyfaith shes accustomed to it said doolan hows the lady that owns ye maybe ill step down sunday and have a glass of punch kilburn way dont bring patsey with you morgan for georgys got the measles said the friendly mick and they straightway fell to talk about matters connected with their tradeabout the foreign mailsabout who was correspondent at paris and who wrote from madridabout the expense the morning journal was at in sending couriers about the circulation of the evening star and so forth warrington laughing took the dawn which was lying before him and pointed to one of the leading articles in that journal which commenced thus as rogues of note in former days who had some wicked work to performan enemy to be put out of the way a quantity of false coin to be passed a lie to be told or a murder to be doneemployed a professional perjurer or assassin to do the work which they were themselves too notorious or too cowardly to execute our notorious contemporary the day engages smashers out of doors to utter forgeries against individuals and calls in auxiliary cutthroats to murder the reputation of those who offend him a black vizarded ruffian whom we will unmask who signs the forged name of trefoil is at present one of the chief bravoes and bullies in our contemporarys establishment he is the eunuch who brings the bowstring and strangles at the order of the day we can convict this cowardly slave and propose to do so the charge which he has brought against lord bangbanagher because he is a liberal irish peer and against the board of poor law guardians of the bangbanagher union is c how did they like the article at your place mick asked morgan when the captain puts his hand to it hes a tremendous hand at a smasher he wrote the article in two hoursinwhewyou know where while the boy was waiting our governor thinks the public dont mind a straw about these newspaper rows and has told the docthor to stop answering said the other them two talked it out together in my room the docthor would have liked a turn for he says its such easy writing and requires no reading up of a subject but the governor put a stopper on him the taste for eloquence is going out mick said morgan deed then it is morgan said mick that was fine writing when the docthor wrote in the phaynix and he and condy roony blazed away at each other day after day and with powder and shot too as well as paper says morgan faith the docthor was out twice and condy roony winged his man they are talking about doctor boyne and captain shandon warrington said who are the two irish controversialists of the dawn and the day dr boyne being the protestant champion and captain shandon the liberal orator they are the best friends in the world i believe in spite of their newspaper controversies and though they cry out against the english for abusing their country by jove they abuse it themselves more in a single article than we should take the pains to do in a dozen volumes how are you doolan your servant mr warringtonmr pendennis i am delighted to have the honor of seeing ye again the nights journey on the top of the alacrity was one of the most agreeable i ever enjoyed in my life and it was your liveliness and urbanity that made the trip so charming i have often thought over that happy night sir and talked over it to mrs doolan i have seen your elegant young friend mr foker too here sir not unfrequently he is an occasional frequenter of this hostelry and a right good one it is mr pendennis when i saw you i was on the tom and jerry weekly paper i have now the honor to be subeditor of the dawn one of the best written papers of the empireand he bowed very slightly to mr warrington his speech was unctuous and measured his courtesy oriental his tone when talking with the two englishmen quite different to that with which he spoke to his comrade why the devil will the fellow compliment so growled warrington with a sneer which he hardly took the pains to suppress pshawho comes hereall parnassus is abroad tonight heres archer we shall have some fun well archer house up havent been there i have been said archer with an air of mystery where i was wanted get me some supper johnsomething substantial i hate your grandees who give you nothing to eat if it had been at apsley house it would have been quite different the duke knows what i like and says to the groom of the chambers martin you will have some cold beef not too much done and a pint bottle of pale ale and some brown sherry ready in my study as usual archer is coming here this evening the duke doesnt eat supper himself but he likes to see a man enjoy a hearty meal and he knows that i dine early a man cant live upon air be hanged to him let me introduce you to my friend mr pendennis warrington said with great gravity pen this is mr archer whom you have heard me talk about you must know pens uncle the major archer you who know every body dined with him the day before yesterday at gaunt house archer said we were fourthe french embassador steyne and we two commoners why my uncle is in scot pen was going to break out but warrington pressed his foot under the table as a signal for him to be quiet it was about the same business that i have been to the palace tonight archer went on simply and where ive been kept four hours in an anteroom with nothing but yesterdays times which i knew by heart as i wrote three of the leading articles myself and though the lord chamberlain came in four times and once holding the royal teacup and saucer in his hand he did not so much as say to me archer will you have a cup of tea indeed what is in the wind now asked warringtonand turning to pen added you know i suppose that when there is any thing wrong at court they always send for archer there is something wrong said mr archer and as the story will be all over the town in a day or two i dont mind telling itat the last chantilly races where i rode brian boru for my old friend the duke de st cloudthe old king said to me archer im uneasy about saint cloud i have arranged his marriage with the princess marie cunegonde the peace of europe depends upon itfor russia will declare war if the marriage does not take place and the young fool is so mad about madame massena marshal massenas wife that he actually refuses to be a party to the marriage well sir i spoke to saint cloud and having got him into pretty good humor by winning the race and a good bit of money into the bargain he said to me archer tell the governor ill think of it how do you say governor in french asked pen who piqued himself on knowing that language oh we speak in englishi taught him when we were boys and i saved his life at twickenham when he fell out of a punt archer said i shall never forget the queens looks as i brought him out of the water she gave me this diamond ring and always calls me charles to this day madame massena must be rather an old woman archer warrington said devlish oldold enough to be his grandmother i told him so archer answered at once but those attachments for old women are the deuce and all thats what the king feels thats what shocks the poor queen so much they went away from paris last tuesday night and are living at this present moment at jaunays hotel has there been a private marriage archer asked warrington whether there has or not i dont know mr archer replied all i know is that i was kept waiting four hours at the palace that i never saw a man in such a state of agitation as the king of belgium when he came out to speak to me and that im devilish hungryand here comes some supper he has been pretty well tonight said warrington as the pair went home together but i have known him in much greater force and keeping a whole room in a state of wonder put aside his archery practice that man is both able and honesta good man of business an excellent friend admirable to his family as husband father and son what is it makes him pull the long bow in that wonderful manner an amiable insanity answered warrington he never did any body harm by his talk or said evil of any body he is a stout politician too and would never write a word or do an act against his party as many of us do of us who are we asked pen of what profession is mr archer of the corporation of goosequillof the press my boy said warrington of the fourth estate are you too of the craft then pendennis said we will talk about that another time answered the other they were passing through the strand as they talked and by a newspaper office which was all lighted up and bright reporters were coming out of the place or rushing up to it in cabs there were lamps burning in the editors rooms and above where the compositors were at work the windows of the building were in a blaze of gas look at that pen warrington said there she isthe great engineshe never sleeps she has her embassadors in every quarter of the worldher couriers upon every road her officers march along with armies and her envoys walk into statesmens cabinets they are ubiquitous yonder journal has an agent at this minute giving bribes at madrid and another inspecting the price of potatoes in covent garden look here comes the foreign express galloping in they will be able to give news to downingstreet tomorrow funds will rise or fall fortunes be made or lost lord b will get up and holding the paper in his hand and seeing the noble marquis in his place will make a great speech andand mr doolan will be called away from his supper at the back kitchen for he is foreign subeditor and sees the mail on the newspaper sheet before he goes to his own and so talking the friends turned into their chambers and the dawn was beginning to peep chapter xxxii in which the printers devil comes to the door illustration pen in the midst of his revels and enjoyments humble as they were and moderate in cost if not in kind saw an awful sword hanging over him which must drop down before long and put an end to his follies and feasting his money was very nearly spent his club subscription had carried away a third part of it he had paid for the chief articles of furniture with which he had supplied his little bedroom in fine he was come to the last fivepound note in his pocketbook and could think of no method of providing a successor for our friend had been bred up like a young prince as yet or as a child in arms whom his mother feeds when it cries out warrington did not know what his comrades means were an only child with a mother at her country house and an old dandy of an uncle who dined with a great man every day pen might have a large bank at his command for any thing that the other knew he had gold chains and a dressingcase fit for a lord his habits were those of an aristocratnot that he was expensive upon any particular point for he dined and laughed over the pint of porter and the plate of beef from the cooks shop with perfect content and good appetitebut he could not adopt the pennywise precautions of life he could not give twopence to a waiter he could not refrain from taking a cab if he had a mind to do so or if it rained and as surely as he took the cab he overpaid the driver he had a scorn for cleaned gloves and minor economies had he been bred to ten thousand a year he could scarcely have been more freehanded and for a beggar with a sad story or a couple of pretty piteousfaced children he never could resist putting his hand into his pocket it was a sumptuous nature perhaps that could not be brought to regard money a natural generosity and kindness and possibly a petty vanity that was pleased with praise even with the praise of waiters and cabmen i doubt whether the wisest of us know what our own motives are and whether some of the actions of which we are the very proudest will not surprise us when we trace them as we shall one day to their source warrington then did not know and pen had not thought proper to confide to his friend his pecuniary history that pen had been wild and wickedly extravagant at college the other was aware every body at college was extravagant and wild but how great the sons expenses had been and how small the mothers means were points which had not been as yet submitted to mr warringtons examination at last the story came out while pen was grimly surveying the change for the last fivepound note as it lay upon the tray from the publichouse by mr warringtons pot of ale it is the last rose of summer said pen its blooming companions have gone long ago and behold the last one of the garland has shed its leaves and he told warrington the whole story which we know of his mothers means of his own follies of lauras generosity during which time warrington smoked his pipe and listened intent impecuniosity will do you good pens friend said knocking out the ashes at the end of the narration i dont know any thing more wholesome for a manfor an honest man mind youfor another the medicine loses its effectthan a state of tick it is an alterative and a tonic it keeps your moral man in a perpetual state of excitement as a man who is riding at a fence or has his opponents single stick before him is forced to look his obstacle steadily in the face and braces himself to repulse or overcome it a little necessity brings out your pluck if you have any and nerves you to grapple with fortune you will discover what a number of things you can do without when you have no money to buy them you wont want new gloves and varnished boots eau de cologne and cabs to ride in you have been bred up as a mollycoddle pen and spoilt by the women a single man who has health and brains and cant find a livelihood in the world doesnt deserve to stay there let him pay his last halfpenny and jump over waterloo bridge let him steal a leg of mutton and be transported and get out of the countryhe is not fit to live in it dixi i have spoken give us another pull at the pale ale you have certainly spoken but how is one to live said pen there is beef and bread in plenty in england but you must pay for it with work or money and who will take my work and what work can i do warrington burst out laughing suppose we advertise in the times he said for an ushers place at a classical and commercial academya gentleman ba of st boniface college oxbridge and who was plucked for his degree confound you cried pen wishes to give lessons in classics and mathematics and the rudiments of the french language he can cut hair attend to the younger pupils and play a second on the piano with the daughters of the principal address a p lamb court temple go on said pen growling men take to all sorts of professions why there is your friend bloundellbloundell is a professional blackleg and travels the continent where he picks up young gentlemen of fashion and fleeces them there is bob otoole with whom i was at school who drives the ballynafad mail now and carries honest jack finucanes own correspondence to that city i know a man sir a doctors son likewell dont be angry i meant nothing offensivea doctors son i say who was walking the hospitals here and quarreled with his governor on questions of finance and what did he do when he came to his last fivepound note he let his mustaches grow went into a provincial town where he announced himself as professor spineto chiropodist to the emperor of all the russias and by a happy operation on the editor of the country newspaper established himself in practice and lived reputably for three years he has been reconciled to his family and has now succeeded to his fathers gallypots hang gallypots cried pen i cant drive a coach cut corns or cheat at cards theres nothing else you propose yes theres our own correspondent warrington said every man has his secrets look you before you told me the story of your moneymatters i had no idea but that you were a gentleman of fortune for with your confounded airs and appearance any body would suppose you to be so from what you tell me about your mothers income it is clear that you must not lay any more hands on it you cant go on spunging upon the women you must pay off that trump of a girl laura is her namehere is your health lauraand carry a hod rather than ask for a shilling from home but how earn one asked pen how do i live think you said the other on my younger brothers allowance pendennis i have secrets of my own my boy and here warringtons countenance fell i made away with that allowance five years ago if i had made away with myself a little time before it would have been better i have played off my own bat ever since i dont want much money when my purse is out i go to work and fill it and then lie idle like a serpent or an indian until i have digested the mass look i begin to feel empty warrington said and showed pen a long lean purse with but a few sovereigns at one end of it but how do you fill it said pen i write said warrington i dont tell the world that i do so he added with a blush i do not choose that questions should be asked or perhaps i am an ass and dont wish it to be said that george warrington writes for bread but i write in the law reviews look here these articles are mine and he turned over some sheets i write in a newspaper now and then of which a friend of mine is editor and warrington going with pendennis to the club one day called for a file of the dawn and pointed with his finger silently to one or two articles which pen read with delight he had no difficulty in recognizing the style afterwardthe strong thoughts and curt periods the sense the satire and the scholarship i am not up to this said pen with a genuine admiration of his friends powers i know very little about politics or history warrington and have but a smattering of letters i cant fly upon such a wing as yours but you can on your own my boy which is lighter and soars higher perhaps the other said goodnaturedly those little scraps and verses which i have seen of yours show me what is rare in these days a natural gift sir you neednt blush you conceited young jackanapes you have thought so yourself any time these ten years you have got the sacred flamea little of the real poetical fire sir i think and all our oillamps are nothing compared to that though ever so well trimmed you are a poet pen my boy and so speaking warrington stretched out his broad hand and clapped pen on the shoulder arthur was so delighted that the tears came into his eyes how kind you are to me warrington he said i like you old boy said the other i was devlish lonely in chambers and wanted somebody and the sight of your honest face somehow pleased me i liked the way you laughed at lowtonthat poor good little snob and in fine the reason why i can not tellbut so it is young un im alone in the world sir and i wanted some one to keep me company and a glance of extreme kindness and melancholy passed out of warringtons dark eyes pen was too much pleased with his own thoughts to perceive the sadness of the friend who was complimenting him thank you warrington he said thank you for your friendship to me andand what you say about me i have often thought i was a poet i will be onei think i am one as you say so though the world maynt is itis it the ariadne in naxos which you liked i was only eighteen when i wrote it or the prize poem warrington burst into a roar of laughter why you young goose he yelled outof all the miserable weak rubbish i ever tried ariadne in naxos is the most mawkish and disgusting the prize poem is so pompous and feeble that im positively surprised sir it didnt get the medal you dont suppose that you are a serious poet do you and are going to cut out milton and aeschylus are you setting up to be a pindar you absurd little tomtit and fancy you have the strength and pinion which the theban eagle bear sailing with supreme dominion through the azure fields of air no my boy i think you can write a magazine article and turn out a pretty copy of verses thats what i think of you by jove said pen bouncing up and stamping his foot ill show you that i am a better man than you think for warrington only laughed the more and blew twentyfour puffs rapidly out of his pipe by way of reply to pen an opportunity for showing his skill presented itself before very long that eminent publisher mr bacon formerly bacon and bungay of paternoster row besides being the proprietor of the legal review in which mr warrington wrote and of other periodicals of note and gravity used to present to the world every year a beautiful gilt volume called the spring annual edited by the lady violet lebas and numbering among its contributors not only the most eminent but the most fashionable poets of our time young lord dodos poems first appeared in this miscellanythe honorable percy popjoy whose chivalrous ballads have obtained him such a reputationbedwin sandss eastern ghazuls and many more of the works of our young nobles were first given to the world in the spring annual which has since shared the fate of other vernal blossoms and perished out of the world the book was daintily illustrated with pictures of reigning beauties or other prints of a tender and voluptuous character and as these plates were prepared long beforehand requiring much time in engraving it was the eminent poets who had to write to the plates and not the painters who illustrated the poems one day just when this volume was on the eve of publication it chanced that mr warrington called in paternoster row to talk with mr hack mr bacons reader and general manager of publicationsfor mr bacon not having the least taste in poetry or in literature of any kind wisely employed the services of a professional gentleman warrington then going into mr hacks room on business of his own found that gentleman with a bundle of proof plates and sheets of the spring annual before him and glanced at some of them percy popjoy had written some verses to illustrate one of the pictures which was called the church porch a spanish damsel was hastening to church with a large prayerbook a youth in a cloak was hidden in a niche watching this young woman the picture was pretty but the great genius of percy popjoy had deserted him for he had made the most execrable verses which ever were perpetrated by a young nobleman warrington burst out laughing as he read the poem and mr hack laughed too but with rather a rueful faceit wont do he said the public wont stand it bungays people are going to bring out a very good book and have set up miss bunyan against lady violet we have most titles to be surebut the verses are too bad lady violet herself owns it shes busy with her own poem whats to be done we cant lose the plate the governor gave sixty pounds for it i know a fellow who would do some

wineshop window ogling herwhat the deuce am i to do with it try said warrington earn your livelihood for once you who long so to do it well i will try said pen and ill go out to dinner said warrington and left mr pen in a brown study illustration when warrington came home that night at a very late hour the verses were done there they are said pen ive screwed em out at last i think theyll do i think they will said warrington after reading them they ran as follows the church porch although i enter not yet round about the spot sometimes i hover and at the sacred gate with longing eyes i wait

stepping fast and hastening hither with modest eyes downcast she comesshes hereshes past may heaven go with her kneel undisturbd fair saint pour out your praise or plaint meekly and duly i will not enter there to sully your pure prayer with thoughts unruly but suffer me to pace round the forbidden place lingering a minute like outcast spirits who wait and see through heavens gate angels within it have you got any more young fellow asked warrington we must make them give you a couple of guineas a page and if the verses are liked why youll get an entree into bacons magazines and may turn a decent penny pen examined his portfolio and found another ballad which he thought might figure with advantage in the spring annual and consigning these two precious documents to warrington the pair walked from the temple to the famous haunt of the muses and their masters paternoster row bacons shop was an ancient lowbrowed building with a few of the books published by the firm displayed in the windows under a bust of my lord of verulam and the name of mr bacon in brass on the private door exactly opposite to bacons house was that of mr bungay which was newly painted and elaborately decorated in the style of the seventeenth century so that you might have fancied stately mr evelyn passing over the threshold or curious mr pepys examining the books in the window warrington went into the shop of mr bacon but pen stayed without it was agreed that his embassador should act for him entirely and the young fellow paced up and down the street in a very nervous condition until he should learn the result of the negotiation many a poor devil before him has trodden those flags with similar cares and anxieties at his heels his bread and his fame dependent upon the sentence of his magnanimous patrons of the row pen looked at all the wonders of all the shops and the strange variety of literature which they exhibit in this were displayed blackletter volumes and books in the clear pale types of aldus and elzevir in the next you might see the penny horrific register the halfpenny annals of crime and history of the most celebrated murderers of all countries the raffs magazine the larky swell and other publications of the penny press while at the next window portraits of illfavored individuals with facsimiles of the venerated signatures of the reverend grimes wapshot the reverend elias howle and the works written and the sermons preached by them showed the british dissenter where he could find mental pabulum hard by would be a little casement hung with emblems with medals and rosaries with little paltry prints of saints gilt and painted and books of controversial theology by which the faithful of the roman opinion might learn a short way to deal with protestants at a penny apiece or ninepence the dozen for distribution while in the very next window you might see come out of rome a sermon preached at the opening of the shepherds bush college by john thomas lord bishop of ealing scarce an opinion but has its expositor and its place of exhibition in this peaceful old paternoster row under the toll of the bells of saint paul pen looked in at all the windows and shops as a gentleman who is going to have an interview with the dentist examines the books on the waitingroom table he remembered them afterward it seemed to him that warrington would never come out and indeed the latter was engaged for some time in pleading his friends cause pens natural conceit would have swollen immensely if he could but have heard the report which warrington gave of him it happened that mr bacon himself had occasion to descend to mr hacks room while warrington was talking there and warrington knowing bacons weaknesses acted upon them with great adroitness in his friends behalf in the first place he put on his hat to speak to bacon and addressed him from the table on which he seated himself bacon liked to be treated with rudeness by a gentleman and used to pass it on to his inferiors as boys pass the mark what not know mr pendennis mr bacon warrington said you cant live much in the world or you would know him a man of property in the west of one of the most ancient families in england related to half the nobility in the empirehes cousin to lord pontypoolhe was one of the most distinguished men at oxbridge he dines at gaunt house every week law bless me you dont say so sir wellreallylaw bless me now said mr bacon i have just been showing mr hack some of his verses which he sat up last night at my request to write and hack talks about giving him a copy of the bookthe whatdyoucallem law bless me now does he the whatdyoucallem indeed the spring annual is its nameas payment for these verses you dont suppose that such a man as mr arthur pendennis gives up a dinner at gaunt house for nothing you know as well as any body that the men of fashion want to be paid that they do mr warrington sir said the publisher i tell you hes a star hell make a name sir hes a new man sir theyve said that of so many of those young swells mr warrington the publisher interposed with a sigh there was lord viscount dodo now i gave his lordship a good bit of money for his poems and only sold eighty copies mr popjoys hadgincourt sir fell dead well then ill take my man over to bungay warrington said and rose from the table this threat was too much for mr bacon who was instantly ready to accede to any reasonable proposal of mr warringtons and finally asked his manager what those proposals were when he heard that the negotiation only related as yet to a couple of ballads which mr warrington offered for the spring annual mr bacon said law bless you give him a check directly and with this paper warrington went out to his friend and placed it grinning in pens hands pen was as elated as if somebody had left him a fortune he offered warrington a dinner at richmond instantly what should he go and buy for laura and his mother he must buy something for them theyll like the book better than any thing else said warrington with the young ones name to the verses printed among the swells thank god thank god cried arthur i neednt be a charge upon the old mother i can pay off laura now i can get my own living i can make my own way i can marry the grand viziers daughter i can purchase a house in belgrave square i can build a fine castle in the air said warrington pleased with the others exultation well you may get bread and cheese pen and i own it tastes well the bread which you earn yourself they had a magnum of claret at dinner at the club that day at pens charges it was long since he had indulged in such a luxury but warrington would not balk him and they drank together to the health of the spring annual it never rains but it pours according to the proverb so very speedily another chance occurred by which mr pen was to be helped in his scheme of making a livelihood warrington one day threw him a letter across the table which was brought by a printers boy from captain shandon sirthe little emissary said and then went and fell asleep on his accustomed bench in the passage he paid many a subsequent visit there and brought many a message to pen f p tuesday morning my dear sir bungay will be here today about the pallmall gazette you would be the very man to help us with a genuine westend articleyou understanddashing trenchant and d aristocratic lady hipshaw will write but shes not much you know and weve two lords but the less they do the better we must have you well give you your own terms and well make a hit with the gazette shall b come and see you or can you look in upon me here ever yours c s some more opposition warrington said when pen had read the note bungay and bacon are at daggersdrawn each married the sister of the other and they were for some time the closest friends and partners hack says it was mrs bungay who caused all the mischief between the two whereas shandon who reads for bungay a good deal says mrs bacon did the business but i dont know which is right peachum or lockit but since they have separated it is a furious war between the two publishers and no sooner does one bring out a book of travels or poems a magazine or periodical quarterly or monthly or weekly or annual but the rival is in the field with something similar i have heard poor shandon tell with great glee how he made bungay give a grand dinner at blackwall to all his writers by saying that bacon had invited his corps to an entertainment at greenwich when bungay engaged your celebrated friend mr wagg to edit the londoner bacon straightway rushed off and secured mr grindle to give his name to the westminster magazine when bacon brought out his comic irish novel of barney brallaghan off went bungay to dublin and produced his rollicking hibernian story of looney mactwolter when doctor hicks brought out his wanderings in mesopotamia under bacons auspices bungay produced professor sandimans researches in zahara and bungay is publishing his pallmall gazette as a counterpoise to bacons whitehall review let us go and hear about the gazette there may be a place for you in it pen my boy we will go and see shandon we are sure to find him at home where does he live asked pen in the fleet prison warrington said and very much at home he is there too he is the king of the place pen had never seen this scene of london life and walked with no small interest in at the grim gate of that dismal edifice they went through the anteroom where the officers and janitors of the place were seated and passing in at the wicket entered the prison the noise and the crowd the life and the shouting the shabby bustle of the place struck and excited pen people moved about ceaselessly and restless like caged animals in a menagerie men were playing at fives others pacing and tramping this one in colloquy with his lawyer in dingy blackthat one walking sadly with his wife by his side and a child on his arm some were arrayed in tattered dressinggowns and had a look of rakish fashion every body seemed to be busy humming and on the move pen felt as if he choked in the place and as if the door being locked upon him they never would let him out they went through a court up a stone staircase and through passages full of people and noise and cross lights and black doors clapping and banging pen feeling as one does in a feverish morningdream at last the same little runner who had brought shandons note and had followed them down fleetstreet munching apples and who showed the way to the two gentlemen through the prison said this is the captains door and mr shandons voice from within bade them enter the room though bare was not uncheerful the sun was shining in at the windownear which sate a lady at work who had been gay and beautiful once but in whose faded face kindness and tenderness still beamed through all his errors and reckless mishaps and misfortunes this faithful creature adored her husband and thought him the best and cleverest as indeed he was one of the kindest of men nothing ever seemed to disturb the sweetness of his temper not debts not duns not misery not the bottle not his wifes unhappy position or his childrens ruined chances he was perfectly fond of wife and children after his fashion he always had the kindest words and smiles for them and ruined them with the utmost sweetness of temper he never could refuse himself or any man any enjoyment which his money could purchase he would share his last guinea with jack and tom and we may be sure he had a score of such retainers he would sign his name at the back of any mans bill and never pay any debt of his own he would write on any side and attack himself or another man with equal indifference he was one of the wittiest the most amiable and the most incorrigible of irishmen nobody could help liking charley shandon who saw him once and those whom he ruined could scarcely be angry with him when pen and warrington arrived the captain he had been in an irish militia regiment once and the title remained with him was sitting on his bed in a torn dressinggown with a desk on his knees at which he was scribbling as fast as his rapid pen could write slip after slip of paper fell off the desk wet on to the ground a picture of his children was hung up over his bed and the youngest of them was pattering about the room opposite the captain sate mr bungay a portly man of stolid countenance with whom the little child had been trying a conversation papas a very clever man said she mamma says so oh very said mr bungay and youre a very rich man mr bundy cried the child who could hardly speak plain mary said mamma from her work oh never mind bungay roared out with a great laugh no harm in saying im richhe hei am pretty well off my little dear if youre rich why dont you take papa out of pizn asked the child mamma at this began to wipe her eyes with the work on which she was employed the poor lady had hung curtains up in the room had brought the childrens picture and placed it there and had made one or two attempts to ornament it mamma began to cry mr bungay turned red and looked fiercely out of his bloodshot little eyes shandons pen went on and pen and warrington arrived with their knock captain shandon looked up from his work how do you do mr warrington he said ill speak to you in a minute please sit down gentlemen if you can find places and away went the pen again warrington pulled forward an old portmanteauthe only available seatand sate down on it with a bow to mrs shandon and a nod to bungay the child came and looked at pen solemnly and in a couple of minutes the swift scribbling ceased and shandon turning the desk over on the bed stooped and picked up the papers i think this will do said he its the prospectus for the pallmall gazette and heres the money for it mr bungay said laying down a fivepound note im as good as my word i am when i say ill pay i pay faith thats more than some of us can say said shandon and he eagerly clapped the note into his pocket chapter xxxiii which is passed in the neighborhood of ludgate hill illustration our imprisoned captain announced in smart and emphatic language in his prospectus that the time had come at last when it was necessary for the gentlemen of england to band together in defense of their common rights and their glorious order menaced on all sides by foreign revolutions by intestine radicalism by the artful calumnies of millowners and cottonlords and the stupid hostility of the masses whom they gulled and led the ancient monarchy was insulted the captain said by a ferocious republican rabble the church was deserted by envious dissent and undermined by stealthy infidelity the good institutions which had made our country glorious and the name of english gentleman the proudest in the world were left without defense and exposed to assault and contumely from men to whom no sanctuary was sacred for they believed in nothing holy no history venerable for they were too ignorant to have heard of the past and no law was binding which they were strong enough to break when their leaders gave the signal for plunder it was because the kings of france mistrusted their gentlemen mr shandon remarked that the monarchy of saint louis went down it was because the people of england still believed in their gentlemen that this country encountered and overcame the greatest enemy a nation ever met it was because we were headed by gentlemen that the eagles retreated before us from the douro to the garonne it was a gentleman who broke the line at trafalgar and swept the plain of waterloo bungay nodded his head in a knowing manner and winked his eyes when the captain came to the waterloo passage and warrington burst out laughing you see how our venerable friend bungay is affected shandon said slily looking up from his papersthats your true sort of test i have used the duke of wellington and the battle of waterloo a hundred times and i never knew the duke to fail the captain then went on to confess with much candor that up to the present time the gentlemen of england confident of their right and careless of those who questioned it had left the political interest of their order as they did the management of their estates or the settlement of their legal affairs to persons affected to each peculiar service and had permitted their interests to be represented in the press by professional proctors and advocates that time shandon professed to consider was now gone by the gentlemen of england must be their own champions the declared enemies of their order were brave strong numerous and uncompromising they must meet their foes in the field they must not be belied and misrepresented by hireling advocates they must not have grubstreet publishing gazettes from whitehall thats a dig at bacons people mr bungay said shandon turning round to the publisher bungay clapped his stick on the floor hang him pitch into him capting he said with exultation and turning to warrington wagged his dull head more vehemently than ever and said for a slashing article sir theres nobody like the captingnoobody like him the prospectuswriter went on to say that some gentlemen whose names were for obvious reasons not brought before the public at which mr warrington began to laugh again had determined to bring forward a journal of which the principles were so and so these men are proud of their order and anxious to uphold it cried out captain shandon flourishing his paper with a grin they are loyal to their sovereign by faithful conviction and ancestral allegiance they love their church where they would have their children worship and for which their forefathers bled they love their country and would keep it what the gentlemen of englandyes the gentlemen of england well have that in large caps bungay my boy have made itthe greatest and freest in the world and as the names of some of them are appended to the deed which secured our liberties at runnymede whats that asked mr bungay an ancestor of mine sealed it with his swordhilt pen said with great gravity its the habeas corpus mr bungay warrington said on which the publisher answered all right i dare say and yawned though he said go on capting at runnymede they are ready to defend that freedom today with sword and pen and now as then to rally round the old laws and liberties of england brayvo cried warrington the little child stood wondering the lady was working silently and looking with fond admiration come here little mary said warrington and patted the childs fair curls with his large hand but she shrank back from his rough caress and preferred to go and take refuge at pens knee and play with his fine watchchain and pen was very much pleased that she came to him for he was very softhearted and simple though he concealed his gentleness under a shy and pompous demeanor so she clambered up on his lap while her father continued to read his programme you were laughing the captain said to warrington about the obvious reasons which i mentioned now ill show ye what they are ye unbelieving heathen we have said he went on that we can not give the names of the parties engaged in this undertaking and that there were obvious reasons for that concealment we number influential friends in both houses of the senate and have secured allies in every diplomatic circle in europe our sources of intelligence are such as can not by any possibility be made publicand indeed such as no other london or european journal could by any chance acquire but this we are free to say that the very earliest information connected with the movement of english and continental politics will be found only in the columns of the pall mall gazette the statesman and the capitalist the country gentleman and the divine will be among our readers because our writers are among them we address ourselves to the higher circles of society we care not to disown itthe pall mall gazette is written by gentlemen for gentlemen its conductors speak to the classes in which they live and were born the fieldpreacher has his journal the radical freethinker has his journal why should the gentlemen of england be unrepresented in the press mr shandon then went on with much modesty to descant upon the literary and fashionable departments of the pall mall gazette which were to be conducted by gentlemen of acknowledged reputation men famous at the universities at which mr pendennis could scarcely help laughing and blushing known at the clubs and of the society which they described he pointed out delicately to advertisers that there would be no such medium as the pall mall gazette for giving publicity to their sales and he eloquently called upon the nobility of england the baronetage of england the revered clergy of england the bar of england the matrons the daughters the homes and hearths of england to rally round the good old cause and bungay at the conclusion of the reading woke up from a second snooze in which he had indulged himself and again said it was all right the reading of the prospectus concluded the gentlemen present entered into some details regarding the political and literary management of the paper and mr bungay sate by listening and nodding his head as if he understood what was the subject of their conversation and approved of their opinions bungays opinions in truth were pretty simple he thought the captain could write the best smashing article in england he wanted the opposition house of bacon smashed and it was his opinion that the captain could do that business if the captain had written a letter of junius on a sheet of paper or copied a part of the church catechism mr bungay would have been perfectly contented and have considered that the article was a smashing article and he pocketed the papers with the greatest satisfaction and he not only paid for the ms as we have seen but he called little mary to him and gave her a penny as he went away the reading of the manuscript over the party engaged in general conversation shandon leading with a jaunty fashionable air in compliment to the two guests who sate with him and who by their appearance and manner he presumed to be persons of the beau monde he knew very little indeed of the great world but he had seen it and made the most of what he had seen he spoke of the characters of the day and great personages of the fashion with easy familiarity and jocular allusions as if it was his habit to live among them he told anecdotes of their private life and of conversations he had had and entertainments at which he had been present and at which such and such a thing occurred pen was amused to hear the shabby prisoner in a tattered dressinggown talking glibly about the great of the land mrs shandon was always delighted when her husband told these tales and believed in them fondly every one she did not want to mingle in the fashionable world herself she was not clever enough but the great society was the very place for her charles he shone in it he was respected in it indeed shandon had once been asked to dinner by the earl of x his wife treasured the invitationcard in her workbox at that very day mr bungay presently had enough of this talk and got up to take leave whereupon warrington and pen rose to depart with the publisher though the latter would have liked to stay to make a further acquaintance with this family who interested him and touched him he said something about hoping for permission to repeat his visit upon which shandon with a rueful grin said he was always to be found at home and should be delighted to see mr pennington ill see you to my parkgate gentlemen said captain shandon seizing his hat in spite of a deprecatory look and a faint cry of charles from mrs shandon and the captain in shabby slippers shuffled out before his guests leading the way through the dismal passages of the prison his hand was already fiddling with his waistcoat pocket where bungays fivepound note was as he took leave of the three gentlemen at the wicket one of them mr arthur pendennis being greatly relieved when he was out of the horrid place and again freely treading the flags of farringdonstreet mrs shandon sadly went on with her work at the window looking into the court she saw shandon with a couple of men at his heels run rapidly in the direction of the prison tavern she had hoped to have had him to dinner herself that day there was a piece of meat and some salad in a basin on the ledge outside of the window of their room which she had expected that she and little mary were to share with the childs father but there was no chance of that now he would be in that tavern until the hours for closing it then he would go and play at cards or drink in some other mans room and come back silent with glazed eyes reeling a little in his walk that his wife might nurse him oh what varieties of pain do we not make our women suffer illustration so mrs shandon went to the cupboard and in lieu of a dinner made herself some tea and in those varieties of pain of which we spoke anon what a part of confidante has that poor teapot played ever since the kindly plant was introduced among us what myriads of women have cried over it to be sure what sick beds it has smoked by what fevered lips have received refreshment from out of it nature meant very gently by women when she made that teaplant and with a little thought what a series of pictures and groups the fancy may conjure up and assemble round the teapot and cup melissa and sacharissa are talking love secrets over it poor polly has it and her lovers letters upon the table his letters who was her lover yesterday and when it was with pleasure not despair she wept over them mary comes tripping noiselessly into her mothers bedroom bearing a cup of the consoler to the widow who will take no other food ruth is busy concocting it for her husband who is coming home from the harvestfieldone could fill a page with hints for such pictures finally mrs shandon and little mary sit down and drink their tea together while the captain goes out and takes his pleasure she cares for nothing else but that when her husband is away a gentleman with whom we are already slightly acquainted mr jack finucane a townsman of captain shandons found the captains wife and little mary for whom jack always brought a sweetmeat in his pocket over this meal jack thought shandon the greatest of created geniuses had had one or two helps from the goodnatured prodigal who had always a kind word and sometimes a guinea for any friend in need and never missed a day in seeing his patron he was ready to run shandons errands and transact his moneybusiness with publishers and newspaper editors duns creditors holders of shandons acceptances gentlemen disposed to speculate in those securities and to transact the thousand little affairs of an embarrassed irish gentleman i never knew an embarrassed irish gentleman yet but he had an aiddecamp of his own nation likewise in circumstances of pecuniary discomfort that aiddecamp has subordinates of his own who again may have other insolvent dependentsall through his life our captain marched at the head of a ragged staff who shared in the rough fortunes of their chieftain he wont have that fivepound note very long i bet a guinea mr bungay said of the captain as he and his two companions walked away from the prison and the publisher judged rightly for when mrs shandon came to empty her husbands pockets she found but a couple of shillings and a few halfpence out of the mornings remittance shandon had given a pound to one follower had sent a leg of mutton and potatoes and beer to an acquaintance in the poor side of the prison had paid an outstanding bill at the tavern where he had changed his fivepound note had had a dinner with two friends there to whom he lost sundry halfcrowns at cards afterward so that the night left him as poor as the morning had found him the publisher and the two gentlemen had had some talk together after quitting shandon and warrington reiterated to bungay what he had said to his rival bacon viz that pen was a high fellow of great genius and what was more well with the great world and related to no end of the peerage bungay replied that he should be happy to have dealings with mr pendennis and hoped to have the pleasure of seeing both gents to cut mutton with him before long and so with mutual politeness and protestations they parted it is hard to see such a man as shandon pen said musing and talking that night over the sight which he had witnessed of accomplishments so multifarious and of such an undoubted talent and humor an inmate of a jail for half his time and a booksellers hangeron when out of prison i am a booksellers hangeronyou are going to try your paces as a hack warrington said with a laugh we are all hacks upon some road or other i would rather be myself than paley our neighbor in chambers who has as much enjoyment of his life as a mole a deuced deal of undeserved compassion has been thrown away upon what you call your booksellers drudge much solitary pipes and ale make a cynic of you pen said you are a diogenes by a beerbarrel warrington no man shall tell me that a man of genius as shandon is ought to be driven by such a vulgar slave driver as yonder mr bungay whom we have just left who fattens on the profits of the others brains and enriches himself out of his journeymans labor it makes me indignant to see a gentleman the serf of such a creature as that of a man who cant speak the language that he lives by who is not fit to black shandons boots so you have begun already to gird at the publishers and to take your side among our order bravo pen my boy warrington answered laughing still what have you got to say against bungays relations with shandon was it the publisher think you who sent the author to prison is it bungay who is tippling away the fivepound note which we saw just now or shandon misfortune drives a man into bad company pen said it is easy to cry fie against a poor fellow who has no society but such as he finds in a prison and no resource except forgetfulness and the bottle we must deal kindly with the eccentricities of genius and remember that the very ardor and enthusiasm of temperament which makes the author delightful often leads the man astray a fiddlestick about men of genius warrington cried out who was a very severe moralist upon some points though possibly a very bad practitioner i deny that there are so many geniuses as people who whimper about the fate of men of letters assert there are there are thousands of clever fellows in the world who could if they would turn verses write articles read books and deliver a judgment upon them the talk of professional critics and writers is not a whit more brilliant or profound or amusing than that of any other society of educated people if a lawyer or a soldier or a parson outruns his income and does not pay his bills he must go to jail and an author must go too if an author fuddles himself i dont know why he should be let off a headache the next morningif he orders a coat from the tailors why he shouldnt pay for it i would give him more money to buy coats said pen smiling i suppose i should like to belong to a welldressed profession i protest against that wretch of a middleman whom i see between genius and his great landlord the public and who stops more than half of the laborers earnings and fame i am a prose laborer warrington said you my boy are a poet in a small way and so i suppose consider you are authorized to be flighty what is it you want do you want a body of capitalists that shall be forced to purchase the works of all authors who may present themselves manuscript in hand every body who writes his epic every driveler who can or cant spell and produces his novel or his tragedyare they all to come and find a bag of sovereigns in exchange for their worthless reams of paper who is to settle what is good or bad salable or otherwise will you give the buyer leave in fine to purchase or not why sir when johnson sate behind the screen at saint johns gate and took his dinner apart because he was too shabby and poor to join the literary bigwigs who were regaling themselves round mr caves best tablecloth the tradesman was doing him no wrong you couldnt force the publisher to recognize the man of genius in the young man who presented himself before him ragged gaunt and hungry rags are not a proof of genius whereas capital is absolute as times go and is perforce the bargainmaster it has a right to deal with the literary inventor as with any otherif i produce a novelty in the book trade i must do the best i can with it but i can no more force mr murray to purchase my book of travels or sermons than i can compel mr tattersall to give me a hundred guineas for my horse i may have my own ideas of the value of my pegasus and think him the most wonderful of animals but the dealer has a right to his opinion too and may want a ladys horse or a cob for a heavy timid rider or a sound hack for the road and my beast wont suit him you deal in metaphors warrington pen said but you rightly say that you are very prosaic poor shandon there is something about the kindness of that man and the gentleness of that sweet creature of a wife which touches me profoundly i like him i am afraid better than a better man and so do i warrington said let us give him the benefit of our sympathy and the pity that is due to his weakness though i fear that sort of kindness would be resented as contempt by a more highminded man you see he takes his consolation along with his misfortune and one generates the other or balances it as is the way of the world he is a prisoner but he is not unhappy his genius sings within his prison bars pen said yes warrington said bitterly shandon accommodates himself to a cage pretty well he ought to be wretched but he has jack and tom to drink with and that consoles him he might have a high place but as he cant why he can drink with tom and jackhe might be providing for his wife and children but thomas and john have got a bottle of brandy which they want him to tastehe might pay poor snip the tailor the twenty pounds which the poor devil wants for his landlord but john and thomas lay their hands upon his purseand so he drinks while his tradesman goes to jail and his family to ruin let us pity the misfortunes of genius and conspire against the publishing tyrants who oppress men of letters what are you going to have another glass of brandyandwater pen said with a humorous look it was at the back kitchen that the above philosophical conversation took place between the two young men warrington began to laugh as usual video meliora proboquei mean bring it me hot with sugar john he said to the waiter i would have some more too only i dont want it said pen it does not seem to me warrington that we are much better than our neighbors and warringtons last glass having been dispatched the pair returned to their chambers they found a couple of notes in the letterbox on their return which had been sent by their acquaintance of the morning mr bungay that hospitable gentleman presented his compliments to each of the gentlemen and requested the pleasure of their company at dinner on an early day to meet a few literary friends we shall have a grand spread said warrington we shall meet all bungays corps all except poor shandon said pen nodding a good night to his friend and he went into his own little room the events and acquaintances of the day had excited him a good deal and he lay for some time awake thinking over them as warringtons vigorous and regular snore from the neighboring apartment pronounced that that gentleman was engaged in deep slumber is it true thought pendennis lying on his bed and gazing at a bright moon without that lighted up a corner of his dressingtable and the frame of a little sketch of fairoaks drawn by laura that hung over his drawersis it true that i am going to earn my bread at last and with my pen that i shall impoverish the dear mother no longer and that i may gain a name and reputation in the world perhaps these are welcome if they come thought the young visionary laughing and blushing to himself though alone and in the night as he thought how dearly he would relish honor and fame if they could be his if fortune favors me i laud her if she frowns i resign her i pray heaven i may be honest if i fail or if i succeed i pray heaven i may tell the truth as far as i know it that i maynt swerve from it through flattery or interest or personal enmity or party prejudice dearest old mother what a pride will you have if i can do any thing worthy of our name and you laura you wont scorn me as the worthless idler and spendthrift when you see that iwhen i have achieved apsha what an alnaschar i am because i have made five pounds by my poems and am engaged to write half a dozen articles for a newspaper he went on with these musings more happy and hopeful and in a humbler frame of mind than he had felt to be for many a day he thought over the errors and idleness the passions extravagancies disappointments of his wayward youth he got up from the bed threw open the window and looked out into the night and then by some impulse which we hope was a good one he went up and kissed the picture of fairoaks and flinging himself down on his knees by the bed remained for some time in that posture of hope and submission when he rose it was with streaming eyes he had found himself repeating mechanically some little words which he had been accustomed to repeat as a child at his mothers side after the saying of which she would softly take him to his bed and close the curtains round him hushing him with a benediction the next day mr pidgeon their attendant brought in a large brown paper parcel directed to g warrington esq with mr trotters compliments and a note which warrington read pen you beggar roared warrington to pen who was in his own room hullo sung out pen come here youre wanted cried the other and pen came out what is it said he catch cried warrington and flung the parcel at pens head who would have been knocked down had he not caught it its books for review for the pall mall gazette pitch into em warrington said as for pen he never had been so delighted in his life his hand trembled as he cut the string of the packet and beheld within a smart set of new neat calicobound books travels and novels and poems sport the oak pidgeon said he im not at home to any body today and he flung into his easy chair and hardly gave himself time to drink his tea so eager was he to begin to read and to review chapter xxxiv in which the history still hovers about fleetstreet illustration captain shandon urged on by his wife who seldom meddled in business matters had stipulated that john finucane esquire of the upper temple should be appointed subeditor of the forthcoming pallmall gazette and this post was accordingly conferred upon mr finucane by the spirited proprietor of the journal indeed he deserved any kindness at the hands of shandon so fondly attached was he as we have said to the captain and his family and so eager to do him a service it was in finucanes chambers that shandon used in former days to hide when danger was near and bailiffs abroad until at length his hidingplace was known and the sheriffs officers came as regularly to wait for the captain on finucanes staircase as at his own door it was to finucanes chambers that poor mrs shandon came often and often to explain her troubles and griefs and devise means of rescue for her adored captain many a meal did finucane furnish for her and the child there it was an honor to his little rooms to be visited by such a lady and as she went down the staircase with her vail over her face fin would lean over the balustrade looking after her to see that no temple lovelace assailed her upon the road perhaps hoping that some rogue might be induced to waylay her so that he fin might have the pleasure of rushing to her rescue and breaking the rascals bones it was a sincere pleasure to mrs shandon when the arrangements were made by which her kind honest champion was appointed her husbands aiddecamp in the newspaper he would have sate with mrs shandon as late as the prison hours permitted and had indeed many a time witnessed the putting to bed of little mary who occupied a crib in the room and to whose evening prayers that god might bless papa finucane although of the romish faith himself had said amen with a great deal of sympathybut he had an appointment with mr bungay regarding the affairs of the paper which they were to discuss over a quiet dinner so he went away at six oclock from mrs shandon but made his accustomed appearance at the fleet prison next morning having arrayed himself in his best clothes and ornaments which though cheap as to cost were very brilliant as to color and appearance and having in his pocket four pounds two shillings being the amount of his weeks salary at the daily journal minus two shillings expended by him in the purchase of a pair of gloves on his way to the prison he had cut his mutton with mr bungay as the latter gentleman phrased it and mr trotter bungays reader and literary man of business at dicks coffeehouse on the previous day and entered at large into his views respecting the conduct of the pallmall gazette in a masterly manner he had pointed out what should be the subeditorial arrangements of the paper what should be the type for the various articles who should report the markets who the turf and ring who the church intelligence and who the fashionable chitchat he was acquainted with gentlemen engaged in cultivating these various departments of knowledge and in communicating them afterward to the publicin fine jack finucane was as shandon had said of him and as he proudly owned himself to be one of the best subeditors of a paper in london he knew the weekly earnings of every man connected with the press and was up to a thousand dodges or ingenious economic contrivances by which money could be saved to spirited capitalists who were going to set up a paper he at once dazzled and mystified mr bungay who was slow of comprehension by the rapidity of the calculations which he exhibited on paper as they sate in the box and bungay afterward owned to his subordinate mr trotter that that irishman seemed a clever fellow and now having succeeded in making this impression upon mr bungay the faithful fellow worked round to the point which he had very near at heart viz the liberation from prison of his admired friend and chief captain shandon he knew to a shilling the amount of the detainers which were against the captain at the porters lodge of the fleet and indeed professed to know all his debts though this was impossible for no man in england certainly not the captain himself was acquainted with them he pointed out what shandons engagements already were and how much better he would work if removed from confinement though this mr bungay denied for when the captains locked up he said we are sure to find him at home whereas when hes free you can never catch hold of him finally he so worked on mr bungays feelings by describing mrs shandon pining away in the prison and the child sickening there that the publisher was induced to promise that if mrs shandon would come to him in the morning he would see what could be done and the colloquy ending at this time with the second round of brandyandwater although finucane who had four guineas in his pocket would have discharged the tavern reckoning with delight bungay said no sirthis is my affair sir if you please james take the bill and eighteenpence for yourself and he handed over the necessary funds to the waiter thus it was that finucane who went to bed at the temple after the dinner at dicks found himself actually with his weeks salary intact upon saturday morning he gave mrs shandon a wink so knowing and joyful that that kind creature knew some good news was in store for her and hastened to get her bonnet and shawl when fin asked if he might have the honor of taking her a walk and giving her a little fresh air and little mary jumped for joy at the idea of this holiday for finucane never neglected to give her a toy or to take her to a show and brought newspaper orders in his pocket for all sorts of london diversions to amuse the child indeed he loved them with all his heart and would cheerfully have dashed out his rambling brains to do them or his adored captain a service may i go charley or shall i stay with you for youre poorly dear this morning hes got a headache mr finucane he suffers from headaches and i persuaded him to stay in bed mrs shandon said go along with you and polly jack take care of em hand me over the burtons anatomy and leave me to my abominable devices shandon said with perfect good humor he was writing and not uncommonly took his greek and latin quotations of which he knew the use as a public writer from that wonderful repertory of learning so fin gave his arm to mrs shandon and mary went skipping down the passages of the prison and through the gate into the free air from fleetstreet to paternoster row is not very far as the three reached mr bungays shop mrs bungay was also entering at the private door holding in her hand a paper parcel and a manuscript volume bound in red and indeed containing an account of her transactions with the butcher in the neighboring market mrs bungay was in a gorgeous shot silk dress which flamed with red and purple she wore a yellow shawl and had red flowers inside her bonnet and a brilliant light blue parasol mrs shandon was in an old black watered silk her bonnet had never seen very brilliant days of prosperity any more than its owner but she could not help looking like a lady whatever her attire was the two women courtesied to each other each according to her fashion i hope youre pretty well mum said mrs bungay its a very fine day said mrs shandon wont you step in mum said mrs bungay looking so hard at the child as almost to frighten her ii came about business with mr bungayii hope hes pretty well said timid mrs shandon if you go to see him in the countinghouse couldnt youcouldnt you leave your little gurl with me said mrs bungay in a deep voice and with a tragic look as she held out one finger toward the child i want to stay with mamma cried little mary burying her face in her mothers dress go with this lady mary my dear said the mother ill show you some pretty pictures said mrs bungay with the voice of an ogress and some nice things besides look hereand opening her brown paper parcel mrs bungay displayed some choice sweet biscuits such as her bungay loved after his wine little mary followed after this attraction the whole party entering at the private entrance from which a side door led into mr bungays commercial apartments here however as the child was about to part from her mother her courage again failed her and again she ran to the maternal petticoat upon which the kind and gentle mrs shandon seeing the look of disappointment in mrs bungays face goodnaturedly said if you will let me i will come up too and sit for a few minutes and so the three females ascended the stairs together a second biscuit charmed little mary into perfect confidence and in a minute or two she prattled away without the least restraint illustration faithful finucane meanwhile found mr bungay in a severer mood than he had been on the night previous when twothirds of a bottle of port and two large glasses of brandyandwater had warmed his soul into enthusiasm and made him generous in his promises toward captain shandon his impetuous wife had rebuked him on his return home she had ordered that he should give no relief to the captain he was a goodfornothing fellow whom no money would help she disapproved of the plan of the pallmall gazette and expected that bungay would only lose his money in it as they were losing over the way she always called her brothers establishment over the way by the whitehall journal let shandon stop in prison and do his work it was the best place for him in vain finucane pleaded and promised and implored for his friend bungay had had an hours lecture in the morning and was inexorable but what honest jack failed to do below stairs in the countinghouse the pretty faces and manners of the mother and child were effecting in the drawingroom where they were melting the fierce but really soft mrs bungay there was an artless sweetness in mrs shandons voice and a winning frankness of manner which made most people fond of her and pity her and taking courage by the rugged kindness with which her hostess received her the captains lady told her story and described her husbands goodness and virtues and her childs failing health she was obliged to part with two of them she said and send them to school for she could not have them in that horrid placethat mrs bungay though as grim as lady macbeth melted under the influence of the simple tale and said she would go down and speak to bungay now in this household to speak was to command with mrs bungay and with bungay to hear was to obey it was just when poor finucane was in despair about his negotiation that the majestic mrs bungay descended upon her spouse politely requested mr finucane to step up to his friends in her drawingroom while she held a few minutes conversation with mr b and when the pair were alone the publishers better half informed him of her intentions toward the captains lady whats in the wind now my dear maecenas asked surprised at his wifes altered tone you wouldnt hear of my doing any thing for the captain this morning i wonder what has been achanging of you the captain is an irishman mrs bungay replied and those irish i have always said i couldnt abide but his wife is a lady as any one can see and a good woman and a clergymans daughter and a west of england woman b which i am myself by my mothers sideand o marmaduke didnt you remark her little gurl yes mrs b i saw the little girl and didnt you see how like she was to our angel bessy mr band mrs bungays thoughts flew back to a period eighteen years back when bacon and bungay had just set up in business as small booksellers in a country town and when she had had a child named bessy something like the little mary who had just moved her compassion well well my dear mr bungay said seeing the little eyes of his wife begin to twinkle and grow red the captain aint in for much theres only a hundred and thirty pound against him half the money will take him out of the fleet finucane says and well pay him half salaries till he has made the account square when the little un said why dont you take par out of pizn i did feel it elizabeth upon my honor i did now and the upshot of this conversation was that mr and mrs bungay both ascended to the drawingroom and mr bungay made a heavy and clumsy speech in which he announced to mrs shandon that hearing sixtyfive pounds would set her husband free he was ready to advance that sum of money deducting it from the captains salary and that he would give it to her on condition that she would personally settle with the creditors regarding her husbands liberation i think this was the happiest day that mrs shandon and mr finucane had had for a long time bedad bungay youre a trump roared out fin in an overpowering brogue and emotion give us your fist old boy and wont we send the pallmall gazette up to ten thousand a week thats all and he jumped about the room and tossed up little mary with a hundred frantic antics if i could drive you any where in my carriage mrs shandonim sure its quite at your service mrs bungay said looking out at a onehorsed vehicle which had just driven up and in which this lady took the air considerablyand the two ladies with little mary between them whose tiny hand maecenass wife kept fixed in her great grasp with the delighted mr finucane on the back seat drove away from paternoster row as the owner of the vehicle threw triumphant glances at the opposite windows at bacons it wont do the captain any good thought bungay going back to his desk and accounts but mrs b becomes reglar upset when she thinks about her misfortune the child would have been of age yesterday if shed lived bessy told me so and he wondered how women did remember things we are happy to say that mrs shandon sped with very good success upon her errand she who had had to mollify creditors when she had no money at all and only tears and entreaties wherewith to soothe them found no difficulty in making them relent by means of a bribe of ten shillings in the pound and the next sunday was the last for some time at least which the captain spent in prison chapter xxxv a dinner in the row illustration upon the appointed day our two friends made their appearance at mr bungays door in paternoster row not the public entrance through which booksellers boys issued with their sacks full of bungays volumes and around which timid aspirants lingered with their virgin manuscripts ready for sale to sultan bungay but at the private door of the house whence the splendid mrs bungay would come forth to step into her chaise and take her drive settling herself on the cushions and casting looks of defiance at mrs bacons opposite windowsat mrs bacon who was as yet a chaiseless woman on such occasions when very much wroth at her sisterinlaws splendor mrs bacon would fling up the sash of her drawingroom window and look out with her four children at the chaise as much as to say look at these four darlings flora bungay this is why i cant drive in my carriage you would give a coach and four to have the same reason and it was with these arrows out of her quiver that emma bacon shot flora bungay as she sate in her chariot envious and childless as pen and warrington came to bungays door a carriage and a cab drove up to bacons old dr slocum descended heavily from the first the doctors equipage was as ponderous as his style but both had a fine sonorous effect upon the publishers in the row a couple of dazzling white waistcoats stepped out of the cab warrington laughed you see bacon has his dinner party too that is dr slocum author of memoirs of the poisoners you would hardly have recognized our friend hoolan in that gallant white waistcoat doolan is one of bungays men and faith here he comes indeed messrs hoolan and doolan had come from the strand in the same cab tossing up by the way which should pay the shilling and mr d stepped from the other side of the way arrayed in black with a large pair of white gloves which were spread out on his hands and which the owner could not help regarding with pleasure the house porter in an evening coat and gentlemen with gloves as large as doolans but of the famous berlin web were in the passage of mr bungays house to receive the guests hats and coats and bawl their names up the stair some of the latter had arrived when the three new visitors made their appearance but there was only mrs bungay in red satin and a turban to represent her own charming sex she made courtesies to each new comer as he entered the drawingroom but her mind was evidently preoccupied by extraneous thoughts the fact is mrs bacons dinner party was disturbing her and as soon as she had received each individual of her own company flora bungay flew back to the embrasure of the window whence she could rake the carriages of emma bacons friends as they came rattling up the row the sight of dr slocums large carriage with the gaunt jobhorses crushed flora none but hack cabs had driven up to her own door on that day they were all literary gentlemen though unknown as yet to pen there was mr bole the real editor of the magazine of which mr wagg was the nominal chief mr trotter who from having broken out on the world as a poet of a tragic and suicidal cast had now subsided into one of mr bungays back shops as reader for that gentleman and captain sumph an exbeau still about town and related in some indistinct manner to literature and the peerage he was said to have written a book once to have been a friend of lord byron to be related to lord sumphington in fact anecdotes of byron formed his staple and he seldom spoke but with the name of that poet or some of his contemporaries in his mouth as thus i remember poor shelley at school being sent up for good for a copy of verses every line of which i wrote by jove or i recollect when i was at missolonghi with byron offering to bet gamba and so forth this gentleman pen remarked was listened to with great attention by mrs bungay his anecdotes of the aristocracy of which he was a middleaged member delighted the publishers lady and he was almost a greater man than the great mr wagg himself in her eyes had he but come in his own carriage mrs bungay would have made her bungay purchase any given volume from his pen mr bungay went about to his guests as they arrived and did the honors of his house with much cordiality how are you sir fine day sir glad to see you year sir flora my love let me ave the honor of introducing mr warrington to you mr warrington mrs bungay mr pendennis mrs bungay hope youve brought good appetites with you gentlemen you doolan i know ave for youve always ad a deuce of a twist lor bungay said mrs bungay faith a man must be hard to please bungay who cant eat a good dinner in this house doolan said and he winked and stroked his lean chops with his large gloves and made appeals of friendship to mrs bungay which that honest woman refused with scorn from the timid man she couldnt abide that doolan she said in confidence to her friends indeed all his flatteries failed to win her as they talked mrs bungay surveying mankind from her window a magnificent vision of an enormous gray cabhorse appeared and neared rapidly a pair of white reins held by small white gloves were visible behind it a face pale but richly decorated with a chintuft the head of an exiguous groom bobbing over the cabheadthese bright things were revealed to the delighted mrs bungay the honorable percy popjoys quite punctual i declare she said and sailed to the door to be in waiting at the noblemans arrival its percy popjoy said pen looking out of window and seeing an individual in extremely lacquered boots descend from the swinging cab and in fact it was that young noblemanlord falconets eldest son as we all very well know who was come to dine with the publisherhis publisher of the row he was my fag at eton warrington said i ought to have licked him a little more he and pen had had some bouts at the oxford union debates in which pen had had very much the better of percy who presently appeared with his hat under his arm and a look of indescribable good humor and fatuity in his round dimpled face upon which nature had burst out with a chintuft but exhausted with the effort had left the rest of the countenance bare of hair the temporary groom of the chambers bawled out the honorable percy popjoy much to that gentlemans discomposure at hearing his titles announced what did the man want to take away my hat for bungay he asked of the publisher cant do without my hatwant it to make my bow to mrs bungay how well you look mrs bungay today havent seen your carriage in the park why havent you been there i missed you indeed i did im afraid youre a sad quiz said mrs bungay quiz never made a joke in myhullo whos here how dye do pendennis how dye do warrington these are old friends of mine mrs bungay i say how the doose did you come here he asked of the two young men turning his lacquered heels upon mrs bungay who respected her husbands two young guests now that she found they were intimate with a lords son what do they know him she asked rapidly of mr b high fellers i tell youthe young one related to all the nobility said the publisher and both ran forward smiling and bowing to greet almost as great personages as the young lordno less characters indeed than the great mr wenham and the great mr wagg who were now announced mr wenham entered wearing the usual demure look and stealthy smile with which he commonly surveyed the tips of his neat little shining boots and which he but seldom brought to bear upon the person who addressed him waggs white waistcoat spread out on the contrary with profuse brilliancy his burly red face shone resplendent over it lighted up with the thoughts of good jokes and a good dinner he liked to make his entree into a drawingroom with a laugh and when he went away at night to leave a joke exploding behind him no personal calamities or distresses of which that humorist had his share in common with the unjocular part of mankind could altogether keep his humor down whatever his griefs might be the thought of a dinner rallied his great soul and when he saw a lord he saluted him with a pun wenham went up then with a smug smile and whisper to mrs bungay and looked at her from under his eyes and showed her the tips of his shoes wagg said she looked charming and pushed on straight at the young nobleman whom he called pop and to whom he instantly related a funny story seasoned with what the french call gros sel he was delighted to see pen too and shook hands with him and slapped him on the back cordially for he was full of spirits and good humor and he talked in a loud voice about their last place and occasion of meeting at baymouth and asked how their friends of clavering park were and whether sir francis was not coming to london for the season and whether pen had been to see lady rockminster who had arrivedfine old lady lady rockminster these remarks wagg made not for pens ear so much as for the edification of the company whom he was glad to inform that he paid visits to gentlemens country seats and was on intimate terms with the nobility wenham also shook hands with our young friendall of which scenes mrs bungay remarked with respectful pleasure and communicated her ideas to bungay afterward regarding the importance of mr pendennisideas by which pen profited much more than he was aware pen who had read and rather admired some of her works and expected to find in miss bunion a person somewhat resembling her own description of herself in the passionflower in which she stated that her youth resembled a violet shrinking meanly when blows the march wind keenly a timid fawn on wildwood lawn where oakboughs rustle greenly and that her maturer beauty was something very different certainly to the artless loveliness of her prime but still exceedingly captivating and striking beheld rather to his surprise and amusement a large and bony woman in a crumpled satin dress who came creaking into the room with a step as heavy as a grenadiers wagg instantly noted the straw which she brought in at the rumpled skirt of her dress and would have stooped to pick it up but miss bunion disarmed all criticism by observing this ornament herself and putting her own large foot upon it so as to separate it from her robe she stopped and picked up the straw saying to mrs bungay that she was very sorry to be a little late but that the omnibus was very slow and what a comfort it was to get a ride all the way from brompton for sixpence nobody laughed at the poetesss speech it was uttered so simply indeed the worthy woman had not the least notion of being ashamed of an action incidental upon her poverty is that passionflowers pen said to wenham by whom he was standing why her picture in the volume represents her as a very welllooking young woman you know passionflowers like all others will run to seed wenham said miss bunions portrait was probably painted some years ago well i like her for not being ashamed of her poverty so do i said mr wenham who would have starved rather than have come to dinner in an omnibus but i dont think that she need flourish the straw about do you mr pendennis my dear miss bunion how do you do i was in a great ladys drawingroom this morning and every body was charmed with your new volume those lines on the christening of lady fanny fantail brought tears into the duchesss eyes i said that i thought i should have the pleasure of meeting you today and she begged me to thank you and say how greatly she was pleased this history told in a bland smiling manner of a duchess whom wenham had met that very morning too quite put poor waggs dowager and baronet out of court and placed wenham beyond wagg as a man of fashion wenham kept this inestimable advantage and having the conversation to himself ran on with a number of anecdotes regarding the aristocracy he tried to bring mr popjoy into the conversation by making appeals to him and saying i was telling your father this morning or i think you were present at w house the other night when the duke said so and so but mr popjoy would not gratify him by joining in the talk preferring to fall back into the window recess with mrs bungay and watch the cabs that drove up to the opposite door at least if he would not talk the hostess hoped that those odious bacons would see how she had secured the noble percy popjoy for her party and now the bell of saint pauls tolled half an hour later than that for which mr bungay had invited his party and it was complete with the exception of two guests who at last made their appearance and in whom pen was pleased to recognize captain and mrs shandon when these two had made their greetings to the master and mistress of the house and exchanged nods of more or less recognition with most of the people present pen and warrington went up and shook hands very warmly with mrs shandon who perhaps was affected to meet them and think where it was she had seen them but a few days before shandon was brushed up and looked pretty smart in a red velvet waistcoat and a frill into which his wife had stuck her best brooch in spite of mrs bungays kindness perhaps in consequence of it mrs shandon felt great terror and timidity in approaching her indeed she was more awful than ever in her red satin and bird of paradise and it was not until she had asked in her great voice about the dear little gurl that the latter was somewhat encouraged and ventured to speak nicelooking woman popjoy whispered to warrington do introduce me to captain shandon warrington im told hes a tremendous clever fellow and dammy i adore intellect by jove i do this was the truth heaven had not endowed young mr popjoy with much intellect of his own but had given him a generous faculty for admiring if not for appreciating the intellect of others and introduce me to miss bunion im told shes very clever too shes rum to look at certainly but that dont matter dammy i consider myself a literary man and i wish to know all the clever fellows so mr popjoy and mr shandon had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with one another and now the doors of the adjoining diningroom being flung open the party entered and took their seats at table pen found himself next to bunion on one side and to mr waggthe truth is wagg fled alarmed from the vacant place by the poetess and pen was compelled to take it the gifted being did not talk much during dinner but pen remarked that she ate with a vast appetite and never refused any of the supplies of wine which were offered to her by the butler indeed miss bunion having considered mr pendennis for a minute who gave himself rather grand airs and who was attired in an extremely fashionable style with his very best chains shirt studs and cambric fronts was set down and not without reason as a prig by the poetess who thought it was much better to attend to her dinner than to take any notice of him she told him as much in after days with her usual candor i took you for one of the little mayfair dandies she said to pen you looked as solemn as a little undertaker and as i disliked beyond measure the odious creature who was on the other side of me i thought it was best to eat my dinner and hold my tongue and you did both very well my dear miss bunion pen said with a laugh well so i do but i intend to talk to you the next time a great deal for you are neither so solemn nor so stupid nor so pert as you look ah miss bunion how i pine for that next time to come pen said with an air of comical gallantry but we must return to the day and the dinner at paternoster row the repast was of the richest descriptionwhat i call of the florid gothic style wagg whispered to pen who sate beside the humorist in his sidewing voice the men in creaking shoes and berlin gloves were numerous and solemn carrying on rapid conversations behind the guests as they moved to and fro with the dishes doolan called out waither to one of them and blushed when he thought of his blunder mrs bungays own footboy was lost amidst those large and blackcoated attendants look at that very bowwindowed man wagg said hes an undertaker in amen corner and attends funerals and dinners cold meat and hot dont you perceive hes the sham butler here and i observe my dear mr pendennis as you will through life that wherever there is a sham butler at a london dinner there is sham winethis sherry is filthy bungay my boy where did you get this delicious brown sherry im glad you like it mr wagg glass with you said the publisher its some i got from alderman bennings store and gave a good figure for it i can tell you mr pendennis will you join us your ealth gentlemen the old rogue where does he expect to go to it came from the public house wagg said it requires two men to carry off that sherry tis so uncommonly strong i wish i had a bottle of old steynes wine here pendennis your uncle and i have had many a one he sends it about to people where he is in the habit of dining i remember at poor rawdon crawleys sir pitt crawleys brotherhe was governor of coventry islandsteynes chef always came in the morning and the butler arrived with the champagne from gaunt house in the icepails ready how good this is said popjoy goodnaturedly you must have a cordon bleu in your kitchen o yes mrs bungay said thinking he spoke of a jackchain very likely i mean a french chef said the polite guest o yes your lordship again said the lady does your artist say hes a frenchman mrs b called out wagg well im sure i dont know answered the publishers lady because if he does hes a quizzin yer cried mr wagg but nobody saw the pun which disconcerted somewhat the bashful punster the dinner is from griggs in st pauls churchyard so is bacons he whispered pen bungay writes to give halfacrown a head more than baconso does bacon they would poison each others ices if they could get near them and as for the madedishesthey are poison thishumhathis brimborion a la sevigne is delicious mrs b he said helping himself to a dish which the undertaker handed to him well im glad you like it mrs bungay answered blushing and not knowing whether the name of the dish was actually that which wagg gave to it but dimly conscious that that individual was quizzing her accordingly she hated mr wagg with female ardor and would have deposed him from his command over mr bungays periodical but that his name was great in the trade and his reputation in the land considerable by the displacement of persons warrington had found himself on the right hand of mrs shandon who sate in plain black silk and faded ornaments by the side of the florid publisher the sad smile of the lady moved his rough heart to pity nobody seemed to interest himself about her she sate looking at her husband who himself seemed rather abashed in the presence of some of the company wenham and wagg both knew him and his circumstances he had worked with the latter and was immeasurably his superior in wit genius and acquirement but waggs star was brilliant in the world and poor shandon was unknown there he could not speak before the noisy talk of the coarser and more successful man but drank his wine in silence and as much of it as the people would give him he was under surveillance bungay had warned the undertaker not to fill the captains glass too often or too full it was a melancholy precaution that and the more melancholy that it was necessary mrs shandon too cast alarmed glances across the table to see that her husband did not exceed abashed by the failure of his first pun for he was impudent and easily disconcerted wagg kept his conversation pretty much to pen during the rest of dinner and of course chiefly spoke about their neighbors this is one of bungays grand fielddays he said we are all bungavians heredid you read popjoys novel it was an old magazine story written by poor buzzard years ago and forgotten here until mr trotter that is trotter with the large shirt collar fished it out and bethought him that it was applicable to the late elopement so bob wrote a few chapters apropospopjoy permitted the use of his name and i dare say supplied a page here and thereand desperation or the fugitive duchess made its appearance the great fun is to examine popjoy about his own work of which he doesnt know a wordi say popjoy what a capital passage that is in volume threewhere the cardinal in disguise after being converted by the bishop of london proposes marriage to the duchesss daughter glad you like it popjoy answered its a favorite bit of my own theres no such thing in the whole book whispered wagg to pen invented it myself gad it wouldnt be a bad plot for a highchurch novel i remember poor byron hobhouse trelawney and myself dining with cardinal mezzocaldo at rome captain sumph began and we had some orvieto wine for dinner which byron liked very much and i remember how the cardinal regretted that he was a single man we went to civita vecchia two days afterward where byrons yacht wasand by jove the cardinal died within three weeks and byron was very sorry for he rather liked him a devilish interesting story sumph indeed wagg said you should publish some of those stories captain sumph you really should such a volume would make our friend bungays fortune shandon said why dont you ask sumph to publish em in your new paperthe whatdyecallemhay shandon bawled out wagg why dont you ask him to publish em in your old magazine the thingumbob shandon replied is there going to be a new paper asked wenham who knew perfectly well but was ashamed of his connection with the press bungay going to bring out a paper cried popjoy who on the contrary was proud of his literary reputation and acquaintances you must employ me mrs bungay use your influence with him and make him employ me prose or versewhat shall it be novels poems travels or leading articles begad any thing or every thingonly let bungay pay me and im readyi am now my dear mrs bungay begad now its to be called the small beer chronicle growled wagg and little popjoy is to be engaged for the infantine department it is to be called the pallmall gazette sir and we shall be very happy to have you with us shandon said pallmall gazettewhy pallmall gazette asked wagg because the editor was born at dublin the subeditor at cork because the proprietor lives in paternoster row and the paper is published in catherinestreet strand wont that reason suffice you wagg shandon said he was getting rather angry every thing must have a name my dog ponto has got a name youve got a name and a name which you deserve more or less bedad why dye grudge the name to our paper by any other name it would smell as sweet said wagg ill have ye remember its names not whatdyecallem mr wagg said shandon you know its name well enough andand you know mine and i know your address too said wagg but this was spoken in an undertone and the goodnatured irishman was appeased almost in an instant after his ebullition of spleen and asked wagg to drink wine with him in a friendly voice when the ladies retired from the table the talk grew louder still and presently wenham in a courtly speech proposed that every body should drink to the health of the new journal eulogizing highly the talents wit and learning of its editor captain shandon it was his maxim never to lose the support of a newspaper man and in the course of that evening he went round and saluted every literary gentleman present with a privy compliment specially addressed to him informing this one how great an impression had been made in downingstreet by his last article and telling that one how profoundly his good friend the duke of so and so had been struck by the ability of the late numbers the evening came to a close and in spite of all the precautions to the contrary poor shandon reeled in his walk and went home to his new lodgings with his faithful wife by his side and the cabman on his box jeering at him wenham had a chariot of his own which he put at popjoys seat and the timid miss bunion seeing mr wagg who was her neighbor about to depart insisted upon a seat in his carriage much to that gentlemans discomfiture pen and warrington walked home together in the moonlight and now warrington said that you have seen the men of letters tell me was i far wrong in saying that there are thousands of people in this town who dont write books who are to the full as clever and intellectual as people who do pen was forced to confess that the literary personages with whom he had become acquainted had not said much in the course of the nights conversation that was worthy to be remembered or quoted in fact not one word about literature had been said during the whole course of the nightand it may be whispered to those uninitiated people who are anxious to know the habits and make the acquaintance of men of letters that there are no race of people who talk about books or perhaps who read books so little as literary men chapter xxxvi the pallmall gazette illustration considerable success at first attended the new journal it was generally stated that an influential political party supported the paper and great names were cited among the contributors to its columns was there any foundation for these rumors we are not at liberty to say whether they were well or illfounded but this much we may divulge that an article upon foreign policy which was generally attributed to a noble lord whose connection with the foreign office is very well known was in reality composed by captain shandon in the parlor of the bear and staff publichouse near whitehall stairs whither the printers boy had tracked him and where a literary ally of his mr bludyer had a temporary residence and that a series of papers on finance questions which were universally supposed to be written by a great statesman of the house of commons were in reality composed by mr george warrington of the upper temple that there may have been some dealings between the pallmall gazette and this influential party is very possible percy popjoy whose father lord falconet was a member of the party might be seen not unfrequently ascending the stairs to warringtons chambers and some information appeared in the paper which gave it a character and could only be got from very peculiar sources several poems feeble in thought but loud and vigorous in expression appeared in the pallmall gazette with the signature of p p and it must be owned that his novel was praised in the new journal in a very outrageous manner in the political department of the paper mr pen did not take any share but he was a most active literary contributor the pallmall gazette had its offices as we have heard in catherinestreet in the strand and hither pen often came with his manuscripts in his pocket and with a great deal of bustle and pleasure such as a man feels at the outset of his literary career when to see himself in print is still a novel sensation and he yet pleases himself to think that his writings are creating some noise in the world illustration here it was that mr jack finucane the subeditor compiled with paste and scissors the journal of which he was supervisor with an eagle eye he scanned all the paragraphs of all the newspapers which had any thing to do with the world of fashion over which he presided he didnt let a death or a dinnerparty of the aristocracy pass without having the event recorded in the columns of his journal and from the most recondite provincial prints and distant scotch and irish newspapers he fished out astonishing paragraphs and intelligence regarding the upper classes of society it was a grand nay a touching sight for a philosopher to see jack finucane esquire with a plate of meat from the cookshop and a glass of porter from the publichouse for his meal recounting the feasts of the great as if he had been present at them and in tattered trowsers and dingy shirt sleeves cheerfully describing and arranging the most brilliant fetes of the world of fashion the incongruity of finucanes avocation and his manners and appearance amused his new friend pen since he left his own native village where his rank probably was not very lofty jack had seldom seen any society but such as used the parlor of the taverns which he frequented whereas from his writing you would have supposed that he dined with embassadors and that his common lounge was the bowwindow of whites errors of description it is true occasionally slipped from his pen but the ballinafad sentinel of which he was own correspondent suffered by these not the pallmall gazette in which jack was not permitted to write much his london chiefs thinking that the scissors and the paste were better wielded by him than the pen pen took a great deal of pains with the writing of his reviews and having a pretty fair share of desultory reading acquired in the early years of his life an eager fancy and a keen sense of fun his articles pleased his chief and the public and he was proud to think that he deserved the money which he earned we may be sure that the pallmall gazette was taken in regularly at fairoaks and read with delight by the two ladies there it was received at clavering park too where we know there was a young lady of great literary tastes and old doctor portman himself to whom the widow sent her paper after she had got her sons articles by heart signified his approval of pens productions saying that the lad had spirit taste and fancy and wrote if not like a scholar at any rate like a gentleman and what was the astonishment and delight of our friend major pendennis on walking into one of his clubs the regent where wenham lord falconet and some other gentlemen of good reputation and fashion were assembled to hear them one day talking over a number of the pallmall gazette and of an article which appeared in its columns making some bitter fun of a book recently published by the wife of a celebrated member of the opposition party the book in question was a book of travels in spain and italy by the countess of muffborough in which it was difficult to say which was the most wonderful the french or the english in which languages her ladyship wrote indifferently and upon the blunders of which the critic pounced with delighted mischief the critic was no other than pen he jumped and danced round about his subject with the greatest jocularity and high spirits he showed up the noble ladys faults with admirable mock gravity and decorum there was not a word in the article which was not polite and gentlemanlike and the unfortunate subject of the criticism was scarified and laughed at during the operation wenhams bilious countenance was puckered up with malign pleasure as he read the critique lady muffborough had not asked him to her parties during the last year lord falconet giggled and laughed with all his heart lord muffborough and he had been rivals ever since they began life and these complimented major pendennis who until now had scarcely paid any attention to some hints which his fairoaks correspondence threw out of dear arthurs constant and severe literary occupations which i fear may undermine the poor boys health and had thought any notice of mr pen and his newspaper connections quite below his dignity as a major and a gentleman but when the oracular wenham praised the boys production when lord falconet who had had the news from percy popjoy approved of the genius of young pen when the great lord steyne himself to whom the major referred the article laughed and sniggered over it swore it was capital and that the muffborough would writhe under it like a whale under a harpoon the major as in duty bound began to admire his nephew very much said by gad the young rascal had some stuff in him and would do something he had always said he would do something and with a hand quite tremulous with pleasure the old gentleman sate down to write to the widow at fairoaks all that the great folks had said in praise of pen and he wrote to the young rascal too asking when he would come and eat a chop with his old uncle and saying that he was commissioned to take him to dinner at gaunt house for lord steyne liked any body who could entertain him whether by his folly wit or by his dullness by his oddity affectation good spirits or any other quality pen flung his letter across the table to warrington perhaps he was disappointed that the other did not seem to be much affected by it the courage of young critics is prodigious they clamber up to the judgmentseat and with scarce a hesitation give their opinion upon works the most intricate or profound had macaulays history or herschels astronomy been put before pen at this period he would have looked through the volumes meditated his opinion over a cigar and signified his august approval of either author as if the critic had been their born superior and indulgent master and patron by the help of the biographie universelle or the british museum he would be able to take a rapid resume of a historical period and allude to names dates and facts in such a masterly easy way as to astonish his mamma at home who wondered where her boy could have acquired such a prodigious store of reading and himself too when he came to read over his articles two or three months after they had been composed and when he had forgotten the subject and the books which he had consulted at that period of his life mr pen owns that he would not have hesitated at twentyfour hours notice to pass an opinion upon the greatest scholars or to give a judgment upon the encyclopaedia luckily he had warrington to laugh at him and to keep down his impertinence by a constant and wholesome ridicule or he might have become conceited beyond all sufferance for shandon liked the dash and flippancy of his young aiddecamp and was indeed better pleased with pens light and brilliant flashes than with the heavier metal which his elder coadjutor brought to bear but though he might justly be blamed on the score of impertinence and a certain prematurity of judgment mr pen was a perfectly honest critic a great deal too candid for mr bungays purposes indeed who grumbled sadly at his impartiality pen and his chief the captain had a dispute upon this subject one day in the name of common sense mr pendennis shandon asked what have you been doingpraising one of mr bacons books bungay has been with me in a fury this morning at seeing a laudatory article upon one of the works of the odious firm over the way pens eyes opened with wide astonishment do you mean to say he asked that we are to praise no books that bacon publishes or that if the books are good we are to say they are bad my good young friendfor what do you suppose a benevolent publisher undertakes a critical journal to benefit his rival shandon inquired to benefit himself certainly but to tell the truth too pen saidruat caelum to tell the truth and my prospectus said shandon with a laugh and a sneer do you consider that was a work of mathematical accuracy of statement pardon me that is not the question pen said and i dont think you very much care to argue it i had some qualms of conscience about that same prospectus and debated the matter with my friend warrington we agreed however pen said laughing that because the prospectus was rather declamatory and poetical and the giant was painted upon the showboard rather larger than the original who was inside the caravan we need not be too scrupulous about this trifling inaccuracy but might do our part of the show without loss of character or remorse of conscience we are the fiddlers and play our tunes only you are the showman and leader of the van said shandon well i am glad that your conscience gave you leave to play for us yes but said pen with a fine sense of the dignity of his position we are all party men in england and i will stick to my party like a briton i will be as goodnatured as you like to our own side he is a fool who quarrels with his own nest and i will hit the enemy as hard as you likebut with fair play captain if you please one cant tell all the truth i suppose but one can tell nothing but the truth and i would rather starve by jove and never earn another penny by my pen this redoubted instrument had now been in use for some six weeks and pen spoke of it with vast enthusiasm and respect than strike an opponent an unfair blow or if called upon to place him rank him below his honest desert well mr pendennis when we want bacon smashed we must get some other hammer to do it shandon said with fatal goodnature and very likely thought within himself a few years hence perhaps the young gentleman wont be so squeamish the veteran condottiere himself was no longer so scrupulous he had fought and killed on so many a side for many a year past that remorse had long left him gad said he youve a tender conscience mr pendennis its the luxury of all novices and i may have had one once myself but that sort of bloom wears off with the rubbing of the world and im not going to the trouble myself of putting on an artificial complexion like our pious friend wenham or our model of virtue wagg i dont know whether some peoples hypocrisy is not better captain than others cynicism its more profitable at any rate said the captain biting his nails that wenham is as dull a quack as ever quacked and you see the carriage in which he drove to dinner faith itll be a long time before mrs shandon will take a drive in her own chariot god help her poor thing and pen went away from his chief after their little dispute and colloquy pointing his own moral to the captains tale and thinking to himself behold this man stored with genius wit learning and a hundred good natural gifts see how he has wrecked them by paltering with his honesty and forgetting to respect himself wilt thou remember thyself o pen thou art conceited enough wilt thou sell thy honor for a bottle no by heavens grace we will be honest whatever befalls and our mouths shall only speak the truth when they open a punishment or at least a trial was in store for mr pen in the very next number of the pallmall gazette warrington read out with roars of laughter an article which by no means amused arthur pendennis who was himself at work with a criticism for the next weeks number of the same journal and in which the spring annual was ferociously maltreated by some unknown writer the person of all most cruelly mauled was pen himself his verses had not appeared with his own name in the spring annual but under an assumed signature as he had refused to review the book shandon had handed it over to mr bludyer with directions to that author to dispose of it and he had done so effectually mr bludyer who was a man of very considerable talent and of a race which i believe is quite extinct in the press of our time had a certain notoriety in his profession and reputation for savage humor he smashed and trampled down the poor spring flowers with no more mercy than a bull would have on a parterre and having cut up the volume to his hearts content went and sold it at a bookstall and purchased a pint of brandy with the proceeds of the volume chapter xxxvii where pen appears in town and country illustration let us be allowed to pass over a few months of the history of mr arthur pendenniss lifetime during the which many events may have occurred which were more interesting and exciting to himself than they would be likely to prove to the reader of his present memoirs we left him in his last chapter regularly entered upon his business as a professional writer or literary hack as mr warrington chooses to style himself and his friend and we know how the life of any hack legal or literary in a curacy or in a marching regiment or at a merchants desk is dull of routine and tedious of description one days labor resembles another much too closely a literary man has often to work for his bread against time or against his will or in spite of his health or of his indolence or of his repugnance to the subject on which he is called to exert himself just like any other daily toiler when you want to make money by pegasus as he must perhaps who has no other salable property farewell poetry and aerial flights pegasus only rises now like mr greens balloon at periods advertised beforehand and when the spectators money has been paid pegasus trots in harness over the stony pavement and pulls a cart or a cab behind him often pegasus does his work with panting sides and trembling knees and not seldom gets a cut of the whip from his driver do not let us however be too prodigal of our pity upon pegasus there is no reason why this animal should be exempt from labor or illness or decay any more than any of the other creatures of gods world if he gets the whip pegasus very often deserves it and i for one am quite ready to protest with my friend george warrington against the doctrine which some poetical sympathizers are inclined to put forward viz that men of letters and what is called genius are to be exempt from the prose duties of this daily breadwanting taxpaying life and are not to be made to work and pay like their neighbors well then the pall mall gazette being duly established and arthur pendenniss merits recognized as a flippant witty and amusing critic he worked away hard every week preparing reviews of such works as came into his department and writing his reviews with flippancy certainly but with honesty and to the best of his power it might be that a historian of threescore who had spent a quarter of a century in composing a work of which our young gentleman disposed in the course of a couple of days reading at the british museum was not altogether fairly treated by such a facile critic or that a poet who had been elaborating sublime sonnets and odes until he thought them fit for the public and for fame was annoyed by two or three dozen pert lines in mr pens review in which the poets claims were settled by the critic as if the latter were my lord on the bench and the author a miserable little suitor trembling before him the actors at the theaters complained of him woefully too and very likely he was too hard upon them but there was not much harm done after all it is different now as we know but there were so few great historians or great poets or great actors in pens time that scarce any at all came up for judgment before his critical desk those who got a little whipping got what in the main was good for them not that the judge was any better or wiser than the persons whom he sentenced or indeed ever fancied himself so pen had a strong sense of humor and justice and had not therefore an overweening respect for his own works besides he had his friend warrington at his elbowa terrible critic if the young man was disposed to be conceited and more savage over pen than ever he was to those whom he tried at his literary assize by these critical labors and by occasional contributions to leading articles of the journal when without wounding his paper this eminent publicist could conscientiously speak his mind mr arthur pendennis gained the sum of four pounds four shillings weekly and with no small pains and labor likewise he furnished magazines and reviews with articles of his composition and is believed to have been though on this score he never chooses to speak london correspondent of the chatteris champion which at that time contained some very brilliant and eloquent letters from the metropolis by these labors the fortunate youth was enabled to earn a sum very nearly equal to four hundred pounds a year and on the second christmas after his arrival in london he actually brought a hundred pounds to his mother as a dividend upon the debt which he owed to laura that mrs pendennis read every word of her sons works and considered him to be the profoundest thinker and most elegant writer of the day that she thought his retribution of the hundred pounds an act of angelic virtue that she feared he was ruining his health by his labors and was delighted when he told her of the society which he met and of the great men of letters and fashion whom he saw will be imagined by all readers who have seen sonworship among mothers and that charming simplicity of love with which women in the country watch the career of their darlings in london if john has held such and such a brief if tom has been invited to such and such a ball or george has met this or that great and famous man at dinner what a delight there is in the hearts of mothers and sisters at home in somersetshire how young hopefuls letters are read and remembered what a theme for village talk they give and friendly congratulation in the second winter pen came for a very brief space and cheered the widows heart and lightened up the lonely house at fairoaks helen had her son all to herself laura was away on a visit to old lady rockminster the folks of clavering park were absent the very few old friends of the house dr portman at their head called upon mr pen and treated him with marked respect between mother and son it was all fondness confidence and affection it was the happiest fortnight of the widows whole life perhaps in the lives of both of them the holiday was gone only too quickly and pen was back in the busy world and the gentle widow alone again she sent arthurs money to laura i dont know why this young lady took the opportunity of leaving home when pen was coming thither or whether he was the more piqued or relieved by her absence he was by this time by his own merits and his uncles introductions pretty well introduced into london and known both in literary and polite circles among the former his fashionable reputation stood him in no little stead he was considered to be a gentleman of good present means and better expectations who wrote for his pleasure than which there can not be a greater recommendation to a young literary aspirant bacon bungay and co were proud to accept his articles mr wenham asked him to dinner mr wagg looked upon him with a favorable eye and they reported how they met him at the houses of persons of fashion among whom he was pretty welcome as they did not trouble themselves about his means present or future as his appearance and address were good and as he had got a character for being a clever fellow finally he was asked to one house because he was seen at another house and thus no small varieties of london life were presented to the young man he was made familiar with all sorts of people from paternoster row to pimlico and was as much at home at mayfair diningtables as at those tavern boards where some of his companions of the pen were accustomed to assemble illustrationmoved up from full of high spirits and curiosity easily adapting himself to all whom he met the young fellow pleased himself in this strange variety and jumble of men and made himself welcome or at ease at least whereever he went he would breakfast for instance at mr plovers of a morning in company with a peer a bishop a parliamentary orator two blue ladies of fashion a popular preacher the author of the last new novel and the very latest lion imported from egypt or from america and would quit this distinguished society for the back room at the newspaper office where pens and ink and the wet proofsheets were awaiting him here would be finucane the subeditor with the last news from the row and shandon would come in presently and giving a nod to pen would begin scribbling his leading article at the other end of the table flanked by the pint of sherry which when the attendant boy beheld him was always silently brought for the captain or mr bludyers roaring voice would be heard in the front room where that truculent critic would impound the books on the counter in spite of the timid remonstrances of mr midge the publisher and after looking through the volumes would sell them at his accustomed bookstall and having drunken and dined upon the produce of the sale in a tavern box would call for ink and paper and proceed to smash the author of his dinner and the novel toward evening mr pen would stroll in the direction of his club and take up warrington there for a constitutional walk this exercise freed the lungs and gave an appetite for dinner after which pen had the privilege to make his bow at some very pleasant houses which were opened to him or the town before him for amusement there was the opera or the eagle tavern or a ball to go to in may fair or a quiet night with a cigar and a book and a long talk with warrington or a wonderful new song at the back kitchen at this time of his life mr pen beheld all sorts of places and men and very likely did not know how much he enjoyed himself until long after when balls gave him no pleasure neither did farces make him laugh nor did the tavern joke produce the least excitement in him nor did the loveliest dancer that ever showed her ankles cause him to stir from his chair after dinner at his present mature age all these pleasures are over and the times have passed away too it is but a very few years sincebut the time is gone and most of the men bludyer will no more bully authors or cheat landlords of their score shandon the learned and thriftless the witty and unwise sleeps his last sleep they buried honest doolan the other day never will he cringe or flatter never pull longbow or empty whiskynoggin any more the london season was now blooming in its full vigor and the fashionable newspapers abounded with information regarding the grand banquets routs and balls which were enlivening the polite world our gracious sovereign was holding levees and drawingrooms at st jamess the baywindows of the clubs were crowded with the heads of respectable redfaced newspaperreading gentlemen along the serpentine trailed thousands of carriages squadrons of dandy horsemen trampled over rotten row every body was in town in a word and of course major arthur pendennis who was somebody was not absent with his head tied up in a smart bandana handkerchief and his meager carcass enveloped in a brilliant turkish dressinggown the worthy gentleman sate on a certain morning by his fireside letting his feet gently simmer in a bath while he took his early cup of tea and perused his morning post he could not have faced the day without his two hours toilet without his early cup of tea without his morning post i suppose nobody in the world except morgan not even morgans master himself knew how feeble and ancient the major was growing and what numberless little comforts he required if men sneer as our habit is at the artifices of an old beauty at her paint perfumes ringlets at those innumerable and to us unknown stratagems with which she is said to remedy the ravages of time and reconstruct the charms whereof years have bereft her the ladies it is to be presumed are not on their side altogether ignorant that men are vain as well as they and that the toilets of old bucks are to the full as elaborate as their own how is it that old blushington keeps that constant little rosetint on his cheeks and where does old blondel get the preparation which makes his silver hair pass for golden have you ever seen lord hotspur get off his horse when he thinks nobody is looking taken out of his stirrups his shiny boots can hardly totter up the steps of hotspur house he is a dashing young nobleman still as you see the back of him in rotten row when you behold him on foot what an old old fellow did you ever form to yourself any idea of dick lacy dick has been dick these sixty years in a natural state and without his stays all these men are objects whom the observer of human life and manners may contemplate with as much profit as the most elderly belgravian venus or inveterate mayfair jezebel an old reprobate daddylonglegs who has never said his prayers except perhaps in public these fifty years an old buck who still clings to as many of the habits of youth as his feeble grasp of health can hold by who has given up the bottle but sits with young fellows over it and tells naughty stories upon toast and waterwho has given up beauty but still talks about it as wickedly as the youngest roue in companysuch an old fellow i say if any parson in pimlico or st jamess were to order the beadles to bring him into the middle aisle and there set him in an armchair and make a text of him and preach about him to the congregation could be turned to a wholesome use for once in his life and might be surprised to find that some good thoughts came out of him but we are wandering from our text the honest major who sits all this while with his feet cooling in the bath morgan takes them out of that place of purification and dries them daintily and proceeds to set the old gentleman on his legs with waistband and wig starched cravat and spotless boots and gloves it was during these hours of the toilet that morgan and his employer had their confidential conversations for they did not meet much at other times of the daythe major abhorring the society of his own chairs and tables in his lodgings and morgan his masters toilet over and letters delivered had his time very much on his own hands this spare time the active and wellmannered gentleman bestowed among the valets and butlers of the nobility his acquaintance and morgan pendennis as he was styled for by such compound names gentlemens gentlemen are called in their private circles was a frequent and welcome guest at some of the very highest tables in this town he was a member of two influential clubs in mayfair and pimlico and he was thus enabled to know the whole gossip of the town and entertain his master very agreeably during the two hours toilet conversation he knew a hundred tales and legends regarding persons of the very highest ton whose valets canvass their august secrets just my dear madam as our own parlormaids and dependents in the kitchen discuss our characters our stinginess and generosity our pecuniary means or embarrassments and our little domestic or connubial tiffs and quarrels if i leave this manuscript open on my table i have not the slightest doubt betty will read it and they will talk it over in the lower regions tonight and tomorrow she will bring in my breakfast with a face of such entire imperturbable innocence that no mortal could suppose her guilty of playing the spy if you and the captain have high words upon any subject which is just possible the circumstances of the quarrel and the characters of both of you will be discussed with impartial eloquence over the kitchen teatable and if mrs smiths maid should by chance be taking a dish of tea with yours her presence will not undoubtedly act as a restraint upon the discussion in question her opinion will be given with candor and the next day her mistress will probably know that captain and mrs jones have been aquarreling as usual nothing is secret take it as a rule that john knows every thing and as in our humble world so in the greatest a duke is no more a hero to his valetdechambre than you or i and his graces man at his club in company doubtless with other men of equal social rank talks over his masters character and affairs with the ingenuous truthfulness which befits gentlemen who are met together in confidence who is a niggard and screws up his moneyboxes who is in the hands of the moneylenders and is putting his noble name on the back of bills of exchange who is intimate with whose wife who wants whom to marry her daughter and which he wont no not at any price all these facts gentlemens confidential gentlemen discuss confidentially and are known and examined by every person who has any claim to rank in genteel society in a word if old pendennis himself was said to know every thing and was at once admirably scandalous and delightfully discreet it is but justice to morgan to say that a great deal of his masters information was supplied to that worthy man by his valet who went out and foraged knowledge for him indeed what more effectual plan is there to get a knowledge of london society than to begin at the foundationthat is at the kitchen floor so mr morgan and his employer conversed as the latters toilet proceeded there had been a drawingroom on the day previous and the major read among the presentations that of lady clavering by lady rockminster and of miss amory by her mother lady clavering and in a further part of the paper their dresses were described with a precision and in a jargon which will puzzle and amuse the antiquary of future generations the sight of these names carried pendennis back to the country how long have the claverings been in london he asked pray morgan have you seen any of their people sir francis have sent away his foring man sir mr morgan replied and have took a friend of mine as own man sir indeed he applied on my reckmendation you may recklect towler sirtall redaired manbut dyes his air was groom of the chambers in lord levants famly till his lordship broke hup its a fall for towler sir but pore men cant be particklar said the valet with a pathetic voice devilish hard on towler by gad said the major amused and not pleasant for lord levanthe he always knew it was coming sir i spoke to you of it michaelmas was four years when her ladyship put the diamonds in pawn it was towler sir took em in two cabs to dobrees and a good deal of the plate went the same way dont you remember seeing of it at blackwall with the levant arms and coronick and lord levant settn oppsit to it at the marquis of steynes dinner beg your pardon did i cut you sir morgan was now operating upon the majors chin he continued the theme while stropping the skillful razor theyve took a house in grosvenorplace and are coming out strong sir her ladyships going to give three parties besides a dinner a week sir her fortune wont stand itcant stand it gad she had a devilish good cook when i was at fairoaks the major said with very little compassion for the widow amorys fortune mirobblan was his name sir mirobblans gone away sir morgan said and the major this time with hearty sympathy said he was devilish sorry to lose him theres been a tremenjuous row about that mosseer mirobblan morgan continued at a ball at baymouth sir bless his impadence he challenged mr harthur to fight a jewel sir which mr harthur was very near knocking him down and pitchin him out awinder and serve him right but chevalier strong sir came up and stopped the shindyi beg pardon the holtercation sirthem french cooks has as much pride and hinsolence as if they was real gentlemen i heard something of that quarrel said the major but mirobolant was not turned off for that no sir that affair sir mr harthur forgave it him and beaved most handsome was hushed hup it was about miss hamory sir that he ad his dismissal those french fellers they fancy every body is in love with em and he climbed up the large grape vine to her winder sir and was a trying to get in when he was caught sir and mr strong came out and they got the gardenengine and played on him and there was no end of a row sir confound his impudence you dont mean to say miss amory encouraged him cried the major amazed at a peculiar expression in mr morgans countenance morgan resumed his imperturbable demeanor know nothing about it sir servants dont know them kind of things the least most probbly there was nothing in itso many lies is told about familiesmarobblan went away bag and baggage saucepans and piano and allthe feller ad a pianna and wrote potry in french and he took a lodging at clavering and he hankered about the primises and it was said that madam fribsby the milliner brought letters to miss hamory though i dont believe a word about it nor that he tried to pison hisself with charcoal which it was all a humbug betwigst him and madam fribsby and he was nearly shot by the keeper in the park illustration in the course of that very day it chanced that the major had stationed himself in the great window of bayss club in st jamessstreet at the hour in the afternoon when you see a half score of respectable old bucks similarly recreating themselves bayss is rather an oldfashioned place of resort now and many of its members more than middleaged but in the time of the prince regent these old fellows occupied the same window and were some of the very greatest dandies in this empire major pendennis was looking from the great window and spied his nephew arthur walking down the street in company with his friend mr popjoy look said popjoy to pen as they passed did you ever pass bayss at four oclock without seeing that collection of old fogies its a regular museum they ought to be cast in wax and set up at madame tussauds in a chamber of old horrors by themselves pen said laughing in the chamber of horrors gad doosid good pop cried they are old rogues most of em and no mistake theres old blondel theres my uncle colchicum the most confounded old sinner in europe thereshullo theres somebody rapping the window and nodding at us its my uncle the major said pen is he an old sinner too notorious old rogue pop said wagging his head notowious old wogue he pronounced the words thereby rendering them much more emphatic hes beckoning you in he wants to speak to you come in too pen said cant replied the other cut uncle col two years ago about mademoiselle frangipaneta ta and the young sinner took leave of pen and the club of the elder criminals and sauntered into blacquieres an adjacent establishment frequented by reprobates of his own age colchicum blondel and the senior bucks had just been conversing about the clavering family whose appearance in london had formed the subject of major pendenniss morning conversation with his valet mr blondels house was next to that of sir francis clavering in grosvenorplace giving very good dinners himself he had remarked some activity in his neighbors kitchen sir francis indeed had a new chef who had come in more than once and dressed mr blondels dinner for him that gentleman having only a remarkably expert female artist permanently engaged in his establishment and employing such chiefs of note as happened to be free on the occasion of his grand banquets they go to a devilish expense and see devilish bad company as yet i hear mr blondel said they scour the streets by gad to get people to dine with em champignon says it breaks his heart to serve up a dinner to their society what a shame it is that those low people should have money at all cried mr blondel whose grandfather had been a reputable leatherbreeches maker and whose father had lent money to the princes i wish i had fallen in with the widow myself sighed lord colchicum and not been laid up with that confounded gout at leghorn i would have married the woman myself im told she has six hundred thousand pounds in the threes not quite so much as that i knew her family in india major pendennis said i knew her family in india her father was an enormously rich old indigoplanter know all about her clavering has the next estate to ours in the country ha theres my nephew walking with with mine the infernal young scamp said lord colchicum glowering at popjoy out of his heavy eyebrows and he turned away from the window as major pendennis tapped upon it the major was in high goodhumor the sun was bright the air brisk and invigorating he had determined upon a visit to lady clavering on that day and bethought him that arthur would be a good companion for the walk across the green park to her ladyships door master pen was not displeased to accompany his illustrious relative who pointed out a dozen great men in their brief transit through st jamessstreet and got bows from a duke at a crossing a bishop on a cob and a cabinet minister with an umbrella the duke gave the elder pendennis the finger of a pipeclayed glove to shake which the major embraced with great veneration and all pens blood tingled as he found himself in actual communication as it were with this famous man for pen had possession of the majors left arm while that gentlemans other wing was engaged with his graces right and he wished all gray friars school all oxbridge university all paternoster row and the temple and laura and his mother at fairoaks could be standing on each side of the street to see the meeting between him and his uncle and the most famous duke in christendom how do pendennis fine day were his graces remarkable words and with a nod of his august head he passed onin a blue frock coat and spotless white duck trowsers in a white stock with a shining buckle behind old pendennis whose likeness to his grace has been remarked began to imitate him unconsciously after they had parted speaking with curt sentences after the manner of the great man we have all of us no doubt met with more than one military officer who has so imitated the manner of a certain great captain of the age and has perhaps changed his own natural character and disposition because fate had endowed him with an aquiline nose in like manner have we not seen many another man pride himself on having a tall forehead and a supposed likeness to mr canning many another go through life swelling with selfgratification on account of an imagined resemblance we say imagined because that any body should be really like that most beautiful and perfect of men is impossible to the great and revered george iv many third parties who wore low necks to their dresses because they fancied that lord byron and themselves were similar in appearance and has not the grave closed lately upon poor tom bickerstaff who having no more imagination than mr joseph hume looked in the glass and fancied himself like shakspeare shaved his forehead so as farther to resemble the immortal bard wrote tragedies incessantly and died perfectly crazyactually perished of his forehead these or similar freaks of vanity most people who have frequented the world must have seen in their experience pen laughed in his roguish sleeve at the manner in which his uncle began to imitate the great man from whom they had just parted but mr pen was as vain in his own way perhaps as the elder gentleman and strutted with a very consequential air of his own by the majors side yes my dear boy said the old bachelor as they sauntered through the green park where many poor children were disporting happily and errand boys were playing at tosshalfpenny and black sheep were grazing in the sunshine and an actor was learning his part on a bench and nursery maids and their charges sauntered here and there and several couples were walking in a leisurely manner yes depend on it my boy for a poor man there is nothing like having good acquaintances who were those men with whom you saw me in the baywindow at bayss two were peers of the realm hobananob will be a peer as soon as his granduncle dies and he has had his third seizure and of the other four not one has less than his seven thousand a year did you see that dark blue brougham with that tremendous stepping horse waiting at the door of the club youll know it again it is sir hugh trumpingtons he was never known to walk in his life never appears in the streets on footnever and if he is going two doors off to see his mother the old dowager to whom i shall certainly introduce you for she receives some of the best company in london gad sir he mounts his horse at no and dismounts again at no a he is now upstairs at bayss playing piquet with count punter he is the secondbest player in england as well he may be for he plays every day of his life except sundays for sir hugh is an uncommonly religious man from halfpast three to halfpast seven when he dresses for dinner a very pious manner of spending his time pen said laughing and thinking that his uncle was falling into the twaddling state gad sir that is not the question a man of his estate may employ his time as he chooses when you are a baronet a county member with ten thousand acres of the best land in cheshire and such a place as trumpington though he never goes there you may do as you like and so that was his brougham sir was it the nephew said with almost a sneer his broughamo ay yesand that brings me back to my pointrevenons a nos moutons yes begad revenons a nos moutons well that brougham is mine if i choose between four and seven just as much mine as if i jobbed it from tilburys begad for thirty pound a month sir hugh is the bestnatured fellow in the world and if it hadnt been so fine an afternoon as it is you and i would have been in that brougham at this very minute on our way to grosvenorplace that is the benefit of knowing rich men i dine for nothing sir i go into the country and im mounted for nothing other fellows keep hounds and gamekeepers for me sic vos non vobis as we used to say at gray friars hey im of the opinion of my old friend leech of the fortyfourth and a devilish good shrewd fellow he was as most scotchmen are gad sir leech used to say he was so poor that he couldnt afford to know a poor man you dont act up to your principles uncle pen said goodnaturedly up to my principles how sir the major asked rather testily you would have cut me in saint jamessstreet sir pen said were your practice not more benevolent than your theory you who live with dukes and magnates of the land and would take no notice of a poor devil like me by which speech we may see that mr pen was getting on in the world and could flatter as well as laugh in his sleeve major pendennis was appeased instantly and very much pleased he tapped affectionately his nephews arm on which he was leaning and said you sir you are my flesh and blood hang it sir ive been very proud of you and very fond of you but for your confounded follies and extravagancies and wild oats sir which i hope youve sown yes begad i hope youve sown em i hope youve sown em begad my object arthur is to make a man of you to see you well placed in the world as becomes one of your name and my own sir you have got yourself a little reputation by your literary talents which i am very far from undervaluing though in my time begad poetry and genius and that sort of thing were devilish disreputable there was poor byron for instance who ruined himself and contracted the worst habits by living with poets and newspaperwriters and people of that kind but the times are changed nowtheres a run upon literatureclever fellows get into the best houses in town begad tempora mutantur sir and by jove i suppose whatever is is right as shakspeare says pen did not think fit to tell his uncle who was the author who had made use of that remarkable phrase and here descending from the green park the pair made their way into grosvenorplace and to the door of the mansion occupied there by sir francis and lady clavering the diningroom shutters of this handsome mansion were freshly gilded the knockers shone gorgeous upon the newlypainted door the balcony before the drawingroom bloomed with a portable garden of the most beautiful plants and with flowers white and pink and scarlet the windows of the upper room the sacred chamber and dressingroom of my lady doubtless and even a pretty little casement of the third story which keensighted mr pen presumed to belong to the virgin bedroom of miss blanche amory were similarly adorned with floral ornaments and the whole exterior face of the house presented the most brilliant aspect which fresh new paint shining plate glass newly cleaned bricks and spotless mortar could offer to the beholder how strong must have rejoiced in organizing all this splendor thought pen he recognized the chevaliers genius in the magnificence before him lady clavering is going out for her drive the major said we shall only have to leave our pasteboards arthur he used the word pasteboards having heard it from some of the ingenuous youth of the nobility about town and as a modern phrase suited to pens tender years indeed as the two gentlemen reached the door a landau drove up a magnificent yellow carriage lined with brocade or satin of a faint cream color drawn by wonderful gray horses with flaming ribbons and harness blazing all over with crests no less than three of these heraldic emblems surmounted the coats of arms on the panels and these shields contained a prodigious number of quarterings betokening the antiquity and splendor of the house of clavering and snell a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammercloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing graysa young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoeslittle buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot one of the leaves of the hall door was opened and johnone of the largest of his racewas leaning against the door pillar with his ambrosial hair powdered his legs crossed beautiful silkstockinged in his hand his cane goldheaded dolichoskion jeames was invisible but near at hand waiting in the hall with the gentleman who does not wear livery and ready to fling down the roll of haircloth over which her ladyship was to step to her carriage these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practiced eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horsehair carpet tumbled down the doorsteps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other and two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriagestep as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the doorthe major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick at that moment lady clavering looking round saw the pairshe was on the first carriagestep and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backward which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isnt arthur pendennis and the old major jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orangecolored gloves the goodnatured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew come in both of you why havent you been before get out blanche and come and see your old friends o im so glad to see you weve been waitin and waitin for you ever so long come in luncheon aint gone down cried out this hospitable lady squeezing pens hand in both hers she had dropped the majors after a brief wrench of recognition and blanche casting up her eyes toward the chimneys descended from the carriage presently with a timid blushing appealing look and gave a little hand to major pendennis the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen and the carriage with the prancing grays was left unoccupied save by the coachman in the silver wig chapter xxxviii in which the sylph reappears illustration better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady claverings riches and the legend in london upon her ladyships arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady claverings father were mentioned as sources of her wealth her account at her london bankers was positively known and the sum embraced so many ciphers as to create as many o s of admiration in the wondering hearer it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknows prime favorite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mohammedanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaubs celebrated nosering diamond the light of the dewan under the title of the begum lady claverings fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of de lolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliestborn man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from her wealth he merits to be this fact shows our british independence and honest feelingour higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strongs soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor he hung and rehung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronets factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strongs cutlet now found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherds inn he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenhamcourt road and whom he had elevated to the rank of bodyservant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings this was no other than the favorite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connection which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patrons early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield in truth strong had long understood sir francis claverings character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his embassador in all sorts of affairs on one of these occasions the nawaubs envoy must have been in an exceeding illhumor for he crushed claverings letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged ill have no more letters nor no more shillyshally tell clavering ill have a thousand or by jove ill split and burst him all to atoms let him give me a thousand and ill go abroad and i give you my honor as a gentleman ill not ask him for no more for a year give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money aint here next friday at oclock as sure as my names what it is ill have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week ill blow up the whole concern strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamonts hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour strong saw him embark at dover it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellows power and the colonel has got the bill before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a color coming up fourteen times he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamonts bill though evidently very much against his will for in strongs hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtors jail in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldnt speak to his wife part of mr strongs business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron and in the chevaliers apartments in shepherds inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the moneylender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strongs lodgings than at his own and such was the chevaliers friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted having drawn claverings bills he got them discounted in the city when they became due he parleyed with the billholders and gave them installments of their debt or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successfulso there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gayety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necksthe which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherds inn and in the mean while are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the door steps of grosvenorplace first they went into the gorgeous diningroom fitted up lady clavering couldnt for goodness gracious tell why in the middleaged style unless said her goodnatured ladyship laughing because me and clavering are middleaged people and here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which lady clavering and blanche had just partaken when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the diningroom with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase there were indeed highbacked dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardourstreet and tapestry from france bits of armor doublehanded swords and battleaxes made of cartonpierre lookingglasses statuettes of saints and dresden chinanothing in a word could be chaster behind the diningroom was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bells life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiardtable at his clubs or punting at the gamblinghouses in saint jamess but what could equal the chaste splendor of the drawingrooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your feet made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warmingpans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandylegged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marqueterietables covered with marvelous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each outsquealing and outchattering the other a clock singing tunes on a consoletable and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantlepiecethere was in a word every thing that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise a london drawingroom fitted up without regard to expense is surely one of the noblest and most curious sights of the present day the romans of the lower empire the dear marchionesses and countesses of louis xv could scarcely have had a finer taste than our modern folks exhibit and every body who saw lady claverings receptionrooms was forced to confess that they were most elegant and that the prettiest rooms in londonlady harley quins lady hanway wardours or mrs hodgepodgsons own the great railroad croesus wife were not fitted up with a more consummate chastity poor lady clavering meanwhile knew little regarding these things and had a sad want of respect for the splendors around her i only know they cost a precious deal of money major she said to her guest and that i dont advise you to try one of them gossamer gilt chairs i came down on one the night we gave our second dinner party why didnt you come and see us before wed have asked you to it you would have liked to see mamma break a chair wouldnt you mr pendennis dear blanche said with a sneer she was angry because pen was talking and laughing with mamma because mamma had made a number of blunders in describing the housefor a hundred other good reasons i should like to have been by to give lady clavering my arm if she had need of it pen answered with a bow and a blush quel preux chevalier cried the sylphide tossing up her little head i have a fellowfeeling with those who fall remember pen said i suffered myself very much from doing so once and you went home to laura to console you said miss amory pen winced he did not like the remembrance of the consolation which laura had given to him nor was he very well pleased to find that his rebuff in that quarter was known to the world so as he had nothing to say in reply he began to be immensely interested in the furniture round about him and to praise lady claverings taste with all his might me dont praise me said honest lady clavering its all the upholsterers doings and captain strongs they did it all while we was at the parkandandlady rockminster has been here and says the salongs are very well said lady clavering with an air and tone of great deference my cousin laura has been staying with her pen said its not the dowager it is the lady rockminster indeed cried major pendennis when he heard this great name of fashion if you have her ladyships approval lady clavering you can not be far wrong no no you can not be far wrong lady rockminster i should say arthur is the very center of the circle of fashion and taste the rooms are beautiful indeed and the majors voice hushed as he spoke of this great lady and he looked round and surveyed the apartments awfully and respectfully as if he had been at church yes lady rockminster has took us up said lady clavering taken us up mamma cried blanche in a shrill voice well taken us up then said my lady its very kind of her and i dare say we shall like it when we git used to it only at first one dont fancy being tookwell taken up at all she is going to give our balls for us and wants to invite all our dinners but i wont stand that i will have my old friends and i wont let her send all the cards out and sit mum at the head of my own table you must come to me arthur and majorcome let me see on the th it aint one of our grand dinners blanche she said looking round at her daughter who bit her lips and frowned very savagely for a sylphide the major with a smile and a bow said he would much rather come to a quiet meeting than to a grand dinner he had had enough of those large entertainments and preferred the simplicity of the home circle i always think a dinners the best the second day said lady clavering thinking to mend her first speech on the th well be quite a snug little party at which second blunder miss blanche clasped her hands in despair and said o mamma vous etes incorrigible major pendennis vowed that he liked snug dinners of all things in the world and confounded her ladyships impudence for daring to ask such a man as him to a second days dinner but he was a man of an economical turn of mind and bethinking himself that he could throw over these people if any thing better should offer he accepted with the blandest air as for pen he was not a dinerout of thirty years standing as yet and the idea of a fine feast in a fine house was still perfectly welcome to him what was that pretty little quarrel which engaged itself between your worship and miss amory the major asked of pen as they walked away together i thought you used to be au mieux in that quarter used to be answered pen with a dandified air is a vague phrase regarding a woman was and is are two very different terms sir as regards womens hearts especially egad they change as we do cried the elder when we took the cape of good hope i recollect there was a lady who talked of poisoning herself for your humble servant and begad in three months she ran away from her husband with somebody else dont get yourself entangled with that miss amory she is forward affected and underbred and her character is somewhatnever mind what but dont think of her ten thousand pound wont do for you what my good follow is ten thousand pound i would scarcely pay that girls milliners bill with the interest of the money you seem to be a connoisseur in millinery uncle pen said i was sir i was replied the senior and the old warhorse you know never hears the sound of a trumpet but he begins to he heyou understand and he gave a killing though somewhat superannuated leer and bow to a carriage that passed them and entered the park lady catherine martingales carriage he said monsous fine girls the daughters though gad i remember their mother a thousand times handsomer no arthur my dear fellow with your person and expectations you ought to make a good coup in marriage some day or other and though i wouldnt have this repeated at fairoaks you rogue ha ha a reputation for a little wickedness and for being an homme dangereux dont hurt a young fellow with the women they like it sirthey hate a milksop young men must be young men you know but for marriage continued the veteran moralist that is a very different matter marry a woman with money ive told you before it is as easy to get a rich wife as a poor one and a doosed deal more comfortable to sit down to a wellcooked dinner with your little entrees nicely served than to have nothing but a damned cold leg of mutton between you and your wife we shall have a good dinner on the th when we dine with sir francis clavering stick to that my boy in your relations with the family cultivate em but keep em for dining no more of your youthful follies and nonsense about love in a cottage it must be a cottage with a double coachhouse a cottage of gentility sir said pen quoting the hackneyed ballad of the devils walk but his uncle did not know that poem though perhaps he might be leading pen upon the very promenade in question and went on with his philosophical remarks very much pleased with the aptness of the pupil to whom he addressed them indeed arthur pendennis was a clever fellow who took his color very readily from his neighbor and found the adaptation only too easy warrington the grumbler growled out that pen was becoming such a puppy that soon there would be no bearing him but the truth is the young mans success and dashing manners pleased his elder companion he liked to see pen gay and spirited and brimful of health and life and hope as a man who has long since left off being amused with clown and harlequin still gets a pleasure in watching a child at a pantomime mr pens former sulkiness disappeared with his better fortune and he bloomed as the sun began to shine upon him chapter xxxix in which colonel altamont appears and disappears illustration on the day appointed major pendennis who had formed no better engagement and arthur who desired none arrived together to dine with sir francis clavering the only tenants of the drawingroom when pen and his uncle reached it were sir francis and his wife and our friend captain strong whom arthur was very glad to see though the major looked very sulkily at strong being by no means well pleased to sit down to dinner with claverings dd housesteward as he irreverently called strong but mr welbore welbore claverings country neighbor and brother member of parliament speedily arriving pendennis the elder was somewhat appeased for welbore though perfectly dull and taking no more part in the conversation at dinner than the footman behind his chair was a respectable country gentleman of ancient family and seven thousand a year and the major felt always at ease in such society to these were added other persons of note the dowager lady rockminster who had her reasons for being well with the clavering family and the lady agnes foker with her son mr harry our old acquaintance mr pynsent could not come his parliamentary duties keeping him at the house duties which sate upon the two other senators very lightly miss blanche amory was the last of the company who made her appearance she was dressed in a killing white silk dress which displayed her pearly shoulders to the utmost advantage foker whispered to pen who regarded her with eyes of evident admiration that he considered her a stunner she chose to be very gracious to arthur upon this day and held out her hand most cordially and talked about dear fairoaks and asked for dear laura and his mother and said she was longing to go back to the country and in fact was entirely simple affectionate and artless harry foker thought he had never seen any body so amiable and delightful not accustomed much to the society of ladies and ordinarily being dumb in their presence he found that he could speak before miss amory and became uncommonly lively and talkative even before the dinner was announced and the party descended to the lower rooms he would have longed to give his arm to the fair blanche and conduct her down the broad carpeted stair but she fell to the lot of pen upon this occasion mr foker being appointed to escort mrs welbore welbore in consequence of his superior rank as an earls grandson but though he was separated from the object of his desire during the passage down stairs the delighted foker found himself by miss amorys side at the dinnertable and flattered himself that he had maneuvered very well in securing that happy place it may be that the move was not his but that it was made by another person blanche had thus the two young men one on each side of her and each tried to render himself gallant and agreeable fokers mamma from her place surveying her darling boy was surprised at his vivacity harry talked constantly to his fair neighbor about the topics of the day seen taglioni in the sylphide miss amory bring me that souprame of volile again if you please this was addressed to the attendant near him very good cant think where the souprames come from what becomes of the legs of the fowls i wonder shes clipping in the sylphide aint she and he began very kindly to hum the pretty air which pervades that prettiest of all ballets now faded into the past with that most beautiful and gracious of all dancers will the young folks ever see any thing so charming any thing so classic any thing like taglioni miss amory is a sylph herself said mr pen what a delightful tenor voice you have mr foker said the young lady i am sure you have been well taught i sing a little myself i should like to sing with you pen remembered that words very similar had been addressed to himself by the young lady and that she had liked to sing with him in former days and sneering within himself he wondered with how many other gentlemen she had sung duets since his time but he did not think fit to put this awkward question aloud and only said with the very tenderest air which he could assume i should like to hear you sing again miss blanche i never heard a voice i liked so well as yours i think i thought you liked lauras said miss blanche lauras is a contralto and that voice is very often out you know pen said bitterly i have heard a great deal of music in london he continued im tired of those professional peoplethey sing too loud or i have grown too old or too blase one grows old very soon in london miss amory and like all old fellows i only care for the songs i heard in my youth i like english music best i dont care for foreign songs much get me some saddle of mutton said mr foker i adore english ballads of all things said miss amory sing me one of the old songs after dinner will you said pen with an imploring voice shall i sing you an english song after dinner asked the sylphide turning to mr foker i will if you will promise to come up soon and she gave him a perfect broadside of her eyes ill come up after dinner fast enough he said simply i dont care about much wine afterwardi take my whack at dinneri mean my share you know and when i have had as much as i want i toddle up to tea im a domestic character miss amorymy habits are simpleand when im pleased im generally in a good humor aint i penthat jelly if you pleasenot that one the other with the cherries inside how the doose do they get those cherries inside the jellies in this way the artless youth prattled on and miss amory listened to him with inexhaustible good humor when the ladies took their departure for the upper regions blanche made the two young men promise faithfully to quit the table soon and departed with kind glances to each she dropped her gloves on fokers side of the table and her handkerchief on pens each had some little attention paid to him her politeness to mr foker was perhaps a little more encouraging than her kindness to arthur but the benevolent little creature did her best to make both the gentlemen happy foker caught her last glance as she rushed out of the door that bright look passed over mr strongs broad white waistcoat and shot straight at harry fokers the door closed on the charmer he sate down with a sigh and swallowed a bumper of claret as the dinner at which pen and his uncle took their places was not one of our grand parties it had been served at a considerably earlier hour than those ceremonial banquets of the london season which custom has ordained shall scarcely take place before nine oclock and the company being small and miss blanche anxious to betake herself to her piano in the drawingroom giving constant hints to her mother to retreatlady clavering made that signal very speedily so that it was quite daylight yet when the ladies reached the upper apartments from the flowerembroidered balconies of which they could command a view of the two parks of the poor couples and children still sauntering in the one and of the equipages of ladies and the horses of dandies passing through the arch of the other the sun in a word had not set behind the elms of kensington gardens and was still gilding the statue erected by the ladies of england in honor of his grace the duke of wellington when lady clavering and her female friends left the gentlemen drinking wine the windows of the diningroom were opened to let in the fresh air and afforded to the passersby in the street a pleasant or perhaps tantalizing view of six gentlemen in white waistcoats with a quantity of decanters and a variety of fruits before themlittle boys as they passed and jumped up at the arearailings and took a peep said to one another mi hi jim shouldnt you like to be there and have a cut of that there pineapplethe horses and carriages of the nobility and gentry passed by conveying them to belgravian toilets the policeman with clamping feet patrolled up and down before the mansion the shades of evening began to fall the gasman came and lighted the lamps before sir franciss door the butler entered the diningroom and illuminated the antique gothic chandelier over the antique carved oak diningtable so that from outside the house you looked inward upon a night scene of feasting and wax candles and from within you beheld a vision of a calm summer evening and the wall of st jamess park and the sky above in which a star or two was just beginning to twinkle jeames with folded legs leaning against the doorpillar of his masters abode looked forth musingly upon the latter tranquil sight while a spectator clinging to the railings examined the former scene policeman x passing gave his attention to neither but fixed it upon the individual holding by the railings and gazing into sir francis claverings diningroom where strong was laughing and talking away making the conversation for the party the man at the railings was very gorgeously attired with chains jewelry and waistcoats which the illumination from the house lighted up to great advantage his boots were shiny he had brass buttons to his coat and large white wristbands over his knuckles and indeed looked so grand that x imagined he beheld a member of parliament or a person of consideration before him whatever his rank however the mp or person of consideration was considerably excited by wine for he lurched and reeled somewhat in his gait and his hat was cocked over his wild and bloodshot eyes in a manner which no sober hat ever could assume his copious black hair was evidently surreptitious and his whiskers of the tyrian purple as strongs laughter following after one of his own gros mots came ringing out of window this gentleman without laughed and sniggered in the queerest way likewise and he slapped his thigh and winked at jeames pensive in the portico as much as to say plush my boy isnt that a good story jeamess attention had been gradually drawn from the moon in the heavens to this sublunary scene and he was puzzled and alarmed by the appearance of the man in shiny boots a holtercation he remarked afterward in the servantshalla holtercation with a feller in the streets is never no good and indeed he was not hired for any such purpose so having surveyed the man for some time who went on laughing reeling nodding his head with tipsy knowingness jeames looked out of the portico and softly called pleaceman and beckoned to that officer x marched up resolute with one berlin glove stuck in his beltside and jeames simply pointed with his index finger to the individual who was laughing against the railings not one single word more than pleaceman did he say but stood there in the calm summer evening pointing calmly a grand sight x advanced to the individual and said now sir will you have the kindness to move hon the individual who was in perfect good humor did not appear to hear one word which policeman x uttered but nodded and waggled his grinning head at strong until his hat almost fell from his head over the area railings now sir move on do you hear cries x in a much more peremptory tone and he touched the stranger gently with one of the fingers inclosed in the gauntlets of the berlin woof he of the many rings instantly started or rather staggered back into what is called an attitude of selfdefense and in that position began the operation which is entitled squaring at policeman x and showed himself brave and warlike if unsteady hullo keep your hands off a gentleman he said with an oath which need not be repeated move on out of this said x and dont be a blocking up the pavement staring into gentlemens diningrooms not stareho honot starethat is a good one replied the other with a satiric laugh and sneer whos to prevent me from staring looking at my friends if i like not you old highlows friends i dessay move on answered x if you touch me ill pitch into you i will roared the other i tell you i know em allthats sir francis clavering baronet mpi know him and he knows meand thats strong and thats the young chap that made the row at the ball i say strong strong its that d altamont cried sir francis within with a start and a guilty look and strong also with a look of annoyance got up from the table and ran out to the intruder a gentleman in a white waistcoat running out from a diningroom bareheaded a policeman and an individual decently attired engaged in almost fistycuffs on the pavement were enough to make a crowd even in that quiet neighborhood at halfpast eight oclock in the evening and a small mob began to assemble before sir francis claverings door for gods sake come in strong said seizing his acquaintances arm send for a cab james if you please he added in an under voice to that domestic and carrying the excited gentleman out of the street the outer door was closed upon him and the small crowd began to move away mr strong had intended to convey the stranger into sir franciss private sittingroom where the hats of the male guests were awaiting them and having there soothed his friend by bland conversation to have carried him off as soon as the cab arrived but the new comer was in a great state of wrath at the indignity which had been put upon him and when strong would have led him into the second door said in a tipsy voice that aint the door thats the diningroom door where the drinks going on and ill go and have some by jove ill go and have some at this audacity the butler stood aghast in the hall and placed himself before the door but it opened behind him and the master of the house made his appearance with anxious looks i will have someby i will the intruder was roaring out as sir francis came forward hullo clavering i say im come to have some wine with you hay old boyhay old corkscrew get us a bottle of the yellow seal you old thief the very besta hundred rupees a dozen and no mistake the host reflected a moment over his company there is only welbore pendennis and those two lads he thought and with a forced laugh and a piteous look he said well altamont come in i am very glad to see you im sure colonel altamont for the intelligent reader has doubtless long ere this discovered in the stranger his excellency the embassador of the nawaub of lucknow reeled into the diningroom with a triumphant look toward jeames the footman which seemed to say there sir what do you think of that now am i a gentleman or no and sank down into the first vacant chair sir francis clavering timidly stammered out the colonels name to his guest mr welbore welbore and his excellency began drinking wine forthwith and gazing round upon the company now with the most wonderful frowns and anon with the blandest smiles and hiccupped remarks encomiastic of the drink which he was imbibing very singular man has resided long in a native court in india strong said with great gravity the chevaliers presence of mind never deserting him in those indian courts they get very singular habits very said major pendennis dryly and wondering what in goodness name was the company into which he had got mr foker was pleased with the new comer its the man who would sing the malay song at the backkitchen he whispered to pen try this pine sir he then said to colonel altamont its uncommonly fine pines ive seen em feed pigs on pines said the colonel all the nawaub of lucknows pigs are fed on pines strong whispered to major pendennis o of course the major answered sir francis clavering was in the mean while endeavoring to make an excuse to his brother guest for the new comers condition and muttered something regarding altamont that he was an extraordinary character very eccentric veryhad indian habitsdidnt understand the rules of english society to which old welbore a shrewd old gentleman who drank his wine with great regularity said that seemed pretty clear then the colonel seeing pens honest face regarded it for a while with as much steadiness as became his condition and said i know you too young fellow i remember you baymouth ball by jingo wanted to fight the frenchman i remember you and he laughed and he squared with his fists and seemed hugely amused in the drunken depths of his mind as these recollections passed or rather reeled across it mr pendennis you remember colonel altamont at baymouth strong said upon which pen bowing rather stiffly said he had the pleasure of remembering that circumstance perfectly whats his name cried the colonel strong named mr pendennis again pendennispendennis be hanged altamont roared out to the surprise of every one and thumping with his fist on the table my name is also pendennis sir said the major whose dignity was exceedingly mortified by the evenings eventsthat he major pendennis should have been asked to such a party and that a drunken man should have been introduced to it my name is pendennis and i will be obliged to you not to curse it too loudly the tipsy man turned round to look at him and as he looked it appeared as if colonel altamont suddenly grew sober he put his hand across his forehead and in doing so displaced somewhat the black wig which he wore and his eyes stared fiercely at the major who in his turn like a resolute old warrior as he was looked at his opponent very keenly and steadily at the end of the mutual inspection altamont began to button up his brassbuttoned coat and rising up from his chair suddenly and to the companys astonishment reeled toward the door and issued from it followed by strong all that the latter heard him utter was captain beak captain beak by jingo there had not passed above a quarter of an hour from his strange appearance to his equally sudden departure the two young men and the baronets other guest wondered at the scene and could find no explanation for it clavering seemed exceeding pale and agitated and turned with looks of almost terror toward major pendennis the latter had been eying his host keenly for a moment or two do you know him asked sir francis of the major i am sure i have seen the fellow the major replied looking as if he too was puzzled yes i have it he was a deserter from the horse artillery who got into the nawaubs service i remember his face quite well oh said clavering with a sigh which indicated immense relief of mind and the major looked at him with a twinkle of his sharp old eyes the cab which strong had desired to be called drove away with the chevalier and colonel altamont coffee was brought to the remaining gentlemen and they went upstairs to the ladies in the drawingroom foker declaring confidentially to pen that this was the rummest go he ever saw which decision pen said laughing showed great discrimination on mr fokers part then according to her promise miss amory made music for the young men foker was enraptured with her performance and kindly joined in the airs which she sang when he happened to be acquainted with them pen affected to talk aside with others of the party but blanche brought him quickly to the piano by singing some of his own words those which we have given in a previous number indeed and which the sylphide had herself she said set to music i dont know whether the air was hers or how much of it was arranged for her by signor twankidillo from whom she took lessons but good or bad original or otherwise it delighted mr pen who remained by her side and turned the leaves now for her most assiduously gad how i wish i could write verses like you pen foker sighed afterward to his companion if i could do em wouldnt i thats all but i never was a dab at writing you see and im sorry i was so idle when i was at school no mention was made before the ladies of the curious little scene which had been transacted below stairs although pen was just on the point of describing it to miss amory when that young lady inquired for captain strong who she wished should join her in a duet but chancing to look up toward sir francis clavering arthur saw a peculiar expression of alarm in the baronets ordinarily vacuous face and discreetly held his tongue it was rather a dull evening welbore went to sleep as he always did at music and after dinner nor did major pendennis entertain the ladies with copious anecdotes and endless little scandalous stories as his wont was but sat silent for the most part and appeared to be listening to the music and watching the fair young performer the hour of departure having arrived the major rose regretting that so delightful an evening should have passed away so quickly and addressed a particularly fine compliment to miss amory upon her splendid talents as a singer your daughter lady clavering he said to that lady is a perfect nightingalea perfect nightingale begad i have scarcely ever heard any thing equal to her and her pronunciation of every languagebegad of every languageseems to me to be perfect and the best houses in london must open before a young lady who has such talents and allow an old fellow to say miss amory such a face blanche was as much astonished by these compliments as pen was to whom his uncle a little time since had been speaking in very disparaging terms of the sylph the major and the two young men walked home together after mr foker had placed his mother in her carriage and procured a light for an enormous cigar the young gentlemans company or his tobacco did not appear to be agreeable to major pendennis who eyed him askance several times and with a look which plainly indicated that he wished mr foker would take his leave but foker hung on resolutely to the uncle and nephew even until they came to the formers door in burystreet where the major wished the lads goodnight and i say pen he said in a confidential whisper calling his nephew back mind you make a point of calling in grosvenorplace tomorrow theyve been uncommonly civil monsously civil and kind pen promised and wondered and the majors door having been closed upon him by morgan foker took pens arm and walked with him for some time silently puffing his cigar at last when they had reached charing cross on arthurs way home to the temple harry foker relieved himself and broke out with that eulogium upon poetry and those regrets regarding a misspent youth which have just been mentioned and all the way along the strand and up to the door of pens very staircase in lambcourt temple young harry foker did not cease to speak about singing and blanche amory end of
