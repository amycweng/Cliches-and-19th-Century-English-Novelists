chapter of matchmaking exeunt omnes pendennis chapter i relates to mr harry fokers affairs since that fatal but delightful night in grosvenor place mr harry fokers heart had been in such a state of agitation as you would hardly have thought so great a philosopher could endure when we remember what good advice he had given to pen in former days how an early wisdom and knowledge of the world had manifested itself in the gifted youth how a constant course of selfindulgence such as becomes a gentleman of his means and expectations ought by right to have increased his cynicism and made him with every succeeding day of his life care less and less for every individual in the world with the single exception of mr harry foker one may wonder that he should fall into the mishap to which most of us are subject once or twice in our lives and disquiet his great mind about a woman but foker though early wise was still a man he could no more escape the common lot than achilles or ajax or lord nelson or adam our first father and now his time being come young harry became a victim to love the allconqueror when he went to the back kitchen that night after quitting arthur pendennis at his staircasedoor in lambcourt the gintwist and deviled turkey had no charms for him the jokes of his companions fell flatly on his ear and when mr hodgen the singer of the body snatcher had a new chant even more dreadful and humorous than that famous composition foker although he appeared his friend and said bravo hodgen as common politeness and his position as one of the chiefs of the back kitchen bound him to do yet never distinctly heard one word of the song which under its title of the cat in the cupboard hodgen has since rendered so famous late and very tired he slipped into his private apartments at home and sought the downy pillow but his slumbers were disturbed by the fever of his soul and the very instant that he woke from his agitated sleep the image of miss amory presented itself to him and said here i am i am your princess and beauty you have discovered me and shall care for nothing else hereafter heavens how stale and distasteful his former pursuits and friendships appeared to him he had not been up to the present time much accustomed to the society of females of his own rank in life when he spoke of such he called them modest women that virtue which let us hope they possessed had not hitherto compensated to mr foker for the absence of more lively qualities which most of his own relatives did not enjoy and which he found in mesdemoiselles the ladies of the theater his mother though good and tender did not amuse her boy his cousins the daughters of his maternal uncle the respectable earl of rosherville wearied him beyond measure one was blue and a geologist one was a horsewoman and smoked cigars one was exceedingly low church and had the most heterodox views on religious matters at least so the other said who was herself of the very highest church faction and made the cupboard in her room into an oratory and fasted on every friday in the year their paternal house of drummington foker could very seldom be got to visit he swore he had rather go to the treadmill than stay there he was not much beloved by the inhabitants lord erith lord roshervilles heir considered his cousin a low person of deplorably vulgar habits and manners while foker and with equal reason voted erith a prig and a dullard the nightcap of the house of commons the speakers opprobrium the dreariest of philanthropic spouters nor could george robert earl of gravesend and rosherville ever forget that on one evening when he condescended to play at billiards with his nephew that young gentleman poked his lordship in the side with his cue and said well old cock ive seen many a bad stroke in my life but i never saw such a bad one as that there he played the game out with angelic sweetness of temper for harry was his guest as well as his nephew but he was nearly having a fit in the night and he kept to his own rooms until young harry quitted drummington on his return to oxbridge where the interesting youth was finishing his education at the time when the occurrence took place it was an awful blow to the venerable earl the circumstance was never alluded to in the family he shunned foker whenever he came to see them in london or in the country and could hardly be brought to gasp out a how dye do to the young blasphemer but he would not break his sister agness heart by banishing harry from the family altogether nor indeed could he afford to break with mr foker senior between whom and his lordship there had been many private transactions producing an exchange of bank checks from mr foker and autographs from the earl himself with the letters i o u written over his illustrious signature illustration besides the four daughters of lord gravesend whose various qualities have been enumerated in the former paragraph his lordship was blessed with a fifth girl the lady ann milton who from her earliest years and nursery had been destined to a peculiar position in life it was ordained between her parents and her aunt that when mr harry foker attained a proper age lady ann should become his wife the idea had been familiar to her mind when she yet wore pinafores and when harry the dirtiest of little boys used to come back with black eyes from school to drummington or to his fathers house of logwood where lady ann lived much with her aunt both of the young people coincided with the arrangement proposed by the elders without any protests or difficulty it no more entered lady anns mind to question the order of her father than it would have entered esthers to dispute the commands of ahasuerus the heirapparent of the house of foker was also obedient for when the old gentleman said harry your uncle and i have agreed that when youre of a proper age youll marry lady ann she wont have any money but shes good blood and a good one to look at and i shall make you comfortable if you refuse youll have your mothers jointure and two hundred a year during my life harry who knew that his sire though a man of few words was yet implicitly to be trusted acquiesced at once in the parental decree and said well sir if anns agreeable i say ditto shes not a badlooking girl and she has the best blood in england sir your mothers blood your own blood sir said the brewer theres nothing like it sir well sir as you like it harry replied when you want me please ring the bell only theres no hurry and i hope youll give us a long day i should like to have my fling out before i marry fling away harry answered the benevolent father nobody prevents you do they and so very little more was said upon this subject and mr harry pursued those amusements in life which suited him best and hung up a little picture of his cousin in his sittingroom amidst the french prints the favorite actresses and dancers the racing and coaching works of art which suited his taste and formed his gallery it was an insignificant little picture representing a simple round face with ringlets and it made as it must be confessed a very poor figure by the side of mademoiselle petitot dancing over a rainbow or mademoiselle redowa grinning in red boots and a lancers cap being engaged and disposed of lady ann milton did not go out so much in the world as her sisters and often stayed at home in london at the parental house in gauntsquare when her mamma with the other ladies went abroad they talked and they danced with one man after another and the men came and went and the stories about them were various but there was only this one story about ann she was engaged to harry foker she never was to think about any body else it was not a very amusing story well the instant foker awoke on the day after lady claverings dinner there was blanches image glaring upon him with its clear gray eyes and winning smile there was her tune ringing in his ears yet round about the spot ofttimes i hover ofttimes i hover which poor foker began piteously to hum as he sat up in his bed under the crimson silken coverlet opposite him was a french print of a turkish lady and her greek lover surprised by a venerable ottoman the ladys husband on the other wall was a french print of a gentleman and lady riding and kissing each other at the full gallop all round the chaste bedroom were more french prints either portraits of gauzy nymphs of the opera or lovely illustrations of the novels or mayhap an english chefdoeuvre or two in which miss calverley of t r e o would be represented in tight pantaloons in her favorite page part or miss rougemont as venus their value enhanced by the signatures of these ladies maria calverley or frederica rougemont inscribed underneath the prints in an exquisite facsimile such were the pictures in which honest harry delighted he was no worse than many of his neighbors he was an idle jovial kindly fast man about town and if his rooms were rather profusely decorated with works of french art so that simple lady agnes his mamma on entering the apartments where her darling sate enveloped in fragrant clouds of latakia was often bewildered by the novelties which she beheld there why it must be remembered that he was richer than most young men and could better afford to gratify his taste a letter from miss calverley written in a very degage style of spelling and handwriting scrawling freely over the filigree paper and commencing by calling mr harry her dear hokeypokeyfokey lay on his bed table by his side amid keys sovereigns cigarcases and a bit of verbena which miss amory had given him and reminding him of the arrival of the day when he was to stand that dinner at the elefant and castle at richmond which he had promised a card for a private box at miss rougemonts approaching benefit a bundle of tickets for ben budgeons night the north lancashire pippin at martin faunces the threecorned hat in st martins lane where conkey sam dick the nailor and deadman the worcestershire nobber would put on the gloves and the lovers of the good old british sport were invited to attendthese and sundry other memoirs of mr fokers pursuits and pleasures lay on the table by his side when he woke ah how faint all these pleasures seemed now what did he care for conkey sam or the worcestershire nobber what for the french prints ogling him from all sides of the room those regular stunning slapup outandouters and calverley spelling bad and calling him hokeyfokey confound her impudence the idea of being engaged to a dinner at the elephant and castle at richmond with that old woman who was seven and thirty years old if she was a day filled his mind with dreary disgust now instead of that pleasure which he had only yesterday expected to find from the entertainment when his fond mamma beheld her boy that morning she remarked on the pallor of his cheek and the general gloom of his aspect why do you go on playing billiards at that wicked spratts lady agnes asked my dearest child those billiards will kill you im sure they will it isnt the billiards harry said gloomily then its the dreadful back kitchen said the lady agnes ive often thought dyou know harry of writing to the landlady and begging that she would have the kindness to put only very little wine in the negus which you take and see that you have your shawl on before you get into your brougham do maam mrs cutts is a most kind motherly woman harry said but it isnt the back kitchen neither he added with a ghastly sigh as lady agnes never denied her son any thing and fell into all his ways with the fondest acquiescence she was rewarded by a perfect confidence on young harrys part who never thought to disguise from her a knowledge of the haunts which he frequented and on the contrary brought her home choice anecdotes from the clubs and billiardrooms which the simple lady relished if she did not understand my son goes to spratts she would say to her confidential friends all the young men go to spratts after their balls it is de rigeur my dear and they play billiards as they used to play macao and hazard in mr foxs time yes my dear father often told me that they sate up always until nine oclock the next morning with mr fox at brookss whom i remember at drummington when i was a little girl in a buff waistcoat and black satin small clothes my brother erith never played as a young man nor sate up latehe had no health for it but my boy must do as every body does you know yes and then he often goes to a place called the back kitchen frequented by all the wits and authors you know whom one does not see in society but whom it is a great privilege and pleasure for harry to meet and there he hears the questions of the day discussed and my dear father often said that it was our duty to encourage literature and he had hoped to see the late dr johnson at drummington only dr johnson died yes and mr sheridan came over and drank a great deal of wineevery body drank a great deal of wine in those daysand papas winemerchants bill was ten times as much as eriths is who gets it as he wants it from fortnum and masons and doesnt keep any stock at all that was an uncommon good dinner we had yesterday maam the artful harry broke out their clear soups better than ours moufflet will put too much taragon into every thing the supreme de volaille was very gooduncommon and the sweets were better than moufflets sweets did you taste the plombiere maam and the maraschino jelly stunningly good that maraschino jelly lady agnes expressed her agreement in these as in almost all other sentiments of her son who continued the artful conversation saying very handsome house that of the claverings furniture i should say got up regardless of expense magnificent display of plate maam the lady assented to all these propositions very nice people the claverings hem said lady agnes i know what you mean lady c aint distangy exactly but she is very goodnatured o very mamma said who was herself one of the most goodnatured of women and sir francis he dont talk much before ladies but after dinner he comes out uncommon strong maama highly agreeable wellinformed man when will you ask them to dinner look out for an early day maam and looking into lady agness pocketbook he chose a day only a fortnight hence an age that fortnight seemed to the young gentleman when the claverings were to be invited to grosvenorstreet the obedient lady agnes wrote the required invitation she was accustomed to do so without consulting her husband who had his own society and habits and who left his wife to see her own friends alone harry looked at the card but there was an omission in the invitation which did not please him you have not asked miss whatdyecallemmiss emery lady claverings daughter o that little creature lady agnes cried no i think not harry we must ask miss amory foker said ii want to ask pendennis and hes very sweet upon her dont you think she sings very well maam i thought her rather forward and didnt listen to her singing she only sang at you and mr pendennis it seemed to me but i will ask her if you wish harry and so miss amorys name was written on the card with her mothers this piece of diplomacy being triumphantly executed harry embraced his fond parent with the utmost affection and retired to his own apartments where he stretched himself on his ottoman and lay brooding silently sighing for the day which was to bring the fair miss amory under his paternal roof and devising a hundred wild schemes for meeting her on his return from making the grand tour mr foker junior had brought with him a polyglot valet who took the place of stoopid and condescended to wait at dinner attired in shirt fronts of worked muslin with many gold studs and chains upon his master and the elders of the family this man who was of no particular country and spoke all languages indifferently ill made himself useful to mr harry in a variety of waysread all the artless youths correspondence knew his favorite haunts and the addresses of his acquaintance and officiated at the private dinners which the young gentleman gave as harry lay upon his sofa after his interview with his mamma robed in a wonderful dressinggown and puffing his pipe in gloomy silence anatole too must have remarked that something affected his masters spirits though he did not betray any illbred sympathy with harrys agitation of mind when harry began to dress himself in his outofdoor morning costume he was very hard indeed to please and particularly severe and snappish about his toilet he tried and cursed pantaloons of many different stripes checks and colors all the boots were villainously varnished the shirts too loud in pattern he scented his linen and person with peculiar richness this day and what must have been the valets astonishment when after some blushing and hesitation on harrys part the young gentleman asked i say anatole when i engaged you didnt youhemdidnt you say that you could dresshemdress hair the valet said yes he could cherchy alors une paire de tongsetcurly moi un pew mr foker said in an easy manner and the valet wondering whether his master was in love or was going masquerading went in search of the articlesfirst from the old butler who waited upon mr foker senior on whose bald pate the tongs would have scarcely found a hundred hairs to seize and finally of the lady who had the charge of the meek auburn fronts of the lady agnes and the tongs being got monsieur anatole twisted his young masters locks until he had made harrys head as curly as a negros after which the youth dressed himself with the utmost care and splendor and proceeded to sally out at what time sall i order de drag sir to be to miss calverleys door sir the attendant whispered as his master was going forth confound her put the dinner offi cant go said foker no hang iti must go poyntz and rougemont and ever so many more are coming the drag at pelham corner at six oclock anatole the drag was not one of mr fokers own equipages but was hired from a livery stable for festive purposes foker however put his own carriage into requisition that morning and for what purpose does the kind reader suppose why to drive down to lambcourt temple taking grosvenorplace by the way which lies in the exact direction of the temple from grosvenorstreet as every body knows where he just had the pleasure of peeping upward at miss amorys pink window curtains having achieved which satisfactory feat he drove off to pens chambers why did he want to see his dear friend pen so much why did he yearn and long after him and did it seem necessary to fokers very existence that he should see pen that morning having parted with him in perfect health on the night previous pen had lived two years in london and foker had not paid half a dozen visits to his chambers what sent him thither now in such a hurry whatif any young ladies read this page i have only to inform them that when the same mishap befalls them which now had for more than twelve hours befallen harry foker people will grow interesting to them for whom they did not care sixpence on the day before as on the other hand persons of whom they fancied themselves fond will be found to have become insipid and disagreeable then your dearest eliza or maria of the other day to whom you wrote letters and sent locks of hair yards long will on a sudden be as indifferent to you as your stupidest relation while on the contrary about his relations you will begin to feel such a warm interest such a loving desire to ingratiate yourself with his mamma such a liking for that dear kind old man his father if he is in the habit of visiting at any house what advances you will make in order to visit there too if he has a married sister you will like to spend long mornings with her you will fatigue your servant by sending notes to her for which there will be the most pressing occasion twice or thrice in a day you will cry if your mamma objects to your going too often to see his family the only one of them you will dislike is perhaps his younger brother who is at home for the holidays and who will persist in staying in the room when you come to see your dear newfound friend his darling second sister something like this will happen to you young ladies or at any rate let us hope it may yes you must go through the hot fits and the cold fits of that pretty fever your mothers if they would acknowledge it have passed through it before you were born your dear papa being the object of the passion of coursewho could it be but he and as you suffer it so will your brothers in their wayand after their kind more selfish than you more eager and headstrong than you they will rush on their destiny when the doomed charmer makes her appearance or if they dont and you dont heaven help you as the gambler said of his dice to love and win is the best thing to love and lose is the next best you dont die of the complaint or very few do the generous wounded heart suffers and survives it and he is not a man or she a woman who is not conquered by it or who does not conquer it in his time now then if you ask why henry foker esquire was in such a hurry to see arthur pendennis and felt such a sudden value and esteem for him there is no difficulty in saying it was because pen had become really valuable in mr fokers eyes because if pen was not the rose he yet had been near that fragrant flower of love was not he in the habit of going to her house in london did he not live near her in the countryknow all about the enchantress what i wonder would lady ann milton mr fokers cousin and pretendue have said if her ladyship had known all that was going on in the bosom of that funny little gentleman alas when foker reached lambcourt leaving his carriage for the admiration of the little clerks who were lounging in the archway that leads thence into flagcourt which leads into upper templelane warrington was in the chambers but pen was absent pen was gone to the printingoffice to see his proofs would foker have a pipe and should the laundress go to the cock and get him some beer warrington asked remarking with a pleased surprise the splendid toilet of this scented and shinybooted young aristocrat but foker had not the slightest wish for beer or tobacco he had very important business he rushed away to the pallmall gazette office still bent upon finding pen pen had quitted that place foker wanted him that they might go together to call upon lady clavering foker went away disconsolate and whiled away an hour or two vaguely at clubs and when it was time to pay a visit he thought it would be but decent and polite to drive to grosvenorplace and leave a card upon lady clavering he had not the courage to ask to see her when the door was opened he only delivered two cards with mr henry foker engraved upon them to jeames in a speechless agony jeames received the tickets bowing his powdered head the varnished doors closed upon him the beloved object was as far as ever from him though so near he thought he heard the tones of a piano and of a siren singing coming from the drawingroom and sweeping over the balconyshrubbery of geraniums he would have liked to stop and listen but it might not be drive to tattersalls he said to the groom in a voice smothered with emotionand bring my pony round he added as the man drove rapidly away as good luck would have it that splendid barouche of lady claverings which has been inadequately described in a former chapter drove up to her ladyships door just as foker mounted the pony which was in waiting for him he bestrode the fiery animal and dodged about the arch of the green park keeping the carriage well in view until he saw lady clavering enter and with herwhose could be that angel form but the enchantresss clad in a sort of gossamer with a pink bonnet and a lightblue parasolbut miss amory the carriage took its fair owners to madame rigodons cap and lace shop to mrs wolseys berlin worsted shopwho knows to what other resorts of female commerce then it went and took ices at hunters for lady clavering was somewhat florid in her tastes and amusements and not only liked to go abroad in the most showy carriage in london but that the public should see her in it too and so in a white bonnet with a yellow feather she ate a large pink ice in the sunshine before hunters door till foker on his pony and the red jacket who accompanied him were almost tired of dodging then at last she made her way into the park and the rapid foker made his dash forward what to do just to get a nod of recognition from miss amory and her mother to cross them a halfdozen times in the drive to watch and ogle them from the other side of the ditch where the horsemen assemble when the band plays in kensington gardens what is the use of looking at a woman in a pink bonnet across a ditch what is the earthly good to be got out of a nod of the head strange that men will be contented with such pleasures or if not contented at least that they will be so eager in seeking them not one word did harry he so fluent of conversation ordinarily change with his charmer on that day mutely he beheld her return to her carriage and drive away among rather ironical salutes from the young men in the park one said that the indian widow was making the paternal rupees spin rapidly another said that she ought to have burned herself alive and left the money to her daughter this one asked who clavering wasand old tom eales who knew every body and never missed a day in the park on his gray cob kindly said that clavering had come into an estate over head and heels in mortgage that there were devlish ugly stories about him when he was a young man and that it was reported of him that he had a share in a gambling house and had certainly shown the white feather in his regiment he plays still he is in a hell every night almost mr eales added i should think so since his marriage said a wag he gives devilish good dinners said foker striking up for the honor of his host of yesterday i daresay and i daresay he doesnt ask eales the wag said i say eales do you dine at claveringsat the begums i dine there said mr eales who would have dined with beelzebub if sure of a good cook and when he came away would have painted his host blacker than fate had made him you might you know although you do abuse him so continued the wag they say its very pleasant clavering goes to sleep after dinner the begum gets tipsy with cherrybrandy and the young lady sings songs to the young gentlemen she sings well dont she fo slap up said fo i tell you what poyntz she sings like a whatdyecallumyou know what i meanlike a mermaid you know but thats not their name i never heard a mermaid sing mr poyntz the wag replied who ever heard a mermaid eales you are an old fellow did you dont make a lark of me hang it poyntz said foker turning red and with tears almost in his eyes you know what i mean its those whatshisnamesin homer you know i never said i was a good scholar and nobody ever said it of you my boy mr poyntz remarked and foker striking spurs into his pony cantered away down rotten row his mind agitated with various emotions ambitions mortifications he was sorry that he had not been good at his books in early lifethat he might have cut out all those chaps who were about her and who talked the languages and wrote poetry and painted pictures in her album andand that what am i thought little foker compared to her shes all soul she is and can write poetry or compose music as easy as i could drink a glass of beer beerdamme thats all im fit for is beer i am a poor ignorant little beggar good for nothing but fokers entire i misspent my youth and used to get the chaps to do my exercises and whats the consequences now o harry foker what a confounded little fool you have been as he made this dreary soliloquy he had cantered out of rotten row into the park and there was on the point of riding down a large old roomy family carriage of which he took no heed when a cheery voice cried out harry harry and looking up he beheld his aunt the lady rosherville and two of her daughters of whom the one who spoke was harrys betrothed the lady ann he started back with a pale scared look as a truth about which he had not thought during the whole day came across him there was his fate there in the back seat of that carriage what is the matter harry why are you so pale you have been raking and smoking too much you wicked boy said lady ann foker said how do aunt how do ann in a perturbed mannermuttered something about a pressing engagementindeed he saw by the park clock that he must have been keeping his party in the drag waiting for nearly an hourand waved a goodby the little man and the little pony were out of sight in an instantthe great carriage rolled away nobody inside was very much interested about his coming or going the countess being occupied with her spaniel the lady lucys thoughts and eyes being turned upon a volume of sermons and those of lady ann upon a new novel which the sisters had just procured from the library chapter ii carries the reader both to richmond and greenwich illustration poor foker found the dinner at richmond to be the most dreary entertainment upon which ever mortal man wasted his guineas i wonder how the deuce i could ever have liked these people he thought in his own mind why i can see the crowsfeet under rougemonts eyes and the paint on her cheeks is laid on as thick as clowns in a pantomime the way in which that calverley talks slang is quite disgusting i hate chaff in a woman and old colchicum that old col coming down here in his brougham with his coronet on it and sitting bodkin between mademoiselle coralie and her mother its too bad an english peer and a horserider of franconis it wont do by jove it wont do i aint proud but it will not do twopencehalfpenny for your thoughts fokey cried out miss rougemont taking her cigar from her truly vermilion lips as she beheld the young fellow lost in thought seated at the head of his table amidst melting ices and cut pineapples and bottles full and empty and cigarashes scattered on fruit and the ruins of a dessert which had no pleasure for him does foker ever think drawled out mr poyntz foker here is a considerable sum of money offered by a fair capitalist at this end of the table for the present emanations of your valuable and acute intellect old boy what the deuce is that poyntz a talking about mrs calverley asked of her neighbor i hate him hes a drawlin sneerin beast what a droll of a little man is that little fokare my lor mademoiselle coralie said in her own language and with the rich twang of that sunny gascony in which her swarthy cheeks and bright black eyes had got their fire what a droll of a man he does not look to have twenty years i wish i were of his age said the venerable colchicum with a sigh as he inclined his purple face toward a large goblet of claret cte jeunesse peuh je men fiche said madame brack coralies mamma taking a great pinch out of lord colchicums delicate gold snuffbox je naime que les hommes faits moi comme milor coralie nest ce pas que tu naimes que les hommes faits ma bichette my lord said with a grin you flatter me madame brack taisez vous maman vous netes quune bete coralie cried with a shrug of her robust shoulders upon which my lord said that she did not flatter at any rate and pocketed his snuffbox not desirous that madame bracks dubious fingers should plunge too frequently into his mackabaw there is no need to give a prolonged detail of the animated conversation which ensued during the rest of the banquet a conversation which would not much edify the reader and it is scarcely necessary to say that all ladies of the corps de danse are not like miss calverley any more than that all peers resemble that illustrious member of their order the late lamented viscount colchicum but there have been such in our memories who have loved the society of riotous youth better than the company of men of their own age and rank and have given the young ones the precious benefit of their experience and example and there have been very respectable men too who have not objected so much to the kind of entertainment as to the publicity of it i am sure for instance that our friend major pendennis would have made no sort of objection to join a party of pleasure provided that it were en petit comite and that such men as my lord steyne and my lord colchicum were of the society give the young men their pleasures this worthy guardian said to pen more than once im not one of your straightlaced moralists but an old man of the world begad and i know that as long as it lasts young men will be young men and there were some young men to whom this estimable philosopher accorded about seventy years as the proper period for sowing their wild oats but they were men of fashion mr foker drove his lovely guests home to brompton in the drag that night but he was quite thoughtful and gloomy during the whole of the little journey from richmond neither listening to the jokes of the friends behind him and on the box by his side nor enlivening them as was his wont by his own facetious sallies and when the ladies whom he had conveyed alighted at the door of their house and asked then accomplished coachman whether he would not step in and take some thing to drink he declined with so melancholy an air that they supposed that the governor and he had had a difference or that some calamity had befallen him and he did not tell these people what the cause of his grief was but left mesdames rougemont and calverley unheeding the cries of the latter who hung over her balcony like jezebel and called out to him to ask him to give another party soon he sent the drag home under the guidance of one of the grooms and went on foot himself his hands in his pockets plunged in thought the stars and moon shining tranquilly over head looked down upon mr foker that night as he in his turn sentimentally regarded them and he went and gazed upward at the house in grosvenorplace and at the windows which he supposed to be those of the beloved object and he moaned and he sighed in a way piteous and surprising to witness which policeman x did who informed sir francis claverings people as they took the refreshment of beer on the coachbox at the neighboring publichouse after bringing home their lady from the french play that there had been another chap hanging about the premises that eveninga little chap dressed like a swell and now with that perspicuity and ingenuity and enterprise which only belongs to a certain passion mr foker began to dodge miss amory through london and to appear wherever he could meet her if lady clavering went to the french play where her ladyship had a box mr foker whose knowledge of the language as we have heard was not conspicuous appeared in a stall he found out where her engagements were it is possible that anatole his man was acquainted with sir francis claverings gentleman and so got a sight of her ladyships engagementbook and at many of these evening parties mr foker made his appearance to the surprise of the world and of his mother especially whom he ordered to apply for cards to these parties for which until now he had shown a supreme contempt he told the pleased and unsuspicious lady that he went to parties because it was right for him to see the world he told her that he went to the french play because he wanted to perfect himself in the language and there was no such good lesson as a comedy or vaudevilleand when one night the astonished lady agnes saw him stand up and dance and complimented him upon his elegance and activity the mendacious little rogue asserted that he had learned to dance in paris whereas anatole knew that his young master used to go off privily to an academy in brewerstreet and study there for some hours in the morning the casino of our modern days was not invented or was in its infancy as yet and gentlemen of mr fokers time had not the facilities of acquiring the science of dancing which are enjoyed by our present youth old pendennis seldom missed going to church he considered it to be his duty as a gentleman to patronize the institution of public worship and that it was quite a correct thing to be seen in church of a sunday one day it chanced that he and arthur went thither together the latter who was now in high favor had been to breakfast with his uncle from whose lodging they walked across the park to a church not far from belgravesquare there was a charity sermon at saint jamess as the major knew by the bills posted on the pillars of his parish church which probably caused him for he was a thrifty man to forsake it for that day besides he had other views for himself and pen we will go to church sir across the park and then begad we will go to the claverings house and ask them for lunch in a friendly way lady clavering likes to be asked for lunch and is uncommonly kind and monstrous hospitable i met them at dinner last week at lady agnes fokers sir pen said and the begum was very kind indeed so she was in the country so she is every where but i share your opinion about miss amory one of your opinions that is uncle for you were changing the last time we spoke about her and what do you think of her now the elder said i think her the most confounded little flirt in london pen answered laughing she made a tremendous assault upon harry foker who sat next to her and to whom she gave all the talk though i took her down bah henry foker is engaged to his cousin all the world knows it not a bad coup of lady roshervilles that i should say that the young man at his fathers death and old mr fokers lifes devilish bad you know he had a fit at arthurs last year i should say that young foker wont have less than fourteen thousand a year from the brewery besides logwood and the norfolk property ive no pride about me pen i like a man of birth certainly but dammy i like a brewery which brings in a man fourteen thousand a year hey pen ha ha thats the sort of man for me and i recommend you now that you are lanced in the world to stick to fellows of that sort to fellows who have a stake in the country begad foker sticks to me sir arthur answered he has been at our chambers several times lately he has asked me to dinner we are almost as great friends as we used to be in our youth and his talk is about blanche amory from morning till night im sure hes sweet upon her im sure he is engaged to his cousin and that they will keep the young man to his bargain said the major the marriages in these families are affairs of state lady agnes was made to marry old foker by the late lord although she was notoriously partial to her cousin who was killed at albuera afterward and who saved her life out of the lake at drummington i remember lady agnes sir an exceedingly fine woman but what did she do of course she married her fathers man why mr foker sate for drummington till the reform bill and paid devlish well for his seat too and you may depend upon this sir that foker senior who is a parvenu and loves a great man as all parvenus do has ambitious views for his son as well as himself and that your friend harry must do as his father bids him lord bless you ive known a hundred cases of love in young men and women hey master arthur do you take me they kick sir they resist they make a deuce of a riot and that sort of thing but they end by listening to reason begad blanche is a dangerous girl sir pen said i was smitten with her myself once and very far gone too he added but that is years ago were you how far did it go did she return it asked the major looking hard at pen pen with a laugh said that at one time he did think he was pretty well in miss amorys good graces but my mother did not like her and the affair went off pen did not think it fit to tell his uncle all the particulars of that courtship which had passed between himself and the young lady a man might go farther and fare worse arthur the major said still looking queerly at his nephew her birth sir her father was the mate of a ship they say and she has not money enough objected pen in a dandyfied manner whats ten thousand pound and a girl bred up like her you use my own words and it is all very well but i tell you in confidence penin strict honor mindthat its my belief she has a devilish deal more than ten thousand pound and from what i saw of her the other day andand have heard of heri should say she was a devilish accomplished clever girl and would make a good wife with a sensible husband how do you know about her money pen asked smiling you seem to have information about every body and to know about all the town i do know a few things sir and i dont tell all i know mark that the uncle replied and as for that charming miss amoryfor charming begad she isif i saw her mrs arthur pendennis i should neither be sorry nor surprised begad and if you object to ten thousand pound what would you say sir to thirty or forty or fifty and the major looked still more knowingly and still harder at pen well sir he said to his godfather and namesake make her mrs arthur pendennis you can do it as well as i psha you are laughing at me sir the other replied rather peevishly and you ought not to laugh so near a church gate here we are at st benedicts they say mr oriel is a beautiful preacher indeed the bells were tolling the people were trooping into the handsome church the carriages of the inhabitants of the lordly quarter poured forth their pretty loads of devotees in whose company pen and his uncle ending their edifying conversation entered the fane i do not know whether other people carry their worldly affairs to the church door arthur who from habitual reverence and feeling was always more than respectful in a place of worship thought of the incongruity of their talk perhaps while the old gentleman at his side was utterly unconscious of any such contrast his hat was brushed his wig was trim his neckcloth was perfectly tied he looked at every soul in the congregation it is true the bald heads and the bonnets the flowers and the feathers but so demurely that he hardly lifted up his eyes from his bookfrom his book which he could not read without glasses as for pens gravity it was sorely put to the test when upon looking by chance toward the seats where the servants were collected he spied out by the side of a demure gentleman in plush henry foker esquire who had discovered this place of devotion following the direction of harrys eye which strayed a good deal from his book pen found that it alighted upon a yellow bonnet and a pink one and that these bonnets were on the heads of lady clavering and blanche amory if pens uncle is not the only man who has talked about his worldly affairs up to the church door is poor harry foker the only one who has brought his worldly love into the aisle illustration when the congregation issued forth at the conclusion of the service foker was out among the first but pen came up with him presently as he was hankering about the entrance which he was unwilling to leave until my ladys barouche with the bewigged coachman had borne away its mistress and her daughter from their devotions when the two ladies came out they found together the pendennises uncle and nephew and harry foker esquire sucking the crook of his stick standing there in the sunshine to see and to ask to eat were simultaneous with the goodnatured begum and she invited the three gentlemen to luncheon straightway blanche was too particularly gracious o do come she said to arthur if you are not too great a man i want so to talk to you aboutbut we mustnt say what here you know what would mr oriel say and the young devotee jumped into the carriage after her mamma ive read every word of it its adorable she added still addressing herself to pen i know who is said mr arthur making rather a pert bow whats the row about asked mr foker rather puzzled i suppose miss amory means walter lorraine said the major looking knowing and nodding at pen i suppose so sir there was a famous review in the pall mall this morning it was warringtons doing though and i must not be too proud a review in pall mallwalter lorraine what the doose do you mean foker asked walter lorraine died of the measles poor little beggar when we were at gray friars i remember his mother coming up you are not a literary man foker pen said laughing and hooking his arm into his friends you must know i have been writing a novel and some of the papers have spoken very well of it perhaps you dont read the sunday papers i read bells life regular old boy mr foker answered at which pen laughed again and the three gentlemen proceeded in great goodhumor to lady claverings house the subject of the novel was resumed after luncheon by miss amory who indeed loved poets and men of letters if she loved any thing and was sincerely an artist in feeling some of the passages in the book made me cry positively they did she said pen said with some fatuity i am happy to think i have a part of vos larmes miss blancheand the major who had not read more than six pages of pens book put on his sanctified look saying yes there are some passages quite affecting monsous affecting ando if it makes you crylady amory declared she would not read it that she wouldnt dont mamma blanche said with a french shrug of her shoulders and then she fell into a rhapsody about the book about the snatches of poetry interspersed in it about the two heroines leonora and neaera about the two heroes walter lorraine and his rival the young dukeand what good company you introduce us to said the young lady archly quel ton how much of your life have you passed at court and are you a prime ministers son mr arthur pen began to laughit is as cheap for a novelist to create a duke as to make a baronet he said shall i tell you a secret miss amory i promoted all my characters at the request of the publisher the young duke was only a young baron when the novel was first written his false friend the viscount was a simple commoner and so on with all the characters of the story what a wicked satirical pert young man you have become comme vous voila forme said the young lady how different from arthur pendennis of the country ah i think i like arthur pendennis of the country best though and she gave him the full benefit of her eyesboth of the fond appealing glance into his own and of the modest look downward toward the carpet which showed off her dark eyelids and long fringed lashes pen of course protested that he had not changed in the least to which the young lady replied by a tender sigh and thinking that she had done quite enough to make arthur happy or miserable as the case might be she proceeded to cajole his companion mr harry foker who during the literary conversation had sate silently imbibing the head of his cane and wishing that he was a clever chap like that pen if the major thought that by telling miss amory of mr fokers engagement to his cousin lady ann milton which information the old gentleman neatly conveyed to the girl as he sate by her side at luncheon below stairsif we say the major thought that the knowledge of this fact would prevent blanche from paying any further attention to the young heir of fokers entire he was entirely mistaken she became only the more gracious to foker she praised him and every thing belonging to him she praised his mamma she praised the pony which he rode in the park she praised the lovely breloques or gimcracks which the young gentleman wore at his watchchain and that dear little darling of a cane and those dear little delicious monkeys heads with ruby eyes which ornamented harrys shirt and formed the buttons of his waistcoat and then having praised and coaxed the weak youth until he blushed and tingled with pleasure and until pen thought she really had gone quite far enough she took another theme i am afraid mr foker is a very sad young man she said turning round to pen he does not look so pen answered with a sneer i mean we have heard sad stories about him havent we mamma what was mr poyntz saying here the other day about that party at richmond o you naughty creature but here seeing that harrys countenance assumed a great expression of alarm while pens wore a look of amusement she turned to the latter and said i believe you are just as bad i believe you would have liked to have been therewouldnt you i know you would yesand so should i lor blanche mamma cried well i would i never saw an actress in my life i would give any thing to know one for i adore talent and i adore richmond that i do and i adore greenwich and i say i should like to go there why should not we three bachelors the major here broke out gallantly and to his nephews special surprise beg these ladies to honor us with their company at greenwich is lady clavering to go on forever being hospitable to us and may we make no return speak for yourselves young meneh begad here is my nephew with his pockets full of moneyhis pockets full begad and mr henry foker who as i have heard say is pretty well to do in the world how is your lovely cousin lady ann mr fokerhere are these two young onesand they allow an old fellow like me to speak lady clavering will you do me the favor to be my guest and miss blanche shall be arthurs if she will be so good o delightful cried blanche i like a bit of fun too said lady clavering and we will take some day when sir francis when sir francis dines outyes mamma the daughter said it will be charming and a charming day it was the dinner was ordered at greenwich and foker though he did not invite miss amory had some delicious opportunities of conversation with her during the repast and afterward on the balcony of their room at the hotel and again during the drive home in her ladyships barouche pen came down with his uncle in sir hugh trumpingtons brougham which the major borrowed for the occasion i am an old soldier begad he said and i learned in early life to make myself comfortable and being an old soldier he allowed the two young men to pay for the dinner between them and all the way home in the brougham he rallied pen about miss amorys evident partiality for him praised her good looks spirits and wit and again told pen in the strictest confidence that she would be a devilish deal richer than people thought chapter iii contains a novel incident illustration some account has been given in a former part of this story how mr pen during his residence at home after his defeat at oxbridge had occupied himself with various literary compositions and among other works had written the greater part of a novel this book written under the influence of his youthful embarrassments amatory and pecuniary was of a very fierce gloomy and passionate sortthe byronic despair the wertherian despondency the mocking bitterness of mephistopheles of faust were all reproduced and developed in the character of the hero for our youth had just been learning the german language and imitated as almost all clever lads do his favorite poets and writers passages in the volumes once so loved and now read so seldom still bear the mark of the pencil with which he noted them in those days tears fell upon the leaf of the book perhaps or blistered the pages of his manuscript as the passionate young man dashed his thoughts down if he took up the books afterward he had no ability or wish to sprinkle the leaves with that early dew of former times his pencil was no longer eager to score its marks of approval but as he looked over the pages of his manuscript he remembered what had been the overflowing feelings which had caused him to blot it and the pain which had inspired the line if the secret history of books could be written and the authors private thoughts and meanings noted down alongside of his story how many insipid volumes would become interesting and dull tales excite the reader many a bitter smile passed over pens face as he read his novel and recalled the time and feelings which gave it birth how pompous some of the grand passages appeared and how weak others were in which he thought he had expressed his full heart this page was imitated from a then favorite author as he could now clearly see and confess though he had believed himself to be writing originally then as he mused over certain lines he recollected the place and hour where he wrote them the ghost of the dead feeling came back as he mused and he blushed to review the faint image and what meant those blots on the page as you come in the desert to a ground where camels hoofs are marked in the clay and traces of withered herbage are yet visible you know that water was there once so the place in pens mind was no longer green and the fons lacrymarum was dried up he used this simile one morning to warrington as the latter sate over his pipe and book and pen with much gesticulation according to his wont when excited and with a bitter laugh thumped his manuscript down on the table making the teathings rattle and the blue milk dance in the jug on the previous night he had taken the manuscript out of a long neglected chest containing old shooting jackets old oxbridge scribbling books his old surplice and battered cap and gown and other memorials of youth school and home he read in the volume in bed until he fell asleep for the commencement of the tale was somewhat dull and he had come home tired from a london evening party by jove said pen thumping down his papers when i think that these were written but very few years ago i am ashamed of my memory i wrote this when i believed myself to be eternally in love with that little coquette miss amory i used to carry down verses to her and put them into the hollow of a tree and dedicate them amori that was a sweet little play upon words warrington remarked with a puff amoryamori it showed profound scholarship let us hear a bit of the rubbish and he stretched over from his easy chair and caught hold of pens manuscript with the firetongs which he was just using in order to put a coal into his pipe thus in possession of the volume he began to read out from the leaves from the lifebook of walter lorraine false as thou art beautiful heartless as thou art fair mockery of passion walter cried addressing leonora what evil spirit hath sent thee to torture me so o leonora cut that part cried out pen making a dash at the book which however his comrade would not release well dont read it out at any rate thats about my other flame my firstlady mirabel that is now i saw her last night at lady whistons she asked me to a party at her house and said that as old friends we ought to meet oftener she has been seeing me any time these two years in town and never thought of inviting me before but seeing wenham talking to me and monsieur dubois the french literary man who had a dozen orders on and might have passed for a marshal of france she condescended to invite me the claverings are to be there on the same evening wont it be exciting to meet ones two flames at the same table two flamestwo heaps of burntout cinders warrington said are both the beauties in this book both or something like them pen said leonora who marries the duke is the fotheringay i drew the duke from magnus charters with whom i was at oxbridge its a little like him and miss amory is neaera by gad warrington i did love that first woman i thought of her as i walked home from lady whistons in the moonlight and the whole early scenes came back to me as if they had been yesterday and when i got home i pulled out the story which i wrote about her and the other three years ago do you know outrageous as it is it has some good stuff in it and if bungay wont publish it i think bacon will thats the way of poets said warrington they fall in love jilt or are jilted they suffer and they cry out that they suffer more than any other mortals and when they have experienced feelings enough they note them down in a book and take the book to market all poets are humbugs all literary men are humbugs directly a man begins to sell his feelings for money hes a humbug if a poet gets a pain in his side from too good a dinner he bellows ai ai louder than prometheus i suppose a poet has greater sensibility than another man said pen with some spirit that is what makes him a poet i suppose that he sees and feels more keenly it is that which makes him speak of what he feels and sees you speak eagerly enough in your leading articles when you espy a false argument in an opponent or detect a quack in the house paley who does not care for any thing else in the world will talk for an hour about a question of law give another the privilege which you take yourself and the free use of his faculty and let him be what nature has made him why should not a man sell his sentimental thoughts as well as you your political ideas or paley his legal knowledge each alike is a matter of experience and practice it is not money which causes you to perceive a fallacy or paley to argue a point but a natural or acquired aptitude for that kind of truth and a poet sets down his thoughts and experiences upon paper as a painter does a landscape or a face upon canvas to the best of his ability and according to his particular gift if ever i think i have the stuff in me to write an epic by jove i will try if i only feel that i am good enough to crack a joke or tell a story i will do that not a bad speech young one warrington said but that does not prevent all poets from being humbugs whathomer aeschylus shakspeare and all their names are not to be breathed in the same sentence with you pigmies mr warrington said there are men and men sir well shakspeare was a man who wrote for money just as you and i do pen answered at which warrington confounded his impudence and resumed his pipe and his manuscript there was not the slightest doubt then that this document contained a great deal of pens personal experiences and that leaves from the lifebook of walter lorraine would never have been written but for arthur pendenniss own private griefs passions and follies as we have become acquainted with these in the first volume of his biography it will not be necessary to make large extracts from the novel of walter lorraine in which the young gentleman had depicted such of them as he thought were likely to interest the reader or were suitable for the purposes of his story now though he had kept it in his box for nearly half of the period during which according to the horatian maxim a work of art ought to lie ripening a maxim the truth of which may by the way be questioned altogether mr pen had not buried his novel for this time in order that the work might improve but because he did not know where else to bestow it or had no particular desire to see it a man who thinks of putting away a composition for ten years before he shall give it to the world or exercise his own maturer judgment upon it had best be very sure of the original strength and durability of the work otherwise on withdrawing it from its crypt he may find that like small wine it has lost what flavor it once had and is only tasteless when opened there are works of all tastes and smacks the small and the strong those that improve by age and those that wont bear keeping at all but are pleasant at the first draught when they refresh and sparkle now pen had never any notion even in the time of his youthful inexperience and fervor of imagination that the story he was writing was a masterpiece of composition or that he was the equal of the great authors whom he admired and when he now reviewed his little performance he was keenly enough alive to its faults and pretty modest regarding its merits it was not very good he thought but it was as good as most books of the kind that had the run of circulating libraries and the career of the season he had critically examined more than one fashionable novel by the authors of the day then popular and he thought that his intellect was as good as theirs and that he could write the english language as well as those ladies or gentlemen and as he now ran over his early performance he was pleased to find here and there passages exhibiting both fancy and vigor and traits if not of genius of genuine passion and feeling this too was warringtons verdict when that severe critic after halfanhours perusal of the manuscript and the consumption of a couple of pipes of tobacco laid pens book down yawning portentously i cant read any more of that balderdash now he said but it seems to me there is some good stuff in it pen my boy theres a certain greenness and freshness in it which i like somehow the bloom disappears off the face of poetry after you begin to shave you cant get up that naturalness and artless rosy tint in after days your cheeks are pale and have got faded by exposure to evening parties and you are obliged to take curlingirons and macassar and the deuce knows what to your whiskers they curl ambrosially and you are very grand and genteel and so forth but ah pen the spring time was the best what the deuce have my whiskers to do with the subject in hand pen said who perhaps may have been nettled by warringtons allusion to those ornaments which to say the truth the young man coaxed and curled and oiled and purfumed and petted in rather an absurd manner do you think we can do any thing with walter lorraine shall we take him to the publishers or make an autodafe of him i dont see what is the good of incremation warrington said though i have a great mind to put him into the fire to punish your atrocious humbug and hypocrisy shall i burn him indeed you have much too great a value for him to hurt a hair of his head illustration have i here goes said pen and walter lorraine went off the table and was flung on to the coals but the fire having done its duty of boiling the young mans breakfastkettle had given up work for the day and had gone out as pen knew very well and warrington with a scornful smile once more took up the manuscript with the tongs from out of the harmless cinders o pen what a humbug you are warrington said and what is worst of all sir a clumsy humbug i saw you look to see that the fire was out before you sent walter lorraine behind the bars no we wont burn him we will carry him to the egyptians and sell him we will exchange him away for money yea for silver and gold and for beef and for liquors and for tobacco and for raiment this youth will fetch some price in the market for he is a comely lad though not over strong but we will fatten him up and give him the bath and curl his hair and we will sell him for a hundred piastres to bacon or to bungay the rubbish is salable enough sir and my advice to you is this the next time you go home for a holiday take walter lorraine in your carpetbaggive him a more modern air prune away though sparingly some of the green passages and add a little comedy and cheerfulness and satire and that sort of thing and then well take him to market and sell him the book is not a wonder of wonders but it will do very well do you think so warrington said pen delighted for this was great praise from his cynical friend you silly young fool i think its uncommonly clever warrington said in a kind voice so do you sir and with the manuscript which he held in his hand he playfully struck pen on the cheek that part of pens countenance turned as red as it had ever done in the earliest days of his blushes he grasped the others hand and said thank you warrington with all his might and then he retired to his own room with his book and passed the greater part of the day upon his bed rereading it and he did as warrington had advised and altered not a little and added a great deal until at length he had fashioned walter lorraine pretty much into the shape in which as the respected novelreader knows it subsequently appeared while he was at work upon this performance the goodnatured warrington artfully inspired the two gentlemen who read for messrs bacon and bungay with the greatest curiosity regarding walter lorraine and pointed out the peculiar merits of its distinguished author it was at the period when the novel called the fashionable was in vogue among us and warrington did not fail to point out as before how pen was a man of the very first fashion himself and received at the houses of some of the greatest personages in the land the simple and kindhearted percy popjoy was brought to bear upon mrs bungay whom he informed that his friend pendennis was occupied upon a work of the most exciting nature a work that the whole town would run after full of wit genius satire pathos and every conceivable good quality we have said before that bungay knew no more about novels than he did about hebrew or algebra and neither read nor understood any of the books which he published and paid for but he took his opinions from his professional advisers and from mrs b and evidently with a view to a commercial transaction asked pendennis and warrington to dinner again bacon when he found that bungay was about to treat of course began to be anxious and curious and desired to outbid his rival was any thing settled between mr pendennis and the odious house over the way about the new book mr hack the confidential reader was told to make inquiries and see if any thing was to be done and the result of the inquiries of that diplomatist was that one morning bacon himself toiled up the staircase of lambcourt and to the door on which the names of mr warrington and mr pendennis were painted for a gentleman of fashion as poor pen was represented to be it must be confessed that the apartments he and his friend occupied were not very suitable the ragged carpet had grown only more ragged during the two years of joint occupancy a constant odor of tobacco perfumed the sittingroom bacon tumbled over the laundresss buckets in the passage through which he had to pass warringtons shooting jacket was as shattered at the elbows as usual and the chair which bacon was requested to take on entering broke down with the publisher warrington burst out laughing said that bacon had got the game chair and bawled out to pen to fetch a sound one from his bedroom and seeing the publisher looking round the dingy room with an air of profound pity and wonder asked him whether he didnt think the apartments were elegant and if he would like for mrs bacons drawingroom any of the articles of furniture mr warringtons character as a humorist was known to mr bacon i never can make that chap out the publisher was heard to say or tell whether he is in earnest or only chaffing it is very possible that mr bacon would have set the two gentlemen down as impostors altogether but that there chanced to be on the breakfasttable certain cards of invitation which the post of the morning had brought in for pen and which happened to come from some very exalted personages of the beaumonde into which our young man had his introduction looking down upon these bacon saw that the marchioness of steyne would be at home to mr arthur pendennis upon a given day and that another lady of distinction proposed to have dancing at her house upon a certain future evening warrington saw the admiring publisher eying these documents ah said he with an air of simplicity pendennis is one of the most affable young men i ever knew mr bacon here is a young fellow that dines with all the great men in london and yet hell take his muttonchop with you and me quite contentedly theres nothing like the affability of the old english gentleman o no nothing said mr bacon and you wonder why he should go on living up three pair of stairs with me dont you now well it is a queer taste but we are fond of each other and as i cant afford to live in a grand house he comes and stays in these rickety old chambers with me hes a man that can afford to live any where i fancy it dont cost him much here thought mr bacon and the object of these praises presently entered the room from his adjacent sleeping apartment then mr bacon began to speak upon the subject of his visit said he heard that mr pendennis had a manuscript novel professed himself anxious to have a sight of that work and had no doubt that they could come to terms respecting it what would be his price for it would he give bacon the refusal of it he would find our house a liberal house and so forth the delighted pen assumed an air of indifference and said that he was already in treaty with bungay and could give no definite answer this piqued the other into such liberal though vague offers that pen began to fancy eldorado was opening to him and that his fortune was made from that day i shall not mention what was the sum of money which mr arthur pendennis finally received for the first edition of his novel of walter lorraine lest other young literary aspirants should expect to be as lucky as he was and unprofessional persons forsake their own callings whatever they may be for the sake of supplying the world with novels whereof there is already a sufficiency let no young people be misled and rush fatally into romancewriting for one book which succeeds let them remember the many that fail i do not say deservedly or otherwise and wholesomely abstain or if they venture at least let then do so at their own peril as for those who have already written novels this warning is not addressed of course to them let them take their wares to market let them apply to bacon and bungay and all the publishers in the row or the metropolis and may they be happy in their ventures this world is so wide and the tastes of mankind happily so various that there is always a chance for every man and he may win the prize by his genius or by his good fortune but what is the chance of success or failure of obtaining popularity or of holding it when achieved one man goes over the ice which bears him and a score who follow flounder in in fine mr pendenniss was an exceptional case and applies to himself only and i assert solemnly and will to the last maintain that it is one thing to write a novel and another to get money for it by merit then or good fortune or the skillful playing off of bungay against bacon which warrington performed and which an amateur novelist is quite welcome to try upon any two publishers in the trade pens novel was actually sold for a certain sum of money to one of the two eminent patrons of letters whom we have introduced to our readers the sum was so considerable that pen thought of opening an account at a bankers or of keeping a cab and horse or of descending into the first floor of lambcourt into newly furnished apartments or of migrating to the fashionable end of the town major pendennis advised the latter move strongly he opened his eyes with wonder when he heard of the good luck that had befallen pen and which the latter as soon as it occurred hastened eagerly to communicate to his uncle the major was almost angry that pen should have earned so much money who the doose reads this kind of thing he thought to himself when he heard of the bargain which pen had made i never read your novels and rubbish except paul de kock who certainly makes me laugh i dont think ive looked into a book of the sort these thirty years gad pens a lucky fellow i should think he might write one of these in a month nowsay a monththats twelve in a year dammy he may go on spinning this nonsense for the next four or five years and make a fortune in the mean time i should wish him to live properly take respectable apartments and keep a brougham and on this simple calculation it was that the major counseled pen arthur laughing told warrington what his uncles advice had been but he luckily had a much more reasonable counselor than the old gentleman in the person of his friend and in his own conscience which said to him be grateful for this piece of good fortune dont plunge into any extravagancies pay back laura and he wrote a letter to her in which he told her his thanks and his regard and inclosed to her such an installment of his debt as nearly wiped it off the widow and laura herself might well be affected by the letter it was written with genuine tenderness and modesty and old dr portman when he read a passage in the letter in which pen with an honest heart full of gratitude humbly thanked heaven for his present prosperity and for sending him such dear and kind friends to support him in his illfortunewhen doctor portman read this portion of the letter his voice faltered and his eyes twinkled behind his spectacles and when he had quite finished reading the same and had taken his glasses off his nose and had folded up the paper and given it back to the widow i am constrained to say that after holding mrs pendenniss hand for a minute the doctor drew that lady toward him and fairly kissed her at which salute of course helen burst out crying on the doctors shoulder for her heart was too full to give any other reply and the doctor blushing a great deal after his feat led the lady with a bow to the sofa on which he seated himself by her and he mumbled out in a low voice some words of a great poet whom he loved very much and who describes how in the days of his prosperity he had made the widows heart to sing for joy the letter does the boy very great honor very great honor my dear he said patting it as it lay on helens kneeand i think we have all reason to be thankful for itvery thankful i need not tell you in what quarter my dear for you are a sainted woman yes laura my love your mother is a sainted woman and mrs pendennis maam i shall order a copy of the book for myself and another at the book club we may be sure that the widow and laura walked out to meet the mail which brought them their copy of pens precious novel as soon as that work was printed and ready for delivery to the public and that they read it to each other and that they also read it privately and separately for when the widow came out of her room in her dressinggown at one oclock in the morning with volume two which she had finished she found laura devouring volume three in bed laura did not say much about the book but helen pronounced that it was a happy mixture of shakspeare and byron and walter scott and was quite certain that her son was the greatest genius as he was the best son in the world did laura not think about the book and the author although she said so little at least she thought about arthur pendennis kind as his tone was it vexed her she did not like his eagerness to repay that money she would rather that her brother had taken her gift as she intended it and was pained that there should be money calculations between them his letters from london written with the goodnatured wish to amuse his mother were full of descriptions of the famous people and the entertainments and magnificence of the great city every body was flattering him and spoiling him she was sure was he not looking to some great marriage with that cunning uncle for a mentor between whom and laura there was always an antipathy that inveterate worldling whose whole thoughts were bent upon pleasure and rank and fortune he never alluded toto old times when he spoke of her he had forgotten them and her perhaps had he not forgotten other things and people these thoughts may have passed in miss lauras mind though she did not she could not confide them to helen she had one more secret too from that lady which she could not divulge perhaps because she knew how the widow would have rejoiced to know it this regarded an event which had occurred during that visit to lady rockminster which laura had paid in the last christmas holidays when pen was at home with his mother and when mr pynsent supposed to be so cold and so ambitious had formally offered his hand to miss bell no one except herself and her admirer knew of this proposal or that pynsent had been rejected by her and probably the reasons she gave to the mortified young man himself were not those which actuated her refusal or those which she chose to acknowledge to herself i never she told pynsent can accept such an offer as that which you make me which you own is unknown to your family as i am sure it would be unwelcome to them the difference of rank between us is too great you are very kind to me heretoo good and kind dear mr pynsentbut i am little better than a dependent a dependent who ever so thought of you you are the equal of all the world pynsent broke out i am a dependent at home too laura said sweetly and indeed i would not be otherwise left early a poor orphan i have found the kindest and tenderest of mothers and i have vowed never to leave her never pray do not speak of this againhere under your relatives roof or elsewhere it is impossible if lady rockminster asks you herself will you listen to her pynsent cried eagerly no laura said i beg you never to speak of this any more i must go away if you do and with this she left him pynsent never asked for lady rockminsters intercession he knew how vain it was to look for that and he never spoke again on that subject to laura or to any person when at length the famous novel appeared it not only met with applause from more impartial critics than mrs pendennis but luckily for pen it suited the taste of the public and obtained a quick and considerable popularity before two months were over pen had the satisfaction and surprise of seeing the second edition of walter lorraine advertised in the newspapers and enjoyed the pleasure of reading and sending home the critiques of various literary journals and reviewers upon his book their censure did not much affect him for the goodnatured young man was disposed to accept with considerable humility the dispraise of others nor did their praise elate him overmuch for like most honest persons he had his own opinion about his own performance and when a critic praised him in the wrong place he was hurt rather than pleased by the compliment but if a review of his work was very laudatory it was a great pleasure to him to send it home to his mother at fairoaks and to think of the joy which it would give there there are some natures and perhaps as we have said pendenniss was one which are improved and softened by prosperity and kindness as there are men of other dispositions who become arrogant and graceless under good fortune happy he who can endure one or the other with modesty and goodhumor lucky he who has been educated to bear his fate whatsoever it may be by an early example of uprightness and a childish training in honor chapter iv alsatia bred up like a bailiff or a shabby attorney about the purlieus of the inns of court shepherds inn is always to be found in the close neighborhood of lincolnsinnfields and the temple somewhere behind the black gables and smutty chimneystacks of wychstreet holywellstreet chancerylane the quadrangle lies hidden from the outer world and it is approached by curious passages and ambiguous smoky alleys on which the sun has forgotten to shine slopsellers brandyball and hardbake venders purveyors of theatrical prints for youth dealers in dingy furniture and bedding suggestive of any thing but sleep line the narrow walls and dark casements with their wares the doors are manybelled and crowds of dirty children form endless groups about the steps or around the shellfish dealers trays in these courts whereof the damp pavements resound with pattens and are drabbled with a neverfailing mud balladsingers come and chant here in deadly guttural tones satirical songs against the whig administration against the bishops and dignified clergy against the german relatives of an august royal family punch sets up his theater sure of an audience and occasionally of a halfpenny from the swarming occupants of the houses women scream after their children for loitering in the gutter or worse still against the husband who comes reeling from the ginshop there is a ceaseless din and life in these courts out of which you pass into the tranquil oldfashioned quadrangle of shepherds inn in a mangy little grassplat in the center rises up the statue of shepherd defended by iron railings from the assaults of boys the hall of the inn on which the founders arms are painted occupies one side of the square the tall and ancient chambers are carried round other two sides and over the central archway which leads into oldcastlestreet and so into the great london thoroughfare the inn may have been occupied by lawyers once but the laity have long since been admitted into its precincts and i do not know that any of the principal legal firms have their chambers here the offices of the polwheedle and tredyddlum copper mines occupy one set of the groundfloor chambers the registry of patent inventions and union of genius and capital company anotherthe only gentleman whose name figures here and in the law list is mr campion who wears mustaches and who comes in his cab twice or thrice in a week and whose west end offices are in curzonstreet mayfair where mrs campion entertains the nobility and gentry to whom her husband lends money there and on his glazed cards he is mr somerset campion here he is campion and co and the same tuft which ornaments his chin sprouts from the under lip of the rest of the firm it is splendid to see his cabhorse harness blazing with heraldic bearings as the vehicle stops at the door leading to his chambers the horse flings froth off his nostrils as he chafes and tosses under the shining bit the reins and the breeches of the groom are glittering whitethe luster of that equipage makes a sunshine in that shady place our old friend captain costigan has examined campions cab and horse many an afternoon as he trailed about the court in his carpet slippers and dressinggown with his old hat cocked over his eye he suns himself there after his breakfast when the day is suitable and goes and pays a visit to the porters lodge where he pats the heads of the children and talks to mrs bolton about the thayatres and me daughter leedy mirabel mrs bolton was herself in the profession once and danced at the wells in early days as the thirteenth of mr serles forty pupils costigan lives in the third floor at no in the rooms which were mr podmores and whose name is still on the door somebody elses name by the way is on almost all the doors in shepherds inn when charley podmore the pleasing tenor singer trdl and at the backkitchen concert rooms married and went to live at lambeth he ceded his chambers to mr bows and captain costigan who occupy them in common now and you may often hear the tones of mr bowss piano of fine days when the windows are open and when he is practicing for amusement or for the instruction of a theatrical pupil of whom he has one or two fanny bolton is one the porteresss daughter who has heard tell of her mothers theatrical glories which she longs to emulate she has a good voice and a pretty face and figure for the stage and she prepares the rooms and makes the beds and breakfasts for messrs costigan and bows in return for which the latter instructs her in music and singing but for his unfortunate propensity to liquor and in that excess she supposes that all men of fashion indulge she thinks the captain the finest gentleman in the world and believes in all the versions of all his stories and she is very fond of mr bows too and very grateful to him and this shy queer old gentleman has a fatherly fondness for her too for in truth his heart is full of kindness and he is never easy unless he loves somebody illustration costigan has had the carriages of visitors of distinction before his humble door in shepherds inn and to hear him talk of a morning for his evening song is of a much more melancholy nature you would fancy that sir charles and lady mirabel were in the constant habit of calling at his chambers and bringing with them the select nobility to visit the old man the honest old halfpay captain poor old jack costigan as cos calls himself the truth is that lady mirabel has left her husbands card which has been stuck in the little lookingglass over the mantlepiece of the sittingroom at no for these many months past and has come in person to see her father but not of late days a kind person disposed to discharge her duties gravely upon her marriage with sir charles she settled a little pension upon her father who occasionally was admitted to the table of his daughter and soninlaw at first poor coss behavior in the hoight of poloit societee as he denominated lady mirabels drawingroom table was harmless if it was absurd as he clothed his person in his best attire so he selected the longest and richest words in his vocabulary to deck his conversation and adopted a solemnity of demeanor which struck with astonishment all those persons in whose company he happened to be was your leedyship in the pork todee he would demand of his daughter i looked for your equipage in veenthe poor old man was not gratified by the soight of his daughters choriot sir chorlus i saw your neem at the levee manys the levee at the castle at dublin that poor old jack costigan has attended in his time did the juke look pretty well bedad ill call at apsley house and lave me cyard upon um i thank ye james a little dthrop more champeane indeed he was magnificent in his courtesy to all and addressed his observations not only to the master and the guests but to the domestics who waited at the table and who had some difficulty in maintaining their professional gravity while they waited on captain costigan on the first two or three visits to his soninlaw costigan maintained a strict sobriety content to make up for his lost time when he got to the backkitchen where he bragged about his soninlaws clart and burgundee until his own utterance began to fail him over his sixth tumbler of whiskeypunch but with familiarity his caution vanished and poor cos lamentably disgraced himself at sir charles mirabels table by premature inebriation a carriage was called for him the hospitable door was shut upon him often and sadly did he speak to his friends at the kitchen of his resemblance to king lear in the pleeof his having a thankless choild bedadof his being a pore wornout lonely old man dthriven to dthrinking by ingratitude and seeking to dthrown his sorrows in punch it is painful to be obliged to record the weaknesses of fathers but it must be furthermore told of costigan that when his credit was exhausted and his money gone he would not unfrequently beg money from his daughter and make statements to her not altogether consistent with strict truth on one day a bailiff was about to lead him to prison he wrote unless theto you insignificantsum of three pound five can be forthcoming to liberate a poor mans gray hairs from jail and the goodnatured lady mirabel dispatched the money necessary for her fathers liberation with a caution to him to be more economical for the future on a second occasion the captain met with a frightful accident and broke a plateglass window in the strand for which the proprietor of the shop held him liable the money was forthcoming on this time too to repair her papas disaster and was carried down by lady mirabels servant to the slipshod messenger and aiddecamp of the captain who brought the letter announcing his mishap if the servant had followed the captains aiddecamp who carried the remittance he would have seen that gentleman a person of costigans country too for have we not said that however poor an irish gentleman is he always has a poorer irish gentleman to run on his errands and transact his pecuniary affairs call a cab from the nearest stand and rattle down to the rosciuss head harlequinyard drurylane where the captain was indeed in pawn and for several glasses containing rum and water or other spirituous refreshment of which he and his staff had partaken on a third melancholy occasion he wrote that he was attacked by illness and wanted money to pay the physician whom he was compelled to call in and this time lady mirabel alarmed about her fathers safety and perhaps reproaching herself that she had of late lost sight of her father called for her carriage and drove to shepherds inn at the gate of which she alighted whence she found the way to her fathers chambers no third floor name of podmore over the door the porteress said with many courtesies pointing toward the door of the house into which the affectionate daughter entered and mounted the dingy stair alas the door surmounted by the name of podmore was opened to her by poor cos in his shirtsleeves and prepared with the gridiron to receive the muttonchops which mrs bolton had gone to purchase also it was not pleasant for sir charles mirabel to have letters constantly addressed to him at brookess with the information that captain costigan was in the hall waiting for an answer or when he went to play his rubber at the travelers to be obliged to shoot out of his brougham and run up the steps rapidly lest his fatherinlaw should seize upon him and to think that while he read his paper or played his whist the captain was walking on the opposite side of pall mall with that dreadful cocked hat and the eye beneath it fixed steadily upon the windows of the club sir charles was a weak man he was old and had many infirmities he cried about his fatherinlaw to his wife whom he adored with senile infatuation he said he must go abroadhe must go and live in the countryhe should die or have another fit if he saw that man againhe knew he should and it was only by paying a second visit to captain costigan and representing to him that if he plagued sir charles by letters or addressed him in the street or made any further applications for loans his allowance would be withdrawn altogether that lady mirabel was enabled to keep her papa in order and to restore tranquillity to her husband and on occasion of this visit she sternly rebuked bows for not keeping a better watch over the captain desired that he should not be allowed to drink in that shameful way and that the people at the horrid taverns which he frequented should be told upon no account to give him credit papas conduct is bringing me to the grave she said though she looked perfectly healthy and you as an old man mr bows and one that pretended to have a regard for us ought to be ashamed of abetting him in it these were the thanks which honest bows got for his friendship and his lifes devotion and i do not suppose that the old philosopher was much worse off than many other men or had greater reason to grumble on the second floor of the next house to bowss in shepherds inn at no live two other acquaintances of ours colonel altamont agent to the nawaab of lucknow and captain the chevalier edward strong no name at all is over their door the captain does not choose to let all the world know where he lives and his cards bear the address of a jermynstreet hotel and as for the embassador plenipotentiary of the indian potentate he is not an envoy accredited to the courts of st jamess or leadenhallstreet but is here on a confidential mission quite independent of the east india company or the board of control in fact as strong says colonel altamonts object being financial and to effectuate a sale of some of the principal diamonds and rubies of the lucknow crown his wish is not to report himself at the india house or in cannonrow but rather to negotiate with private capitalistswith whom he has had important transactions both in this country and on the continent we have said that these anonymous chambers of strongs had been very comfortably furnished since the arrival of sir francis clavering in london and the chevalier might boast with reason to the friends who visited him that few retired captains were more snugly quartered than he in his crib in shepherds inn there were three rooms below the office where strong transacted his businesswhatever that might beand where still remained the desk and railings of the departed officials who had preceded him and the chevaliers own bedroom and sitting room and a private stair led out of the office to two upper apartments the one occupied by colonel altamont and the other serving as the kitchen of the establishment and the bedroom of mr grady the attendant these rooms were on a level with the apartments of our friends bows and costigan next door at no and by reaching over the communicating leads grady could command the mignonnettebox which bloomed in bowss window from gradys kitchen casement often came odors still more fragrant the three old soldiers who formed the garrison of no were all skilled in the culinary art grady was great at an irish stew the colonel was famous for pillaus and curries and as for strong he could cook any thing he made french dishes and spanish dishes stews fricassees and omelettes to perfection nor was there any man in england more hospitable than he when his purse was full or his credit was good at those happy periods he could give a friend as he said a good dinner a good glass of wine and a good song afterward and poor cos often heard with envy the roar of strongs choruses and the musical clinking of the glasses as he sate in his own room so far removed and yet so near to those festivities it was not expedient to invite mr costigan always his practice of inebriation was lamentable and he bored strongs guests with his stories when sober and with his maudlin tears when drunk a strange and motley set they were these friends of the chevalier and though major pendennis would not much have relished their company arthur and warrington liked it not a little and pen thought it as amusing as the society of the finest gentlemen in the finest houses which he had the honor to frequent there was a history about every man of the set they seemed all to have had their tides of luck and bad fortune most of them had wonderful schemes and speculations in their pockets and plenty for making rapid and extraordinary fortunes jack holt had been in don carloss army when ned strong had fought on the other side and was now organizing a little scheme for smuggling tobacco into london which must bring thirty thousand a year to any man who would advance fifteen hundred just to bribe the last officer of the excise who held out and had wind of the scheme tom diver who had been in the mexican navy knew of a specieship which had been sunk in the first year of the war with three hundred and eighty thousand dollars on board and a hundred and eighty thousand pounds in bars and doubloons give me eighteen hundred pounds tom said and im off tomorrow i take out four men and a divingbell with me and i return in ten months to take my seat in parliament by jove and to buy back my family estate keightley the manager of the tredyddlum and polwheedle copper mines which were as yet under water besides singing as good a second as any professional man and besides the tredyddlum office had a smyrna sponge company and a little quicksilver operation in view which would set him straight with the world yet filby had been every thing a corporal of dragoons a fieldpreacher and missionaryagent for converting the irish an actor at a greenwich fairbooth in front of which his fathers attorney found him when the old gentleman died and left him that famous property from which he got no rents now and of which nobody exactly knew the situation added to these was sir francis clavering bart who liked their society though he did not much add to its amusements by his convivial powers but he was made much of by the company now on account of his wealth and position in the world he told his little story and sang his little song or two with great affability and he had had his own history too before his accession to good fortune and had seen the inside of more prisons than one and written his name on many a stamped paper when altamont first returned from paris and after he had communicated with sir francis clavering from the hotel at which he had taken up his quarters and which he had reached in a very denuded state considering the wealth of diamonds and rubies with which this honest man was intrusted strong was sent to him by his patron the baronet paid his little bill at the inn and invited him to come and sleep for a night or two at the chambers where he subsequently took up his residence to negotiate with this man was very well but to have such a person settled in his rooms and to be constantly burdened with such society did not suit the chevaliers taste much and he grumbled not a little to his principal i wish you would put this bear into somebody elses cage he said to clavering the fellows no gentleman i dont like walking with him he dresses himself like a nigger on a holiday i took him to the play the other night and by jove sir he abused the actor who was doing the part of villain in the play and swore at him so that the people in the boxes wanted to turn him out the afterpiece was the brigand where wallack comes in wounded you know and dies when he died altamont began to cry like a child and said it was a dd shame and cried and swore so that there was another row and every body laughing then i had to take him away because he wanted to take his coat off to one fellow who laughed at him and bellowed to him to stand up like a man who is he where the deuce does he come from you had best tell me the whole story frank you must one day you and he have robbed a church together thats my belief you had better get it off your mind at once clavering and tell me what this altamont is and what hold he has over you hang him i wish he was dead was the baronets only reply and his countenance became so gloomy that strong did not think fit to question his patron any further at that time but resolved if need were to try and discover for himself what was the secret tie between altamont and clavering chapter v in which the colonel narrates some of his adventures early in the forenoon of the day after the dinner in grosvenorplace at which colonel altamont had chosen to appear the colonel emerged from his chamber in the upper story at shepherds inn and entered into strongs sittingroom where the chevalier sat in his easychair with the newspaper and his cigar he was a man who made his tent comfortable wherever he pitched it and long before altamonts arrival had done justice to a copious breakfast of fried eggs and broiled rashers which mr grady had prepared secundum artem goodhumored and talkative he preferred any company rather than none and though he had not the least liking for his fellowlodger and would not have grieved to hear that the accident had befallen him which sir francis clavering desired so fervently yet kept on fair terms with him he had seen altamont to bed with great friendliness on the night previous and taken away his candle for fear of accidents and finding a spiritbottle empty upon which he had counted for his nocturnal refreshment had drunk a glass of water with perfect contentment over his pipe before he turned into his own crib and to sleep that enjoyment never failed him he had always an easy temper a faultless digestion and a rosy cheek and whether he was going into action the next morning or to prison and both had been his lot in the camp or the fleet the worthy captain snored healthfully through the night and woke with a good heart and appetite for the struggles or difficulties or pleasures of the day the first act of colonel altamont was to bellow to grady for a pint of pale ale the which he first poured into a pewter flagon whence he transferred it to his own lips he put down the tankard empty drew a great breath wiped his mouth in his dressinggown the difference of the color of his heard from his dyed whiskers had long struck captain strong who had seen too that his hair was fair under his black wig but made no remarks upon these circumstancesthe colonel drew a great breath and professed himself immensely refreshed by his draught nothing like that beer he remarked when the coppers are hot many a day ive drunk a dozen of bass at calcutta andand and at lucknow i suppose strong said with a laugh i got the beer for you on purpose knew youd want it after last night and the colonel began to talk about his adventures of the preceding evening i can not help myself the colonel said beating his head with his big hand im a madman when i get the liquor on board me and aint fit to be trusted with a spiritbottle when i once begin i cant stop till ive emptied it and when ive swallowed it lord knows what i say or what i dont say i dined at home here quite quiet grady gave me just my two tumblers and i intended to pass the evening at the black and red as sober as a parson why did you leave that confounded samplebottle of hollands out of the cupboard strong grady must go out too and leave me the kettle aboiling for tea it was of no use i couldnt keep away from it washed it all down sir by jingo and its my belief i had some more too afterward at that infernal little thieves den what were you there too strong asked and before you came to grosvenorplace that was beginning betimes early hours to be drunk and cleared out before nine oclock eh but so it was yes like a great big fool i must go there and found the fellows dining blackland and young moss and two or three more of the thieves if wed gone to rouge et noir i must have won but we didnt try the black and red no hang em they knowd id have beat em at thati must have beat emi cant help beating em i tell you but they was too cunning for me that rascal blackland got the bones out and we played hazard on the diningtable and i dropped all the money i had from you in the morning be hanged to my luck it was that that set me wild and i suppose i must have been very hot about the head for i went off thinking to get some more money from clavering i recollect and thenand then i dont much remember what happened till i woke this morning and heard old bows at no playing on his pianner strong mused for a while as he lighted his cigar with a coal i should like to know how you always draw money from clavering colonel he said the colonel burst out with a laugh ha ha he owes it me he said i dont know that thats a reason with frank for paying strong answered he owes plenty besides you well he gives it me because he is so fond of me the other said with the same grinning sneer he loves me like a brother you know he does captain nohe dontwell perhaps he dont and if you ask me no questions perhaps ill tell you no lies captain strongput that in your pipe and smoke it my boy but ill give up that confounded brandybottle the colonel continued after a pause i must give it up or itll be the ruin of me it makes you say queer things said the captain looking altamont hard in the face remember what you said last night at claverings table say what did i say asked the other hastily did i split any thing dammy strong did i split any thing ask me no questions and i will tell you no lies the chevalier replied on his part strong thought of the words mr altamont had used and his abrupt departure from the baronets diningtable and house as soon as he recognized major pendennis or captain beak as he called the major but strong resolved to seek an explanation of these words otherwise than from colonel altamont and did not choose to recall them to the others memory no he said then you didnt split as you call it colonel it was only a trap of mine to see if i could make you speak but you didnt say a word that any body could comprehendyou were too far gone for that so much the better altamont thought and heaved a great sigh as if relieved strong remarked the emotion but took no notice and the other being in a communicative mood went on speaking yes i own to my faults continued the colonel there is some things i cant do what i will resist a bottle of brandy a box of dice and a beautiful woman no man of pluck and spirit no man as was worth his salt ever could as i know of theres hardly praps a country in the world in which them three aint got me into trouble indeed said strong yes from the age of fifteen when i ran away from home and went cabinboy on board an indiaman till now when im fifty year old pretty nigh them women have always been my ruin why it was one of em and with such black eyes and jewels on her neck and sattens and ermine like a duchess i tell youit was one of em at paris that swept off the best part of the thousand pound as i went off didnt i ever tell you of it well i dont mind at first i was very cautious and having such a lot of money kep it close and lived like a gentlemancolonel altamont meurices hotel and that sort of thing never played except at the public tables and won more than i lost well sir there was a chap that i saw at the hotel and the palace royal too a regular swell fellow with white kid gloves and a tuft to his chin bloundellbloundell his name was as i made acquaintance with somehow and he asked me to dinner and took me to madame the countess de foljambes soireessuch a woman strongsuch an eye such a hand at the pianner lor bless you shed sit down and sing to you and gaze at you until she warbled your soul out of your body amost she asked me to go to her evening parties every toosday and didnt i take operaboxes and give her dinners at the restaurateurs thats all but i had a run of luck at the tables and it was not in the dinners and operaboxes that poor claverings money went no be hanged to it it was swep off in another way one night at the countesss there was several of us at suppermr bloundellbloundell the honorable deuceace the marky de la tour de forceall tiptop nobs sir and the height of fashion when we had supper and champagne you may be sure in plenty and then some of that confounded brandy i would have iti would go on at itthe countess mixed the tumblers of punch for me and we had cards as well as grog after supper and i played and drank until i dont know what i did i was like i was last night i was taken away and put to bed somehow and never woke until the next day to a roaring headache and to see my servant who said the honorable deuceace wanted to see me and was waiting in the sittingroom how are you colonel says he acoming into my bedroom how long did you stay last night after i went away the play was getting too high for me and id lost enough to you for one night to me says i hows that my dear feller for though he was an earls son we was as familiar as you and me hows that my dear feller says i and he tells me that he had borrowed thirty louis of me at vingtetun that he gave me an iou for it the night before which i put into my pocketbook before he left the room i takes out my cardcaseit was the countess as worked it for meand there was the iou sure enough and he paid me thirty louis in gold down upon the table at my bedside so i said he was a gentleman and asked him if he would like to take any thing when my servant should get it for him but the honorable deuceace dont drink of a morning and he went away to some business which he said he had presently theres another ring at my outer door and this time its bloundellbloundell and the marky that comes in bong jour marky says i good morningno headache says he so i said i had one and how i must have been uncommon queer the night afore but they both declared i didnt show no signs of having had too much but took my liquor as grave as a judge so says the marky deuceace has been with you we met him in the palais royal as we were coming from breakfast has he settled with you get it while you can hes a slippery card and as he won three ponies of bloundell i recommend you to get your money while he has some he has paid me says i but i knew no more than the dead that he owed me any thing and dont remember a bit about lending him thirty louis the marky and bloundell looks and smiles at each other at this and bloundell says colonel you are a queer feller no man could have supposed from your manners that you had tasted any thing stronger than tea all night and yet you forget things in the morning come cometell that to the marines my friendwe wont have it any price en effet says the marky twiddling his little black mustaches in the chimneyglass and making a lunge or two as he used to do at the fencingschool he was a wonder at the fencingschool and ive seen him knock down the image fourteen times running at lepages let us speak of affairs colonel you understand that affairs of honor are best settled at once perhaps it wont be inconvenient to you to arrange our little matters of last night what little matters says i do you owe me any money marky bah says he do not let us have any more jesting i have your note of hand for three hundred and forty louis la voici says he taking out a paper from his pocketbook and mine for two hundred and ten says bloundellbloundell and he pulls out his bit of paper i was in such a rage of wonder at this that i sprang out of bed and wrapped my dressinggown round me are you come here to make a fool of me says i i dont owe you two hundred or two thousand or two louis and i wont pay you a farthing do you suppose you can catch me with your notes of hand i laugh at em and at you and i believe you to be a couple a couple of what says mr bloundell you of course are aware that we are a couple of men of honor colonel altamont and not come here to trifle or to listen to abuse from you you will either pay us or we will expose you as a cheat and chastise you as a cheat too says bloundell oui parbleu says the marky but i didnt mind him for i could have thrown the little fellow out of the window but it was different with bloundell he was a large man that weighs three stone more than me and stands six inches higher and i think he could have done for me monsieur will pay or monsieur will give me the reason why i believe youre little better than a polisson colonel altamontthat was the phrase he usedaltamont said with a grinand i got plenty more of this language from the two fellows and was in the thick of the row with them when another of our party came in this was a friend of minea gent i had met at boulogne and had taken to the countesss myself and as he hadnt played at all on the previous night and had actually warned me against bloundell and the others i told the story to him and so did the other two i am very sorry says he you would go on playing the countess entreated you to discontinue these gentlemen offered repeatedly to stop it was you that insisted on the large stakes not they in fact he charged dead against me and when the two others went away he told me how the marky would shoot me as sure as my name waswas what it is i left the countess crying too said he she hates these two men she has warned you repeatedly against them which she actually had done and often told me never to play with them and now colonel i have left her in hysterics almost lest there should be any quarrel between you and that confounded marky should put a bullet through your head its my belief says my friend that that woman is distractedly in love with you do you think so says i upon which my friend told me how she had actually gone down on her knees to him and said save colonel altamont as soon as i was dressed i went and called upon that lovely woman she gave a shriek and pretty near fainted when she saw me she called me ferdinandim blest if she didnt i thought your name was jack said strong with a laugh at which the colonel blushed very much behind his dyed whiskers a man may have more names than one maynt he strong altamont asked when im with a lady i like to take a good one she called me by my christian name she cried fit to break your heart i cant stand seeing a woman crynever couldnot while im fond of her she said she could not bear to think of my losing so much money in her house wouldnt i take her diamonds and necklaces and pay part i swore i wouldnt touch a farthings worth of her jewelry which perhaps i did not think was worth a great deal but what can a woman do more than give you her all thats the sort i like and i know theres plenty of em and i told her to be easy about the money for i would not pay one single farthing then theyll shoot you says she theyll kill my ferdinand theyll kill my jack wouldnt have sounded well in french strong said laughing never mind about names said the other sulkily a man of honor may take any name he chooses i suppose well go on with your story said strong she said they would kill you no says i they wont for i will not let that scamp of a marquis send me out of the world and if he lays a hand on me ill brain him marquis as he is at this the countess shrank back from me as if i had said something very shocking do i understand colonel altamont aright says she and that a british officer refuses to meet any person who provokes him to the field of honor field of honor be hanged countess says i you would not have me be a target for that little scoundrels pistol practice colonel altamont says the countess i thought you were a man of honori thought ibut no matter goodby sir and she was sweeping out of the room her voice regular choking in her pockethandkerchief countess says i rushing after her and seizing her hand leave me monsieur le colonel says she shaking me off my father was a general of the grand army a soldier should know how to pay all his debts of honor what could i do every body was against me caroline said i had lost the money though i didnt remember a syllable about the business i had taken deuceaces money too but then it was because he offered it to me you know and thats a different thing every one of these chaps was a man of fashion and honor and the marky and the countess of the first families in france and by jove sir rather than offend her i paid the money up five hundred and sixty gold napoleons by jove besides three hundred which i lost when i had my revenge and i cant tell you at this minute whether i was done or not concluded the colonel musing sometimes i think i was but then caroline was so fond of me that woman would never have seen me done never im sure she wouldnt at least if she would im deceived in woman any further revelations of his past life which altamont might have been disposed to confide to his honest comrade the chevalier were interrupted by a knocking at the outer door of their chambers which when opened by grady the servant admitted no less a person than sir francis clavering into the presence of the two worthies the governor by jove cried strong regarding the arrival of his patron with surprise whats brought you here growled altamont looking sternly from under his heavy eyebrows at the baronet its no good i warrant and indeed good very seldom brought sir francis clavering into that or any other place whenever he came into shepherds inn it was money that brought the unlucky baronet into those precincts and there was commonly a gentleman of the moneydealing world in waiting for him at strongs chambers or at campions below and a question of bills to negotiate or to renew clavering was a man who had never looked his debts fairly in the face familiar as he had been with them all his life as long as he could renew a bill his mind was easy regarding it and he would sign almost any thing for tomorrow provided today could be left unmolested he was a man whom scarcely any amount of fortune could have benefited permanently and who was made to be ruined to cheat small tradesmen to be the victim of astuter sharpers to be niggardly and reckless and as destitute of honesty as the people who cheated him and a dupe chiefly because he was too mean to be a successful knave he had told more lies in his time and undergone more baseness of stratagem in order to stave off a small debt or to swindle a poor creditor than would have suffered to make a fortune for a braver rogue he was abject and a shuffler in the very height of his prosperity had he been a crown prince he could not have been more weak useless dissolute or ungrateful he could not move through life except leaning on the arm of somebody and yet he never had an agent but he mistrusted him and marred any plans which might be arranged for his benefit by secretly acting against the people whom he employed strong knew clavering and judged him quite correctly it was not as friends that this pair met but the chevalier worked for his principal as he would when in the army have pursued a harassing march or undergone his part in the danger and privations of a siege because it was his duty and because he had agreed to it what is it he wants thought the two officers of the shepherds inn garrison when the baronet came among them his pale face expressed extreme anger and irritation so sir he said addressing altamont youve been at your old tricks which of um asked altamont with a sneer you have been at the rouge et noir you were there last night cried the baronet how do you knowwere you there the other said i was at the club but it wasnt on the colors i playedask the captainive been telling him of it it was with the bones it was at hazard sir francis upon my word and honor it was and he looked at the baronet with a knowing humorous mock humility which only seemed to make the other more angry what the deuce do i care sir how a man like you loses his money and whether it is at hazard or roulette screamed the baronet with a multiplicity of oaths and at the top of his voice what i will not have sir is that you should use my name or couple it with yours damn him strong why dont you keep him in better order i tell you he has gone and used my name again sir drawn a bill upon me and lost the money on the tablei cant stand iti wont stand it flesh and blood wont bear it do you know how much i have paid for you sir this was only a very little un sir francisonly fifteen pound captain strong they wouldnt stand another and it oughtnt to anger you governor why its so trifling i did not even mention it to strongdid i now captain i protest it had quite slipped my memory and all on account of that confounded liquor i took liquor or no liquor sir it is no business of mine i dont care what you drink or where you drink itonly it shant be in my house and i will not have you breaking into my house of a night and a fellow like you intruding himself on my company how dared you show yourself in grosvenorplace last night sirandand what do you suppose my friends must think of me when they see a man of your sort walking into my diningroom uninvited and drunk and calling for liquor as if you were the master of the house theyll think you know some very queer sort of people i dare say altamont said with impenetrable goodhumor look here baronet i apologize on my honor i do and aint an apology enough between two gentlemen it was a strong measure i own walking into your cuddy and calling for drink as if i was the captain but i had had too much before you see thats why i wanted some more nothing can be more simpleand it was because they wouldnt give me no more money upon your name at the black and red that i thought i would come down and speak to you about it to refuse me was nothing but to refuse a bill drawn on you that have been such a friend to the shop and are a baronet and a member of parliament and a gentleman and no mistakedamme its ungrateful by heavens if ever you do it again if ever you dare to show yourself in my house or give my name at a gamblinghouse or at any other house by joveat any other houseor give any reference at all to me or speak to me in the street by gad or any where else until i speak to youi disclaim you altogetheri wont give you another shilling governor dont be provoking altamont said surlily dont talk to me about daring to do this thing or tother or when my dander is up its the very thing to urge me on i oughtnt to have come last night i know i oughtnt but i told you i was drunk and that ought to be sufficient between gentleman and gentleman you a gentleman dammy sir said the baronet how dares a fellow like you to call himself a gentleman i aint a baronet i know growled the other and ive forgotten how to be a gentleman almost now butbut i was one once and my father was one and ill not have this sort of talk from you sir f clavering thats flat i want to go abroad again why dont you come down with the money and let me go why the devil are you to be rolling in riches and me to have none why should you have a house and a table covered with plate and me be in a garret here in this beggarly shepherds inn were partners aint we ive as good a right to be rich as you have havent i tell the story to strong here if you like and ask him to be umpire between us i dont mind letting my secret out to a man that wont split look here strongperhaps you guess the story alreadythe fact is me and the governor d hold your tongue shrieked out the baronet in a fury you shall have the money as soon as i can get it i aint made of money im so pressed and badgered i dont know where to turn i shall go mad by jove i shall i wish i was dead for im the most miserable brute alive i say mr altamont dont mind me when im out of healthand im devilish bilious this morninghang me i abuse every body and dont know what i say excuse me if ive offended you iill try and get that little business done strong shall try upon my word he shall and i say strong my boy i want to speak to you come into the office for a minute almost all claverings assaults ended in this ignominious way and in a shameful retreat altamont sneered after the baronet as he left the room and entered into the office to talk privately with his factotum what is the matter now the latter asked of him its the old story i suppose dit yes the baronet said i dropped two hundred in ready money at the little coventry last night and gave a check for three hundred more on her ladyships bankers too for tomorrow and i must meet it for therell be the deuce to pay else the last time she paid my playdebts i swore i would not touch a dicebox again and shell keep her word strong and dissolve partnership if i go on i wish i had three hundred a year and was away at a german wateringplace you can do devilish well with three hundred a year but my habits are so dreckless i wish i was in the serpentine i wish i was dead by gad i wish i was i wish i had never touched those confounded bones i had such a run of luck last night with five for the main and seven to five all night until those ruffians wanted to pay me with altamonts bill upon me the luck turned from that minute never held the box again for three mains and came away cleaned out leaving that infernal check behind me how shall i pay it blackland wont hold it over hulker and bullock will write about it directly to her ladyship by jove ned im the most miserable brute in all england it was necessary for ned to devise some plan to console the baronet under this pressure of grief and no doubt he found the means of procuring a loan for his patron for he was closeted at mr campions offices that day for some time altamont had once more a guinea or two in his pocket with a promise of a farther settlement and the baronet had no need to wish himself dead for the next two or three months at least and strong putting together what he had learned from the colonel and sir francis began to form in his own mind a pretty accurate opinion as to the nature of the tie which bound the two men together chapter vi a chapter of conversations illustration every day after the entertainments at grosvenorplace and greenwich of which we have seen major pendennis partake the worthy gentlemans friendship and cordiality for the clavering family seemed to increase his calls were frequent his attentions to the lady of the house unremitting an old man about town he had the good fortune to be received in many houses at which a lady of lady claverings distinction ought also to be seen would her ladyship not like to be present at the grand entertainment at gaunt house there was to be a very pretty breakfast ball at viscount marrowfats at fulham every body was to be there including august personages of the highest rank and there was to be a watteau quadrille in which miss amory would surely look charming to these and other amusements the obsequious old gentleman kindly offered to conduct lady clavering and was also ready to make himself useful to the baronet in any way agreeable to the latter in spite of his present station and fortune the world persisted in looking rather coldly upon clavering and strange suspicious rumors followed him about he was blackballed at two clubs in succession in the house of commons he only conversed with a few of the most disreputable members of that famous body having a happy knack of choosing bad society and adapting himself naturally to it as other people do to the company of their betters to name all the senators with whom clavering consorted would be invidious we may mention only a few there was captain raff the honorable member for epsom who retired after the last goodwood races having accepted as mr hotspur the whip of the party said a mission to the levant there was hustingson the patriotic member for islington whose voice is never heard now denunciating corruption since his appointment to the governorship of coventry island there was bob freeny of the booterstown freenys who is a dead shot and of whom we therefore wish to speak with every respect and of all these gentlemen with whom in the course of his professional duty mr hotspur had to confer there was none for whom he had a more thorough contempt and dislike than for sir francis clavering the representative of an ancient race who had sat for their own borough of clavering time out of mind in the house if that man is wanted for a division hotspur said ten to one he is to be found in a hell he was educated in the fleet and he has not heard the end of newgate yet take my word for it hell muddle away the begums fortune at thimblerig be caught picking pockets and finish on board the hulks and if the highborn hotspur with such an opinion of clavering could yet from professional reasons be civil to him why should not major pendennis also have reasons of his own for being attentive to this unlucky gentleman he has a very good cellar and a very good cook the major said as long as he is silent he is not offensive and he very seldom speaks if he chooses to frequent gamblingtables and lose his money to blacklegs what matters to me dont look too curiously into any mans affairs pen my boy every fellow has some cupboard in his house begad which he would not like you and me to peep into why should we try when the rest of the house is open to us and a devilish good house too as you and i know and if the man of the family is not all one could wish the women are excellent the begum is not overrefined but as kind a woman as ever lived and devilish clever too and as for the little blanche you know my opinion about her you rogue you know my belief is that she is sweet on you and would have you for the asking but you are growing such a great man that i suppose you wont be content under a dukes daughterhey sir i recommend you to ask one of them and try perhaps pen was somewhat intoxicated by his success in the world and it may also have entered into the young mans mind his uncles perpetual hints serving not a little to encourage the notion that miss amory was tolerably well disposed to renew the little flirtation which had been carried on in the early days of both of them by the banks of the rural brawl but he was little disposed to marriage he said at that moment and adopting some of his uncles worldly tone spoke rather contemptuously of the institution and in favor of a bachelor life you are very happy sir said he and you get on very well alone and so do i with a wife at my side i should lose my place in society and i dont for my part much fancy retiring into the country with a mrs pendennis or taking my wife into lodgings to be waited upon by the servantofallwork the period of my little illusions is over you cured me of my first love who certainly was a fool and would have had a fool for her husband and a very sulky discontented husband too if she had taken me we young fellows live fast sir and i feel as old at fiveandtwenty as many of the old fo the old bachelorswhom i see in the baywindow at bayss dont look offended i only mean that i am blase about love matters and that i could no more fan myself into a flame for miss amory now than i could adore lady mirabel over again i wish i could i rather like old mirabel for his infatuation about her and think his passion is the most respectable part of his life sir charles mirabel was always a theatrical man sir the major said annoyed that his nephew should speak flippantly of any person of sir charless rank and station he has been occupied with theatricals since his early days he acted at carlton house when he was page to the prince he has been mixed up with that sort of thing he could afford to marry whom he chooses and lady mirabel is a most respectable woman received every whereevery where mind the duchess of connaught receives her lady rockminster receives herit doesnt become young fellows to speak lightly of people in that station theres not a more respectable woman in england than lady mirabel and the old fogies as you call them at bayss are some of the first gentlemen in england of whom you youngsters had best learn a little manners and a little breeding and a little modesty and the major began to think that pen was growing exceedingly pert and conceited and that the world made a great deal too much of him the majors anger amused pen he studied his uncles peculiarities with a constant relish and was always in a good humor with his worldly old mentor i am a youngster of fifteen years standing sir he said adroitly and if you think that we are disrespectful you should see those of the present generation a protege of yours came to breakfast with me the other day you told me to ask him and i did it to please you we had a days sights together and dined at the club and went to the play he said the wine at the polyanthus was not so good as elliss wine at richmond smoked warringtons cavendish after breakfast and when i gave him a sovereign as a farewell token said he had plenty of them but would take it to show he wasnt proud did hedid you ask young clavering cried the major appeased at once fine boy rather wild but a fine boyparents like that sort of attention and you cant do better than pay it to our worthy friends of grosvenorplace and so you took him to the play and tipped him that was right sir that was right with which mentor quitted telemachus thinking that the young men were not so very bad and that he should make something of that fellow yet as master clavering grew into years and stature he became too strong for the authority of his fond parents and governess and rather governed them than permitted himself to be led by their orders with his papa he was silent and sulky seldom making his appearance however in the neighborhood of that gentleman with his mamma he roared and fought when any contest between them arose as to the gratification of his appetite or other wish of his heart and in his disputes with his governess over his book he kicked that quiet creatures shins so fiercely that she was entirely overmastered and subdued by him and he would have so treated his sister blanche too and did on one or two occasions attempt to prevail over her but she showed an immense resolution and spirit on her part and boxed his ears so soundly that he forebore from molesting miss amory as he did the governess and his mamma and his mammas maid at length when the family came to london sir francis gave forth his opinion that the little beggar had best be sent to school accordingly the young son and heir of the house of clavering was dispatched to the rev otto roses establishment at twickenham where young noblemen and gentlemen were received preparatory to their introduction to the great english public schools it is not our intention to follow master clavering in his scholastic career the paths to the temple of learning were made more easy to him than they were to some of us of earlier generations he advanced toward that fane in a carriageandfour so to speak and might halt and take refreshments almost whenever he pleased he wore varnished boots from the earliest period of youth and had cambric handkerchiefs and lemoncolored kid gloves of the smallest size ever manufactured by privat they dressed regularly at mr roses to come down to dinner the young gentlemen had shawl dressinggowns fires in their bedrooms horse and carriage exercise occasionally and oil for their hair corporal punishment was altogether dispensed with by the principal who thought that moral discipline was entirely sufficient to lead youth and the boys were so rapidly advanced in many branches of learning that they acquired the art of drinking spirits and smoking cigars even before they were old enough to enter a public school young frank clavering stole his fathers havannas and conveyed them to school or smoked them in the stables at a surprisingly early period of life and at ten years old drank his champagne almost as stoutly as any whiskered cornet of dragoons could do when this interesting youth came home for his vacations major pendennis was as laboriously civil and gracious to him as he was to the rest of the family although the boy had rather a contempt for old wigsby as the major was denominated mimicked him behind his back as the polite major bowed and smirked with lady clavering or miss amory and drew rude caricatures such as are designed by ingenious youths in which the majors wig his nose his tie c were represented with artless exaggeration untiring in his efforts to be agreeable the major wished that pen too should take particular notice of this child incited arthur to invite him to his chambers to give him a dinner at the club to take him to madame tussauds the tower the play and so forth and to tip him as the phrase is at the end of the days pleasures arthur who was goodnatured and fond of children went through all these ceremonies one day had the boy to breakfast at the temple where he made the most contemptuous remarks regarding the furniture the crockery and the tattered state of warringtons dressinggown and smoked a short pipe and recounted the history of a fight between tuffy and long biggings at roses greatly to the edification of the two gentlemen his hosts as the major rightly predicted lady clavering was very grateful for arthurs attention to the boy more grateful than the lad himself who took attentions as a matter of course and very likely had more sovereigns in his pocket than poor pen who generously gave him one of his own slender stock of those coins the major with the sharp eyes with which nature endowed him and with the glasses of age and experience watched this boy and surveyed his position in the family without seeming to be rudely curious about their affairs but as a country neighbor one who had many family obligations to the claverings an old man of the world he took occasion to find out what lady claverings means were how her capital was disposed and what the boy was to inherit and setting himself to work for what purposes will appear no doubt ulteriorly he soon had got a pretty accurate knowledge of lady claverings affairs and fortune and of the prospects of her daughter and son the daughter was to have but a slender provision the bulk of the property was as before has been said to go to the son his father did not care for him or any body else his mother was dotingly fond of him as the child of her latter days his sister disliked him such may be stated in round numbers to be the result of the information which major pendennis got ah my dear madam he would say patting the head of the boy this boy may wear a barons coronet on his head on some future coronation if matters are but managed rightly and if sir francis clavering would but play his cards well at this the widow amory heaved a deep sigh he plays only too much of his cards major im afraid she said the major owned that he knew as much did not disguise that he had heard of sir francis claverings unfortunate propensity to play pitied lady clavering sincerely but spoke with such genuine sentiment and sense that her ladyship glad to find a person of experience to whom she could confide her grief and her condition talked about them pretty unreservedly to major pendennis and was eager to have his advice and consolation major pendennis became the begums confidante and housefriend and as a mother a wife and a capitalist she consulted him he gave her to understand showing at the same time a great deal of respectful sympathy that he was acquainted with some of the circumstances of her first unfortunate marriage and with even the person of her late husband whom he remembered in calcuttawhen she was living in seclusion with her father the poor lady with tears of shame more than of grief in her eyes told her version of her story going back a child to india after two years at a european school she had met amory and foolishly married him o you dont know how miserable that man made me she said or what a life i passed between him and my father before i saw him i had never seen a man except my fathers clerks and native servants you know we didnt go into society in india on account of i know said major pendennis with a bow i was a wild romantic child my head was full of novels which id read at schooli listened to his wild stories and adventures for he was a daring fellow and i thought he talked beautifully of those calm nights on the passage out when he used to well i married him and was wretched from that daywretched with my father whose character you know major pendennis and i wont speak of but he wasnt a good man sirneither to my poor mother nor to me except that he left me his moneynor to no one else that i ever heard of and he didnt do many kind actions in his lifetime im afraid and as for amory he was almost worse he was a spendthrift when my father was close he drank dreadfully and was furious when in that way he wasnt in any way a good or a faithful husband to me major pendennis and if hed died in the jail before his trial instead of afterward he would have saved me a deal of shame and unhappiness since sir lady clavering added for perhaps i should not have married at all if i had not been so anxious to change his horrid name and i have not been happy in my second husband as i suppose you know sir ah major pendennis ive got money to be sure and im a lady and people fancy im very happy but i aint we all have our cares and griefs and troubles and manys the day that i sit down to one of my grand dinners with an aching heart and many a night do i lay awake on my fine bed a great deal more unhappy than the maid that makes it for im not a happy woman major for all the world says and envies the begum her diamonds and carriages and the great company that comes to my house im not happy in my husband im not happy in my daughter she aint a good girl like that dear laura bell at fairoaks shes cost me many a tear though you dont see em and she sneers at her mother because i havent had learning and that how should i i was brought up among natives till i was twelve and went back to india when i was fourteen ah major i should have been a good woman if i had had a good husband and now i must go upstairs and wipe my eyes for theyre red with cryin and lady rockminsters acomin and were goin to ave a drive in the park and when lady rockminster made her appearance there was not a trace of tears or vexation on lady claverings face but she was full of spirits and bounced out with her blunders and talk and murdered the kings english with the utmost liveliness and good humor illustration begad she is not such a bad woman the major thought within himself she is not refined certainly and calls apollo apoller but she has some heart and i like that sort of thing and a devilish deal of money too three stars in india stock to her name begad which that young cub is to haveis he and he thought how he should like to see a little of the money transferred to miss blanche and better still one of those stars shining in the name of mr arthur pendennis still bent upon pursuing his schemes whatsoever they might be the old negotiator took the privilege of his intimacy and age to talk in a kindly and fatherly manner to miss blanche when he found occasion to see her alone he came in so frequently at luncheontime and became so familiar with the ladies that they did not even hesitate to quarrel before him and lady clavering whose tongue was loud and temper brusk had many a battle with the sylphide in the family friends presence blanches wit seldom failed to have the mastery in these encounters and the keen barbs of her arrows drove her adversary discomfited away i am an old fellow the major said i have nothing to do in life i have my eyes open i keep good counsel i am the friend of both of you and if you choose to quarrel before me why i shant tell any one but you are two good people and i intend to make it up between you i have between lots of peoplehusbands and wives fathers and sons daughters and mammas before this i like it ive nothing else to do one day then the old diplomatist entered lady claverings drawingroom just as the latter quitted it evidently in a high state of indignation and ran past him up the stairs to her own apartments she couldnt speak to him now she said she was a great deal too angry with thatthatthat little wickedanger choked the rest of the words or prevented their utterance until lady clavering had passed out of hearing my dear good miss amory the major said entering the drawingroom i see what is happening you and mamma have been disagreeing mothers and daughters disagree in the best families it was but last week that i healed up a quarrel between lady clapperton and her daughter lady claudia lady lear and her eldest daughter have not spoken for fourteen years kinder and more worthy people than these i never knew in the whole course of my life for every body but each other admirable but they cant live together they oughtnt to live together and i wish my dear creature with all my soul that i could see you with an establishment of your ownfor there is no woman in london who could conduct one betterwith your own establishment making your own home happy i am not very happy in this one said the sylphide and the stupidity of mamma is enough to provoke a saint precisely so you are not suited to one another your mother committed one fault in early lifeor was it nature my dear in your caseshe ought not to have educated you you ought not to have been bred up to become the refined and intellectual being you are surrounded as i own you are by those who have not your genius or your refinement your place would be to lead in the most brilliant circles not to follow and take a second place in any society i have watched you miss amory you are ambitious and your proper sphere is command you ought to shine and you never can in this house i know it i hope i shall see you in another and a happier one some day and the mistress of it the sylphide shrugged her lily shoulders with a look of scorn where is the prince and where is the palace major pendennis she said i am ready but there is no romance in the world now no real affection no indeed said the major with the most sentimental and simple air which he could muster not that i know any thing about it said blanche casting her eyes down except what i have read in novels of course not major pendennis cried how should you my dear young lady and novels aint true as you remark admirably and there is no romance left in the world begad i wish i was a young fellow like my nephew and what continued miss amory musing what are the men whom we see about at the balls every nightdancing guardsmen penniless treasury clerksboobies if i had my brothers fortune i might have such an establishment as you promise mebut with my name and with my little means what am i to look to a country parson or a barrister in a street near russellsquare or a captain in a dragoonregiment who will take lodgings for me and come home from the mess tipsy and smelling of smoke like sir francis clavering that is how we girls are destined to end life o major pendennis i am sick of london and of balls and of young dandies with their chintips and of the insolent great ladies who know us one day and cut us the nextand of the world altogether i should like to leave it and to go into a convent that i should i shall never find any body to understand me and i live here as much alone in my family and in the world as if i were in a cell locked up for ever i wish there were sisters of charity here and that i could be one and catch the plague and die of iti wish to quit the world i am not very old but i am tired i have suffered so muchive been so disillusionatedim weary im wearyo that the angel of death would come and beckon me away this speech may be interpreted as follows a few nights since a great lady lady flamingo had cut miss amory and lady clavering she was quite mad because she could not get an invitation to lady drums ball it was the end of the season and nobody had proposed to her she had made no sensation at all she who was so much cleverer than any girl of the year and of the young ladies forming her special circle dora who had but five thousand pounds flora who had nothing and leonora who had red hair were going to be married and nobody had come for blanche amory you judge wisely about the world and about your position my dear miss blanche the major said the prince dont marry nowadays as you say unless the princess has a doosid deal of money in the funds or is a lady of his own rank the young folks of the great families marry into the great families if they havent fortune they have each others shoulders to push on in the world which is pretty nearly as good a girl with your fortune can scarcely hope for a great match but a girl with your genius and your admirable tact and fine manners with a clever husband by her side may make any place for herself in the world we are grown doosid republican talent ranks with birth and wealth now begad and a clever man with a clever wife may take any place they please miss amory did not of course in the least understand what major pendennis meant perhaps she thought over circumstances in her mind and asked herself could he be a negotiator for a former suitor of hers and could he mean pen no it was impossible he had been civil but nothing more so she said laughing who is the clever man and when will you bring him to me major pendennis i am dying to see him at this moment a servant threw open the door and announced mr henry foker at which name and at the appearance of our friend both the lady and the gentleman burst out laughing that is not the man major pendennis said he is engaged to his cousin lord gravesends daughter goodby my dear miss amory was pen growing worldly and should a man not get the experience of the world and lay it to his account he felt for his part as he said that he was growing very old very soon how this town forms and changes us he said once to warrington each had come in from his nights amusement and pen was smoking his pipe and recounting as his habit was to his friend the observations and adventures of the evening just past how i am changed he said from the simpleton boy at fairoaks who was fit to break his heart about his first love lady mirabel had a reception tonight and was as grave and collected as if she had been born a duchess and had never seen a trapdoor in her life she gave me the honor of a conversation and patronized me about walter lorraine quite kindly what condescension broke in warrington wasnt it pen said simply at which the other burst out laughing according to his wont is it possible he said that any body should think of patronizing the eminent author of walter lorraine you laugh at both of us pen said blushing a little i was coming to that myself she told me that she had not read the book as indeed i believe she never read a book in her life but that lady rockminster had and that the duchess of connaught pronounced it to be very clever in that case i said i should die happy for that to please those two ladies was in fact the great aim of my existence and having their approbation of course i need look for no other lady mirabel looked at me solemnly out of her fine eyes and said o indeed as if she understood me and then she asked me whether i went to the duchesss thursdays and when i said no hoped she should see me there and that i must try and get there every body went there every body who was in society and then we talked of the new embassador from timbuctoo and how he was better than the old one and how lady mary billington was going to marry a clergyman quite below her in rank and how lord and lady ringdove had fallen out three months after their marriage about tom pouter of the blues lady ringdoves cousin and so forth from the gravity of that woman you would have fancied she had been born in a palace and lived all the seasons of her life in belgravesquare and you i suppose you took your part in the conversation pretty well as the descendant of the earl your father and the heir of fairoaks castle warrington said yes i remember reading of the festivities which occurred when you came of age the countess gave a brilliant tea soiree to the neighboring nobility and the tenantry were regaled in the kitchen with a leg of mutton and a quart of ale the remains of the banquet were distributed among the poor of the village and the entrance to the park was illuminated until old john put the candle out on retiring to rest at his usual hour illustration my mother is not a countess said pen though she has very good blood in her veins too but commoner as she is i have never met a peeress who was more than her peer mr george and if you will come to fairoaks castle you shall judge for yourself of her and of my cousin too they are not so witty as the london women but they certainly are as well bred the thoughts of women in the country are turned to other objects than those which occupy your london ladies in the country a woman has her household and her poor her long calm days and long calm evenings devilish long warrington said and a great deal too calm ive tried em the monotony of that existence must be to a certain degree melancholylike the tune of a long ballad and its harmony grave and gentle sad and tender it would be unendurable else the loneliness of women in the country makes them of necessity soft and sentimental leading a life of calm duty constant routine mystic reveriea sort of nuns at largetoo much gayety or laughter would jar upon their almost sacred quiet and would be as out of place there as in a church where you go to sleep over the sermon warrington said you are a professed misogynist and hate the sex because i suspect you know very little about them mr pen continued with an air of considerable selfcomplacency if you dislike the women in the country for being too slow surely the london women ought to be fast enough for you the pace of london life is enormous how do people last at it i wondermale and female take a woman of the world follow her course through the season one asks how she can survive it or if she tumbles into a sleep at the end of august and lies torpid until the spring she goes into the world every night and sits watching her marriageable daughters dancing till long after dawn she has a nursery of little ones very likely at home to whom she administers example and affection having an eye likewise to breadandmilk catechism music and french and roast leg of mutton at one oclock she has to call upon ladies of her own station either domestically or in her public character in which she sits upon charity committees or ball committees or emigration committees or queens college committees and discharges i dont know what more duties of british stateswomanship she very likely keeps a poor visiting list has combinations with the clergyman about soup or flannel or proper religious teaching for the parish and if she lives in certain districts probably attends early church she has the newspapers to read and at least must know what her husbands party is about so as to be able to talk to her neighbor at dinner and it is a fact that she reads every new book that comes out for she can talk and very smartly and well about them all and you see them all upon her drawingroom table she has the cares of her household besides to make both ends meet to make the girls milliners bills appear not too dreadful to the father and paymaster of the family to snip off in secret a little extra article of expenditure here and there and convey it in the shape of a banknote to the boys at college or at sea to check the encroachments of tradesmen and housekeepers financial fallacies to keep upper and lower servants from jangling with one another and the household in order add to this that she has a secret taste for some art or science models in clay makes experiments in chemistry or plays in private on the violoncelloand i say without exaggeration many london ladies are doing thisand you have a character before you such as our ancestors never heard of and such as belongs entirely to our era and period of civilization ye gods how rapidly we live and grow in nine months mr paxton grows you a pine apple as large as a portmanteau whereas a little one no bigger than a dutch cheese took three years to attain his majority in old times and as the race of pineapples so is the race of man hoiaperwhats the greek for a pineapple warrington stop for mercys sake stop with the english and before you come to the greek warrington cried out laughing i never heard you make such a long speech or was aware that you had penetrated so deeply into the female mysteries who taught you all this and into whose boudoirs and nurseries have you been peeping while i was smoking my pipe and reading my book lying on my straw bed you are on the bank old boy content to watch the waves tossing in the winds and the struggles of others at sea pen said i am in the stream now and by jove i like it how rapidly we go down it hey strong and feeble old and youngthe metal pitchers and the earthen pitchersthe pretty little china boat swims gayly till the big bruised brazen one bumps him and sends him downeh vogue la galereyou see a man sink in the race and say goodby to himlook he has only dived under the other fellows legs and comes up shaking his pole and striking out ever so far ahead eh vogue la galere i say its good sport warringtonnot winning merely but playing well go in and win young un ill sit and mark the game warrington said surveying the ardent young fellow with an almost fatherly pleasure a generous fellow plays for the play a sordid one for the stake an old fogy sits by and smokes the pipe of tranquillity while jack and tom are pommeling each other in the ring why dont you come in george and have a turn with the gloves you are big enough and strong enough pen said dear old boy you are worth ten of me you are not quite as tall as goliath certainly the other answered with a laugh that was rough and yet tender and as for me i am disabled i had a fatal hit in early life i will tell you about it some day you may too meet with your master dont be too eager or too confident or too worldly my boy was pendennis becoming worldly or only seeing the world or both and is a man very wrong for being after all only a man which is the most reasonable and does his duty best he who stands aloof from the struggle of life calmly contemplating it or he who descends to the ground and takes his part in the contest that philosopher pen said had held a great place among the leaders of the world and enjoyed to the full what it had to give of rank and riches renown and pleasure who came wearyhearted out of it and said that all was vanity and vexation of spirit many a teacher of those whom we reverence and who steps out of his carriage up to his carved cathedral place shakes his lawn ruffles over the velvet cushion and cries out that the whole struggle is an accursed one and the works of the world are evil many a consciencestriken mystic flies from it altogether and shuts himself out from it within convent walls real or spiritual whence he can only look up to the sky and contemplate the heaven out of which there is no rest and no good but the earth where our feet are is the work of the same power as the immeasurable blue yonder in which the future lies into which we would peer who ordered toil as the condition of life ordered weariness ordered sickness ordered poverty failure successto this man a foremost place to the other a nameless struggle with the crowdto that a shameful fall or paralyzed limb or sudden accidentto each some work upon the ground he stands on until he is laid beneath it while they were talking the dawn came shining through the windows of the room and pen threw them open to receive the fresh morning air look george said he look and see the sun rise he sees the laborer on his way afield the workgirl plying her poor needle the lawyer at his desk perhaps the beauty smiling asleep upon her pillow of down or the jaded reveler reeling to bed or the fevered patient tossing on it or the doctor watching by it over the throes of the mother for the child that is to be born into the world to be born and to take his part in the suffering and struggling the tears and laughter the crime remorse love folly sorrow rest chapter vii miss amorys partners the noble henry foker of whom we have lost sight for a few pages has been in the mean while occupied as we might suppose a man of his constancy would be in the pursuit and indulgence of his allabsorbing passion of love i wish that a few of my youthful readers who are inclined to that amusement would take the trouble to calculate the time which is spent in the pursuit when they would find it to be one of the most costly occupations in which a man can possibly indulge what dont you sacrifice to it indeed young gentlemen and young ladies of illregulated minds many hours of your precious sleep in the first place in which you lie tossing and thinking about the adored object whence you come down late to breakfast when noon is advancing and all the family is long since away to its daily occupations then when you at length get to these occupations you pay no attention to them and engage in them with no ardor all your thoughts and powers of mind being fixed elsewhere then the days work being slurred over you neglect your friends and relatives your natural companions and usual associates in life that you may go and have a glance at the dear personage or a look up at her windows or a peep at her carriage in the park then at night the artless blandishments of home bore you mammas conversation palls upon you the dishes which that good soul prepares for the dinner of her favorite are sent away untasted the whole meal of life indeed except one particular plat has no relish life business family ties home all things useful and dear once become intolerable and you are never easy except when you are in pursuit of your flame such i believe to be not unfrequently the state of mind among illregulated young gentlemen and such indeed was mr h fokers condition who having been bred up to indulge in every propensity toward which he was inclined abandoned himself to this one with his usual selfish enthusiasm nor because he had given his friend arthur pendennis a great deal of good advice on a former occasion need men of the world wonder that mr foker became passions slave in his turn who among us has not given a plenty of the very best advice to his friends who has not preached and who has practiced to be sure you madam are perhaps a perfect being and never had a wrong thought in the whole course of your frigid and irreproachable existence or you sir are a great deal too strongminded to allow any foolish passion to interfere with your equanimity in chambers or your attendance on change you are so strong that you dont want any sympathy we dont give you any then we keep ours for the humble and weak that struggle and stumble and get up again and so march with the rest of mortals what need have you of a hand who never fall your serene virtue is never shaded by passion or ruffled by temptation or darkened by remorse compassion would be impertinence for such an angel but then with such a one companionship becomes intolerable you are from the very elevation of your virtue and high attributes of necessity lonely we cant reach up and talk familiarly with such potentates goodby then our way lies with humble folks and not with serene highnesses like you and we give notice that there are no perfect characters in this history except perhaps one little one and that one is not perfect either for she never knows to this day that she is perfect and with a deplorable misapprehension and perverseness of humility believes herself to be as great a sinner as need be this young person does not happen to be in london at the present period of our story and it is by no means for the like of her that mr henry fokers mind is agitated but what matters a few failings need we be angels male or female in order to be worshiped as such let us admire the diversity of the tastes of mankind and the oldest the ugliest the stupidest and most pompous the silliest and most vapid the greatest criminal tyrant booby bluebeard catherine hayes george barnwell among us we need never despair i have read of the passion of a transported pickpocket for a female convict each of them being advanced in age repulsive in person ignorant quarrelsome and given to drink that was as magnificent as the loves of cleopatra and antony or lancelot and guinever the passion which count borulawski the polish dwarf inspired in the bosom of the most beautiful baroness at the court of dresden is a matter with which we are all of us acquainted the flame which burned in the heart of young cornet tozer but the other day and caused him to run off and espouse mrs battersby who was old enough to be his mamma all these instances are told in the page of history or the newspaper column are we to be ashamed or pleased to think that our hearts are formed so that the biggest and highestplaced ajax among us may some day find himself prostrate before the pattens of his kitchenmaid as that there is no poverty or shame or crime which will not be supported hugged even with delight and cherished more closely than virtue would be by the perverse fidelity and admirable constant folly of a woman so then henry foker esquire longed after his love and cursed the fate which separated him from her when lord gravesends family retired to the country his lordship leaving his proxy with the venerable lord bagwig harry still remained lingering on in london certainly not much to the sorrow of lady ann to whom he was affianced and who did not in the least miss him wherever miss clavering went this infatuated young fellow continued to follow her and being aware that his engagement to his cousin was known in the world he was forced to make a mystery of his passion and confine it to his own breast so that it was so pent in there and pressed down that it is a wonder he did not explode some day with the stormy secret and perish collapsed after the outburst there had been a grand entertainment at gaunt house on one beautiful evening in june and the next days journals contained almost two columns of the names of the most closelyprinted nobility and gentry who had been honored with invitations to the ball among the guests were sir francis and lady clavering and miss amory for whom the indefatigable major pendennis had procured an invitation and our two young friends arthur and harry each exerted himself and danced a great deal with miss blanche as for the worthy major he assumed the charge of lady clavering and took care to introduce her to that department of the mansion where her ladyship specially distinguished herself namely the refreshmentroom where among pictures of titian and giorgione and regal portraits of vandyke and reynolds and enormous salvers of gold and silver and pyramids of large flowers and constellations of wax candlesin a manner perfectly regardless of expense in a worda supper was going on all night of how many creams jellies salads peaches white soups grapes pates galantines cups of tea champagne and so forth lady clavering partook it does not become us to say how much the major suffered as he followed the honest woman about calling to the solemn male attendants and lovely servantmaids and administering to lady claverings various wants with admirable patience nobody knows he never confessed he never allowed his agony to appear on his countenance in the least but with a constant kindness brought plate after plate to the begum mr wagg counted up all the dishes of which lady clavering partook as long as he could count but as he partook very freely himself of champagne during the evening his powers of calculation were not to be trusted at the close of the entertainment and he recommended mr honeyman lady steynes medical man to look carefully after the begum and to call and get news of her ladyship the next day sir francis clavering made his appearance and skulked for a while about the magnificent rooms but the company and the splendor which he met there were not to the baronets taste and after tossing off a tumbler of wine or two at the buffet he quitted gaunt house for the neighborhood of jermynstreet where his friends loder punter little moss abrams and captain skewball were assembled at the familiar green table in the rattle of the box and of their agreeable conversation sir franciss spirits rose to their accustomed point of feeble hilarity mr pynsent who had asked miss amory to dance came up on one occasion to claim her hand but scowls of recognition having already passed between him and mr arthur pendennis in the dancingroom arthur suddenly rose up and claimed miss amory as his partner for the present dance on which mr pynsent biting his lips and scowling yet more savagely withdrew with a profound bow saying that he gave up his claim there are some men who are always falling in ones way in life pynsent and pen had this view of each other and regarded each other accordingly what a confounded conceited provincial fool that is thought the one because he has written a twopenny novel his absurd head is turned and a kicking would take his conceit out of him what an impertinent idiot that man is remarked the other to his partner his soul is in downingstreet his neckcloth is foolscap his hair is sand his legs are rulers his vitals are tape and sealingwax he was a prig in his cradle and never laughed since he was born except three times at the same joke of his chief i have the same liking for that man miss amory that i have for cold boiled veal upon which blanche of course remarked that mr pendennis was wicked mechant perfectly abominable and wondered what he would say when her back was turned saysay that you have the most beautiful figure and the slimmest waist in the world blanchemiss amory i mean i beg your pardon another turn this music would make an alderman dance and you have left off tumbling when you waltz now blanche asked archly looking up at her partners face one falls and one gets up again in life blanche you know i used to call you so in old times and it is the prettiest name in the world besides i have practiced since then and with a great number of partners im afraid blanche said with a little sham sigh and a shrug of the shoulders and so in truth mr pen had practiced a good deal in this life and had undoubtedly arrived at being able to dance better if pendennis was impertinent in his talk foker on the other hand so bland and communicative on most occasions was entirely mum and melancholy when he danced with miss amory to clasp her slender waist was a rapture to whirl round the room with her was a delirium but to speak to her what could he say that was worthy of her what pearl of conversation could he bring that was fit for the acceptance of such a queen of love and wit as blanche it was she who made the talk when she was in the company of this lovestricken partner it was she who asked him how that dear little pony was and looked at him and thanked him with such a tender kindness and regret and refused the dear little pony with such a delicate sigh when he offered it i have nobody to ride with in london she said mamma is timid and her figure is not pretty on horseback sir francis never goes out with me he loves me likelike a stepdaughter oh how delightful it must be to have a fathera father mr foker oh uncommon said mr harry who enjoyed that blessing very calmly upon which and forgetting the sentimental air which she had just before assumed blanches gray eyes gazed at foker with such an arch twinkle that both of them burst out laughing and harry enraptured and at his ease began to entertain her with a variety of innocent prattlegood kind simple foker talk flavored with many expressions by no means to be discovered in dictionaries and relating to the personal history of himself or horses or other things dear and important to him or to persons in the ballroom then passing before them and about whose appearance or character mr harry spoke with artless freedom and a considerable dash of humor and it was blanche who when the conversation flagged and the youths modesty came rushing back and overpowering him knew how to reanimate her companion asked him questions about logwood and whether it was a pretty place whether he was a huntingman and whether he liked women to hunt in which case she was prepared to say that she adored huntingbut mr foker expressing his opinion against sporting females and pointing out lady bullfinch who happened to pass by as a horse godmother whom he had seen at cover with a cigar in her face blanche too expressed her detestation of the sports of the field and said it would make her shudder to think of a dear sweet little fox being killed on which foker danced and waltzed with renewed vigor and grace at the end of the waltzthe last waltz they had on that night blanche asked him about drummington and whether it was a fine house his cousins she had heard were very accomplished lord erith she had met and which of his cousins was his favorite was it not lady ann yes she was sure it was she sure by his looks and his blushes she was tired of dancing it was getting very late she must go to mamma and without another word she sprang away from harry fokers arm and seized upon pens who was swaggering about the dancingroom and again said mamma mammatake me to mamma dear mr pendennis transfixing harry with a parthian shot as she fled from him my lord steyne with garter and ribbon with a bald head and shining eyes and a collar of red whiskers round his face always looked grand upon an occasion of state and made a great effect upon lady clavering when he introduced himself to her at the request of the obsequious major pendennis with his own white and royal hand he handed to her ladyship a glass of wine said he had heard of her charming daughter and begged to be presented to her and at this very juncture mr arthur pendennis came up with the young lady on his arm the peer made a profound bow and blanche the deepest courtesy that ever was seen his lordship gave mr arthur pendennis his hand to shake said he had read his book which was very wicked and clever asked miss blanche if she had read it at which pen blushed and winced why blanche was one of the heroines of the novel blanche in black ringlets and a little altered was the neaera of walter lorraine blanche had read it the language of the eyes expressed her admiration and rapture at the performance this little play being achieved the marquis of steyne made other two profound bows to lady clavering and her daughter and passed on to some other of his guests at the splendid entertainment mamma and daughter were loud in their expression of admiration of the noble marquis so soon as his broad back was turned upon them he said they make a very nice couple whispered major pendennis to lady clavering did he now really mamma thought they would mamma was so flustered with the honor which had just been shown to her and with other intoxicating events of the evening that her good humor knew no bounds she laughed she winked and nodded knowingly at pen she tapped him on the arm with her fan she tapped blanche she tapped the major her contentment was boundless and her method of showing her joy equally expansive as the party went down the great staircase of gaunt house the morning had risen stark and clear over the black trees of the square the skies were tinged with pink and the cheeks of some of the people at the ballah how ghastly they looked that admirable and devoted major above allwho had been for hours by lady claverings side ministering to her and feeding her body with every thing that was nice and her ear with every thing that was sweet and flatteringoh what an object he was the rings round his eyes were of the color of bistre those orbs themselves were like the plovers eggs whereof lady clavering and blanche had each tasted the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes and a silver stubble like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl there he stood with admirable patience enduring uncomplainingly a silent agony knowing that people could see the state of his face for could he not himself perceive the condition of others males and females of his own agelonging to go to rest for hours past aware that suppers disagreed with him and yet having eaten a little so as to keep his friend lady clavering in good humor with twinges of rheumatism in the back and knees with weary feet burning in his varnished boots so tired oh so tired and longing for bed if a man struggling with hardship and bravely overcoming it is an object of admiration for the gods that power in whose chapels the old major was a faithful worshiper must have looked upward approvingly upon the constancy of pendenniss martyrdom there are sufferers in that cause as in the other the negroes in the service of mumbo jumbo tattoo and drill themselves with burning skewers with great fortitude and we read that the priests in the service of baal gashed themselves and bled freely you who can smash the idols do so with a good courage but do not be too fierce with the idolatersthey worship the best thing they know illustration the pendennises the elder and the younger waited with lady clavering and her daughter until her ladyships carriage was announced when the elders martyrdom may be said to have come to an end for the goodnatured begum insisted upon leaving him at his door in burystreet so he took the back seat of the carriage after a feeble bow or two and speech of thanks polite to the last and resolute in doing his duty the begum waved her dumpy little hand by way of farewell to arthur and foker and blanche smiled languidly out upon the young men thinking whether she looked very wan and green under her rosecolored hood and whether it was the mirrors at gaunt house or the fatigue and fever of her own eyes which made her fancy herself so pale arthur perhaps saw quite well how yellow blanche looked but did not attribute that peculiarity of her complexion to the effect of the lookingglasses or to any error in his sight or her own our young man of the world could use his eyes very keenly and could see blanches face pretty much as nature had made it but for poor foker it had a radiance which dazzled and blinded him he could see no more faults in it than in the sun which was now flaring over the housetops among other wicked london habits which pen had acquired the moralist will remark that he had got to keep very bad hours and often was going to bed at the time when sober country people were thinking of leaving it men get used to one hour as to another editors of newspapers coventgarden market people night cabmen and coffeesellers chimneysweeps and gentlemen and ladies of fashion who frequent balls are often quite lively at three or four oclock of a morning when ordinary mortals are snoring we have shown in the last chapter how pen was in a brisk condition of mind at this period inclined to smoke his cigar at ease and to speak freely foker and pen walked away from gaunt house then indulging in both the above amusements or rather pen talked and foker looked as if he wanted to say something pen was sarcastic and dandyfied when he had been in the company of great folks he could not help imitating some of their airs and tones and having a most lively imagination mistook himself for a person of importance very easily he rattled away and attacked this person and that sneered at lady john turnbulls bad french which her ladyship will introduce into all conversations in spite of the sneers of every body at mrs slack ropers extraordinary costume and sham jewels at the old dandies and the young ones at whom didnt he sneer and laugh you fire at everybody penyoure grown awful that you are foker said now youve pulled about blondels yellow wig and colchicums black one why dont you have a shy at a brown one hay you know whose i mean it got into lady claverings carriage under my uncles hat my uncle is a martyr foker my boy my uncle has been doing excruciating duties all night he likes to go to bed rather early he has a dreadful headache if he sits up and touches supper he always has the gout if he walks or stands much at a ball he has been sitting up and standing up and supping he has gone home to the gout and the headache and for my sake shall i make fun of the old boy no not for venice how do you mean that he has been doing it for your sake foker asked looking rather alarmed boy canst thou keep a secret if i impart it to thee pen cried out in high spirits art thou of good counsel wilt thou swear wilt thou be mum or wilt thou peach wilt thou be silent and hear or wilt thou speak and die and as he spoke flinging himself into an absurd theatrical attitude the men in the cabstand in piccadilly wondered and grinned at the antics of the two young swells what the doose are you driving at foker asked looking very much agitated pen however did not remark this agitation much but continued in the same bantering and excited vein henry friend of my youth he said and witness of my early follies though dull at thy books yet thou art not altogether deprived of sense nay blush not henrico thou hast a good portion of that and of courage and kindness too at the service of thy friends were i in a strait of poverty i would come to my fokers purse were i in grief i would discharge my grief upon his sympathizing bosom gammon pen go on foker said i would henrico upon thy studs and upon thy cambric worked by the hands of beauty to adorn the breast of valor know then friend of my boyhoods days that arthur pendennis of the upper temple studentatlaw feels that he is growing lonely and old care is furrowing his temples and baldness is busy with his crown shall we stop and have a drop of coffee at this stall it looks very hot and nice look how that cabman is blowing at his saucer no you wont aristocrat i resume my tale i am getting on in life i have got devilish little money i want some i am thinking of getting some and settling in life im thinking of settling im thinking of marrying old boy im thinking of becoming a moral man a steady port and sherry character with a good reputation in my quartier and a moderate establishment of two maids and a man with an occasional brougham to drive out mrs pendennis and a house near the parks for the accommodation of the children ha what sayest thou answer thy friend thou worthy child of beer speak i adjure thee by all thy vats but you aint got any money pen said the other still looking alarmed i aint no but she ave i tell thee there is gold in store for me not what you call money nursed in the lap of luxury and cradled on grains and drinking in wealth from a thousand mashtubs what do you know about money what is poverty to you is splendor to the hardy son of the humble apothecary you cant live without an establishment and your houses in town and country a snug little house somewhere off belgravia a brougham for my wife a decent cook and a fair bottle of wine for my friends at home sometimes these simple necessaries suffice for me my foker and here pendennis began to look more serious without bantering further pen continued ive rather serious thoughts of settling and marrying no man can get on in the world without some money at his back you must have a certain stake to begin with before you can go in and play the great game who knows that im not going to try old fellow worse men than i have won at it and as i have not got enough capital from my fathers i must get some by my wifethats all they were walking down grosvenorstreet as they talked or rather as pen talked in the selfish fullness of his heart and mr pen must have been too much occupied with his own affairs to remark the concern and agitation of his neighbor for he continued we are no longer children you know you and i harry bah the time of our romance has passed away we dont marry for passion but for prudence and for establishment what do you take your cousin for because she is a nice girl and an earls daughter and the old folks wish it and that sort of thing and you pendennis asked foker you aint very fond of the girlyoure going to marry pen shrugged his shoulders comme ca said he i like her well enough shes pretty enough shes clever enough i think shell do very well and she has got money enoughthats the great point psha you know who she is dont you i thought you were sweet on her yourself one night when we dined with her mamma its little amory ii thought so foker said and has she accepted you not quite arthur replied with a confident smile which seemed to say i have but to ask and she comes to me that instant oh not quite said foker and he broke out with such a dreadful laugh that pen for the first time turned his thoughts from himself toward his companion and was struck by the others ghastly pale face my dear fellow fo whats the matter youre ill pen said in a tone of real concern you think it was the champagne at gaunt house dont you it aint that come in let me talk to you for a minute ill tell you what it is dit let me tell somebody foker said they were at mr fokers door by this time and opening it harry walked with his friend into his apartments which were situated in the back part of the house and behind the family diningroom where the elder foker received his guests surrounded by pictures of himself his wife his infant son on a donkey and the late earl of gravesend in his robes as a peer foker and pen passed by this chamber now closed with deathlike shutters and entered into the young mans own quarters dusky streams of sunbeams were playing into that room and lighting up poor harrys gallery of dancing girls and opera nymphs with flickering illuminations look here i cant help telling you pen he said ever since the night we dined there im so fond of that girl that i think i shall die if i dont get her i feel as if i should go mad sometimes i cant stand it pen i couldnt bear to hear you talking about her just now about marrying her only because shes money ah pen that aint the question in marrying id bet any thing it aint talking about money and such a girl as that itsitswhatdyecallemyou know what i meani aint good at talkingsacrilege then if shed have me id take and sweep a crossing that i would poor fo i dont think that would tempt her pen said eying his friend with a great deal of real goodnature and pity she is not a girl for love and a cottage she ought to be a duchess i know that very well and i know she wouldnt take me unless i could make her a great place in the worldfor i aint good for any thing myself muchi aint clever and that sort of thing foker said sadly if i had all the diamonds that all the duchesses and marchionesses had on tonight wouldnt i put em in her lap but whats the use of talking im booked for another race its that kills me pen i cant get out of it though i die i cant get out of it and though my cousins a nice girl and i like her very well and that yet i hadnt seen this one when our governors settled that matter between us and when you talked just now about her doing very well and about her having money enough for both of you i thought to myself it isnt money or mere liking a girl that ought to be enough to make a fellow marry he may marry and find he likes somebody else better all the money in the world wont make you happy then look at me ive plenty of money or shall have out of the mashtubs as you call em my governor thought hed made it all right for me in settling my marriage with my cousin i tell you it wont do and when lady ann has got her husband it wont be happy for either of us and shell have the most miserable beggar in town poor old fellow pen said with rather a cheap magnanimity i wish i could help you i had no idea of this and that you were so wild about the girl do you think she would have you without your money no do you think your father would agree to break off your engagement with your cousin you know him very well and that he would cast you off rather than do so the unhappy foker only groaned a reply flinging himself prostrate on the sofa face forward his head in his hands as for my affair pen went onmy dear fellow if i had thought matters were so critical with you at least i would not have pained you by choosing you as my confidant and my business is not serious at least not as yet i have not spoken a word about it to miss amory very likely she would not have me if i asked her only i have had a great deal of talk about it with my uncle who says that the match might be an eligible one for me im ambitious and im poor and it appears lady clavering will give her a good deal of money and sir francis might be got tonever mind the rest nothing is settled harry they are going out of town directly i promise you i wont ask her before she goes theres no hurry theres time for every body but suppose you got her foker remember what you said about marriages just now and the misery of a man who doesnt care for his wife and what sort of a wife would you have who didnt care for her husband but she would care for me said foker from his sofathat is i think she would last night only as we were dancing she said what did she say pen cried starting up in great wrath but he saw his own meaning more clearly than foker and broke off with a laughwell never mind what she said harry miss amory is a clever girl and says numbers of civil thingsto youto me perhapsand who the deuce knows to whom besides nothings settled old boy at least my heart wont break if i dont get her win her if you can and i wish you joy of her goodby dont think about what i said to you i was excited and confoundedly thirsty in those hot rooms and didnt i suppose put enough seltzer water into the champagne good night ill keep your counsel too mum is the word between us and let there be a fair fight and let the best man win as peter crawley says so saying mr arthur pendennis giving a very queer and rather dangerous look at his companion shook him by the hand with something of that sort of cordiality which befitted his just repeated simile of the boxingmatch and which mr bendigo displays when he shakes hands with mr gaunt before they fight each other for the champions belt and two hundred pounds a side foker returned his friends salute with an imploring look and a piteous squeeze of the hand sank back on his cushions again and pen putting on his hat strode forth into the air and almost over the body of the matutinal housemaid who was rubbing the steps at the door and so he wants her too does he thought pen as he marched alongand noted within himself with a fatal keenness of perception and almost an infernal mischief that the very pains and tortures which that honest heart of fokers was suffering gave a zest and an impetus to his own pursuit of blanche if pursuit that might be called which had been no pursuit as yet but mere sport and idle dallying she said something to him did she perhaps she gave him the fellow flower to this and he took out of his coat and twiddled in his thumb and finger a poor little shriveled crumpled bud that had faded and blackened with the heat and flare of the night i wonder to how many more she has given her artless tokens of affectionthe little flirtand he flung his into the gutter where the water may have refreshed it and where any amateur of rosebuds may have picked it up and then bethinking him that the day was quite bright and that the passersby might be staring at his beard and white neckcloth our modest young gentleman took a cab and drove to the temple ah is this the boy that prayed at his mothers knee but a few years since and for whom very likely at this hour of morning she is praying is this jaded and selfish worldling the lad who a short while back was ready to fling away his worldly all his hope his ambition his chance of life for his love this is the man you are proud of old pendennis you boast of having formed him and of having reasoned him out of his absurd romance and follyand groaning in your bed over your pains and rheumatisms satisfy yourself still by thinking that at last that lad will do something to better himself in life and that the pendennises will take a good place in the world and is he the only one who in his progress through this dark life goes willfully or fatally astray while the natural truth and love which should illumine him grew dim in the poisoned air and suffice to light him no more when pen was gone away poor harry foker got up from the sofa and taking out from his waistcoatthe splendidly buttoned the gorgeously embroidered the work of his mammaa little white rosebud he drew from his dressingcase also the maternal present a pair of scissors with which he nipped carefully the stalk of the flower and placing it in a glass of water opposite his bed he sought refuge there from care and bitter remembrances it is to be presumed that miss blanche amory had more than one rose in her bouquet and why should not the kind young creature give out of her superfluity and make as many partners as possible happy chapter viii monseigneur samuse illustration the exertions of that last night at gaunt house had proved almost too much for major pendennis and as soon as he could move his weary old body with safety he transported himself groaning to buxton and sought relief in the healing waters of that place parliament broke up sir francis clavering and family left town and the affairs which we have just mentioned to the reader were not advanced in the brief interval of a few days or weeks which have occurred between this and the last chapter the town was however emptied since then the season was now come to a conclusion pens neighbors the lawyers were gone upon circuit and his more fashionable friends had taken their passports for the continent or had fled for health or excitement to the scotch moors scarce a man was to be seen in the baywindows of the clubs or on the solitary pallmall pavement the red jackets had disappeared from before the palacegate the tradesmen of st jamess were abroad taking their pleasure the tailors had grown mustaches and were gone up the rhine the bootmakers were at ems or baden blushing when they met their customers at those places of recreation or punting beside their creditors at the gambling tables the clergymen of st jamess only preached to half a congregation in which there was not a single sinner of distinction the band in kensington gardens had shut up their instruments of brass and trumpets of silver only two or three old flies and chaises crawled by the banks of the serpentine and clarence bulbul who was retained in town by his arduous duties as a treasury clerk when he took his afternoon ride in rotten row compared its loneliness to the vastness of the arabian desert and himself to a bedouin wending his way through that dusty solitude warrington stowed away a quantity of cavendish tobacco in his carpet bag and betook himself as his custom was in the vacation to his brothers house in norfolk pen was left alone in chambers for a while for this man of fashion could not quit the metropolis when he chose always and was at present detained by the affairs of his newspaper the pall mall gazette of which he acted as the editor and charge daffaires during the temporary absence of the chief captain shandon who was with his family at the salutary wateringplace of boulogne sur mer although as we have seen mr pen had pronounced himself for years past to be a man perfectly blase and wearied of life yet the truth is that he was an exceedingly healthy young fellow still with a fine appetite which he satisfied with the greatest relish and satisfaction at least once a day and a constant desire for society which showed him to be any thing but misanthropical if he could not get a good dinner he sat down to a bad one with perfect contentment if he could not procure the company of witty or great or beautiful persons he put up with any society that came to hand and was perfectly satisfied in a tavernparlor or on board a greenwich steamboat or in a jaunt to hampstead with mr finucane his colleague at the pall mall gazette or in a visit to the summer theaters across the river or to the royal gardens of vauxhall where he was on terms of friendship with the great simpson and where he shook the principal comic singer or the lovely equestrian of the arena by the hand and while he could watch the grimaces or the graces of these with a satiric humor that was not deprived of sympathy he could look on with an eye of kindness at the lookers on too at the roystering youth bent upon enjoyment and here taking it at the honest parents with their delighted children laughing and clapping their hands at the show at the poor outcasts whose laughter was less innocent though perhaps louder and who brought their shame and their youth here to dance and be merry till the dawn at least and to get bread and drown care of this sympathy with all conditions of men arthur often boasted he was pleased to possess it and said that he hoped thus to the last he should retain it as another man has an ardor for art or music or natural science mr pen said that anthropology was his favorite pursuit and had his eyes always eagerly open to its infinite varieties and beauties contemplating with an unfailing delight all specimens of it in all places to which he resorted whether it was the coqueting of a wrinkled dowager in a ballroom or a highbred young beauty blushing in her prime there whether it was a hulking guardsman coaxing a servantgirl in the park or innocent little tommy that was feeding the ducks while the nurse listened and indeed a man whose heart is pretty clean can indulge in this pursuit with an enjoyment that never ceases and is only perhaps the more keen because it is secret and has a touch of sadness in it because he is of his mood and humor lonely and apart although not alone yes pen used to brag and talk in his impetuous way to warrington i was in love so fiercely in my youth that i have burned out that flame forever i think and if ever i marry it will be a marriage of reason that i will make with a wellbred goodtempered goodlooking person who has a little money and so forth that will cushion our carriage in its course through life as for romance it is all done i have spent that out and am old before my timeim proud of it stuff growled the other you fancied you were getting bald the other day and bragged about it as you do about every thing but you began to use the bearsgrease pot directly the hairdresser told you and are scented like a barber ever since you are diogenes the other answered and you want every man to live in a tub like yourself violets smell better than stale tobacco you grizzly old cynic but mr pen was blushing while he made this reply to his unromantical friend and indeed cared a great deal more about himself still than such a philosopher perhaps should have done indeed considering that he was careless about the world mr pen ornamented his person with no small pains in order to make himself agreeable to it and for a weary pilgrim as he was wore very tight boots and bright varnish it was in this dull season of the year then of a shining friday night in autumn that mr pendennis having completed at his newspaper office a brilliant leading articlesuch as captain shandon himself might have written had the captain been in good humor and inclined to work which he never would do except under compulsionthat mr arthur pendennis having written his article and reviewed it approvingly as it lay before him in its wet proofsheet at the office of the paper bethought him that he would cross the water and regale himself with the fireworks and other amusements of vauxhall so he affably put in his pocket the order which admitted editor of pall mall gazette and friend to that place of recreation and paid with the coin of the realm a sufficient sum to enable him to cross waterloo bridge the walk thence to the gardens was pleasant the stars were shining in the skies above looking down upon the royal property whence the rockets and roman candles had not yet ascended to outshine the stars before you enter the enchanted ground where twenty thousand additional lamps are burned every night as usual most of us have passed through the black and dreary passage and wickets which hide the splendors of vauxhall from uninitiated men in the walls of this passage are two holes strongly illuminated in the midst of which you see two gentlemen at desks where they will take either your money as a private individual or your order of admission if you are provided with that passport to the gardens pen went to exhibit his ticket at the lastnamed orifice where however a gentleman and two ladies were already in parley before him the gentleman whose hat was very much on one side and who wore a short and shabby cloak in an excessively smart manner was crying out in a voice which pen at once recognized bedad sir if ye doubt me honor will ye obleege me by stipping out of that box and lor capting cried the elder lady dont bother me said the man in the box and ask mr hodgen himself whos in the gyardens to let these leedies pass dont be froightened me dear madam im not going to quarl with this gintleman at any reet before leedies will ye go sir and desoire mr hodgen whose orther i keem in with and hes me most intemate friend and i know hes goan to sing the body snatcher here tonoight with captain costigans compliments to stip out and let in the leedies for meself sir oive seen vauxhall and i scawrun any interfayrance on moi account but for these leedies one of them has never been there and oi should think yed harly take advantage of me misfartune in losing the tickut to deproive her of her pleasure it aint no use captain i cant go about your business the checktaker said on which the captain swore an oath and the elder lady said lor ow provokin as for the young one she looked up at the captain and said never mind captain costigan im sure i dont want to go at all come away mamma and with this although she did not want to go at all her feelings overcame her and she began to cry me poor child the captain said can ye see that sir and will ye not let this innocent creature in it aint my business cried the doorkeeper peevishly out of the illuminated box and at this minute arthur came up and recognizing costigan said dont you know me captain pendennis and he took off his hat and made a bow to the two ladies me dear boy me dear friend cried the captain extending toward pendennis the grasp of friendship and he rapidly explained to the other what he called a most unluckee conthratong he had an order for vauxhall admitting two from mr hodgen then within the gardens and singing as he did at the back kitchen and the nobilitys concerts the body snatcher the death of general wolfe the banner of blood and other favorite melodies and having this order for the admission of two persons he thought that it would admit three and had come accordingly to the gardens with his friends but on his way captain costigan had lost the paper of admissionit was not forthcoming at all and the leedies must go back again to the great disappointment of one of them as pendennis saw arthur had a great deal of good nature for everybody and sympathized with the misfortunes of all sorts of people how could he refuse his sympathy in such a case as this he had seen the innocent face as it looked up to the captain the appealing look of the girl the piteous quiver of the mouth and the final outburst of tears if it had been his last guinea in the world he must have paid it to have given the poor little thing pleasure she turned the sad imploring eyes away directly they lighted upon a stranger and began to wipe them with her handkerchief arthur looked very handsome and kind as he stood before the women with his hat off blushing bowing generous a gentleman who are they he asked of himself he thought he had seen the elder lady before if i can be of any service to you captain costigan the young man said i hope you will command me is there any difficulty about taking these ladies into the garden will you kindly make use of my purse andi have a ticket myself which will admit twoi hope maam you will permit me the first impulse of the prince of fairoaks was to pay for the whole party and to make away with his newspaper order as poor costigan had done with his own ticket but his instinct and the appearance of the two women told him that they would be better pleased if he did not give himself the airs of a grand seigneur and he handed his purse to costigan and laughingly pulled out his ticket with one hand as he offered the other to the elder of the ladiesladies was not the wordthey had bonnets and shawls and collars and ribbons and the youngest showed a pretty little foot and boot under her modest gray gown but his highness of fairoaks was courteous to every person who wore a petticoat whatever its texture was and the humbler the wearer only the more stately and polite in his demeanor fanny take the gentlemans arm the elder said since you will be so very kind ive seen you often come in at our gate sir and go in to captain strongs at no fanny made a little courtesy and put her hand under arthurs arm it had on a shabby little glove but it was pretty and small she was not a child but she was scarcely a woman as yet her tears had dried up and her cheek mantled with youthful blushes and her eyes glistened with pleasure and gratitude as she looked up into arthurs kind face arthur in a protecting way put his other hand upon the little one resting on his arm fannys a very pretty little name he said and so you know me do you we keep the lodge sir at shepherds inn fanny said with a courtesy and ive never been at vauxhall sir and pa didnt like me to goandandoolaw how beautiful she shrank back as she spoke starting with wonder and delight as she saw the royal gardens blaze before her with a hundred million of lamps with a splendor such as the finest fairy tale the finest pantomime she had ever witnessed at the theater had never realized pen was pleased with her pleasure and pressed to his side the little hand which clung so kindly to him what would i not give for a little of this pleasure said the blase young man your purse pendennis me dear boy said the captains voice behind him will ye count it its all roightnoye thrust in old jack costigan he thrusts me ye see madam yeve been me preserver pen ive known um since choildhood mrs bolton hes the proproietor of fairoaks castle and manys the cooper of clart ive dthrunk there with the first nobilitee of his native counteemr pendennis yeve been me preserver and oi thank ye me daughtther will thank ye mr simpson your humble servant sir if pen was magnificent in his courtesy to the ladies what was his splendor in comparison to captain costigans bowing here and there and crying bravo to the singers a man descended like costigan from a long line of hibernian kings chieftains and other magnates and sheriffs of the county had of course too much dignity and selfrespect to walk arruminarrum as the captain phrased it with a lady who occasionally swept his room out and cooked his mutton chops in the course of their journey from shepherds inn to vauxhall gardens captain costigan had walked by the side of the two ladies in a patronizing and affable manner pointing out to them the edifices worthy of note and discoursing according to his wont about other cities and countries which he had visited and the people of rank and fashion with whom he had the honor of an acquaintance nor could it be expected nor indeed did mrs bolton expect that arrived in the royal property and strongly illuminated by the flare of the twenty thousand additional lamps the captain would relax from his dignity and give an arm to a lady who was in fact little better than a housekeeper or charwoman but pen on his part had no such scruples miss fanny bolton did not make his bed nor sweep his chambers and he did not choose to let go his pretty little partner as for fanny her color heightened and her bright eyes shone the brighter with pleasure as she leaned for protection on the arm of such a fine gentleman as mr pen and she looked at numbers of other ladies in the place and at scores of other gentlemen under whose protection they were walking here and there and she thought that her gentleman was handsomer and grander looking than any other gent in the place of course there were votaries of pleasure of all ranks thererakish young surgeons fast young clerks and commercialists occasional dandies of the guard regiments and the rest old lord colchicum was there in attendance upon mademoiselle caracoline who had been riding in the ring and who talked her native french very loud and used idiomatic expressions of exceeding strength as she walked about leaning on the arm of his lordship colchicum was in attendance upon mademoiselle caracoline little tom tufthunt was in attendance upon lord colchicum and rather pleased too with his position when don juan scales the wall theres never a want of a leporello to hold the ladder tom tufthunt was quite happy to act as friend to the elderly viscount and to carve the fowl and to make the salad at supper when pen and his young lady met the viscounts party that noble peer only gave arthur a passing leer of recognition as his lordships eyes passed from pens face under the bonnet of pens companion but tom tufthunt wagged his head very goodnaturedly at mr arthur and said how are you old boy and looked extremely knowing at the godfather of this history that is the great rider at astleys i have seen her there miss bolton said looking after mademoiselle caracoline and who is that old man is it not the gentleman in the ring that is lord viscount colchicum miss fanny said pen with an air of protection he meant no harm he was pleased to patronize the young girl and he was not displeased that she should be so pretty and that she should be hanging upon his arm and that yonder elderly don juan should have seen her there fanny was very pretty her eyes were dark and brilliant her teeth were like little pearls her mouth was almost as red as mademoiselle caracolines when the latter had put on her vermilion and what a difference there was between the ones voice and the others between the girls laugh and the womans it was only very lately indeed that fanny when looking in the little glass over the bowscostigan mantlepiece as she was dusting it had begun to suspect that she was a beauty but a year ago she was a clumsy gawky girl at whom her father sneered and of whom the girls at the dayschool miss minifers newcastlestreet strand miss m the younger sister took the leading business at the norwich circuit in and she herself had played for two seasons with some credit treo trsw until she fell down a trapdoor and broke her leg the girls at fannys school we say took no account of her and thought her a dowdy little creature as long as she remained under miss minifers instruction and it was unremarked and almost unseen in the dark porters lodge of shepherds inn that this little flower bloomed into beauty so this young person hung upon mr pens arm and they paced the gardens together empty as london was there were still some two millions of people left lingering about it and among them one or two of the acquaintances of mr arthur pendennis among them silent and alone pale with his hands in his pockets and a rueful nod of the head to arthur as they met passed henry foker esq young henry was trying to ease his mind by moving from place to place and from excitement to excitement but he thought about blanche as he sauntered in the dark walks he thought about blanche as he looked at the devices of the lamps he consulted the fortuneteller about her and was disappointed when that gipsy told him that he was in love with a dark lady who would make him happy and at the concert though mr momus sang his most stunning comic songs and asked his most astonishing riddles never did a kind smile come to visit fokers lips in fact he never heard mr momus at all pen and miss bolton were hard by listening to the same concert and the latter remarked and pen laughed at mr fokers woebegone face fanny asked what it was that made that oddlooking little man so dismal i think he is crossed in love pen said isnt that enough to make any man dismal fanny and he looked down at her splendidly protecting her like egmont at clara in goethes play or leicester at amy in scotts novel crossed in love is he poor gentleman said fanny with a sigh and her eyes turned round toward him with no little kindness and pitybut harry did not see the beautiful dark eyes illustration howdydo mr pendennisa voice broke in hereit was that of a young man in a large white coat with a red neckcloth over which a dingy short collar was turned so as to exhibit a dubious neckwith a large pin of bullion or other metal and an imaginative waistcoat with exceedingly fanciful glass buttons and trowsers that cried with a loud voice come look at me and see how cheap and tawdry i am my master what a dirty buck and a little stick in one pocket of his coat and a lady in pink satin on the other armhowdydoforget me i dare say huxterclavering how do you do mr huxter the prince of fairoaks said in his most princely manner i hope you are very well pretty bobbish thanky and mr huxter wagged his head i say pendennis youve been coming it uncommon strong since we had the row at wapshots dont you remember great author hay go about with the swells saw your name in the morning post i suppose youre too much of a swell to come and have a bit of supper with an old friendcharterhouselane tomorrow nightsome devilish good fellows from bartholomews and some stunning gin punch heres my card and with this mr huxter released his hand from the pocket where his cane was and pulling off the top of his card case with his teeth produced thence a visiting ticket which he handed to pen you are exceedingly kind i am sure said pen but i regret that i have an engagement which will take me out of town tomorrow night and the marquis of fairoaks wondering that such a creature as this could have the audacity to give him a card put mr huxters card into his waistcoat pocket with a lofty courtesy possibly mr samuel huxter was not aware that there was any great social difference between mr arthur pendennis and himself mr huxters father was a surgeon and apothecary at clavering just as mr pendenniss papa had been a surgeon and apothecary at bath but the impudence of some men is beyond all calculation well old fellow never mind said mr huxter who always frank and familiar was from vinous excitement even more affable than usual if ever you are passing look up at our placeim mostly at home saturdays and theres generally a cheese in the cupboard ta ta theres the bell for the fireworks ringing come along mary and he set off running with the rest of the crowd in the direction of the fireworks so did pen presently when this agreeable youth was out of sight begin to run with his little companion mrs bolton following after them with captain costigan at her side but the captain was too majestic and dignified in his movements to run for friend or enemy and he pursued his course with the usual jaunty swagger which distinguished his steps so that he and his companion were speedily distanced by pen and miss fanny perhaps arthur forgot or perhaps he did not choose to remember that the elder couple had no money in their pockets as had been proved by their adventure at the entrance of the gardens howbeit pen paid a couple of shillings for himself and his partner and with her hanging close on his arm scaled the staircase which leads to the firework gallery the captain and mamma might have followed them if they liked but arthur and fanny were too busy to look back people were pushing and squeezing there beside and behind them one eager individual rushed by fanny and elbowed her so that she fell back with a little cry upon which of course arthur caught her adroitly in his arms and just for protection kept her so defended until they mounted the stair and took their places poor foker sate alone on one of the highest benches his face illuminated by the fireworks or in their absence by the moon arthur saw him and laughed but did not occupy himself about his friend much he was engaged with fanny how she wondered how happy she was how she cried o o o as the rockets soared into the air and showered down in azure and emerald and vermilion as these wonders blazed and disappeared before her the little girl thrilled and trembled with delight at arthurs sideher hand was under his arm still he felt it pressing him as she looked up delighted illustration how beautiful they are sir she cried dont call me sir fanny arthur said a quick blush rushed up into the girls face what shall i call you she said in a low voice sweet and tremulous what would you wish me to say sir again fanny well i forgot it is best so my dear pendennis said very kindly and gently i may call you fanny o yes she said and the little hand pressed his arm once more very eagerly and the girl clung to him so that he could feel her heart beating on his shoulder i may call you fanny because you are a young girl and a good girl fanny and i am an old gentleman but you mustnt call me any thing but sir or mr pendennis if you like for we live in very different stations fanny and dont think i speak unkindly andand why do you take your hand away fanny are you afraid of me do you think i would hurt you not for all the world my dear little girl andand look how beautiful the moon and stars are and how calmly they shine when the rockets have gone out and the noisy wheels have done hissing and blazing when i came here tonight i did not think i should have had such a pretty little companion to sit by my side and see these fine fireworks you must know i live by myself and work very hard i write in books and newspapers fanny and i was quite tired out and expected to sit alone all night anddont cry my dear dear little girl here pen broke out rapidly putting an end to the calm oration which he had begun to deliver for the sight of a womans tears always put his nerves in a quiver and he began forthwith to coax her and soothe her and to utter a hundredandtwenty little ejaculations of pity and sympathy which need not be repeated here because they would be absurd in print so would a mothers talk to a child be absurd in print so would a lovers to his bride that sweet artless poetry bears no translation and is too subtle for grammarians clumsy definitions you have but the same four letters to describe the salute which you perform on your grandmothers forehead and that which you bestow on the sacred cheek of your mistress but the same four letters and not one of them a labial do we mean to hint that mr arthur pendennis made any use of the monosyllable in question not so in the first place it was dark the fireworks were over and nobody could see him secondly he was not a man to have this kind of secret and tell it thirdly and lastly let the honest fellow who has kissed a pretty girl say what would have been his own conduct in such a delicate juncture well the truth is that however you may suspect him and whatever you would have done under the circumstances or mr pen would have liked to do he behaved honestly and like a man i will not play with this little girls heart he said within himself and forget my own or her honor she seems to have a great deal of dangerous and rather contagious sensibility and i am very glad the fireworks are over and that i can take her back to her mother come along fanny mind the steps and lean on me dont stumble you heedless little thing this is the way and there is your mamma at the door and there indeed mrs bolton was unquiet in spirit and grasping her umbrella she seized fanny with maternal fierceness and eagerness and uttered some rapid abuse to the girl in an under tone the expression in captain costigans eyestanding behind the matron and winking at pendennis from under his hatwas i am bound to say indefinably humorous it was so much so that pen could not refrain from bursting into a laugh you should have taken my arm mrs bolton he said offering it i am very glad to bring miss fanny back quite safe to you we thought you would have followed us up into the gallery we enjoyed the fireworks didnt we oh yes said miss fanny with rather a demure look and the bouquet was magnificent said pen and it is ten hours since i had any thing to eat ladies and i wish you would permit me to invite you to supper dad said costigan id loike a snack tu only i forgawt me purse or i should have invoited these leedies to a colleetion mrs bolton with considerable asperity said she ad an eadache and would much rather go home a lobster salad is the best thing in the world for a headache pen said gallantly and a glass of wine im sure will do you good come mrs bolton be kind to me and oblige me i shant have the heart to sup without you and upon my word i have had no dinner give me your arm give me the umbrella costigan im sure youll take care of miss fanny and i shall think mrs bolton angry with me unless she will favor me with her society and we will all sup quietly and go back in a cab together the cab the lobster salad the frank and goodhumored look of pendennis as he smilingly invited the worthy matron subdued her suspicions and her anger since he would be so obliging she thought she could take a little bit of lobster and so they all marched away to a box and costigan called for a waither with such a loud and belligerent voice as caused one of those officials instantly to run to him the carte was examined on the wall and fanny was asked to choose her favorite dish upon which the young creature said she was fond of lobster too but also owned to a partiality for raspberrytart this delicacy was provided by pen and a bottle of the most frisky champagne was moreover ordered for the delight of the ladies little fanny drank this what other sweet intoxication had she not drunk in the course of the night when the supper which was very brisk and gay was over and captain costigan and mrs bolton had partaken of some of the rack punch that is so fragrant at vauxhall the bill was called and discharged by pen with great generosity like a foin young english gentleman of th olden toime be jove costigan enthusiastically remarked and as when they went out of the box he stepped forward and gave mrs bolton his arm fanny fell to pens lot and the young people walked away in high goodhumor together in the wake of their seniors the champagne and the rack punch though taken in moderation by all persons except perhaps poor cos who lurched ever so little in his gait had set them in high spirits and good humor so that fanny began to skip and move her brisk little feet in time to the band which was playing waltzes and galops for the dancers as they came up to the dancing the music and fannys feet seemed to go quicker together she seemed to spring as if naturally from the ground and as if she required repression to keep her there shouldnt you like a turn said the prince of fairoaks what fun it would be mrs bolton maam do let me take her once round upon which mr costigan said off wid you and mrs bolton not refusing indeed she was an old warhorse and would have liked at the trumpets sound to have entered the arena herself fannys shawl was off her back in a minute and she and arthur were whirling round in a waltz in the midst of a great deal of queer but exceedingly joyful company pen had no mishap this time with little fanny as he had with miss blanche in old days at least there was no mishap of his making the pair danced away with great agility and contentment first a waltz then a galop then a waltz again until in the second waltz they were bumped by another couple who had joined the terpsichorean choir this was mr huxter and his pink satin young friend of whom we have already had a glimpse mr huxter very probably had been also partaking of supper for he was even more excited now than at the time when he had previously claimed pens acquaintance and having run against arthur and his partner and nearly knocked them down this amiable gentleman of course began to abuse the people whom he had injured and broke out into a volley of slang against the unoffending couple now then stoopid dont keep the ground if you cant dance old slow coach the young surgeon roared out using at the same time other expressions far more emphatic and was joined in his abuse by the shrill language and laughter of his partner to the interruption of the ball the terror of poor little fanny and the immense indignation of pen arthur was furious and not so angry at the quarrel as at the shame attending it a battle with a fellow like that a row in a public garden and with a porters daughter on his arm what a position for arthur pendennis he drew poor little fanny hastily away from the dancers to her mother and wished that lady and costigan and poor fanny underground rather than there in his companionship and under his protection when huxter commenced his attack that free spoken young gentleman had not seen who was his opponent and directly he was aware that it was arthur whom he had insulted he began to make apologies hold your stoopid tongue mary he said to his partner its an old friend and crony at home i beg pardon pendennis wasnt aware it was you old boy mr huxter had been one of the boys of the clavering school who had been present at a combat which has been mentioned in the early part of this story when young pen knocked down the biggest champion of the academy and huxter knew that it was dangerous to quarrel with arthur his apologies were as odious to the other as his abuse had been pen stopped his tipsy remonstrances by telling him to hold his tongue and desiring him not to use his pendenniss name in that place or any other and he walked out of the gardens with a titter behind him from the crowd every one of whom he would have liked to massacre for having been witness to the degrading broil he walked out of the gardens quite forgetting poor little fanny who came trembling behind him with her mother and the stately costigan he was brought back to himself by a word from the captain who touched him on the shoulder just as they were passing the inner gate theres no rayadmittance except ye pay again the captain said hadnt i better go back and take the fellow your message pen burst out laughing take him a message do you think i would fight with such a fellow as that he asked no no dont dont cried out little fanny how can you be so wicked captain costigan the captain muttered something about honor and winked knowingly at pen but arthur said gallantly no fanny dont be frightened it was my fault to have danced in such a place i beg your pardon to have asked you to dance there and he gave her his arm once more and called a cab and put his three friends into it he was about to pay the driver and to take another carriage for himself when little fanny still alarmed put her little hand out and caught him by the coat and implored him and besought him to come in will nothing satisfy you said pen in great goodhumor that i am not going back to fight him well i will come home with you drive to shepherds inn cab the cab drove to its destination arthur was immensely pleased by the girls solicitude about him her tender terrors quite made him forget his previous annoyance pen put the ladies into their lodge having shaken hands kindly with both of them and the captain again whispered to him that he would see um in the morning if he was inclined and take his message to that scounthrel but the captain was in his usual condition when he made the proposal and pen was perfectly sure that neither he nor mr huxter when they awoke would remember any thing about the dispute chapter ix a visit of politeness illustration costigan never roused pen from his slumbers there was no hostile message from mr huxter to disturb him and when pen woke it was with a brisker and more lively feeling than ordinarily attends that moment in the day of the tired and blase london man a city man wakes up to care and consols and the thoughts of change and the countinghouse take possession of him as soon as sleep flies from under his nightcap a lawyer rouses himself with the early morning to think of the case that will take him all his day to work upon and the inevitable attorney to whom he has promised his papers ere night which of us has not his anxiety instantly present when his eyes are opened to it and to the world after his nights sleep kind strengthener that enables us to face the days task with renewed heart beautiful ordinance of providence that creates rest as it awards labor mr pendenniss labor or rather his disposition was of that sort that his daily occupations did not much interest him for the excitement of literary composition pretty soon subsides with the hired laborer and the delight of seeing ones self in print only extends to the first two or three appearances in the magazine or newspaper page pegasus put into harness and obliged to run a stage every day is as prosaic as any other hack and wont work without his whip or his feed of corn so indeed mr arthur performed his work at the pall mall gazette and since his success as a novelist with an increased salary but without the least enthusiasm doing his best or pretty nearly and sometimes writing ill and sometimes well he was a literary hack naturally fast in pace and brilliant in action neither did society or that portion which he saw excite or amuse him overmuch in spite of his brag and boast to the contrary he was too young as yet for womens society which probably can only be had in perfection when a man has ceased to think about his own person and has given up all designs of being a conqueror of ladies he was too young to be admitted as an equal among men who had made their mark in the world and of whose conversation he could scarcely as yet expect to be more than a listener and he was too old for the men of pleasure of his own age too much a man of pleasure for the men of business destined in a word to be a good deal alone fate awards this lot of solitude to many a man and many like it from taste as many without difficulty bear it pendennis in reality suffered it very equanimously but in words and according to his wont grumbled over it not a little what a nice little artless creature that was mr pen thought at the very instant of waking after the vauxhall affair what a pretty natural manner she has how much pleasanter than the minanderies of the young ladies in the ballrooms and here he recalled to himself some instances of what he could not help seeing was the artful simplicity of miss blanche and some of the stupid graces of other young ladies in the polite world who could have thought that such a pretty rose could grow in a porters lodge or bloom in that dismal old flowerpot of a shepherds inn so she learns to sing from old bows if her singing voice is as sweet as her speaking voice it must be pretty i like those low voilees voices what would you like me to call you indeed poor little fanny it went to my heart to adopt the grand air with her and tell her to call me sir but well have no nonsense of that sortno faust and margaret business for me that old bows so he teaches her to sing does he hes a dear old fellow old bows a gentleman in those old clothes a philosopher and with a kind heart too how good he was to me in the fotheringay business he too has had his griefs and his sorrows i must cultivate old bows a man ought to see people of all sorts i am getting tired of genteel society besides theres nobody in town yes ill go and see bows and costigan too what a rich character begad ill study him and put him into a book in this way our young anthropologist talked with himself and as saturday was the holiday of the week the pall mall gazette making its appearance upon that day and the contributors to that journal having no further calls upon their brains or inkbottles mr pendennis determined he would take advantage of his leisure and pay a visit to shepherds innof course to see old bows the truth is that if arthur had been the most determined roue and artful lovelace who ever set about deceiving a young girl he could hardly have adopted better means for fascinating and overcoming poor little fanny bolton than those which he had employed on the previous night his dandyfied protecting air his conceit generosity and good humor the very sense of good and honesty which had enabled him to check the tremulous advances of the young creature and not to take advantage of that little fluttering sensibilityhis faults and his virtues at once contributed to make her admire him and if we could peep into fannys bed which she shared in a cupboard along with those two little sisters to whom we have seen mr costigan administering gingerbread and apples we should find the poor little maid tossing upon her mattress to the great disturbance of its other two occupants and thinking over all the delights and events of that delightful eventful night and all the words looks and actions of arthur its splendid hero many novels had fanny read in secret and at home in three volumes and in numbers periodical literature had not reached the height which it has attained subsequently and the girls of fannys generation were not enabled to purchase sixteen pages of excitement for a penny rich with histories of crime murder oppressed virtue and the heartless seductions of the aristocracy but she had had the benefit of the circulating library which in conjunction with her school and a small brandyball and millinery business miss minifer keptand arthur appeared to her at once as the type and realization of all the heroes of all those darling greasy volumes which the young girl had devoured mr pen we have seen was rather a dandy about shirts and haberdashery in general fanny had looked with delight at the fineness of his linen at the brilliancy of his shirt studs at his elegant cambric pockethandkerchief and white gloves and at the jetty brightness of his charming boots the prince had appeared and subjugated the poor little handmaid his image traversed constantly her restless slumbers the tone of his voice the blue light of his eyes the generous look half love half pitythe manly protecting smile the frank winning laughterall these were repeated in the girls fond memory she felt still his arm encircling her and saw him smiling so grand as he filled up that delicious glass of champagne and then she thought of the girls her friends who used to sneer at herof emma baker who was so proud forsooth because she was engaged to a cheesemonger in a white apron near clare market and of betsy rodgers who made such a todo about her young manan attorneys clerk indeed that went about with a bag so that at about two oclock in the afternoonthe bolton family having concluded their dinner and mr b who besides his place of porter of the inn was in the employ of messrs tressler the eminent undertakers of the strand being absent in the country with the countess of estrichs hearse when a gentleman in a white hat and white trowsers made his appearance under the inn archway and stopped at the porters wicket fanny was not in the least surprised only delighted only happy and blushing beyond all measure she knew it could be no other than he she knew hed come there he was there was his royal highness beaming upon her from the gate she called to her mother who was busy in the upper apartment mamma mamma and ran to the wicket at once and opened it pushing aside the other children how she blushed as she gave her hand to him how affably he took off his white hat as he came in the children staring up at him he asked mrs bolton if she had slept well after the fatigues of the night and hoped she had no headache and he said that as he was going that way he could not pass the door without asking news of his little partner mrs bolton was perhaps rather shy and suspicious about these advances but mr pens good humor was inexhaustible he could not see that he was unwelcome he looked about the premises for a seat and none being disengaged for a dishcover was on one a workbox on the other and so forth he took one of the childrens chairs and perched himself upon that uncomfortable eminence at this the children began laughing the child fanny louder than all at least she was more amused than any of them and amazed at his royal highnesss condescension he to sit down in that chairthat little childs chair many and many a time after she regarded it havent we almost all such furniture in our rooms that our fancy peoples with dear figures that our memory fills with sweet smiling faces which may never look on us more so pen sate down and talked away with great volubility to mrs bolton he asked about the undertaking business and how many mutes went down with lady estrichs remains and about the inn and who lived there he seemed very much interested about mr campions cab and horse and had met that gentleman in society he thought he should like shares in the polwheedle and pontydiddlum did mrs bolton do for those chambers were there any chambers to let in the inn it was better than the temple he should like to come to live in shepherds inn as for captain strong andcolonel altamont was his name he was deeply interested in them too the captain was an old friend at home he had dined with him at chambers here before the colonel came to live with him what sort of man was the colonel wasnt he a stout man with a large quantity of jewelry and a wig and large black whiskers very black here pen was immensely waggish and caused hysteric giggles of delight from the ladies very black indeed in fact blueblack that is to say a rich greenish purple that was the man he had met him too at sir fin society o we know said the ladies sir fis sir f clavering hes often here two or three times a week with the captain my little boy has been out for bill stamps for him oh lor i beg pardon i shouldnt have mentioned no secrets mrs bolton blurted out being talked perfectly into goodnature by this time but we know you to be a gentleman mr pendennis for im sure you have shown that you can beayve as such hasnt mr pendennis fanny fanny loved her mother for that speech she cast up her dark eyes to the low ceiling and said o that he has im sure ma with a voice full of feeling pen was rather curious about the bill stamps and concerning the transactions in strongs chambers and he asked when altamont came and joined the chevalier whether he too sent out for bill stamps who he was whether he saw many people and so forth these questions put with considerable adroitness by pen who was interested about sir francis claverings doings from private motives of his own were artlessly answered by mrs bolton and to the utmost of her knowledge and ability which in truth were not very great these questions answered and pen being at a loss for more luckily recollected his privilege as a member of the press and asked the ladies whether they would like any orders for the play the play was their delight as it is almost always the delight of every theatrical person when bolton was away professionally it appeared that of late the porter of shepherds inn had taken a serious turn drank a good deal and otherwise made himself unpleasant to the ladies of his family they would like of all things to slip out and go to the theater little barney their son keeping the lodge and mr pendenniss most generous and most genteel compliment of orders was received with boundless gratitude by both mother and daughter fanny clapped her hands with pleasure her face beamed with it she looked and nodded and laughed at her mamma who nodded and laughed in her turn mrs bolton was not superannuated for pleasure yet or by any means too old for admiration she thought and very likely mr pendennis in his conversation with her had insinuated some compliments or shaped his talk so as to please her at first against pen and suspicious of him she was his partisan now and almost as enthusiastic about him as her daughter when two women get together to like a man they help each other on each pushes the other forward and the second out of sheer sympathy becomes as eager as the principal at least so it is said by philosophers who have examined this science so the offer of the play tickets and other pleasantries put all parties into perfect goodhumor except for one brief moment when one of the younger children hearing the name of astleys pronounced came forward and stated that she should like very much to go too on which fanny said dont bother rather sharply and mamma said gitlong betsy jane do now and play in the court so that the two little ones namely betsy jane and ameliar ann went away in their little innocent pinafores and disported in the courtyard on the smooth gravel round about the statue of shepherd the great and here as they were playing they very possibly communicated with an old friend of theirs and dweller in the inn for while pen was making himself agreeable to the ladies at the lodge who were laughing delighted at his sallies an old gentleman passed under the archway from the innsquare and came and looked in at the door of the lodge he made a very blank and rueful face when he saw mr arthur seated upon a table like macheath in the play in easy discourse with mrs bolton and her daughter what mr bows how dyou do bows cried out pen in a cheery loud voice i was coming to see you and was asking your address of these ladies you were coming to see me were you sir bows said and came in with a sad face and shook hands with arthur plague on that old man somebody thought in the room and so perhaps some one else besides her chapter x in shepherds inn illustration our friend pen said how dye do mr bows in a loud cheery voice on perceiving that gentleman and saluted him in a dashing offhand manner yet you could have seen a blush upon arthurs face answered by fanny whose cheek straightway threw out a similar fluttering red signal and after bows and arthur had shaken hands and the former had ironically accepted the others assertion that he was about to pay mr costigans chambers a visit there was a gloomy and rather guilty silence in the company which pen presently tried to dispel by making a great rattling and noise the silence of course departed at mr arthurs noise but the gloom remained and deepened as the darkness does in a vault if you light up a single taper in it pendennis tried to describe in a jocular manner the transactions of the night previous and attempted to give an imitation of costigan vainly expostulating with the checktaker at vauxhall it was not a good imitation what stranger can imitate that perfection nobody laughed mrs bolton did not in the least understand what part mr pendennis was performing and whether it was the checktaker or the captain he was taking off fanny wore an alarmed face and tried a timid giggle old mr bows looked as glum as when he fiddled in the orchestra or played a difficult piece upon the old piano at the backkitchen pen felt that his story was a failure his voice sank and dwindled away dismally at the end of itflickered and went out and it was all dark again you could hear the ticketporter who lolls about shepherds inn as he passed on the flags under the archway the clink of his bootheels was noted by every body you were coming to see me sir mr bows said wont you have the kindness to walk up to my chambers with me you do them a great honor i am sure they are rather high up but o i live in a garret myself and shepherds inn is twice as cheerful as lamb court mr pendennis broke in i knew that you had third floor apartments mr bows said and was going to sayyou will please not take my remark as discourteousthat the air up three pair of stairs is wholesomer for gentlemen than the air of a porters lodge sir said pen whose candle flamed up again in his wrath and who was disposed to be as quarrelsome as men are when they are in the wrong will you permit me to choose my society without you were so polite as to say that you were about to honor my umble domicile with a visit mr bows said with a sad voice shall i show you the way mr pendennis and i are old friends mrs boltonvery old acquaintances and at the earliest dawn of his life we crossed each other the old man pointed toward the door with a trembling finger and a hat in the other hand and in an attitude slightly theatrical so were his words when he spoke somewhat artificial and chosen from the vocabulary which he had heard all his life from the painted lips of the orators before the stagelamps but he was not acting or masquerading as pen knew very well though he was disposed to poohpooh the old fellows melodramatic airs come along sir he said as you are so very pressing mrs bolton i wish you a good day goodby miss fanny i shall always think of our night at vauxhall with pleasure and be sure i will remember the theatretickets and he took her hand pressed it was pressed by it and was gone what a nice young man to be sure cried mrs bolton dyou think so ma said fanny i was athinkin who he was like when i was at the wells with mrs serle mrs bolton continued looking through the window curtain after pen as he went up the court with bows there was a young gentleman from the city that used to come in a tilbry in a white at the very image of him ony his whiskers was black and mr ps is red law ma they are a most beautiful hawburn fanny said he used to come for emly budd who danced columbine in arleykin ornpipe or the battle of navarino when miss de la bosky was took illa pretty dancer and a fine stage figure of a womanand he was a great sugarbaker in the city with a country ouse at omerton and he used to drive her in the tilbry down goswellstreetroad and one day they drove and was married at st bartholomews church smithfield where they had their bands read quite private and she now keeps her carriage and i sor her name in the paper as patroness of the manshinghouse ball for the washywomens asylum and look at lady mirabelcapting costigans daughtershe was profeshnl as all very well know thus and more to this purpose mrs bolton spoke now peeping through the windowcurtain now cleaning the mugs and plates and consigning them to their place in the corner cupboard and finishing her speech as she and fanny shook out and folded up the dinnercloth between them and restored it to its drawer in the table although costigan had once before been made pretty accurately to understand what pens pecuniary means and expectations were i suppose cos had forgotten the information acquired at chatteris years ago or had been induced by his natural enthusiasm to exaggerate his friends income he had described fairoaks park in the most glowing terms to mrs bolton on the preceding evening as he was walking about with her during pens little escapade with fanny had dilated upon the enormous wealth of pens famous uncle the major and shown an intimate acquaintance with arthurs funded and landed property very likely mrs bolton in her wisdom had speculated upon these matters during the night and had had visions of fanny driving in her carriage like mrs boltons old comrade the dancer of sadlers wells in the last operation of tablecloth folding these two foolish women of necessity came close together and as fanny took the cloth and gave it the last fold her mother put her finger under the young girls chin and kissed her again the red signal flew out and fluttered on fannys cheek what did it mean it was not alarm this time it was pleasure which caused the poor little fanny to blush so poor little fanny what is love sin that it is so pleasant at the beginning and so bitter at the end after the embrace mrs bolton thought proper to say that she was agoin out upon business and that fanny must keep the lodge which fanny after a very faint objection indeed consented to do so mrs bolton took her bonnet and marketbasket and departed and the instant she was gone fanny went and sate by the window which commanded bowss door and never once took her eyes away from that quarter of shepherds inn betsyjane and ameliarann were buzzing in one corner of the place and making believe to read out of a picturebook which one of them held topsyturvy it was a grave and dreadful tract of mr boltons collection fanny did not hear her sisters prattling over it she noticed nothing but bowss door at last she gave a little shake and her eyes lighted up he had come out he would pass the door again but her poor little countenance fell in an instant more pendennis indeed came out but bows followed after him they passed under the archway together he only took off his hat and bowed as he looked in he did not stop to speak in three or four minutesfanny did not know how long but she looked furiously at him when he came into the lodgebows returned alone and entered into the porters room wheres your ma dear he said to fanny i dont know fanny said with an angry toss i dont follow mas steps wherever she goes i suppose mr bows am i my mothers keeper bows said with his usual melancholy bitterness come here betsyjane and ameliaann ive brought a cake for the one who can read her letters best and a cake for the other who can read them the next best when the young ladies had undergone the examination through which bows put them they were rewarded with their gingerbread medals and went off to discuss them in the court meanwhile fanny took out some work and pretended to busy herself with it her mind being in great excitement and anger as she plied her needle bows sate so that he could command the entrance from the lodge to the street but the person whom perhaps he expected to see never made his appearance again and mrs bolton came in from market and found mr bows in place of the person whom she had expected to see the reader perhaps can guess what was his name the interview between bows and his guest when those two mounted to the apartment occupied by the former in common with the descendant of the milesian kings was not particularly satisfactory to either party pen was sulky if bows had any thing on his mind he did not care to deliver himself of his thoughts in the presence of captain costigan who remained in the apartment during the whole of pens visit having quitted his bedchamber indeed but a very few minutes before the arrival of that gentleman we have witnessed the deshabille of major pendennis will any man wish to be valetdechambre to our other hero costigan it would seem that the captain before issuing from his bedroom scented himself with otto of whisky a rich odor of that delicious perfume breathed from out him as he held out the grasp of cordiality to his visitor the hand which performed that grasp shook woefully it was a wonder how it could hold the razor with which the poor gentleman daily operated on his chin bowss room was as neat on the other hand as his comrades was disorderly his humble wardrobe hung behind a curtain his books and manuscript music were trimly arranged upon shelves a lithographed portrait of miss fotheringay as mrs haller with the actresss sprawling signature at the corner hung faithfully over the old gentlemans bed lady mirabel wrote much better than miss fotheringay had been able to do her ladyship had labored assiduously to acquire the art of penmanship since her marriage and in a common note of invitation or acceptance acquitted herself very genteelly bows loved the old handwriting best though the fair artists earlier manner he had but one specimen of the new style a note in reply to a song composed and dedicated to lady mirabel by her most humble servant robert bows and which document was treasured in his desk among his other state papers he was teaching fanny bolton now to sing and to write as he had taught emily in former days it was the nature of the man to attach himself to something when emily was torn from him he took a substitute as a man looks out for a crutch when he loses a leg or lashes himself to a raft when he has suffered shipwreck latude had given his heart to a woman no doubt before he grew to be so fond of a mouse in the bastille there are people who in their youth have felt and inspired an heroic passion and end by being happy in the caresses or agitated by the illness of a poodle but it was hard upon bows and grating to his feelings as a man and a sentimentalist that he should find pen again upon his track and in pursuit of this little fanny meanwhile costigan had not the least idea but that his company was perfectly welcome to messrs pendennis and bows and that the visit of the former was intended for himself he expressed himself greatly pleased with that mark of poloightness and promised in his own mind that he would repay that obligation at leastwhich was not the only debt which the captain owed in lifeby several visits to his young friend he entertained him affably with news of the day or rather of ten days previous for pen in his quality of journalist remembered to have seen some of the captains opinions in the sporting and theatrical newspaper which was costigans oracle he stated that sir charles and lady mirabel were gone to badenbaden and were most pressing in their invitations that he should join them there pen replied with great gravity that he had heard that baden was very pleasant and the grand duke exceedingly hospitable to english costigan answered that the laws of hospitalitee bekeam a grand juke that he sariously would think about visiting him and made some remarks upon the splendid festivities at dublin castle when his excellency the earl of portansherry held the viceraygal coort there and of which he costigan had been an humble but pleased spectator and penas he heard these ofttold wellremembered legendsrecollected the time when he had given a sort of credence to them and had a certain respect for the captain emily and first love and the little room at chatteris and the kind talk with bows on the bridge came back to him he felt quite kindly disposed toward his two old friends and cordially shook the hands of both of them when he rose to go away he had quite forgotten about little fanny bolton while the captain was talking and pen himself was absorbed in other selfish meditations he only remembered her again as bows came hobbling down the stairs after him bent evidently upon following him out of shepherds inn mr bowss precaution was not a lucky one the wrath of mr arthur pendennis rose at the poor old fellows feeble persecution confound him what does he mean by dogging me thought pen and he burst out laughing when he was in the strand and by himself as he thought of the elders stratagem it was not an honest laugh arthur pendennis perhaps the thought struck arthur himself and he blushed at his own sense of humor he went off to endeavor to banish the thoughts which occupied him whatever those thoughts might be and tried various places of amusement with but indifferent success he struggled up the highest stairs of the panorama but when he had arrived panting at the height of the eminence care had come up with him and was bearing him company he went to the club and wrote a long letter home exceedingly witty and sarcastic and in which if he did not say a single word about vauxhall and fanny bolton it was because he thought that subject however interesting to himself would not be very interesting to his mother and laura nor could the novels on the library table fix his attention nor the grave and respectable jawkins the only man in town who wished to engage him in conversation nor any of the amusements which he tried after flying from jawkins he passed a comic theater on his way home and saw stunning farce roars of laughter good old english fun and frolic placarded in vermilion letters on the gate he went into the pit and saw the lovely mrs leary as usual in a mans attire and that eminent buffo actor tom horseman dressed as a woman horsemans travestie seemed to him a horrid and hideous degradation mrs learys glances and ankles had not the least effect he laughed again and bitterly to himself as he thought of the effect which she had produced upon him on the first night of his arrival in london a short timewhat a long long time ago chapter xi in or near the temple garden fashion has long deserted the green and pretty temple garden in which shakspeare makes york and lancaster to pluck the innocent white and red roses which became the badges of their bloody wars and the learned and pleasant writer of the handbook of london tells us that the commonest and hardiest kind of rose has long ceased to put forth a bud in that smoky air not many of the present occupiers of the buildings round about the quarter know or care very likely whether or not roses grow there or pass the old gate except on their way to chambers the attorneys clerks dont carry flowers in their bags or posies under their arms as they run to the counsels chambers the few lawyers who take constitutional walks think very little about york and lancaster especially since the railroad business is over only antiquarians and literary amateurs care to look at the gardens with much interest and fancy good sir roger de coverley and mr spectator with his short face pacing up and down the road or dear oliver goldsmith in the summerhouse perhaps meditating about the next citizen of the world or the new suit that mr filby the tailor is fashioning for him or the dunning letter that mr newberry has sent treading heavily on the gravel and rolling majestically along in a snuffcolored suit and a wig that sadly wants the barbers powder and irons one sees the great doctor step up to him his scotch lackey following at the lexicographers heels a little the worse for port wine that they have been taking at the miter and mr johnson asks mr goldsmith to come home and take a dish of tea with miss williams kind faith of fancy sir hoger and mr spectator are as real to us now as the two doctors and the boozy and faithful scotchman the poetical figures live in our memory just as much as the real personagesand as mr arthur pendennis was of a romantic and literary turn by no means addicted to the legal pursuits common in the neighborhood of the place we may presume that he was cherishing some such poetical reflections as these when upon the evening after the events recorded in the last chapter the young gentleman chose the temple gardens as a place for exercise and meditation on the sunday evening the temple is commonly calm the chambers are for the most part vacant the great lawyers are giving grand dinner parties at their houses in the belgravian or tyburnian districts the agreeable young barristers are absent attending those parties and paying their respects to mr kewsys excellent claret or mr justice ermines accomplished daughters the uninvited are partaking of the economic joint and the modest halfpint of wine at the club entertaining themselves and the rest of the company in the clubroom with circuit jokes and points of wit and law nobody is in chambers at all except poor mr cockle who is ill and whose laundress is making him gruel or mr toodle who is an amateur of the flute and whom you may hear piping solitary from his chambers in the second floor or young tiger the student from whose open windows come a great gush of cigar smoke and at whose door are a quantity of dishes and covers bearing the insignia of dicks or the cock but stop whither does fancy lead us it is vacation time and with the exception of pendennis nobody is in chambers at all perhaps it was solitude then which drove pen into the garden for although he had never before passed the gate and had looked rather carelessly at the pretty flowerbeds and the groups of pleased citizens sauntering over the trim lawn and the broad gravelwalks by the river on this evening it happened as we have said that the young gentleman who had dined alone at a tavern in the neighborhood of the temple took a fancy as he was returning home to his chambers to take a little walk in the gardens and enjoy the fresh evening air and the sight of the shining thames after walking for a brief space and looking at the many peaceful and happy groups round about him he grew tired of the exercise and betook himself to one of the summerhouses which flank either end of the main walk and there modestly seated himself what were his cogitations the evening was delightfully bright and calm the sky was cloudless the chimneys on the opposite bank were not smoking the wharves and warehouses looked rosy in the sunshine and as clear as if they too had washed for the holiday the steamers rushed rapidly up and down the stream laden with holiday passengers the bells of the multitudinous city churches were ringing to evening prayerssuch peaceful sabbath evenings as this pen may have remembered in his early days as he paced with his arm round his mothers waist on the terrace before the lawn at home the sun was lighting up the little brawl too as well as the broad thames and sinking downward majestically behind the clavering elms and the tower of the familiar village church was it thoughts of these or the sunset merely that caused the blush in the young mans face he beat time on the bench to the chorus of the bells without flicked the dust off his shining boots with his pockethandkerchief and starting up stamped with his foot and said no by jove ill go home and with this resolution which indicated that some struggle as to the propriety of remaining where he was or of quitting the garden had been going on in his mind he stepped out of the summerhouse he nearly knocked down two little children who did not indeed reach much higher than his knee and were trotting along the gravelwalk with their long blue shadows slanting toward the east one cried out oh the other began to laugh and with a knowing little infantine chuckle said missa pendennis and arthur looking down saw his two little friends of the day before mesdemoiselles ameliarann and betsyjane he blushed more than ever at seeing them and seizing the one whom he had nearly upset jumped her up into the air and kissed her at which sudden assault ameliarann began to cry in great alarm this cry brought up instantly two ladies in clean collars and new ribbons and grand shawls namely mrs bolton in a rich scarlet caledonian cashmere and a black silk dress and miss f bolton with a yellow scarf and a sweet sprigged muslin and a parasolquite the lady fanny did not say one single word though her eyes flashed a welcome and shone as brightas bright as the most blazing windows in paper buildings but mrs bolton after admonishing betsyjane said lor sir how very odd that we should meet you year i ope you ave your ealth well sir aint it odd fanny that we should meet mr pendennis what do you mean by sniggering mesdames when young croesus has been staying at a countryhouse have you never by any singular coincidence been walking with your fanny in the shrubberies have you and your fanny never happened to be listening to the band of the heavies at brighton when young de boots and captain padmore came clinking down the pier have you and your darling frances never chanced to be visiting old widow wheezy at the cottage on the common when the young curate has stepped in with a tract adapted to the rheumatism do you suppose that if singular coincidences occur at the hall they dont also happen at the lodge it was a coincidence no doubt that was all in the course of the conversation on the day previous mr pendennis had merely said in the simplest way imaginable and in reply to a question of miss bolton that although some of the courts were gloomy parts of the temple were very cheerful and agreeable especially the chambers looking on the river and around the gardens and that the gardens were a very pleasant walk on sunday evenings and frequented by a great number of peopleand here by the merest chance all our acquaintances met together just like so many people in genteel life what could be more artless goodnatured or natural illustration pen looked very grave pompous and dandified he was unusually smart and brilliant in his costume his white duck trowsers and white hat his neckcloth of many colors his light waistcoat gold chains and shirt studs gave him the air of a prince of the blood at least how his splendor became his figure was any body ever like him some one thought he blushedhow his blushes became him the same individual said to herself the children on seeing him the day before had been so struck with him that after he had gone away they had been playing at him and ameliarann sticking her little chubby fingers into the armholes of her pinafore as pen was wont to do with his waistcoat had said now bessyjane ill be missa pendennis fanny had laughed till she cried and smothered her sister with kisses for that feat how happy too she was to see arthur embracing the child illustration if arthur was red fanny on the contrary was very worn and pale arthur remarked it and asked kindly why she looked so fatigued i was awake all night said fanny and began to blush a little i put out her candle and hordered her to go to sleep and leave off readin interposed the fond mother you were reading and what was it that interested you so asked pen amused oh its so beautiful said fanny what walter lorraine fanny sighed out how i do hate that neara nearai dont know the pronunciation and how i love leonora and walter oh how dear he is how had fanny discovered the novel of walter lorraine and that pen was the author this little person remembered every single word which mr pendennis had spoken on the night previous and how he wrote in books and newspapers what books she was so eager to know that she had almost a mind to be civil to old bows who was suffering under her displeasure since yesterday but she determined first to make application to costigan she began by coaxing the captain and smiling upon him in her most winning way as she helped to arrange his dinner and set his humble apartment in order she was sure his linen wanted mending and indeed the captains linencloset contained some curious specimens of manufactured flax and cotton she would mend his shirtsall his shirts what horrid holeswhat funny holes she put her little face through one of them and laughed at the old warrior in the most winning manner she would have made a funny little picture looking through the holes then she daintily removed costigans dinner things tripping about the room as she had seen the dancers do at the play and she danced to the captains cupboard and produced his whisky bottle and mixed him a tumbler and must taste a drop of ita little drop and the captain must sing her one of his songs his dear songs and teach it to her and when he had sung an irish melody in his rich quavering voice fancying it was he who was fascinating the little siren she put her little question about arthur pendennis and his novel and having got an answer cared for nothing more but left the captain at the piano about to sing her another song and the dinner tray on the passage and the shirts on the chair and ran down stairs quickening her pace as she sped captain costigan as he said was not a litherary cyarkter nor had he as yet found time to peruse his young friends ellygant perfaurumance though he intended to teak an early opporchunitee of purchasing a cawpee of his work but he knew the name of pens novel from the fact that messrs finucane bludyer and other frequenters of the backkitchen spoke of mr pendennis and not all of them with great friendship for bludyer called him a confounded coxcomb and hoolan wondered that doolan did not kick him c by the sobriquet of walter lorraineand was hence enabled to give fanny the information which she required and she went and ast for it at the libery mrs bolton said several liberiesand some ad it and it was hout and some adnt it and one of the liberies as ad it wouldnt let er ave it without a sovering and she adnt one and she came back acryin to medidnt you fannyand i gave her a sovering and oh i was in such a fright lest any one should have come to the libery and took it while i was away fanny said her cheeks and eyes glowing and oh i do like it so arthur was touched by this artless sympathy immensely flattered and moved by it do you like it he said if you will come up to my chambers i willno i will bring you oneno i will send you one good night thank you fanny god bless you i mustnt stay with you goodby goodby and pressing her hand once and nodding to her mother and the other children he strode out of the gardens he quickened his pace as he went from them and ran out of the gate talking to himself dear dear little thing he said darling little fanny you are worth them all i wish to heaven shandon was back id go home to my mother i mustnt see her i wont i wont so help me as he was talking thus and running the passers by turning to look at him he ran against a little old man and perceived it was mr bows your very umble servant sir said mr bows making a sarcastic bow and lifting his old hat from his forehead i wish you a good day arthur answered sulkily dont let me detain you or give you the trouble to follow me again i am in a hurry sir good evening bows thought pen had some reason for hurrying to his rooms where are they exclaimed the old gentleman you know whom i mean theyre not in your rooms sir are they they told bolton they were going to church at the temple they werent there they are in your chambers they mustnt stay in your chambers mr pendennis damn it sir cried out pendennis fiercely come and see if they are in my chambers heres the court and the doorcome in and see and bows taking off his hat and bowing first followed the young man they were not in pens chambers as we know but when the gardens were closed the two women who had had but a melancholy evenings amusement walked away sadly with the children and they entered into lambcourt and stood under the lamppost which cheerfully ornaments the center of that quadrangle and looked up to the third floor of the house where pendenniss chambers were and where they saw a light presently kindled then this couple of fools went away the children dragging wearily after them and returned to mr bolton who was immersed in rumandwater at his lodge in shepherds inn mr bows looked round the blank room which the young man occupied and which had received but very few ornaments or additions since the last time we saw them warringtons old bookcase and battered library pens writingtable with its litter of papers presented an aspect cheerless enough will you like to look in the bedrooms mr bows and see if my victims are there he said bitterly or whether i have made away with the little girls and hid them in the coalhole your word is sufficient mr pendennis the other said in his sad tone you say they are not here and i know they are not and i hope they never have been here and never will come upon my word sir you are very good to choose my acquaintances for me arthur said in a haughty tone and to suppose that any body would be the worse for my society i remember you and owe you kindness from old times mr bows or i should speak more angrily than i do about a very intolerable sort of persecution to which you seem inclined to subject me you followed me out of your inn yesterday as if you wanted to watch that i shouldnt steal something here pen stammered and turned red directly he had said the words he felt he had given the other an opening which bows instantly took i do think you came to steal something as you say the words sir bows said do you mean to say that you came to pay a visit to poor old bows the fiddler or to mrs bolton at the porters lodge o fie such a fine gentleman as arthur pendennis esquire doesnt condescend to walk up to my garret or to sit in a laundresss kitchen but for reasons of his own and my belief is that you came to steal a pretty girls heart away and to ruin it and to spurn it afterward mr arthur pendennis thats what the world makes of you young dandies you gentlemen of fashion you high and mighty aristocrats that trample upon the people its sport to you but what is it to the poor think you the toys of your pleasures whom you play with and whom you fling into the streets when you are tired i know your order sir i know your selfishness and your arrogance and your pride what does it matter to my lord that the poor mans daughter is made miserable and her family brought to shame you must have your pleasures and the people of course must pay for them what are we made for but for that its the way with you allthe way with you all sir bows was speaking beside the question and pen had his advantage here which he was not sorry to takenot sorry to put off the debate from the point upon which his adversary had first engaged it arthur broke out with a sort of laugh for which he asked bowss pardon yes i am an aristocrat he said in a palace up three pair of stairs with a carpet nearly as handsome as yours mr bows my life is passed in grinding the people is itin ruining virgins and robbing the poor my good sir this is very well in a comedy where job thornberry slaps his breast and asks my lord how dare he trample on an honest man and poke out an englishmans fireside but in real life mr bows to a man who has to work for his bread as much as you dohow can you talk about aristocrats tyrannizing over the people have i ever done you a wrong or assumed airs of superiority over you did you not have an early regard for mein days when we were both of us romantic young fellows mr bows come dont be angry with me now and let us be as good friends as we were before those days were very different mr bows answered and mr arthur pendennis was an honest impetuous young fellow then rather selfish and conceited perhaps but honest and i liked you then because you were ready to ruin yourself for a woman and now sir arthur asked and now times are changed and you want a woman to ruin herself for you bows answered i know this child sir ive always said this lot was hanging over her she has heated her little brain with novels until her whole thoughts are about love and lovers and she scarcely sees that she treads on a kitchen floor i have taught the little thing she is full of many talents and winning ways i grant you i am fond of the girl sir im a lonely old man i lead a life that i dont like among boon companions who make me melancholy i have but this child that i care for have pity upon me and dont take her away from me mr pendennisdont take her away the old mans voice broke as he spoke its accents touched pen much more than the menacing or sarcastic tone which bows had commenced by adopting indeed said he kindly you do me a wrong if you fancy i intend one to poor little fanny i never saw her till friday night it was the merest chance that our friend costigan threw her into my way i have no intentions regarding herthat is that is you know very well that she is a foolish girl and her mother a foolish womanthat is you meet her in the temple gardens and of course without previous concert that is that when i found her yesterday reading the book youve wrote she scorned me bows said what am i good for but to be laughed at a deformed old fellow like me an old fiddler that wears a threadbare coat and gets his bread by playing tunes at an alehouse you are a fine gentleman you are you wear scent in your handkerchief and a ring on your finger you go to dine with great people who ever gives a crust to old bows and yet i might have been as good a man as the best of you i might have been a man of genius if i had had the chance ay and have lived with the masterspirits of the land but every thing has failed with me id ambition once and wrote plays poems musicnobody would give me a hearing i never loved a woman but she laughed at me and here i am in my old age alonealone dont take this girl from me mr pendennis i say again leave her with me a little longer she was like a child to me till yesterday why did you step in and make her mock my deformity and old age chapter xii the happy village again early in this history we have had occasion to speak of the little town of clavering near which pens paternal home of fairoaks stood and of some of the people who inhabited the place and as the society there was by no means amusing or pleasant our reports concerning it were not carried to any very great length mr samuel huxter the gentleman whose acquaintance we lately made at vauxhall was one of the choice spirits of the little town when he visited it during his vacations and enlivened the tables of his friends there by the wit of bartholomews and the gossip of the fashionable london circles which he frequented mr hobnell the young gentleman whom pen had thrashed in consequence of the quarrel in the fotheringay affair was while a pupil at the grammarschool at clavering made very welcome at the teatable of mrs huxter samuels mother and was free of the surgery where he knew the way to the tamarindpots and could scent his pockethandkerchief with rosewater and it was at this period of his life that he formed an attachment for miss sophy huxter whom on his fathers demise he married and took home to his house of the warren at a few miles from clavering the family had possessed and cultivated an estate there for many years as yeomen and farmers mr hobnells father pulled down the old farmhouse built a flaring new whitewashed mansion with capacious stables and a piano in the drawingroom kept a pack of harriers and assumed the title of squire hobnell when he died and his son reigned in his stead the family might be fairly considered to be established as county gentry and sam huxter at london did no great wrong in boasting about his brotherinlaws place his hounds horses and hospitality to his admiring comrades at bartholomews every year at a time commonly when mrs hobnell could not leave the increasing duties of her nursery hobnell came up to london for a lark had rooms at the tavistock and indulged in the pleasures of the town together ascott the theaters vauxhall and the convivial taverns in the joyous neighborhood of covent garden were visited by the vivacious squire in company with his learned brother when he was in london as he said he liked to do as london does and to go it a bit and when he returned to the west he took a new bonnet and shawl to mrs hobnell and relinquished for country sports and occupations during the next eleven months the elegant amusements of london life sam huxter kept up a correspondence with his relative and supplied him with choice news of the metropolis in return for the baskets of hares partridges and clouted cream which the squire and his goodnatured wife forwarded to sam a youth more brilliant and distinguished they did not know he was the life and soul of their house when he made his appearance in his native place his songs jokes and fun kept the warren in a roar he had saved their eldest darlings life by taking a fishbone out of her throat in fine he was the delight of their circle as illluck would have it pen again fell in with mr huxter only three days after the rencounter at vauxhall faithful to his vow he had not been to see little fanny he was trying to drive her from his mind by occupation or other mental excitement he labored though not to much profit incessantly in his rooms and in his capacity of critic for the pall mall gazette made woeful and savage onslaught on a poem and a romance which came before him for judgment these authors slain he went to dine alone at the lonely club of the polyanthus where the vast solitudes frightened him and made him only the more moody he had been to more theaters for relaxation the whole house was roaring with laughter and applause and he saw only an ignoble farce that made him sad it would have damped the spirits of the buffoon on the stage to have seen pens dismal face he hardly knew what was happening the scene and the drama passed before him like a dream or a fever then he thought he would go to the backkitchen his old haunt with warringtonhe was not a bit sleepy yet the day before he had walked twenty miles in search after rest over hampstead common and hendon lanes and had got no sleep at night he would go to the backkitchen it was a sort of comfort to him to think he should see bows bows was there very calm presiding at the old piano some tremendous comic songs were sung which made the room crack with laughter how strange they seemed to pen he could only see bows in an extinct volcano such as he boasted that his breast was it was wonderful how he should feel such a flame two days indulgence had kindled it two days abstinence had set it burning in fury so musing upon this and drinking down one glass after another as illluck would have it arthurs eyes lighted upon mr huxter who had been to the theater like himself and with two or three comrades now entered the room huxter whispered to his companions greatly to pens annoyance arthur felt that the other was talking about him huxter then worked through the room followed by his friends and came and took a place opposite to pen nodding familiarly to him and holding him out a dirty hand to shake pen shook hands with his fellow townsman he thought he had been needlessly savage to him on the last night when they had met as for huxter perfectly at good humor with himself and the world it never entered his mind that he could be disagreeable to any body and the little dispute or chaff as he styled it of vauxhall was a trifle which he did not in the least regard the disciple of galen having called for four stouts with which he and his party refreshed themselves began to think what would be the most amusing topic of conversation with pen and hit upon that precise one which was most painful to our young gentleman jolly night at vauxhallwasnt it he said and winked in a very knowing way im glad you liked it poor pen said groaning in spirit i was devlish cutuncommonbeen dining with some chaps at greenwich that was a pretty bit of muslin hanging on your armwho was she asked the fascinating student the question was too much for arthur have i asked you any questions about yourself mr huxter he said i didnt mean any offensebeg pardonhang it you cut up quite savage said pens astonished interlocutor do you remember what took place between us the other night pen asked with gathering wrath you forget very probably you were tipsy as you observed just now and very rude hang it sir i asked your pardon huxter said looking red you did certainly and it was granted with all my heart i am sure but if you recollect i begged that you would have the goodness to omit me from the list of your acquaintance for the future and when we met in public that you would not take the trouble to recognize me will you please to remember this hereafter and as the song is beginning permit me to leave you to the unrestrained enjoyment of the music he took his hat and making a bow to the amazed mr huxter left the table as huxters comrades after a pause of wonder set up such a roar of laughter at huxter as called for the intervention of the president of the room who bawled out silence gentlemen do have silence for the body snatcher which popular song began as pen left the backkitchen he flattered himself that he had commanded his temper perfectly he rather wished that huxter had been pugnacious he would have liked to fight him or somebody he went home the days work the dinner the play the whiskyandwater the quarrel nothing soothed him he slept no better than on the previous night a few days afterward mr sam huxter wrote home a letter to mr hobnell in the country of which mr arthur pendennis formed the principal subject sam described arthurs pursuits in london and his confounded insolence of behavior to his old friends from home he said he was an abandoned criminal a regular don juan a fellow who when he did come into the country ought to be kept out of honest peoples houses he had seen him at vauxhall dancing with an innocent girl in the lower ranks of life of whom he was making a victim he had found out from an irish gentleman formerly in the army who frequented a club of which he huxter was member who the girl was on whom this conceited humbug was practicing his infernal arts and he thought he should warn her father c cthe letter then touched on general news conveyed the writers thanks for the last parcel and the rabbits and hinted his extreme readiness for further favors about once a year as we have stated there was occasion for a christening at the warren and it happened that this ceremony took place a day after hobnell had received the letter of his brotherinlaw in town the infant a darling little girl was christened myralucretia after its two godmothers miss portman and mrs pybus of clavering and as of course hobnell had communicated sams letter to his wife mrs hobnell imparted its horrid contents to her two gossips a pretty story it was and prettily it was told throughout clavering in the course of that day myra did notshe was too much shocked to do sospeak on the matter to her mamma but mrs pybus had no such feelings of reserve she talked over the matter not only with mrs portman but with mr and the honorable mrs simcoe with mrs glanders her daughters being to that end ordered out of the room with madame fribsby and in a word with the whole of the clavering society madam fribsby looking furtively up at her picture of the dragoon and inwards into her own wounded memory said that men would be men and as long as they were men would be deceivers and she pensively quoted some lines from marmion requesting to know where deceiving lovers should rest mrs pybus had no words of hatred horror contempt strong enough for a villain who could be capable of conduct so base this was what came of early indulgence and insolence and extravagance and aristocratic airs it is certain that pen had refused to drink tea with mrs pybus and attending the corrupt and horrid parties in the dreadful modern babylon mrs portman was afraid that she must acknowledge that the mothers fatal partiality had spoiled this boy that his literary successes had turned his head and his horrid passions had made him forget the principles which dr portman had instilled into him in early life glanders the atrocious captain of dragoons when informed of the occurrence by mrs glanders whistled and made jocular allusions to it at dinner time on which mrs glanders called him a brute and ordered the girls again out of the room as the horrid captain burst out laughing mr simcoe was calm under the intelligence but rather pleased than otherwise it only served to confirm the opinion which he had always had of that wretched young man not that he knew any thing about himnot that he had read one line of his dangerous and poisonous works heaven forbid that he should but what could be expected from such a youth and such frightful such lamentable such deplorable want of seriousness pen formed the subject for a second sermon at the clavering chapel of ease where the dangers of london and the crime of reading and writing novels were pointed out on a sunday evening to a large and warm congregation they did not wait to hear whether he was guilty or not they took his wickedness for granted and with these admirable moralists it was who should fling the stone at poor pen the next day mrs pendennis alone and almost fainting with emotion and fatigue walked or rather ran to dr portmans house to consult the good doctor she had had an anonymous letter some christian had thought it his or her duty to stab the good soul who had never done mortal a wrongan anonymous letter with references to scripture pointing out the doom of such sinners and a detailed account of pens crime she was in a state of terror and excitement pitiable to witness two or three hours of this pain had aged her already in her first moment of agitation she had dropped the letter and laura had read it laura blushed when she read it her whole frame trembled but it was with anger the cowards she said it isnt true no mother it isnt true it is true and youve done it laura cried out helen fiercely why did you refuse him when he asked you why did you break my heart and refuse him it is you who led him into crime it is you who flung him into the arms of thisthis woman dont speak to me dont answer me i will never forgive you never martha bring me my bonnet and shawl ill go out i wont have you come with me go away leave me cruel girl why have you brought this shame on me and bidding her daughter and her servants keep away from her she ran down the road to clavering doctor portman glancing over the letter thought he knew the hand writing and of course was already acquainted with the charge made against poor pen against his own conscience perhaps for the worthy doctor like most of us had a considerable natural aptitude for receiving any report unfavorable to his neighbors he strove to console helen he pointed out that the slander came from an anonymous quarter and therefore must be the work of a rascal that the charge might not be truewas not true most likelyat least that pen must be heard before he was condemned that the son of such a mother was not likely to commit such a crime c c helen at once saw through his feint of objection and denial you think he has done it she said you know you think he has done it oh why did i ever leave him doctor portman or suffer him away from me but he cant be dishonestpray god not dishonestyou dont think that do you remember his conduct about that otherperson how madly he was attached to her he was an honest boy thenhe is now and i thank godyes i fall down on my knees and thank god he paid laura you said he was goodyou did yourself and nowif this woman loves himand you know they mustif he has taken her from her home or she tempted him which is most likelywhy still she must be his wife and my daughter and he must leave the dreadful world and come back to meto his mother doctor portman let us go away and bring him backyesbring him backand there shall be joy for thethe sinner that repenteth let us go now directly dear friendthis very helen could say no more she fell back and fainted she was carried to a bed in the house of the pitying doctor and the surgeon was called to attend her she lay all night in an alarming state laura came to her or to the rectory rather for she would not see laura and doctor portman still beseeching her to be tranquil and growing bolder and more confident of arthurs innocence as he witnessed the terrible grief of the poor mother wrote a letter to pen warning him of the rumors that were against him and earnestly praying that he would break off and repent of a connection so fatal to his best interests and his souls welfare and laurawas her heart not wrung by the thought of arthurs crime and helens estrangement was it not a bitter blow for the innocent girl to think that at one stroke she should lose all the love which she cared for in the world chapter xiii which had very nearly been the last of the story doctor portmans letter was sent off to its destination in london and the worthy clergyman endeavored to sooth down mrs pendennis into some state of composure until an answer should arrive which the doctor tried to think or at any rate persisted in saying would be satisfactory as regarded the morality of mr pen at least helens wish of moving upon london and appearing in person to warn her son of his wickedness was impracticable for a day or two the apothecary forbade her moving even so far as fairoaks for the first day and it was not until the subsequent morning that she found herself again back on her sofa at home with the faithful though silent laura nursing at her side unluckily for himself and all parties pen never read that homily which doctor portman addressed to him until many weeks after the epistle had been composed and day after day the widow waited for her sons reply to the charges against him her own illness increasing with every days delay it was a hard task for laura to bear the anxiety to witness her dearest friends suffering worst of all to support helens estrangement and the pain caused to her by that averted affection but it was the custom of this young lady to the utmost of her power and by means of that gracious assistance which heaven awarded to her pure and constant prayers to do her duty and as that duty was performed quite noiselesslywhile the supplications which endowed her with the requisite strength for fulfilling it also took place in her own chamber away from all mortal sightwe too must be perforce silent about these virtues of hers which no more bear public talking about than a flower will bear to bloom in a ballroom this only we will saythat a good woman is the loveliest flower that blooms under heaven and that we look with love and wonder upon its silent grace its pure fragrance its delicate bloom of beauty sweet and beautifulthe fairest and the most spotlessis it not pity to see them bowed down or devoured by grief or death inexorablewasting in diseasepining with long painor cut off by sudden fate in their prime we may deserve griefbut why should these be unhappyexcept that we know that heaven chastens those whom it loves best being pleased by repeated trials to make these pure spirits more pure so pen never got the letter although it was duly posted and faithfully discharged by the postman into his letterbox in lamb court and thence carried by the laundress to his writingtable with the rest of his lordships correspondence into which room have we not seen a picture of him entering from his little bedroom adjoining as mrs flanagan his laundress was in the act of drinking his gin those kind readers who have watched mr arthurs career hitherto and have made as they naturally would do observations upon the moral character and peculiarities of their acquaintance have probably discovered by this time what was the prevailing fault in mr pens disposition and who was that greatest enemy artfully indicated in the titlepage with whom he had to contend not a few of us my beloved public have the very same rascal to contend with a scoundrel who takes every opportunity of bringing us into mischief of plunging us into quarrels of leading us into idleness and unprofitable company and what not in a word pens greatest enemy was himself and as he had been pampering and coaxing and indulging that individual all his life the rogue grew insolent as all spoiled servants will be and at the slightest attempt to coerce him or make him do that which was unpleasant to him became frantically rude and unruly a person who is used to making sacrificeslaura for instance who had got such a habit of giving up her own pleasure for otherscan do the business quite easily but pen unaccustomed as he was to any sort of selfdenial suffered woundily when called on to pay his share and savagely grumbled at being obliged to forego any thing he liked he had resolved in his mighty mind then that he would not see fanny and he wouldnt he tried to drive the thoughts of that fascinating little person out of his head by constant occupation by exercise by dissipation and society he worked then too much he walked and rode too much he ate drank and smoked too much nor could all the cigars and the punch of which he partook drive little fannys image out of his inflamed brain and at the end of a week of this discipline and selfdenial our young gentleman was in bed with a fever let the reader who has never had a fever in chambers pity the wretch who is bound to undergo that calamity a committee of marriageable ladies or of any christian persons interested in the propagation of the domestic virtues should employ a cruikshank or a leech or some other kindly expositor of the follies of the day to make a series of designs representing the horrors of a bachelors life in chambers and leading the beholder to think of better things and a more wholesome condition what can be more uncomfortable than the bachelors lonely breakfastwith the black kettle in the dreary fire in midsummer or worse still with the fire gone out at christmas half an hour after the laundress has quitted the sittingroom into this solitude the owner enters shivering and has to commence his day by hunting for coals and wood and before he begins the work of a student has to discharge the duties of a housemaid vice mrs flanagan who is absent without leave or again what can form a finer subject for the classical designer than the bachelors shirtthat garment which he wants to assume just at dinnertime and which he finds without any buttons to fasten it then there is the bachelors return to chambers after a merry christmas holiday spent in a cozy countryhouse full of pretty faces and kind welcomes and regrets he leaves his portmanteau at the barbers in the court he lights his dismal old candle at the sputtering little lamp on the stair he enters the blank familiar room where the only tokens to greet him that show any interest in his personal welfare are the christmas bills which are lying in wait for him amicably spread out on his readingtable add to these scenes an appalling picture of bachelors illness and the rents in the temple will begin to fall from the day of the publication of the dismal diorama to be well in chambers is melancholy and lonely and selfish enough but to be ill in chambersto pass nights of pain and watchfulnessto long for the morning and the laundressto serve yourself your own medicine by your own watchto have no other companion for long hours but your own sickening fancies and fevered thoughts no kind hand to give you drink if you are thirsty or to smooth the hot pillow that crumples under youthis indeed is a fate so dismal and tragic that we shall not enlarge upon its horrors and shall only heartily pity those bachelors in the temple who brave it every day this lot befell arthur pendennis after the various excesses which we have mentioned and to which he had subjected his unfortunate brains one night he went to bed ill and next the day awoke worse his only visitor that day besides the laundress was the printers devil from the pall mall gazette office whom the writer endeavored as best he could to satisfy his exertions to complete his work rendered his fever the greater he could only furnish a part of the quantity of copy usually supplied by him and shandon being absent and warrington not in london to give a help the political and editorial columns of the gazette looked very blank indeed nor did the subeditor know how to fill them mr finucane rushed up to pens chambers and found that gentleman so exceedingly unwell that the goodnatured irishman set to work to supply his place if possible and produced a series of political and critical compositions such as no doubt greatly edified the readers of the periodical in which he and pen were concerned allusions to the greatness of ireland and the genius and virtue of the inhabitants of that injured country flowed magnificently from finucanes pen and shandon the chief of the paper who was enjoying himself placidly at boulognesurmer looking over the columns of the journal which was forwarded to him instantly recognized the hand of the great subeditor and said laughing as he flung over the paper to his wife look here mary my dear here is jack at work again indeed jack was a warm friend and a gallant partisan and when he had the pen in hand seldom let slip an opportunity of letting the world know that rafferty was the greatest painter in europe and wondering at the petty jealousy of the academy which refused to make him an r a of stating that it was generally reported at the west end that mr rooney m p was appointed governor of barataria or of introducing into the subject in hand whatever it might be a compliment to the round towers or the giants causeway and besides doing pens work for him to the best of his ability his kindhearted comrade offered to forego his saturdays and sundays holiday and pass those days of holiday and rest as nursetender to arthur who however insisted that the other should not forego his pleasure and thankfully assured him that he could bear best his malady alone taking his supper at the backkitchen on the friday night after having achieved the work of the paper finucane informed captain costigan of the illness of their young friend in the temple and remembering the fact two days afterward the captain went to lamb court and paid a visit to the invalid on sunday afternoon he found mrs flanagan the laundress in tears in the sittingroom and got a bad report of the poor dear young gentleman within pens condition had so much alarmed her that she was obliged to have recourse to the stimulus of brandy to enable her to support the grief which his illness occasioned as she hung about his bed and endeavored to minister to him her attentions became intolerable to the invalid and he begged her peevishly not to come near him hence the laundresss tears and redoubled grief and renewed application to the bottle which she was accustomed to use as an anodyne the captain rated the woman soundly for her intemperance and pointed out to her the fatal consequences which must ensue if she persisted in her imprudent courses pen who was by this time in a very fevered state was yet greatly pleased to receive costigans visit he heard the wellknown voice in his sittingroom as he lay in the bedroom within and called the captain eagerly to him and thanked him for coming and begged him to take a chair and talk to him the captain felt the young mans pulse with great gravityhis own tremulous and clammy hand growing steady for the instant while his finger pressed arthurs throbbing veinthe pulse was beating very fiercelypens face was haggard and hothis eyes were bloodshot and gloomy his bird as the captain pronounced the word afterward giving a description of his condition had not been shaved for nearly a week pen made his visitor sit down and tossing and turning in his comfortless bed began to try and talk to the captain in a lively manner about the backkitchen about vauxhall and when they should go again and about fannyhow was little fanny illustration indeed how was she we know how she went home very sadly on the previous sunday evening after she had seen arthur light his lamp in his chambers while he was having his interview with bows bows came back to his own rooms presently passing by the lodge door and looking into mrs boltons according to his wont as he passed but with a very melancholy face she had another weary night that night her restlessness wakened her little bedfellows more than once she darent read more of walter lorraine father was at home and would suffer no light she kept the book under her pillow and felt for it in the night she had only just got to sleep when the children began to stir with the morning almost as early as the birds though she was very angry with bows she went to his room at her accustomed hour in the day and there the goodhearted musician began to talk to her i saw mr pendennis last night fanny he said did you i thought you did fanny answered looking fiercely at the melancholy old gentleman ive been fond of you ever since we came to live in this place he continued you were a child when i came and you used to like me fanny until three or four days ago until you saw this gentleman and now i suppose you are going to say ill of him said fanny do mr bowsthat will make me like you better indeed i shall do no such thing bows answered i think he is a very good and honest young man indeed you know that if you said a word against him i would never speak a word to you againnever cried miss fanny and clenched her little hand and paced up and down the room bows noted watched and followed the ardent little creature with admiration and gloomy sympathy her cheeks flushed her frame trembled her eyes beamed love anger defiance you would like to speak ill of him she said but you darentyou know you darent i knew him many years since bows continued when he was almost as young as you are and he had a romantic attachment for our friend the captains daughterlady mirabel that is now fanny laughed i suppose there was other people too that had a romantic attachment for miss costigan she said i dont want to hear about em he wanted to marry her but their ages were quite disproportionate and their rank in life she would not have him because he had no money she acted very wisely in refusing him for the two would have been very unhappy and she wasnt a fit person to go and live with his family or to make his home comfortable mr pendennis has his way to make in the world and must marry a lady of his own rank a woman who loves a man will not ruin his prospects cause him to quarrel with his family and lead him into poverty and misery for her gratification an honest girl wont do that for her own sake or for the mans fannys emotion which but now had been that of defiance and anger here turned to dismay and supplication what do i know about marrying bows she said when was there any talk of it what has there been between this young gentleman and me thats to make people speak so cruel it was not my doing nor arthursmr pendenniss that i met him at vauxhall it was the captain took me and ma there we never thought of nothing wrong im sure he came and rescued us and was so very kind then he came to call and ask after us and very very good it was of such a grand gentleman to be so polite to humble folks like us and yesterday ma and me just went to walk in the temple gardens andandhere she broke out with that usual unanswerable female argument of tearsand cried oh i wish i was dead i wish i was laid in my grave and had never never seen him he said as much himself fanny bows said and fanny asked through her sobs why why should he wish he had never seen her had she ever done him any harm oh she would perish rather than do him any harm whereupon the musician informed her of the conversation of the day previous showed her that pen could not and must not think of her as a wife fitting for him and that she as she valued her honest reputation must strive too to forget him and fanny leaving the musician convinced but still of the same mind and promising that she would avoid the danger which menaced her went back to the porters lodge and told her mother all she talked of her love for arthur and bewailed in her artless manner the inequality of their condition that set barriers between them theres the lady of lyons fanny said oh ma how i did love mr macready when i saw him do it and pauline for being faithful to poor claude and always thinking of him and he coming back to her an officer through all his dangers and if every body admires paulineand im sure every body does for being so true to a poor manwhy should a gentleman be ashamed of loving a poor girl not that mr arthur loves meoh no no i aint worthy of him only a princess is worthy of such a gentleman as him such a poetwriting so beautifully and looking so grand im sure hes a nobleman and of ancient family and kep out of his estate perhaps his uncle has it ah if i might oh how id serve him and work for him and slave for him that i would i wouldnt ask for more than that majust to be allowed to see him of a morning and sometimes hed say how dyou do fanny or god bless you fanny as he said on sunday and id work and work and id sit up all night and read and learn and make myself worthy of him the captain says his mother lives in the country and is a grand lady there oh how i wish i might go and be her servant ma i can do plenty of things and work very neat andand sometimes hed come home and i should see him the girls head fell on her mothers shoulder as she spoke and she gave way to a plentiful outpouring of girlish tears to which the matron of course joined her own you mustnt think no more of him fanny she said if he dont come to you hes a horrid wicked man dont call him so mother fanny replied hes the best of men the best and the kindest bows says he thinks he is unhappy at leaving poor little fanny it wasnt his fault was it that we metand it aint his that i mustnt see him again he says i mustntand i mustnt mother hell forget me but i shall never forget him no ill pray for him and love him alwaysuntil i dieand i shall die i know i shalland then my spirit will always go and be with him you forget your poor mother fanny and youll break my heart by goin on so mrs bolton said perhaps you will see him im sure youll see him im sure hell come today if ever i saw a man in love that man is him when emily budds young man first came about her he was sent away by old budd a most respectable man and violoncello in the orchestra at the wells and his own family wouldnt hear of it neither but he came back we all knew he would emily always said so and he married her and this one will come back too and you mark a mothers words and see if he dont dear at this point of the conversation mr bolton entered the lodge for his evening meal at the fathers appearance the talk between mother and daughter ceased instantly mrs bolton caressed and cajoled the surly undertakers aiddecamp and said lor mr b whod have thought to see you away from the club of a saturday night fanny dear get your pa some supper what will you have b the poor gurls got a gathering in her eye or somethink in iti was looking at it just now as you came in and she squeezed her daughters hand as a signal of prudence and secrecy and fannys tears were dried up likewise and by that wondrous hypocrisy and power of disguise which women practice and with which weapons of defense nature endows them the traces of her emotion disappeared and she went and took her work and sat in the corner so demure and quiet that the careless male parent never suspected that any thing ailed her thus as if fate seemed determined to inflame and increase the poor childs malady and passion all circumstances and all parties round about her urged it on her mother encouraged and applauded it and the very words which bows used in endeavoring to repress her flame only augmented this unlucky fever pen was not wicked and a seducer pen was highminded in wishing to avoid her pen loved her the good and the great the magnificent youth with the chains of gold and the scented auburn hair and so he did or so he would have loved her five years back perhaps before the world had hardened the ardent and reckless boybefore he was ashamed of a foolish and imprudent passion and strangled it as poor women do their illicit children not on account of the crime but of the shame and from dread that the finger of the world should point to them what respectable person in the world will not say he was quite right to avoid a marriage with an illeducated person of low degree whose relations a gentleman could not well acknowledge and whose manners would not become her new stationand what philosopher would not tell him that the best thing to do with these little passions if they spring up is to get rid of them and let them pass over and cure them that no man dies about a woman or vice versa and that one or the other having found the impossibility of gratifying his or her desire in the particular instance must make the best of matters forget each other look out elsewhere and choose again and yet perhaps there may be something said on the other side perhaps bows was right in admiring that passion of pens blind and unreasoning as it was that made him ready to stake his all for his love perhaps if selfsacrifice is a laudable virtue mere worldly selfsacrifice is not very much to be praisedin fine let this be a reserved point to be settled by the individual moralist who chooses to debate it so much is certain that with the experience of the world which mr pen now had he would have laughed at and scouted the idea of marrying a penniless girl out of a kitchen and this point being fixed in his mind he was but doing his duty as an honest man in crushing any unlucky fondness which he might feel toward poor little fanny so she waited and waited in hopes that arthur would come she waited for a whole week and it was at the end of that time that the poor little creature heard from costigan of the illness under which arthur was suffering it chanced on that very evening after costigan had visited pen that arthurs uncle the excellent major arrived in town from buxton where his health had been mended and sent his valet morgan to make inquiries for arthur and to request that gentleman to breakfast with the major the next morning the major was merely passing through london on his way to the marquis of steynes house of stillbrook where he was engaged to shoot partridges morgan came back to his master with a very long face he had seen mr arthur mr arthur was very bad indeed mr arthur was in bed with a fever a doctor ought to be sent to him and morgan thought his case most alarming gracious goodness this was sad news indeed he had hoped that arthur could come down to stillbrook he had arranged that he should go and procured an invitation for his nephew from lord steyne he must go himself he couldnt throw lord steyne over the fever might be catching it might be measles he had never himself had the measles they were dangerous when contracted at his age was any body with mr arthur morgan said there was somebody a nussing of mr arthur the major then asked had his nephew taken any advice morgan said he had asked that question and had been told that mr pendennis had had no doctor morgans master was sincerely vexed at hearing of arthurs calamity he would have gone to him but what good could it do arthur that he the major should catch a fever his own ailments rendered it absolutely impossible that he should attend to any body but himself but the young man must have advicethe best advice and morgan was straightway dispatched with a note from major pendennis to his friend doctor goodenough who by good luck happened to be in london and at home and who quitted his dinner instantly and whose carriage was in half an hour in upper temple lane near pens chambers the major had asked the kindhearted physician to bring him news of his nephew at the club where he himself was dining and in the course of the night the doctor made his appearance the affair was very serious the patient was in a high fever he had had pen bled instantly and would see him the first thing in the morning the major went disconsolate to bed with this unfortunate news when goodenough came to see him according to his promise the next day the doctor had to listen for a quarter of an hour to an account of the majors own maladies before the latter had leisure to hear about arthur he had had a very bad nighthishis nurse said at one hour he had been delirious it might end badly his mother had better be sent for immediately the major wrote the letter to mrs pendennis with the greatest alacrity and at the same time with the most polite precautions as for going himself to the lad in his state it was impossible could i be of any use to him my dear doctor he asked the doctor with a peculiar laugh said no he didnt think the major could be of any use that his own precious health required the most delicate treatment and that he had best go into the country and stay that he himself would take care to see the patient twice a day and do all in his power for him the major declared upon his honor that if he could be of any use he would rush to pens chambers as it was morgan should go and see that every thing was right the doctor must write to him by every post to stillbrook it was but forty miles distant from london and if any thing happened he would come up at any sacrifice major pendennis transacted his benevolence by deputy and by post what else could he do as he said gad you know in these cases its best not disturbing a fellow if a poor fellow goes to the bad why gad you know hes disposed of but in order to get well and in this my dear doctor im sure that you will agree with me the best way is to keep him quietperfectly quiet thus it was the old gentleman tried to satisfy his conscience and he went his way that day to stillbrook by railway for railways have sprung up in the course of this narrative though they have not quite penetrated into pens country yet and made his appearance in his usual trim order and curly wig at the dinnertable of the marquis of steyne but we must do the major the justice to say that he was very unhappy and gloomy in demeanor wagg and wenham rallied him about his low spirits asked whether he was crossed in love and otherwise diverted themselves at his expense he lost his money at whist after dinner and actually trumped his partners highest spade and the thoughts of the suffering boy of whom he was proud and whom he loved after his manner kept the old fellow awake half through the night and made him feverish and uneasy on the morrow he received a note in a handwriting which he did not know it was that of mr bows indeed saying that mr arthur pendennis had had a tolerable night and that as dr goodenough had stated that the major desired to be informed of his nephews health he r b had sent him the news per rail the next day he was going out shooting about noon with some of the gentlemen staying at lord steynes house and the company waiting for the carriages were assembled on the terrace in front of the house when a fly drove up from the neighboring station and a grayheaded rather shabby old gentleman jumped out and asked for major pendennis it was mr bows he took the major aside and spoke to him most of the gentlemen round about saw that something serious had happened from the alarmed look of the majors face wagg said its a bailiff come down to nab the major but nobody laughed at the pleasantry hullo whats the matter pendennis cried lord steyne with his strident voice any thing wrong itsits my boy thats dead said the major and burst into a sobthe old man was quite overcome not dead my lord but very ill when i left london mr bows said in a low voice a britzka came up at this moment as the three men were speaking the peer looked at his watch youve twenty minutes to catch the mailtrain jump in pendennis and drive like h sir do you hear the carriage drove off swiftly with pendennis and his companions and let us trust that the oath will be pardoned to the marquis of steyne the major drove rapidly from the station to the temple and found a traveling carriage already before him and blocking up the narrow temple lane two ladies got out of it and were asking their way of the porters the major looked by chance at the panel of the carriage and saw the wornout crest of the eagle looking at the sun and the motto nec tenui penna painted beneath it was his brothers old carriage built many many years ago it was helen and laura that were asking their way to poor pens room he ran up to them hastily clasped his sisters arm and kissed her hand and the three entered into lambcourt and mounted the long gloomy stair they knocked very gently at the door on which arthurs name was written and it was opened by fanny bolton chapter xiv a critical chapter as fanny saw the two ladies and the anxious countenance of the elder who regarded her with a look of inscrutable alarm and terror the poor girl at once knew that pens mother was before her there was a resemblance between the widows haggard eyes and arthurs as he tossed in his bed in fever fanny looked wistfully at mrs pendennis and at laura afterward there was no more expression in the latters face than if it had been a mass of stone hardheartedness and gloom dwelt on the figures of both the new comers neither showed any the faintest gleam of mercy or sympathy for fanny she looked desperately from them to the major behind them old pendennis dropped his eyelids looking up ever so stealthily from under them at arthurs poor little nurse illustration ii wrote to you yesterday if you please maam fanny said trembling in every limb as she spoke and as pale as laura whose sad menacing face looked over mrs pendenniss shoulder did you madam mrs pendennis said i suppose i may now relieve you from nursing my son i am his mother you understand yes maam ithis is the way to hiso wait a minute cried out fanny i must prepare you for his the widow whose face had been hopelessly cruel and ruthless here started back with a gasp and a little cry which she speedily stifled hes been so since yesterday fanny said trembling very much and with chattering teeth a horrid shriek of laughter came out of pens room whereof the door was open and after several shouts the poor wretch began to sing a college drinking song and then to hurra and to shout as if he was in the midst of a wine party and to thump with his fist against the wainscot he was quite delirious he does not know me maam fanny said indeed perhaps he will know his mother let me pass if you please and go into him and the widow hastily pushed by little fanny and through the dark passage which led into pens sittingroom laura sailed by fanny too without a word and major pendennis followed them fanny sat down on a bench in the passage and cried and prayed as well as she could she would have died for him and they hated her they had not a word of thanks or kindness for her the fine ladies she sate there in the passage she did not know how long they never came out to speak to her she sate there until doctor goodenough came to pay his second visit that day he found the poor little thing at the door what nurse hows your patient asked the goodnatured doctor has he had any rest go and ask them theyre inside fanny answered who his mother fanny nodded her head and didnt speak you must go to bed yourself my poor little maid said the doctor you will be ill too if you dont o maynt i come and see him maynt i come and see him iilove him so the little girl said and as she spoke she fell down on her knees and clasped hold of the doctors hand in such an agony that to see her melted the kind physicians heart and caused a mist to come over his spectacles pooh pooh nonsense nurse has he taken his draught has he had any rest of course you must come and see him so must i theyll let me sit here wont they sir ill never make no noise i only ask to stop here fanny said on which the doctor called her a stupid little thing put her down upon the bench where pens printers devil used to sit so many hours tapped her pale cheek with his finger and bustled into the further room mrs pendennis was ensconced pale and solemn in a great chair by pens bedside her watch was on the bedtable by pens medicines her bonnet and cloaks were laid in the window she had her bible in her lap without which she never traveled her first movement after seeing her son had been to take fannys shawl and bonnet which were on his drawers and bring them out and drop them down upon his studytable she had closed the door upon major pendennis and laura too and taken possession of her son she had had a great doubt and terror lest arthur should not know her but that pang was spared to her in part at least pen knew his mother quite well and familiarly smiled and nodded at her when she came in he instantly fancied that they were at home at fairoaks and began to talk and chatter and laugh in a rambling wild way laura could hear him outside his laughter shot shafts of poison into her heart it was true then he had been guiltyand with that creaturean intrigue with a servant maid and she had loved himand he was dying most likelyraving and unrepentant the major now and then hummed out a word of remark or consolation which laura scarce heard a dismal sitting it was for all parties and when goodenough appeared he came like an angel into the room it is not only for the sick man it is for the sick mans friends that the doctor comes his presence is often as good for them as for the patient and they long for him yet more eagerly how we have all watched after him what an emotion the thrill of his carriagewheels in the street and at length at the door has made us feel how we hang upon his words and what a comfort we get from a smile or two if he can vouchsafe that sunshine to lighten our darkness who hasnt seen the mother praying into his face to know if there is hope for the sick infant that can not speak and that lies yonder its little frame battling with fever ah how she looks into his eyes what thanks if there is light there what grief and pain if he casts them down and dares not say hope or it is the housefather who is stricken the terrified wife looks on while the physician feels his patients wrist smothering her agonies as the children have been called upon to stay their plays and their talk over the patient in the fever the wife expectant the children unconscious the doctor stands as if he were fate the dispenser of life and death he must let the patient off this time the woman prays so for his respite one can fancy how awful the responsibility must be to a conscientious man how cruel the feeling that he has given the wrong remedy or that it might have been possible to do better how harassing the sympathy with survivors if the case is unfortunatehow immense the delight of victory having passed through a hasty ceremony of introduction to the new comers of whose arrival he had been made aware by the heartbroken little nurse in waiting without the doctor proceeded to examine the patient about whose condition of high fever there could be no mistake and on whom he thought it necessary to exercise the strongest antiphlogistic remedies in his power he consoled the unfortunate mother as best he might and giving her the most comfortable assurances on which he could venture that there was no reason to despair yet that every thing might still be hoped from his youth the strength of his constitution and so forth and having done his utmost to allay the horrors of the alarmed matron he took the elder pendennis aside into the vacant room warringtons bedroom for the purpose of holding a little consultation the case was very critical the fever if not stopped might and would carry off the young fellow he must be bled forthwith the mother must be informed of this necessity why was that other young lady brought with her she was out of place in a sick room and there was another woman still be hanged to it the major said thethe little person who opened the door his sisterinlaw had brought the poor little devils bonnet and shawl out and flung them upon the studytable did goodenough know any thing about thethe little person i just caught a glimpse of her as we passed in the major said and begad she was uncommonly nicelooking the doctor looked queer the doctor smiledin the very gravest moments with life and death pending such strange contrasts and occasions of humor will arise and such smiles will pass to satirize the gloom as it were and to make it more gloomy illustration i have it at last he said reentering the study and he wrote a couple of notes hastily at the table there and sealed one of them then taking up poor fannys shawl and bonnet and the notes he went out in the passage to that poor little messenger and said quick nurse you must carry this to the surgeon and bid him come instantly and then go to my house and ask for my servant harbottle and tell him to get this prescription prepared and wait until iuntil it is ready it may take a little time in preparation so poor fanny trudged away with her two notes and found the apothecary who lived in the strand hard by and who came straightway his lancet in his pocket to operate on his patient and then fanny made for the doctors house in hanoversquare the doctor was at home again before the prescription was made up which took harbottle his servant such a long time in compounding and during the remainder of arthurs illness poor fanny never made her appearance in the quality of nurse at his chambers any more but for that day and the next a little figure might be seen lurking about pens staircasea sad sad little face looked at and interrogated the apothecary and the apothecarys boy and the laundress and the kind physician himself as they passed out of the chambers of the sick man and on the third day the kind doctors chariot stopped at shepherds inn and the good and honest and benevolent man went into the porters lodge and tended a little patient he had there for whom the best remedy he found was on the day when he was enabled to tell fanny bolton that the crisis was over and that there was at length every hope for arthur pendennis j costigan esquire late of her majestys service saw the doctors carriage and criticised its horses and appointments green liveries bedad the general said and as foin a pair of highstepping bee horses as ever a gentleman need sit behoind let alone a docthor theres no ind to the proide and argance of them docthors nowadaysnot but that is a good one and a scoientific cyarkter and a roight good fellow bedad and hes brought the poor little girl well troo her faver bows me boy and so pleased was mr costigan with the doctors behavior and skill that whenever he met dr goodenoughs carriage in future he made a point of saluting it and the physician inside in as courteous and magnificent a manner as if dr goodenough had been the lord liftenant himself and captain costigan had been in his glory in phaynix park the widows gratitude to the physician knew no boundsor scarcely any bounds at least the kind gentleman laughed at the idea of taking a fee from a literary man or the widow of a brother practitioner and she determined when she got back to fairoaks that she would send goodenough the silvergilt vase the jewel of the house and the glory of the late john pendennis preserved in green baize and presented to him at bath by the lady elizabeth firebrace on the recovery of her son the late sir anthony firebrace from the scarlet fever hippocrates hygeia king bladud and a wreath of serpents surmount the cup to this day which was executed in their finest manner by messrs abednego of milsomstreet and the inscription was by mr birch tutor to the young baronet this priceless gem of art the widow determined to devote to goodenough the preserver of her son and there was scarcely any other favor which her gratitude would not have conferred upon him except one which he desired most and which was that she should think a little charitably and kindly of poor fanny of whose artless sad story he had got something during his interviews with her and of whom he was induced to think very kindlynot being disposed indeed to give much credit to pen for his conduct in the affair or not knowing what that conduct had been he knew enough however to be aware that the poor infatuated little girl was without stain as yet that while she had been in pens room it was to see the last of him as she thought and that arthur was scarcely aware of her presence and that she suffered under the deepest and most pitiful grief at the idea of losing him dead or living but on the one or two occasions when goodenough alluded to fanny the widows countenance always soft and gentle assumed an expression so cruel and inexorable that the doctor saw it was in vain to ask her for justice or pity and he broke off all entreaties and ceased making any further allusions regarding his little client there is a complaint which neither poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the east could allay in the men in his time as we are informed by a popular poet of the days of elizabeth and which when exhibited in women no medical discoveries or practice subsequent neither homoeopathy nor hydropathy nor mesmerism nor dr simpson nor dr locock can cure and that iswe wont call it jealousy but rather gently denominate rivalry and emulation in ladies some of those mischievious and prosaic people who carp and calculate at every detail of the romancer and want to know for instance how when the characters in the critic are at a dead lock with their daggers at each others throats they are to be got out of that murderous complication of circumstances may be induced to ask how it was possible in a set of chambers in the temple consisting of three rooms two cupboards a passage and a coalbox arthur a sick gentleman helen his mother laura her adopted daughter martha their country attendant mrs wheezer a nurse from st bartholomews hospital mrs flanagan an irish laundress major pendennis a retired military officer morgan his valet pidgeon mr arthur pendenniss boy and others could be accommodatedthe answer is given at once that almost every body in the temple was out of town and that there was scarcely a single occupant of pens house in lamb court except those who were occupied round the sick bed of the sick gentleman about whose fever we have not given a lengthy account neither shall we enlarge very much upon the more cheerful theme of his recovery every body we have said was out of town and of course such a fashionable man as young mr sibwright who occupied chambers on the second floor in pens staircase could not be supposed to remain in london mrs flanagan mr pendenniss laundress was acquainted with mrs rouncy who did for mr sibwright and that gentlemans bedroom was got ready for miss bell or mrs pendennis when the latter should be inclined to leave her sons sick room to try and seek for a little rest for herself if that young buck and flower of bakerstreet percy sibwright could have known who was the occupant of his bedroom how proud he would have been of that apartment what poems he would have written about laura several of his things have appeared in the annuals and in manuscript in the nobilitys albumshe was a camford man and very nearly got the english prize poem it was saidsibwright however was absent and his bed given up to miss bell it was the prettiest little brass bed in the world with chintz curtains lined with pinkhe had a mignonette box in his bedroom window and the mere sight of his little exhibition of shiny boots arranged in trim rows over his wardrobe was a gratification to the beholder he had a museum of scent pomatum and bears grease pots quite curious to examine too and a choice selection of portraits of females almost always in sadness and generally in disguise or dishabille glittered round the neat walls of his elegant little bower of repose medora with disheveled hair was consoling herself over her banjo for the absence of her conradthe princesse fleur de marie of rudolstein and the mysteres de paris was sadly ogling out of the bars of her convent cage in which poor prisoned bird she was moulting awaydorothea of don quixote was washing her eternal feetin fine it was such an elegant gallery as became a gallant lover of the sex and in sibwrights sittingroom while there was quite an infantine law library clad in skins of fresh new born calf there was a tolerably large collection of classical books which he could not read and of english and french works of poetry and fiction which he read a great deal too much his invitation cards of the past season still decorated his looking glass and scarce any thing told of the lawyer but the wigbox beside the venus upon the middle shelf of the bookcase on which the name of p sibwright esquire was gilded with sibwright in chambers was mr bangham mr bangham was a sporting man married to a rich widow mr bangham had no practicedid not come to chambers thrice in a term went a circuit for those mysterious reasons which make men go circuitand his room served as a great convenience to sibwright when that young gentleman gave his little dinners it must be confessed that these two gentlemen have nothing to do with our history will never appear in it again probably but we can not help glancing through their doors as they happen to be open to us and as we pass to pens rooms as in the pursuit of our own business in life through the strand at the club nay at church itself we can not help peeping at the shops on the way or at our neighbors dinner or at the faces under the bonnets in the next pew very many years after the circumstances about which we are at present occupied laura with a blush and a laugh showing much humor owned to having read a french novel once much in vogue and when her husband asked her wondering where on earth she could have got such a volume she owned that it was in the temple when she lived in mr percy sibwrights chambers and also i never confessed she said on that same occasion what i must now own to that i opened the japanned box and took out that strangelooking wig inside it and put it on and looked at myself in the glass in it suppose percy sibwright had come in at such a moment as that what would he have saidthe enraptured rogue what would have been all the pictures of disguised beauties in his room compared to that living one ah we are speaking of old times when sibwright was a bachelor and before he got a county courtwhen people were youngwhen most people were young other people are young now but we no more when miss laura played this prank with the wig you cant suppose that pen could have been very ill upstairs otherwise though she had grown to care for him ever so little common sense of feeling and decorum would have prevented her from performing any tricks or trying any disguises but all sorts of events had occurred in the course of the last few days which had contributed to increase or account for her gayety and a little colony of the readers old friends and acquaintances was by this time established in lamb court temple and round pens sick bed there first martha mrs pendenniss servant had arrived from fairoaks being summoned thence by the major who justly thought her presence would be comfortable and useful to her mistress and her young master for neither of whom the constant neighborhood of mrs flanagan who during pens illness required more spirituous consolation than ever to support her could be pleasant martha then made her appearance in due season to wait upon mrs pendennis nor did that lady go once to bed until the faithful servant had reached her when with a heart full of maternal thankfulness she went and lay down upon warringtons straw mattress and among his mathematical books as has been already described it is true ere that day a great and delightful alteration in pens condition had taken place the fever subjugated by dr goodenoughs blisters potions and lancet had left the young man or only returned at intervals of feeble intermittance his wandering senses had settled in his weakened brain he had had time to kiss and bless his mother for coming to him and calling for laura and his uncle who were both affected according to their different natures by his wan appearance his lean shrunken hands his hollow eyes and voice his thin bearded face to press their hands and thank them affectionately and after this greeting and after they had been turned out of the room by his affectionate nurse he had sunk into a fine sleep which had lasted for about sixteen hours at the end of which period he awoke calling out that he was very hungry if it is hard to be ill and to loathe food oh how pleasant to be getting well and to be feeling hungryhow hungry alas the joys of convalescence become feebler with increasing years as other joys doand thenand then comes that illness when one does not convalesce at all on the day of this happy event too came another arrival in lambcourt this was introduced into the penwarrington sittingroom by large puffs of tobacco smokethe puffs of smoke were followed by an individual with a cigar in his mouth and a carpet bag under his arm this was warrington who had run back from norfolk when mr bows thoughtfully wrote to inform him of his friends calamity but he had been from home when bowss letter had reached his brothers house the eastern counties did not then boast of a railway for we beg the reader to understand that we only commit anachronisms when we choose and when by a daring violation of those natural laws some great ethical truth is to be advancedin fine warrington only appeared with the rest of the good luck upon the lucky day after pens convalescence may have been said to have begun his surprise was after all not very great when he found the chambers of his sick friend occupied and his old acquaintance the major seated demurely in an easy chair warrington had let himself into the rooms with his own passkey listening or pretending to listen to a young lady who was reading to him a play of shakspeare in a low sweet voice the lady stopped and started and laid down her book at the apparition of the tall traveler with the cigar and the carpetbag he blushed he flung the cigar into the passage he took off his hat and dropped that too and going up to the major seized that old gentlemans hand and asked questions about arthur the major answered in a tremulous though cheery voiceit was curious how emotion seemed to olden himand returning warringtons pressure with a shaking hand told him the newsof arthurs happy crisis of his mothers arrivalwith her young chargewith miss you need not tell me her name mr warrington said with great animation for he was affected and elated with the thought of his friends recoveryyou need not tell me your name i knew at once it was laura and he held out his hand and took hers immense kindness and tenderness gleamed from under his rough eyebrows and shook his voice as he gazed at her and spoke to her and this is laura his looks seemed to say and this is warrington the generous girls heart beat back arthurs herothe brave and the kindhe has come hundreds of miles to succor him when he heard of his friends misfortune thank you mr warrington was all that laura said however and as she returned the pressure of his kind hand she blushed so that she was glad the lamp was behind her to conceal her flushing face as these two were standing in this attitude the door of pens bedchamber was opened stealthily as his mother was wont to open it and warrington saw another lady who first looked at him and then turning round toward the bed said hsh and put up her hand it was to pen helen was turning and giving caution he called out with a feeble tremulous but cheery voice come in stunnercome in warrington i knew it was youby theby the smoke old boy he said as holding his worn hand out and with tears at once of weakness and pleasure in his eyes he greeted his friend ii beg pardon maam for smoking warrington said who now almost for the first time blushed for his wicked propensity helen only said god bless you mr warrington she was so happy she would have liked to kiss george then and after the friends had had a brief very brief interview the delighted and inexorable mother giving her hand to warrington sent him out of the room too back to laura and the major who had not resumed their play of cymbeline where they had left it off at the arrival of the rightful owner of pens chambers chapter xv convalescence illustration our duty now is to record a fact concerning pendennis which however shameful and disgraceful when told regarding the chief personage and godfather of a novel must nevertheless be made known to the public who reads his veritable memoirs having gone to bed ill with fever and suffering to a certain degree under the passion of love after he had gone through his physical malady and had been bled and had been blistered and had had his head shaved and had been treated and medicamented as the doctor ordained it is a fact that when he rallied up from his bodily ailment his mental malady had likewise quitted him and he was no more in love with fanny bolton than you or i who are much too wise or too moral to allow our hearts to go gadding after porters daughters he laughed at himself as he lay on his pillow thinking of this second cure which had been effected upon him he did not care the least about fanny now he wondered how he ever should have cared and according to his custom made an autopsy of that dead passion and anatomized his own defunct sensation for his poor little nurse what could have made him so hot and eager about her but a few weeks back not her wit not her breeding not her beautythere were hundreds of women better looking than she it was out of himself that the passion had gone it did not reside in her she was the same but the eyes which saw her were changed and alas that it should be so were not particularly eager to see her any more he felt very well disposed toward the little thing and so forth but as for violent personal regard such as he had but a few weeks ago it had fled under the influence of the pill and lancet which had destroyed the fever in his frame and an immense source of comfort and gratitude it was to pendennis though there was something selfish in that feeling as in most others of our young man that he had been enabled to resist temptation at the time when the danger was greatest and had no particular cause of selfreproach as he remembered his conduct toward the young girl as from a precipice down which he might have fallen so from the fever from which he had recovered he reviewed the fanny bolton snare now that he had escaped out of it but im not sure that he was not ashamed of the very satisfaction which he experienced it is pleasant perhaps but it is humiliating to own that you love no more meanwhile the kind smiles and tender watchfulness of the mother at his bedside filled the young man with peace and security to see that health was returning was all the unwearied nurse demanded to execute any caprice or order of her patients her chiefest joy and reward he felt himself environed by her love and thought himself almost as grateful for it as he had been when weak and helpless in childhood some misty notions regarding the first part of his illness and that fanny had nursed him pen may have had but they were so dim that he could not realize them with accuracy or distinguish them from what he knew to be delusions which had occurred and were remembered during the delirium of his fever so as he had not thought proper on former occasions to make any allusions about fanny bolton to his mother of course he could not now confide to her his sentiments regarding fanny or make this worthy lady a confidante it was on both sides an unlucky precaution and want of confidence and a word or two in time might have spared the good lady and those connected with her a deal of pain and anguish seeing miss bolton installed as nurse and tender to pen i am sorry to say mrs pendennis had put the worst construction on the fact of the intimacy of these two unlucky young persons and had settled in her own mind that the accusations against arthur were true why not have stopped to inquirethere are stories to a mans disadvantage that the women who are fondest of him are always the most eager to believe isnt a mans wife often the first to be jealous of him poor pen got a good stock of this suspicious kind of love from the nurse who was now watching over him and the kind and pure creature thought that her boy had gone through a malady much more awful and debasing than the mere physical fever and was stained by crime as well as weakened by illness the consciousness of this she had to bear perforce silently and to try to put a mask of cheerfulness and confidence over her inward doubt and despair and horror when captain shandon at boulogne read the next number of the pallmall gazette it was to remark to mrs shandon that jack finucanes hand was no longer visible in the leading articles and that mr warrington must be at work there again i know the crack of his whip in a hundred and the cut which the fellows thong leaves theres jack bludyer goes to work like a butcher and mangles a subject mr warrington finishes a man and lays his cuts neat and regular straight down the back and drawing blood every line at which dreadful metaphor mrs shandon said law charles how can you talk so i always thought mr warrington very high but a kind gentleman and im sure he was most kind to the children upon which shandon said yes hes kind to the children but hes savage to the men and to be sure my dear you dont understand a word about what im saying and its best you shouldnt for its little good comes out of writing for newspapers and its better here living easy at boulogne where the wines plenty and the brandy costs but two francs a bottle mix us another tumbler mary my dear well go back into harness soon cras ingens iterabimus aequorbad luck to it in a word warrington went to work with all his might in place of his prostrate friend and did pens portion of the pallmall gazette with a vengeance as the saying is he wrote occasional articles and literary criticisms he attended theatres and musical performances and discoursed about them with his usual savage energy his hand was too strong for such small subjects and it pleased him to tell arthurs mother and uncle and laura that there was no hand in all the band of penmen more graceful and light more pleasant and more elegant than arthurs the people in this country maam dont understand what style is or they would see the merits of our young one he said to mrs pendennis i call him ours maam for i bred him and i am as proud of him as you are and bating a little willfulness and a little selfishness and a little dandyfication i dont know a more honest or loyal or gentle creature his pen is wicked sometimes but he is as kind as a young ladyas miss laura hereand i believe he would not do any living mortal harm at this helen though she heaved a deep deep sigh and laura though she too was sadly wounded nevertheless were most thankful for warringtons good opinion of arthur and loved him for being so attached to their pen and major pendennis was loud in his praises of mr warringtonmore loud and enthusiastic than it was the majors wont to be he is a gentleman my dear creature he said to helen every inch a gentleman my good madamthe suffolk warringtons charles the firsts baronets what could he be but a gentleman come out of that familyfathersir miles warrington ran away withbeg your pardon miss bell sir miles was a very wellknown man in london and a friend of the prince of wales this gentleman is a man of the greatest talents the very highest accomplishments sure to get on if he had a motive to put his energies to work laura blushed for herself while the major was talking and praising arthurs hero as she looked at warringtons manly face and dark melancholy eyes this young person had been speculating about him and had settled in her mind that he must have been the victim of an unhappy attachment and as she caught herself so speculating why miss bell blushed warrington got chambers hard bygreniers chambers in flagcourt and having executed pens task with great energy in the morning his delight and pleasure of an afternoon was to come and sit with the sick mans company in the sunny autumn evenings and he had the honor more than once of giving miss bell his arm for a walk in the temple gardens to take which pastime when the frank laura asked of helen permission the major eagerly said yes yes begadof course you go out with himits like the country you know everybody goes out with every body in the gardens and there are beadles you know and that sort of thingevery body walks in the temple gardens if the great arbiter of morals did not object why should simple helen she was glad that her girl should have such fresh air as the river could give and to see her return with heightened color and spirits from these harmless excursions laura and helen had come you must know to a little explanation when the news arrived of pens alarming illness laura insisted upon accompanying the terrified mother to london would not hear of the refusal which the still angry helen gave her and when refused a second time yet more sternly and when it seemed that the poor lost lads life was despaired of and when it was known that his conduct was such as to render all thoughts of union hopeless laura had with many tears told her mother a secret with which every observant person who reads this story is acquainted already now she never could marry him was she to be denied the consolation of owning how fondly how truly how entirely she had loved him the mingling tears of the women appeased the agony of their grief somewhat and the sorrows and terrors of their journey were at least in so far mitigated that they shared them together what could fanny expect when suddenly brought up for sentence before a couple of such judges nothing but swift condemnation awful punishment merciless dismissal women are cruel critics in cases such as that in which poor fanny was implicated and we like them to be so for besides the guard which a man places round his own harem and the defenses which a woman has in her heart her faith and honor hasnt she all her own friends of her own sex to keep watch that she does not go astray and to tear her to pieces if she is found erring when our mahmouds or selims of bakerstreet or belgravesquare visit their fatimas with condign punishment their mothers sew up fatimas sack for her and her sisters and sistersinlaw see her well under water and this present writer does not say nay he protests most solemnly he is a turk too he wears a turban and a beard like another and is all for the sack practice bismillah but o you spotless who have the right of capital punishment vested in you at least be very cautious that you make away with the proper if so she may be called person be very sure of the fact before you order the barge out and dont pop your subject into the bosphorus until you are quite certain that she deserves it this is all i would urge in poor fatimas behalfabsolutely allnot a word more by the beard of the prophet if shes guilty down with herheave over the sack away with it into the golden horn bubble and squeak and justice being done give away men and let us pull back to supper so the major did not in any way object to warringtons continued promenades with miss laura but like a benevolent old gentleman encouraged in every way the intimacy of that couple were there any exhibitions in town he was for warrington conducting her to them if warrington had proposed to take her to vauxhall itself this most complaisant of men would have seen no harmnor would helen if pendennis the elder had so ruled itnor would there have been any harm between two persons whose honor was entirely spotlessbetween warrington who saw in intimacy a pure and highminded and artless woman for the first time in his lifeand laura who too for the first time was thrown into the constant society of a gentleman of great natural parts and powers of pleasing who possessed varied acquirements enthusiasm simplicity humor and that freshness of mind which his simple life and habits gave him and which contrasted so much with pens dandy indifference of manner and faded sneer in warringtons very uncouthness there was a refinement which the others finery lacked in his energy his respect his desire to please his hearty laughter or simple confiding pathos what a difference to sultan pens yawning sovereignty and languid acceptance of homage what had made pen at home such a dandy and such a despot the women had spoiled him as we like them and as they like to do they had cloyed him with obedience and surfeited him with sweet respect and submission until he grew weary of the slaves who waited upon him and their caresses and cajoleries excited him no more abroad he was brisk and lively and eager and impassioned enoughmost men are so constituted and so nurtured does this like the former sentence run a chance of being misinterpreted and does any one dare to suppose that the writer would incite the women to revolt never by the whiskers of the prophet again he says he wears a beard and he likes his women to be slaves what man doesnt what man would be henpecked i saywe will cut off all the heads in christendom or turkeydom rather than that well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favors bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen traveled in the postchaise as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldnt have it out or how daringly he robbed a birds nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggarboy who came into the yardand so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than either one of us being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writers head and which said that the greatest rascalcutthroats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again andmarriages are made in heaven your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tearsand there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor dear wounded heart why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two it is your nature so to do do you suppose it is all for the mans sake that you love and not a bit for your own do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely any body else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably goodlooking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped itshe there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled itand when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr george warrington what on earth was to prevent her from thinking him a most odd original agreeable and pleasing person a long time afterward when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lambcourt perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent the major had a favorable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad he used to go home to his lodgings in burystreet of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quietly he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance and he made interest with the chef at bayss that renowned cook the superintendence of whose work upon gastronomy compelled the gifted author to stay in the metropolis to prepare little jellies delicate clear soups aspics and other trifles good for invalids which morgan the valet constantly brought down to the little lambcourt colony and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr arthur pendennis the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didnt in the least like the bitter flavor but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the majors health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times pen cheered with his feeble voice from his armchair warrington taught miss laura to cry hear hear and tapped the table with his knuckles pidgeon the attendant grinned and honest doctor goodenough found the party so merrily engaged when he came in to pay his faithful gratuitous visit warrington knew sibwright who lived below and that gallant gentleman in reply to a letter informing him of the use to which his apartments had been put wrote back the most polite and flowery letter of acquiescence he placed his chambers at the service of their fair occupants his bed at their disposal his carpets at their feet everybody was kindly disposed toward the sick man and his family his heart and his mothers too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much good feeling and good nature let pens biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy there was a piano in mr sibwrights chamber indeed this gentleman a lover of all the arts performed himselfand exceedingly ill tooupon the instrument and had had a song dedicated to him the words by himself the air by his devoted friend leopoldo twankidillo and at this musicbox as mr warrington called it laura at first with a great deal of tremor and blushing which became her very much played and sang sometimes of an evening simple airs and old songs of home her voice was a rich contralto and warrington who scarcely knew one tune from another and who had but one time or bray in his repertoirea most discordant imitation of god save the kingsat rapt in delight listening to these songs he could follow their rhythm if not their harmony and he could watch with a constant and daily growing enthusiasm the pure and tender and generous creature who made the music i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamppost in lambcourt sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it when pens bedtime came the songs were hushed lights appeared in the upper room his room whither the widow used to conduct him and then the major and mr warrington and sometimes miss laura would have a game at ecarte or backgammon or she would sit by working a pair of slippers in worsteda pair of gentlemans slippersthey might have been for arthur or for george or for major pendennis one of those three would have given any thing for the slippers while such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear just before ten oclock there was another musical performance namely that of the chimes of st clements clock in the strand which played the clear cheerful notes of a psalm before it proceeded to ring its ten fatal strokes as they were ringing laura began to fold up the slippers martha from fairoaks appeared with a bedcandle and a constant smile on her face the major said god bless my soul is it so late warrington and he left their unfinished game and got up and shook hands with miss bell martha from fairoaks lighted them out of the passage and down the stair and as they descended they could hear her bolting and locking the sporting door after them upon her young mistress and herself if there had been any danger grinning martha said she would have got down that thar hooky soord which hung up in gantlemans roommeaning the damascus scimitar with the names of the prophet engraved on the blade and the redvelvet scabbard which percy sibwright esquire brought back from his tour in the levant along with an albanian dress and which he wore with such elegant effect at lady mullingers fancy ball gloucestersquare hyde park it entangled itself in miss kewseys train who appeared in the dress in which she with her mamma had been presented to their sovereign the latter by the ld chncllrs lady and led to events which have nothing to do with this history is not miss kewsey now mrs sibwright has sibwright not got a county courtgood night laura and fairoaks martha sleep well and wake happy pure and gentle lady sometimes after these evenings warrington would walk a little way with major pendennisjust a little wayjust as far as the temple gateas the strandas charing crossas the clubhe was not going into the club well as far as burystreet where he would laughingly shake hands on the majors own doorstep they had been talking about laura all the way it was wonderful how enthusiastic the major who as we know used to dislike her had grown to be regarding the young lady devlish fine girl begad devlish wellmannered girlmy sisterinlaw has the manners of a duchess and would bring up any girl well miss bells a little countryfied but the smell of the hawthorn is pleasant demmy how she blushes your london girls would give many a guinea for a bouquet like thatnatural flowers begad and shes a little money toonothing to speak ofbut a pooty little bit of money in all which opinions no doubt mr warrington agreed and though he laughed as he shook hands with the major his face fell as he left his veteran companion and he strode back to chambers and smoked pipe after pipe long into the night and wrote article upon article more and more savage in lieu of friend pen disabled well it was a happy time for almost all parties concerned pen mended daily sleeping and eating were his constant occupations his appetite was something frightful he was ashamed of exhibiting it before laura and almost before his mother who laughed and applauded him as the roast chicken of his dinner went away he eyed the departing friend with sad longing and began to long for jelly or tea or what not he was like an ogre in devouring the doctor cried stop but pen would not nature called out to him more loudly than the doctor and that kind and friendly physician handed him over with a very good grace to the other healer and here let us speak very tenderly and in the strictest confidence of an event which befell him and to which he never liked an allusion during his delirium the ruthless goodenough ordered ice to be put to his head and all his lovely hair to be cut it was done in the time ofof the other nurse who left every single hair of course in a paper for the widow to count and treasure up she never believed but that the girl had taken away some of it but then women are so suspicious upon these matters when this direful loss was made visible to major pendennis as of course it was the first time the elder saw the poor young mans shorn pate and when pen was quite out of danger and gaining daily vigor the major with something like blushes and a queer wink of his eyes said he knew of aa persona coiffeur in facta good man whom he would send down to the temple and who wouldaapplyaa temporary remedy to that misfortune laura looked at warrington with the archest sparkle in her eyes warrington fairly burst out into a boohoo of laughter even the widow was obliged to laugh and the major erubescent confounded the impudence of the young folks and said when he had his hair cut he would keep a lock of it for miss laura warrington voted that pen should wear a barristers wig there was sibwrights down below which would become him hugely pen said stuff and seemed as confused as his uncle and the end was that a gentleman from burlington arcade waited next day upon mr pendennis and had a private interview with him in his bedroom and a week afterward the same individual appeared with a box under his arm and an ineffable grin of politeness on his face and announced that he had brought ome mr pendenniss ead of air it must have been a grand but melancholy sight to see pen in the recesses of his apartment sadly contemplating his ravaged beauty and the artificial means of hiding its ruin he appeared at length in the ead of air but warrington laughed so that pen grew sulky and went back for his velvet cap a neat turban which the fondest of mammas had worked for him then mr warrington and miss bell got some flowers off the ladies bonnets and made a wreath with which they decorated the wig and brought it out in procession and did homage before it in fact they indulged in a hundred sports jocularities waggeries and petits jeux innocens so that the second and third floors of number lambcourt temple rang with more cheerfulness and laughter than had been known in those precincts for many a long day illustration at last after about ten days of this life one evening when the little spy of the court came out to take her usual post of observation at the lamp there was no music from the second floor window there were no lights in the third story chambers the windows of each were open and the occupants were gone mrs flanagan the laundress told fanny what had happened the ladies and all the party had gone to richmond for change of air the antique traveling chariot was brought out again and cushioned with many pillows for pen and his mother and miss laura went in the most affable manner in the omnibus under the guardianship of mr george warrington he came back and took possession of his old bed that night in the vacant and cheerless chambers and to his old books and his old pipes but not perhaps to his old sleep the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odor they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place he had had the happiest days of his whole life george felthe knew it now they were just gone he went and took up the flowers and put his face to them smelt themperhaps kissed them as he put them down he rubbed his rough hand across his eyes with a bitter word and laugh he would have given his whole life and soul to win that prize which arthur rejected did she want fame he would have won it for her devotiona great heart full of pentup tenderness and manly love and gentleness was there for her if she might take it but it might not be fate had ruled otherwise even if i could she would not have me george thought what has an ugly rough old fellow like me to make any woman like him im getting old and ive made no mark in life ive neither good looks nor youth nor money nor reputation a man must be able to do something besides stare at her and offer on his knees his uncouth devotion to make a woman like him what can i do lots of young fellows have passed me in the racewhat they call the prizes of life didnt seem to me worth the trouble of the struggle but for her if she had been mine and liked a diamondah shouldnt she have worn it psha what a fool i am to brag of what i would have done we are the slaves of destiny our lots are shaped for us and mine is ordained long ago come let us have a pipe and put the smell of these flowers out of court poor little silent flowers youll be dead tomorrow what business had you to show your red cheeks in this dingy place by his bedside george found a new bible which the widow had placed there with a note inside saying that she had not seen the book among his collection in a room where she had spent a number of hours and where god had vouchsafed to her prayers the life of her son and that she gave to arthurs friend the best thing she could and besought him to read in the volume sometimes and to keep it as a token of a grateful mothers regard and affection poor george mournfully kissed the book as he had done the flowers and the morning found him still reading in its awful pages in which so many stricken hearts in which so many tender and faithful souls have found comfort under calamity and refuge and hope in affliction chapter xvi fannys occupations gone illustration good helen ever since her sons illness had taken as we have seen entire possession of the young man of his drawers and closets and all which they contained whether shirts that wanted buttons or stockings that required mending or must it be owned letters that lay among those articles of raiment and which of course it was necessary that somebody should answer during arthurs weakened and incapable condition perhaps mrs pendennis was laudably desirous to have some explanations about the dreadful fanny bolton mystery regarding which she had never breathed a word to her son though it was present in her mind always and occasioned her inexpressible anxiety and disquiet she had caused the brass knocker to be screwed off the inner door of the chambers whereupon the postmans startling double rap would as she justly argued disturb the rest of her patient and she did not allow him to see any letter which arrived whether from bootmakers who importuned him or hatters who had a heavy account to make up against next saturday and would be very much obliged if mr arthur pendennis would have the kindness to settle c of these documents pen who was always freehanded and careless of course had his share and though no great one one quite enough to alarm his scrupulous and conscientious mother she had some savings pens magnificent selfdenial and her own economy amounting from her great simplicity and avoidance of show to parsimony almost had enabled her to put by a little sum of money a part of which she delightedly consecrated to the paying off the young gentlemans obligations at this price many a worthy youth and respected reader would hand over his correspondence to his parents and perhaps there is no greater test of a mans regularity and easiness of conscience than his readiness to face the postman blessed is he who is made happy by the sound of the rattat the good are eager for it but the naughty tremble at the sound thereof so it was very kind of mrs pendennis doubly to spare pen the trouble of hearing or answering letters during his illness there could have been nothing in the young mans chests of drawers and wardrobes which could be considered as inculpating him in any way nor any satisfactory documents regarding the fanny bolton affair found there for the widow had to ask her brotherinlaw if he knew any thing about the odious transaction and the dreadful intrigue about which her son was engaged when they were at richmond one day and pen with warrington had taken a seat on a bench on the terrace the widow kept major pendennis in consultation and laid her terrors and perplexities before him such of them at least for as is the wont of men and women she did not make quite a clean confession and i suppose no spendthrift asked for a schedule of his debts no lady of fashion asked by her husband for her dressmakers bills ever sent in the whole of them yetsuch we say of her perplexities at least as she chose to confide to her director for the time being when then she asked the major what course she ought to pursue about this dreadfulthis horrid affair and whether he knew any thing regarding it the old gentleman puckered up his face so that you could not tell whether he was smiling or not gave the widow one queer look with his little eyes cast them down to the carpet again and said my dear good creature i dont know any thing about it and i dont wish to know any thing about it and as you ask me my opinion i think you had best know nothing about it too young men will be young men and begad my good maam if you think our boy is a jo pray spare me this helen broke in looking very stately my dear creature i did not commence the conversation permit me to say the major said bowing very blandly i cant bear to hear such a sinsuch a dreadful sinspoken of in such a way the widow said with tears of annoyance starting from her eyes i cant bear to think that my boy should commit such a crime i wish he had died almost before he had done it i dont know how i survive it myself for it is breaking my heart major pendennis to think that his fathers sonmy childwhom i remember so goodoh so good and full of honorshould be fallen so dreadfully low as toas to as to flirt with a little grisette my dear creature said the major egad if all the mothers in england were to break their hearts becausenay nay upon my word and honor now dont agitate yourselfdont cry i cant bear to see a womans tearsi never couldnever but how do we know that any thing serious has happened has arthur said any thing his silence confirms it sobbed mrs pendennis behind her pockethandkerchief not at all there are subjects my dear about which a young fellow can not surely talk to his mamma insinuated the brotherinlaw she has written to him cried the lady behind the cambric what before he was ill nothing more likely no since the mourner with the batiste mask gasped out not before that is i dont think sothat is i only since and you haveyes i understand i suppose when he was too ill to read his own correspondence you took charge of it did you i am the most unhappy mother in the world cried out the unfortunate helen the most unhappy mother in the world because your son is a man and not a hermit have a care my dear sister if you have suppressed any letters to him you may have done yourself a great injury and if i know any thing of arthurs spirit may cause a difference between him and you which youll rue all your lifea difference thats a devlish deal more important my good madam than the littlelittle trumpery cause which originated it there was only one letter broke out helenonly a very little oneonly a few words here it isohow can you how can you speak so when the good soul said only a very little one the major could not speak at all so inclined was he to laugh in spite of the agonies of the poor soul before him and for whom he had a hearty pity and liking too but each was looking at the matter with his or her peculiar eyes and view of morals and the majors morals as the reader knows were not those of an ascetic i recommend you he gravely continued if you can to seal it up those letters aint unfrequently sealed with wafersand to put it among pens other letters and let him have them when he calls for them or if we cant seal it we mistook it for a bill i cant tell my son a lie said the widow it had been put silently into the letterbox two days previous to their departure from the temple and had been brought to mrs pendennis by martha she had never seen fannys handwriting of course but when the letter was put into her hands she knew the author at once she had been on the watch for that letter every day since pen had been ill she had opened some of his other letters because she wanted to get at that one she had the horrid paper poisoning her bag at that moment she took it out and offered it to her brotherinlaw arthur pendennis esq he read in a timid little sprawling handwriting and with a sneer on his face no my dear i wont read any more but you who have read it may tell me what the letter containsonly prayers for his health in bad spelling you sayand a desire to see him welltheres no harm in that and as you ask mehere the major began to look a little queer for his own part and put on his demure lookas you ask me my dear for information why i dont mind telling you thatahthatmorgan my man has made some inquiries regarding this affair and thatmy friend doctor goodenough also looked into itand it appears that this person was greatly smitten with arthur that he paid for her and took her to vauxhall gardens as morgan heard from an old acquaintance of pens and ours an irish gentleman who was very nearly once having the honor of being thefrom an irishman in factthat the girls father a violent man of intoxicated habits has beaten her mother who persists in declaring her daughters entire innocence to her husband on the one hand while on the other she told goodenough that arthur had acted like a brute to her child and so you see the story remains in a mystery will you have it cleared up i have but to ask pen and he will tell me at oncehe is as honorable a man as ever lived honorable said the widow with bitter scorn o brother what is this you call honor if my boy has been guilty he must marry her i would go down on my knees and pray him to do so good god are you mad screamed out the major and remembering former passages in arthurs history and helens the truth came across his mind that were helen to make this prayer to her son he would marry the girl he was wild enough and obstinate enough to commit any folly when a woman he loved was in the case my dear sister have you lost your senses he continued after an agitated pause during which the above dreary reflection crossed him and in a softened tone what right have we to suppose that any thing has passed between this girl and him lets see the letter her heart is breaking pray pray write to mehome unhappyunkind fatheryour nursepoor little fannyspelt as you say in a manner to outrage all sense of decorum but good heavens my dear what is there in this only that the little devil is making love to him still why she didnt come into his chambers until he was so delirious that he didnt know her whatdyoucallem flanagan the laundress told morgan my man so she came in company of an old fellow an old mr bows who came most kindly down to stillbrook and brought me awayby the way i left him in the cab and never paid the fare and devlish kind it was of him no theres nothing in the story do you think so thank heaventhank god helen cried ill take the letter to arthur and ask him now look at him there hes on the terrace with mr warrington they are talking to some children my boy was always fond of children hes innocent thank godthank god let me go to him old pendennis had his own opinion when he briskly took the not guilty side of the case but a moment before very likely the old gentleman had a different view from that which he chose to advocate and judged of arthur by what he himself would have done if she goes to arthur and he speaks the truth as the rascal will it spoils all he thought and he tried one more effort my dear good soul he said taking helens hand and kissing it as your son has not acquainted you with this affair think if you have any right to examine it as you believe him to be a man of honor what right have you to doubt his honor in this instance who is his accuser an anonymous scoundrel who has brought no specific charge against him if there were any such wouldnt the girls parents have come forward he is not called upon to rebut nor you to entertain an anonymous accusation and as for believing him guilty because a girl of that rank happened to be in his rooms acting as nurse to him begad you might as well insist upon his marrying that demd old irish gindrinking laundress mrs flanagan the widow burst out laughing through her tearsthe victory was gained by the old general marry mrs flanagan by ged he continued tapping her slender hand no the boy has told you nothing about it and you know nothing about it the boy is innocentof course and

well he will be at her again he must come home we must go directly to fairoaks the widow cried out my good creature hell bore himself to death at fairoaks hell have nothing to do but to think about his passion there theres no place in the world for making a little passion into a big one and where a fellow feeds on his own thoughts like a demd lonely countryhouse where theres nothing to do we must occupy him amuse him we must take him abroad hes never been abroad except to paris for a lark we must travel a little he must have a nurse with him to take great care of him for goodenough says he had a devlish narrow squeak of it dont look frightened and so you must come and watch and i suppose youll take miss bell and i should like to ask warrington to come arthurs devlish fond of warrington he cant do without warrington warringtons family is one of the oldest in england and he is one of the best young fellows i ever met in my life i like him exceedingly does mr warrington know any thing about thisthis affair asked helen he had been away i know for two months before it happened pen wrote me so not a wordiive asked him about it ive pumped him he never heard of the transaction never i pledge you my word cried out the major in some alarm and my dear i think you had much best not talk to him about itmuch best notof course not the subject is most delicate and painful the simple widow took her brothers hand and pressed it thank you brother she said you have been very very kind to me you have given me a great deal of comfort ill go to my room and think of what you have said this illness and thesetheseemotionshave agitated me a great deal and im not very strong you know but ill go and thank god that my boy is innocent he is innocent isnt he sir yes my dearest creature yes said the old fellow kissing her affectionately and quite overcome by her tenderness he looked after her as she retreated with a fondness which was rendered more piquant as it were by the mixture of a certain scorn which accompanied it innocent he said id swear till i was black in the face he was innocent rather than give that good soul pain having achieved this victory the fatigued and happy warrior laid himself down on the sofa and put his yellow silk pockethandkerchief over his face and indulged in a snug little nap of which the dreams no doubt were very pleasant as he snored with refreshing regularity the young men sate meanwhile dawdling away the sunshiny hours on the terrace very happy and pen at least very talkative he was narrating to warrington a plan for a new novel and a new tragedy warrington laughed at the idea of his writing a tragedy by jove he would show that he could and he began to spout some of the lines of his play the little solo on the wind instrument which the major was performing was interrupted by the entrance of miss bell she had been on a visit to her old friend lady rockminster who had taken a summer villa in the neighborhood and who hearing of arthurs illness and his mothers arrival at richmond had visited the latter and for the benefit of the former whom she didnt like had been prodigal of grapes partridges and other attentions for laura the old lady had a great fondness and longed that she should come and stay with her but laura could not leave her mother at this juncture worn out by constant watching over arthurs health helens own had suffered very considerably and doctor goodenough had had reason to prescribe for her as well as for his younger patient old pendennis started up on the entrance of the young lady his slumbers were easily broken he made her a gallant speechhe had been full of gallantry toward her of late where had she been gathering those roses which she wore on her cheeks how happy he was to be disturbed out of his dreams by such a charming reality laura had plenty of humor and honesty and these two caused her to have on her side something very like a contempt for the old gentleman it delighted her to draw out his worldlinesses and to make the old habitue of clubs and drawingrooms tell his twaddling tales about great folks and expound his views of morals not in this instance however was she disposed to be satirical she had been to drive with lady rockminster in the park she said and she had brought home game for pen and flowers for mamma she looked very grave about mamma she had just been with mrs pendennis helen was very much worn and she feared she was very very ill her large eyes filled with tender marks of the sympathy which she felt in her beloved friends condition she was alarmed about her could not that goodthat dear dr goodenough cure her arthurs illness and other mental anxiety the major slowly said had no doubt shaken helen a burning blush upon the girls face showed that she understood the old mans allusions but she looked him full in the face and made no reply he might have spared me that she thought what is he aiming at in recalling that shame to me that he had an aim in view is very possible the old diplomatist seldom spoke without some such end dr goodenough had talked to him he said about their dear friends health and she wanted rest and change of sceneyes change of scene painful circumstances which had occurred must be forgotten and never alluded to he begged pardon for even hinting at them to miss bellhe never should do so againnor he was sure would she every thing must be done to soothe and comfort their friend and his proposal was that they should go abroad for the autumn to a wateringplace in the rhine neighborhood where helen might rally her exhausted spirits and arthur try and become a new man of course laura would not forsake her mother of course not it was about helen and helen onlythat is about arthur too for her sake that laura was anxious she would go abroad or any where with helen and helen having thought the matter over for an hour in her room had by that time grown to be as anxious for the tour as any schoolboy who has been reading a book of voyages is eager to go to sea whither should they go the farther the betterto some place so remote that even recollection could not follow them thither so delightful that pen should never want to leave itany where so that he could be happy she opened her desk with trembling fingers and took out her bankers book and counted up her little savings if more was wanted she had the diamond cross she would borrow from laura again let us golet us go she thought directly he can bear the journey let us go away come kind doctor goodenoughcome quick and give us leave to quit england the good doctor drove over to dine with them that very day if you agitate yourself so he said to her and if your heart beats so and if you persist in being so anxious about a young gentleman who is getting well as fast as he can we shall have you laid up and miss laura to watch you and then it will be her turn to be ill and i should like to know how the deuce a doctor is to live who is obliged to come and attend you all for nothing mrs goodenough is already jealous of you and says with perfect justice that i fall in love with my patients and you must please to get out of the country as soon as ever you can that i may have a little peace in my family when the plan of going abroad was proposed to arthur it was received by that gentleman with the greatest alacrity and enthusiasm he longed to be off at once he let his mustaches grow from that very moment in order i suppose that he might get his mouth into training for a perfect french and german pronunciation and he was seriously disquieted in his mind because the mustaches when they came were of a decidedly red color he had looked forward to an autumn at fairoaks and perhaps the idea of passing two or three months there did not amuse the young man there is not a soul to speak to in the place he said to warrington i cant stand old portmans sermons and pompous afterdinner conversation i know all old glanderss stories about the peninsular war the claverings are the only christian people in the neighborhood and they are not to be at home before christmas my uncle says besides warrington i want to get out of the country while you were away confound it i had a temptation from which i am very thankful to have escaped and which i count that even my illness came very luckily to put an end to and here he narrated to his friend the circumstances of the vauxhall affair with which the reader is already acquainted warrington looked very grave when he heard this story putting the moral delinquency out of the question he was extremely glad for arthurs sake that the latter had escaped from a danger which might have made his whole life wretched which certainly said warrington would have occasioned the wretchedness and ruin of the other party and your motherand your friendswhat a pain it would have been to them urged pens companion little knowing what grief and annoyance these good people had already suffered not a word to my mother pen cried out in a state of great alarm she would never get over it an esclandre of that sort would kill her i do believe and he added with a knowing air and as if like a young rascal of a lovelace he had been engaged in what are called affairs de coeur all his life the best way when a danger of that sort menaces is not to face it but to turn ones back on it and run and were you very much smitten warrington asked hm said lovelace she dropped her hs but she was a dear little girl o clarissas of this life o you poor little ignorant vain foolish maidens if you did but know the way in which the lovelaces speak of you if you could but hear jack talking to tom across the coffeeroom of a club or see ned taking your poor little letters out of his cigarcase and handing them over to charley and billy and harry across the messroom table you would not be so eager to write or so ready to listen theres a sort of crime which is not complete unless the lucky rogue boasts of it afterward and the man who betrays your honor in the first place is pretty sure remember that to betray your secret too its hard to fight and its easy to fall warrington said gloomily and as you say pendennis when a danger like this is imminent the best way is to turn your back on it and run after this little discourse upon a subject about which pen would have talked a great deal more eloquently a month back the conversation reverted to the plans for going abroad and arthur eagerly pressed his friend to be of the party warrington was a part of the familya part of the cure arthur said he should not have half the pleasure without warrington but george said no he couldnt go he must stop at home and take pens place the other remarked that that was needless for shandon was now come back to london and arthur was entitled to a holiday dont press me warrington said i cant go ive particular engagements im best at home ive not got the money to travel thats the long and short of it for traveling costs money you know this little obstacle seemed fatal to pen he mentioned it to his mother mrs pendennis was very sorry mr warrington had been exceedingly kind but she supposed he knew best about his affairs and then no doubt she reproached herself for selfishness in wishing to carry the boy off and have him to herself altogether what is this i hear from pen my dear mr warrington the major asked one day when the pair were alone and after warringtons objection had been stated to him not go with us we cant hear of such a thingpen wont get well without you i promise you im not going to be his nurse he must have somebody with him thats stronger and gayer and better able to amuse him than a rheumatic old fogy like me i shall go to carlsbad very likely when ive seen you people settle down traveling costs nothing nowadaysor so little andand pray warrington remember that i was your fathers very old friend and if you and your brother are not on such terms as to enable you toto anticipate you younger brothers allowance i beg you to make me your banker for hasnt pen been getting into your debt these three weeks past during which you have been doing what he informs me is his work with such exemplary talent and genius begad still in spite of this kind offer and unheardof generosity on the part of the major george warrington refused and said he would stay at home but it was with a faltering voice and an irresolute accent which showed how much he would like to go though his tongue persisted in saying nay but the majors persevering benevolence was not to be balked in this way at the teatable that evening helen happening to be absent from the room for the moment looking for pen who had gone to roost old pendennis returned to the charge and rated warrington for refusing to join in their excursion isnt it ungallant miss bell he said turning to that young lady isnt it unfriendly here we have been the happiest party in the world and this odious selfish creature breaks it up miss bells long eyelashes looked down toward her teacup and warrington blushed hugely but did not speak neither did miss bell speak but when he blushed she blushed too you ask him to come my dear said the benevolent old gentleman and then perhaps he will listen to you why should mr warrington listen to me asked the young lady putting her query to her teaspoon seemingly and not to the major ask him you have not asked him said pens artless uncle i should be very glad indeed if mr warrington would come remarked laura to the teaspoon would you said george she looked up and said yes their eyes met i will go any where you ask me or do any thing said george lowly and forcing out the words as if they gave him pain old pendennis was delighted the affectionate old creature clapped his hands and cried bravo bravo its a bargaina bargain begad shake hands on it young people and laura with a look full of tender brightness put out her hand to warrington he took hers his face indicated a strange agitation he seemed to be about to speak when from pens neighboring room helen entered looking at them as the candle which she held lighted her pale frightened face laura blushed more red than ever and withdrew her hand what is it helen asked its a bargain we have been making my dear creature said the major in his most caressing voice we have just bound over mr warrington in a promise to come abroad with us indeed helen said chapter xvii in which fanny engages a new medical man illustration could helen have suspected that with pens returning strength his unhappy partiality for little fanny would also reawaken though she never spoke a word regarding that young person after her conversation with the major and though to all appearance she utterly ignored fannys existence yet mrs pendennis kept a particularly close watch upon all master arthurs actions on the plea of illhealth would scarcely let him out of her sight and was especially anxious that he should be spared the trouble of all correspondence for the present at least very likely arthur looked at his own letters with some tremor very likely as he received them at the family table feeling his mothers watch upon him though the good souls eye seemed fixed upon her teacup or her book he expected daily to see a little handwriting which he would have known though he had never seen it yet and his heart beat as he received the letters to his address was he more pleased or annoyed that day after day his expectations were not realized and was his mind relieved that there came no letter from fanny though no doubt in these matters when lovelace is tired of clarissa or the contrary it is best for both parties to break at once and each after the failure of the attempt at union to go his own way and pursue his course through life solitary yet our selflove or our pity or our sense of decency does not like that sudden bankruptcy before we announce to the world that our firm of lovelace and co cant meet its engagements we try to make compromises we have mournful meetings of partners we delay the putting up of the shutters and the dreary announcement of the failure it must come but we pawn our jewels to keep things going a little longer on the whole i dare say pen was rather annoyed that he had no remonstrances from fanny what could she part from him and never so much as once look round could she sink and never once hold a little hand out or cry help arthur well well they dont all go down who venture on that voyage some few drown when the vessel founders but most are only ducked and scramble to shore and the readers experience of a pendennis esquire of the upper temple will enable him to state whether that gentleman belonged to the class of persons who were likely to sink or to swim though pen was as yet too weak to walk half a mile and might not on account of his precious health be trusted to take a drive in a carriage by himself and without a nurse in attendance yet helen could not keep watch over mr warrington too and had no authority to prevent that gentleman from going to london if business called him thither indeed if he had gone and staid perhaps the widow from reasons of her own would have been glad but she checked these selfish wishes as soon as she ascertained or owned them and remembering warringtons great regard and services and constant friendship for her boy received him as a member of her family almost with her usual melancholy kindness and submissive acquiescence yet somehow one morning when his affairs called him to town she divined what warringtons errand was and that he was gone to london to get news about fanny for pen indeed arthur had had some talk with his friend and told him more at large what his adventures had been with fanny adventures which the reader knows already and what were his feelings respecting her he was very thankful that he had escaped the great danger to which warrington said amen heartily that he had no great fault wherewith to reproach himself in regard of his behavior to her but that if they parted as they must he would be glad to say a god bless her and to hope that she would remember him kindly in his discourse with warrington he spoke upon these matters with so much gravity and so much emotion that george who had pronounced himself most strongly for the separation too began to fear that his friend was not so well cured as he boasted of being and that if the two were to come together again all the danger and the temptation might have to be fought once more and with what result it is hard to struggle arthur and it is easy to fall warrington said and the best courage for us poor wretches is to fly from danger i would not have been what i am now had i practiced what i preach and what did you practice george pen asked eagerly i knew there was something tell us about it warrington there was something that cant be mended and that shattered my whole fortunes early warrington answered i said i would tell you about it some day pen and will but not now take the moral without the fable now pen my boy and if you want to see a man whose whole life has been wrecked by an unlucky rock against which he struck as a boyhere he is arthur and so i warn you we have shown how mr huxter in writing home to his clavering friends mentioned that there was a fashionable club in london of which he was an attendant and that he was there in the habit of meeting an irish officer of distinction who among other news had given that intelligence regarding pendennis which the young surgeon had transmitted to clavering this club was no other than the back kitchen where the disciple of saint bartholomew was accustomed to meet the general the peculiarities of whose brogue appearance disposition and general conversation greatly diverted many young gentlemen who used the back kitchen as a place of nightly entertainment and refreshment huxter who had a fine natural genius for mimicking every thing whether it was a favorite tragic or comic actor a cock on a dunghill a corkscrew going into a bottle and a cork issuing thence or an irish officer of genteel connections who offered himself as an object of imitation with only too much readiness talked his talk and twanged his poor old long bow whenever drink a hearer and an opportunity occurred studied our friend the general with peculiar gusto and drew the honest fellow out many a night a bait consisting of sixpennyworth of brandy and water the worthy old man was sure to swallow and under the influence of this liquor who was more happy than he to tell his stories of his daughters triumphs and his own in love war drink and polite society thus huxter was enabled to present to his friends many pictures of costigan of costigan fighting a jewel in the phaynixof costigan and his interview with the juke of yorkof costigan at his sonunlaws teeble surrounded by the nobilitee of his countreeof costigan when crying drunk at which time he was in the habit of confidentially lamenting his daughters ingratichewd and stating that his gray hairs were hastening to a praymachure greeve and thus our friend was the means of bringing a number of young fellows to the back kitchen who consumed the landlords liquors while they relished the generals peculiarities so that mine host pardoned many of the latters foibles in consideration of the good which they brought to his house not the highest position in life was this certainly or one which if we had a reverence for an old man we would be anxious that he should occupy but of this aged buffoon it may be mentioned that he had no particular idea that his condition of life was not a high one and that in his whiskied blood there was not a black drop nor in his muddled brains a bitter feeling against any mortal being even his child his cruel emily he would have taken to his heart and forgiven with tears and what more can one say of the christian charity of a man than that he is actually ready to forgive those who have done him every kindness and with whom he is wrong in a dispute there was some idea among the young men who frequented the back kitchen and made themselves merry with the society of captain costigan that the captain made a mystery regarding his lodgings for fear of duns or from a desire of privacy and lived in some wonderful place nor would the landlord of the premises when questioned upon this subject answer any inquiries his maxim being that he only knew gentlemen who frequented that room in that room that when they quitted that room having paid their scores as gentlemen and behaved as gentlemen his communication with them ceased and that as a gentleman himself he thought it was only impertinent curiosity to ask where any other gentleman lived costigan in his most intoxicated and confidential moments also evaded any replies to questions or hints addressed to him on this subject there was no particular secret about it as we have seen who have had more than once the honor of entering his apartments but in the vicissitudes of a long life he had been pretty often in the habit of residing in houses where privacy was necessary to his comfort and where the appearance of some visitors would have brought him any thing but pleasure hence all sorts of legends were formed by wags or credulous persons respecting his place of abode it was stated that he slept habitually in a watchbox in the city in a cab at a mews where a cab proprietor gave him a shelter in the duke of yorks column c the wildest of these theories being put abroad by the facetious and imaginative huxter for huxey when not silenced by the company of swells and when in the society of his own friends was a very different fellow to the youth whom we have seen cowed by pens impertinent airs and adored by his family at home was the life and soul of the circle whom he met either round the festive board or the dissecting table on one brilliant september morning as huxter was regaling himself with a cup of coffee at a stall in covent garden having spent a delicious night dancing at vauxhall he spied the general reeling down henriettastreet with a crowd of hooting blackguard boys at his heels who had left their beds under the arches of the river betimes and were prowling about already for breakfast and the strange livelihood of the day the poor old general was not in that condition when the sneers and jokes of these young beggars had much effect upon him the cabmen and watermen at the cabstand knew him and passed their comments upon him the policemen gazed after him and warned the boys off him with looks of scorn and pity what did the scorn and pity of men the jokes of ribald children matter to the general he reeled along the street with glazed eyes having just sense enough to know whither he was bound and to pursue his accustomed beat homeward he went to bed not knowing how he had reached it as often as any man in london he woke and found himself there and asked no questions and he was tacking about on this daily though perilous voyage when from his station at the coffeestall huxter spied him to note his friend to pay his twopence indeed he had but eightpence left or he would have had a cab from vauxhall to take him home was with the eager huxter the work of an instantcostigan dived down the alleys by drurylane theater where ginshops oystershops and theatrical wardrobes abound the proprietors of which were now asleep behind the shutters as the pink morning lighted up their chimneys and through these courts huxter followed the general until he reached oldcastlestreet in which is the gate of shepherds inn here just as he was within sight of home a luckless slice of orangepeel came between the generals heel and the pavement and caused the poor fellow to fall backward illustration huxter ran up to him instantly and after a pause during which the veteran giddy with his fall and his previous whisky gathered as he best might his dizzy brains together the young surgeon lifted up the limping general and very kindly and goodnaturedly offered to conduct him to his home for some time and in reply to the queries which the student of medicine put to him the muzzy general refused to say where his lodgings were and declared that they were hard by and that he could reach them without difficulty and he disengaged himself from huxters arm and made a rush as if to get to his own home unattended but he reeled and lurched so that the young surgeon insisted upon accompanying him and with many soothing expressions and cheering and consolatory phrases succeeded in getting the generals dirty old hand under what he called his own fin and led the old fellow moaning piteously across the street he stopped when he came to the ancient gate ornamented with the armorial bearings of the venerable shepherd here tis said he drawing up at the portal and he made a successful pull at the gatebell which presently brought out old mr bolton the porter scowling fiercely and grumbling as he was used to do every morning when it became his turn to let in that early bird costigan tried to hold bolton for a moment in genteel conversation but the other surlily would not dont bother me he said go to your hown bed capting and dont keep honest men out of theirs so the captain tacked across the square and reached his own staircase up which he stumbled with the worthy huxter at his heels costigan had a key of his own which huxter inserted into the keyhole for him so that there was no need to call up little mr bows from the sleep into which the old musician had not long since fallen and huxter having aided to disrobe his tipsy patient and ascertained that no bones were broken helped him to bed and applied compresses and water to one of his knees and shins which with the pair of trowsers which encased them costigan had severely torn in his fall at the generals age and with his habit of body such wounds as he had inflicted on himself are slow to heal a good deal of inflammation ensued and the old fellow lay ill for some days suffering both pain and fever mr huxter undertook the case of his interesting patient with great confidence and alacrity and conducted it with becoming skill he visited his friend day after day and consoled him with lively rattle and conversation for the absence of the society which costigan needed and of which he was an ornament and he gave special instructions to the invalids nurse about the quantity of whisky which the patient was to takeinstructions which as the poor old fellow could not for many days get out of his bed or sofa himself he could not by any means infringe bows mrs bolton and our little friend fanny when able to do so officiated at the generals bedside and the old warrior was made as comfortable as possible under his calamity thus huxter whose affable manners and social turn made him quickly intimate with persons in whose society he fell and whose overrefinement did not lead them to repulse the familiarities of this young gentleman became pretty soon intimate in shepherds inn both with our acquaintances in the garrets and those in the porters lodge he thought he had seen fanny somewhere he felt certain that he had but it is no wonder that he should not accurately remember her for the poor little thing never chose to tell him where she had met him he himself had seen her at a period when his own views both of persons and of right and wrong were clouded by the excitement of drinking and dancing and also little fanny was very much changed and worn by the fever and agitation and passion and despair which the past three weeks had poured upon the head of that little victim borne down was the head now and very pale and wan the face and many and many a time the sad eyes had looked into the postmans as he came to the inn and the sickened heart had sunk as he passed away when mr costigans accident occurred fanny was rather glad to have an opportunity of being useful and doing something kindsomething that would make her forget her own little sorrows perhaps she felt she bore them better while she did her duty though i dare say many a tear dropped into the old irishmans gruel ah me stir the gruel well and have courage little fanny if every body who has suffered from your complaint were to die of it straightway what a fine year the undertakers would have whether from compassion for his only patient or delight in his society mr huxter found now occasion to visit costigan two or three times in the day at least and if any of the members of the porters lodge family were not in attendance on the general the young doctor was sure to have some particular directions to address to those at their own place of habitation he was a kind fellow he made or purchased toys for the children he brought them apples and brandy balls he brought a mask and frightened them with it and caused a smile upon the face of pale fanny he called mrs bolton mrs b and was very intimate familiar and facetious with that lady quite different from that aughty artless beast as mrs bolton now denominated a certain young gentleman of our acquaintance and whom she now vowed she never could abear it was from this lady who was very free in her conversation that huxter presently learned what was the illness which was evidently preying upon little fan and what had been pens behavior regarding her mrs boltons account of the transaction was not it may be imagined entirely an impartial narrative one would have thought from her story that the young gentleman had employed a course of the most persevering and flagitious artifices to win the girls heart had broken the most solemn promises made to her and was a wretch to be hated and chastised by every champion of woman huxter in his present frame of mind respecting arthur and suffering under the latters contumely was ready of course to take all for granted that was said in the disfavor of this unfortunate convalescent but why did he not write home to clavering as he had done previously giving an account of pens misconduct and of the particulars regarding it which had now come to his knowledge he once in a letter to his brotherinlaw announced that that nice young man mr pendennis had escaped narrowly from a fever and that no doubt all clavering where he was so popular would be pleased at his recovery and he mentioned that he had an interesting case of compound fracture an officer of distinction which kept him in town but as for fanny bolton he made no more mention of her in his lettersno more than pen himself had made mention of her o you mothers at home how much do you think you know about your lads how much do you think you know but with bows there was no reason why huxter should not speak his mind and so a very short time after his conversation with mrs bolton mr sam talked to the musician about his early acquaintance with pendennis described him as a confounded conceited blackguard and expressed a determination to punch his impudent head as soon as ever he should be well enough to stand up like a man then it was that bows on his part spoke and told his version of the story whereof arthur and little fan were the hero and heroine how they had met by no contrivance of the former but by a blunder of the old irishman now in bed with a broken shinhow pen had acted with manliness and selfcontrol in the businesshow mrs bolton was an idiot and he related the conversation which he bows had had with pen and the sentiments uttered by the young man perhaps bowss story caused some twinges of conscience in the breast of pens accuser and that gentleman frankly owned that he had been wrong with regard to arthur and withdrew his project for punching mr pendenniss head but the cessation of his hostility for pen did not diminish huxters attentions to fanny which unlucky mr bows marked with his usual jealousy and bitterness of spirit i have but to like any body the old fellow thought and somebody is sure to come and be preferred to me it has been the same illluck with me since i was a lad until now that i am sixty years old what can such a man as i am expect better than to be laughed at it is for the young to succeed and to be happy and not for old fools like me ive played a second fiddle all through life he said with a bitter laugh how can i suppose the luck is to change after it has gone against me so long this was the selfish way in which bows looked at the state of affairs though few persons would have thought there was any cause for his jealousy who looked at the pale and griefstricken countenance of the hapless little girl its object fanny received huxters goodnatured efforts at consolation and kind attentions kindly she laughed now and again at his jokes and games with her little sisters but relapsed quickly into a dejection which ought to have satisfied mr bows that the newcomer had no place in her heart as yet had jealous mr bows been enabled to see with clear eyes but bows did not fanny attributed pens silence somehow to bowss interference fanny hated him fanny treated bows with constant cruelty and injustice she turned from him when he spokeshe loathed his attempts at consolation a hard life had mr bows and a cruel return for his regard when warrington came to shepherds inn as pens embassador it was for mr bowss apartments he inquired no doubt upon a previous agreement with the principal for whom he acted in this delicate negotiation and he did not so much as catch a glimpse of miss fanny when he stopped at the inngate and made his inquiry warrington was of course directed to the musicians chambers and found him tending the patient there from whose chamber he came out to wait upon his guest we have said that they had been previously known to one another and the pair shook hands with sufficient cordiality after a little preliminary talk warrington said that he had come from his friend arthur pendennis and from his family to thank bows for his attention at the commencement of pens illness and for his kindness in hastening into the country to fetch the major bows replied that it was but his duty he had never thought to have seen the young gentleman alive again when he went in search of pens relatives and he was very glad of mr pendenniss recovery and that he had his friends with him lucky are they who have friends mr warrington said the musician i might be up in this garret and nobody would care for me or mind whether i was alive or dead what not the general mr bows warrington asked the general likes his whiskybottle more than any thing in life the other answered we live together from habit and convenience and he cares for me no more than you do what is it you want to ask me mr warrington you aint come to visit me i know very well nobody comes to visit me it is about fanny the porters daughter you are comei see that very well is mr pendennis now he has got well anxious to see her again does his lordship the sultan propose to throw his andkerchief to her she has been very ill sir ever since the day when mrs pendennis turned her out of doorskind of a lady wasnt it the poor girl and myself found the young gentleman raving in a fever knowing nobody with nobody to tend him but his drunken laundressshe watched day and night by him i set off to fetch his uncle mamma comes and turns fanny to the right about uncle comes and leaves me to pay the cab carry my compliments to the ladies and gentleman and say we are both very thankful very why a countess couldnt have behaved better and for an apothecarys lady as im given to understand mrs pendennis wasim sure her behavior is most uncommon aristocratic and genteel she ought to have a double gilt pestle and mortar to her coach it was from mr huxter that bows had learned pens parentage no doubt and if he took pens part against the young surgeon and fannys against mr pendennis it was because the old gentleman was in so savage a mood that his humor was to contradict every body warrington was curious and not ill pleased at the musicians taunts and irascibility i never heard of these transactions he said or got but a very imperfect account of them from major pendennis what was a lady to do i think i have never spoken with her on the subject she had some notion that the young woman and my friend pen were onon terms ofof an intimacy which mrs pendennis could not of course recognize oh of course not sir speak out sir say what you mean at once that the young gentleman of the temple had made a victim of the girl of shepherds inn eh and so she was to be turned out of doorsor brayed alive in the double gilt pestle and mortar by jove no mr warrington there was no such thing there was no victimizing or if there was mr arthur was the victim not the girl he is an honest fellow he is though he is conceited and a puppy sometimes he can feel like a man and run away from temptation like a man i own it though i suffer by it i own it he has a heart he has but the girl hasnt sir that girl will do any thing to win a man and fling him away without a pang sir if she flung away herself sir shell feel it and cry she had a fever when mrs pendennis turned her out of doors and she made love to the doctor doctor goodenough who came to cure her now she has taken on with another chapanother sawbones ha ha dit sir she likes the pestle and mortar and hangs round the pill boxes shes so fond of em and she has got a fellow from saint bartholomews who grins through a horse collar for her sisters and charms away her melancholy go and see sir very likely hes in the lodge now if you want news about miss fanny you must ask at the doctors shop sir not of an old fiddler like megoodby sir theres my patient calling and a voice was heard from the captains bedroom a wellknown voice which said id loike a dthrop of dthrink bows im thirstee and not sorry perhaps to hear that such was the state of things and that pens forsaken was consoling herself warrington took his leave of the irascible musician as luck would have it he passed the lodge door just as mr huxter was in the act of frightening the children with the mask whereof we have spoken and fanny was smiling languidly at his farces warrington laughed bitterly are all women like that he thought i think theres one thats not he added with a sigh at piccadilly waiting for the richmond omnibus george fell in with major pendennis bound in the same direction and he told the old gentleman of what he had seen and heard respecting fanny major pendennis was highly delighted and as might be expected of such a philosopher made precisely the same observation as that which had escaped from warrington all women are the same he said la petite se console dayme when i used to read telemaque at school calypso ne pouvait se consoleryou know the rest warringtoni used to say it was absard absard by gad and so it is and so shes got a new soupirant has she the little porteress dayvlish nice little girl how mad pen will beeh warrington but we must break it to him gently or hell be in such a rage that he will be going after her again we must menager the young fellow i think mrs pendennis ought to know that pen acted very well in the business she evidently thinks him guilty and according to mr bows arthur behaved like a good fellow warrington said my dear warrington said the major with a look of some alarm in mrs pendenniss agitated state of health and that sort of thing the best way i think is not to say a single word about the subjector stay leave it to me and ill talk to herbreak it to her gently you know and that sort of a thing i give you my word i will and so calypsos consoled is she and he sniggered over this gratifying truth happy in the corner of the omnibus during the rest of the journey pen was very anxious to hear from his envoy what had been the result of the latters mission and as soon as the two young men could be alone the embassador spoke in reply to arthurs eager queries you remember your poem pen of ariadne in naxos warrington said devilish bad poetry it was to be sure apres asked pen in a great state of excitement when theseus left ariadne do you remember what happened to her young fellow its a lie its a lie you dont mean that cried out pen starting up his face turning red sit down stoopid warrington said and with two fingers pushed pen back into his seat again its better for you as it is young one he said sadly in reply to the savage flush in arthurs face chapter xviii foreign ground illustration worth major pendennis fulfilled his promise to warrington so far as to satisfy his own conscience and in so far to ease poor helen with regard to her son as to make her understand that all connection between arthur and the odious little gatekeeper was at an end and that she need have no further anxiety with respect to an imprudent attachment or a degrading marriage on pens part and that young fellows mind was also relieved after he had recovered the shock to his vanity by thinking that miss fanny was not going to die of love for him and that no unpleasant consequences were to be apprehended from the luckless and brief connection so the whole party were free to carry into effect their projected continental trip and arthur pendennis rentier voyageant avec madame pendennis and mademoiselle bell and george warrington particulier age de ans taille pieds anglais figure ordinaire cheveux noirs barbe idem c procured passports from the consul of hm the king of the belgians at dover and passed over from that port to ostend whence the party took their way leisurely visiting bruges and ghent on their way to brussels and the rhine it is not our purpose to describe this ofttraveled tour or lauras delight at the tranquil and ancient cities which she saw for the first time or helens wonder and interest at the beguine convents which they visited or the almost terror with which she saw the blackveiled nuns with outstretched arms kneeling before the illuminated altars and beheld the strange pomps and ceremonials of the catholic worship barefooted friars in the streets crowned images of saints and virgins in the churches before which people were bowing down and worshiping in direct defiance as she held of the written law priests in gorgeous robes or lurking in dark confessionals theatres opened and people dancing on sundays all these new sights and manners shocked and bewildered the simple country lady and when the young men after their evening drive or walk returned to the widow and her adopted daughter they found their books of devotion on the table and at their entrance laura would commonly cease reading some of the psalms or the sacred pages which of all others helen loved the late events connected with her son had cruelly shaken her laura watched with intense though hidden anxiety every movement of her dearest friend and poor pen was most constant and affectionate in waiting upon his mother whose wounded bosom yearned with love toward him though there was a secret between them and an anguish or rage almost on the mothers part to think that she was dispossessed somehow of her sons heart or that there were recesses in it which she must not or dared not enter she sickened as she thought of the sacred days of boyhood when it had not been sowhen her arthurs heart had no secrets and she was his all in all when he poured his hopes and pleasures his childish griefs vanities triumphs into her willing and tender embrace when her home was his nest still and before fate selfishness nature had driven him forth on wayward wingsto range on his own flightto sing his own songand to seek his own home and his own mate watching this devouring care and racking disappointment in her friend laura once said to helen if pen had loved me as you wished i should have gained him but i should have lost you mamma i know i should and i like you to love me best men do not know what it is to love as we do i thinkand helen sighing agreed to this portion of the young ladys speech though she protested against the former part for my part i suppose miss laura was right in both statements and with regard to the latter assertion especially that it is an old and received truismlove is an hour with us it is all night and all day with a woman damon has taxes sermon parade tailors bills parliamentary duties and the deuce knows what to think of delia has to think about damondamon is the oak or the post and stands up and delia is the ivy or the honeysuckle whose arms twine about him is it not so delia is it not your nature to creep about his feet and kiss them to twine round his trunk and hang there and damons to stand like a british man with his hands in his breeches pocket while the pretty fond parasite clings round him old pendennis had only accompanied our friends to the waters edge and left them on board the boat giving the chief charge of the little expedition to warrington he himself was bound on a brief visit to the house of a great man a friend of his after which sojourn he proposed to join his sisterinlaw at the german wateringplace whither the party was bound the major himself thought that his long attentions to his sick family had earned for him a little relaxationand though the best of the partridges were thinned off the pheasants were still to be shot at stillbrook where the noble owner still was old pendennis betook himself to that hospitable mansion and disported there with great comfort to himself a royal duke some foreigners of note some illustrious statesmen and some pleasant people visited it it did the old fellows heart good to see his name in the morning post among the list of the distinguished company which the marquis of steyne was entertaining at his country house at stillbrook he was a very useful and pleasant personage in a country house he entertained the young men with queer little anecdotes and grivoises stories on their shooting parties or in their smokingroom where they laughed at him and with him he was obsequious with the ladies of a morning in the rooms dedicated to them he walked the new arrivals about the park and gardens and showed them the carte du pays and where there was the best view of the mansion and where the most favorable point to look at the lake he showed where the timber was to be felled and where the old road went before the new bridge was built and the hill cut down and where the place in the wood was where old lord lynx discovered sir phelim oneal on his knees before her ladyship c c he called the lodge keepers and gardeners by their names he knew the number of domestics that sat down in the housekeepers room and how many dined in the servants hall he had a word for every body and about every body and a little against every body he was invaluable in a country house in a word and richly merited and enjoyed his vacation after his labors and perhaps while he was thus deservedly enjoying himself with his country friends the major was not illpleased at transferring to warrington the command of the family expedition to the continent and thus perforce keeping him in the service of the ladiesa servitude which george was only too willing to undergo for his friends sake and for that of a society which he found daily more delightful warrington was a good german scholar and was willing to give miss laura lessons in the language who was very glad to improve herself though pen for his part was too weak or lazy now to resume his german studies warrington acted as courier and interpreter warrington saw the baggage in and out of ships inns and carriages managed the money matters and put the little troop into marching order warrington found out where the english church was and if mrs pendennis and miss laura were inclined to go thither walked with great decorum along with them warrington walked by mrs pendenniss donkey when that lady went out on her evening excursions or took carriages for her or got galignani for her or devised comfortable seats under the lime trees for her when the guests paraded after dinner and the kursaal band at the bath where our tired friends stopped performed their pleasant music under the trees many a fine whiskered prussian or french dandy come to the bath for the trente et quarante cast glances of longing toward the pretty freshcolored english girl who accompanied the pale widow and would have longed to take a turn with her at the galop or the waltz but laura did not appear in the ballroom except once or twice when pen vouchsafed to walk with her and as for warrington that rough diamond had not had the polish of a dancing master and he did not know how to waltzthough he would have liked to learn if he could have had such a partner as laura such a partner psha what had a stiff bachelor to do with partners and waltzing what was he about dancing attendance here drinking in sweet pleasure at a risk he knows not of what after sadness and regret and lonely longing but yet he staid on you would have said he was the widows son to watch his constant care and watchfulness of her or that he was an adventurer and wanted to marry her fortune or at any rate that he wanted some very great treasure or benefit from her and very likely he didfor ours as the reader has possibly already discovered is a selfish story and almost every person according to his nature more or less generous than george and according to the way of the world as it seems to us is occupied about number one so warrington selfishly devoted himself to helen who selfishly devoted herself to pen who selfishly devoted himself to himself at this present period having no other personage or object to occupy him except indeed his mothers health which gave him a serious and real disquiet but though they sate together they did not talk much and the cloud was always between them illustration every day laura looked for warrington and received him with more frank and eager welcome he found himself talking to her as he didnt know himself that he could talk he found himself performing acts of gallantry which astounded him after the performance he found himself looking blankly in the glass at the crowsfeet round his eyes and at some streaks of white in his hair and some intrusive silver bristles in his grim blue beard he found himself looking at the young bucks at the bathat the blond tightwaisted germansat the capering frenchmen with their lackered mustaches and trim varnished bootsat the english dandies pen among them with their calm domineering air and insolent languor and envied each one of these some excellence or quality of youth or good looks which he possessed and of which warrington felt the need and every night as the night came he quitted the little circle with greater reluctance and retiring to his own lodging in their neighborhood felt himself the more lonely and unhappy the widow could not help seeing his attachment she understood now why major pendennis always a tacit enemy of her darling project had been so eager that warrington should be of their party laura frankly owned her great her enthusiastic regard for him and arthur would make no movement arthur did not choose to see what was going on or did not care to prevent or actually encouraged it she remembered his often having said that he could not understand how a man proposed to a woman twice she was in tortureat secret feud with her son of all objects in the world the dearest to herin doubt which she dared not express to herself about lauraaverse to warrington the good and generous no wonder that the healing waters of rosenbad did not do her good or that doctor von glauber the bath physician when he came to visit her found that the poor lady made no progress to recovery meanwhile pen got well rapidly slept with immense perseverance twelve hours out of the twentyfour ate huge meals and at the end of a couple of months had almost got back the bodily strength and weight which he had possessed before his illness after they had passed some fifteen days at their place of rest and refreshment a letter came from major pendennis announcing his speedy arrival at rosenbad and soon after the letter the major himself made his appearance accompanied by morgan his faithful valet without whom the old gentleman could not move when the major traveled he wore a jaunty and juvenile traveling costume to see his back still you would have taken him for one of the young fellows whose slim waist and youthful appearance warrington was beginning to envy it was not until the worthy man began to move that the observer remarked that time had weakened his ancient knees and had unkindly interfered to impede the action of the natty little varnished boots in which the old traveler still pinched his toes there were magnates both of our own country and of foreign nations present that autumn at rosenbad the elder pendennis read over the strangers list with great gratification on the night of his arrival was pleased to find several of his acquaintances among the great folks and would have the honor of presenting his nephew to a german grand duchess a russian princess and an english marquis before many days were over nor was pen by any means averse to making the acquaintance of these great personages having a liking for polite life and all the splendors and amenities belonging to it that very evening the resolute old gentlemen leaning on his nephews arm made his appearance in the halls of the kursaal and lost or won a napoleon or two at the table of trente et quarante he did not play to lose he said or to win but he did as other folks did and betted his napoleon and took his luck as it came he pointed out the russians and spaniards gambling for heaps of gold and denounced their eagerness as something sordid and barbarous an english gentleman should play where the fashion is play but should not elate or depress himself at the sport and he told how he had seen his friend the marquis of steyne when lord gaunt lose eighteen thousand at a sitting and break the bank three nights running at paris without ever showing the least emotion at his defeat or victoryand thats what i call being an english gentleman pen my dear boy the old gentleman said warming as he prattled about his recollectionswhat i call the great manner only remains with us and with a few families in france and as russian princesses passed him whose reputation had long ceased to be doubtful and damaged english ladies who are constantly seen in company of their faithful attendant for the time being in these gay haunts of dissipation the old major with eager garrulity and mischievous relish told his nephew wonderful particulars regarding the lives of these heroines and diverted the young man with a thousand scandals egad he felt himself quite young again he remarked to pen as rouged and grinning her enormous chasseur behind her bearing her shawl the princess obstropski smiled and recognized and accosted him he remembered her in when she was an actress of the paris boulevard and the emperor alexanders aiddecamp obstropski a man of great talents who knew a good deal about the emperor pauls death and was a devil to play married her he most courteously and respectfully asked leave to call upon the princess and to present to her his nephew mr arthur pendennis and he pointed out to the latter a halfdozen of other personages whose names were as famous and whose histories were as edifying what would poor helen have thought could she have heard those tales or known to what kind of people her brotherinlaw was presenting her son only once leaning on arthurs arm she had passed through the room where the green tables were prepared for play and the croaking croupiers were calling out their fatal words of rouge gagne and couleur perd she had shrunk terrified out of the pandemonium imploring pen extorting from him a promise on his word of honor that he would never play at those tables and the scene which so frightened the simple widow only amused the worldly old veteran and made him young again he could breath the air cheerfully which stifled her her right was not his right his food was her poison human creatures are constituted thus differently and with this variety the marvelous world is peopled to the credit of mr pen let it be said that he kept honestly the promise made to his mother and stoutly told his uncle of his intention to abide by it illustration when the major arrived his presence somehow cast a damp upon at least three persons of our little partyupon laura who had any thing but respect for him upon warrington whose manner toward him showed an involuntary haughtiness and contempt and upon the timid and alarmed widow who dreaded lest he should interfere with her darling though almost desperate projects for her boy and indeed the major unknown to himself was the bearer of tidings which were to bring about a catastrophe in the affairs of all our friends pen with his two ladies had apartments in the town of rosenbad honest warrington had lodgings hard by the major on arrival at rosenbad had as befitted his dignity taken up his quarters at one of the great hotels at the roman emperor or the four seasons where two or three hundred gamblers pleasureseekers or invalids sate down and overate themselves daily at the enormous table dhote to this hotel pen went on the morning after the majors arrival dutifully to pay his respects to his uncle and found the latters sittingroom duly prepared and arranged by mr morgan with the majors hats brushed and his coats laid out his dispatchboxes and umbrellacases his guidebooks passports maps and other elaborate necessaries of the english traveler all as trim and ready as they could be in their masters own room in jermynstreet every thing was ready from the medicinebottle fresh filled from the pharmaciens down to the old fellows prayerbook without which he never traveled for he made a point of appearing at the english church at every place which he honored with a stay every body did it he said every english gentleman did it and this pious man would as soon have thought of not calling upon the english embassador in a continental town as of not showing himself at the national place of worship the old gentleman had been to take one of the baths for which rosenbad is famous and which every body takes and his afterbath toilet was not yet completed when pen arrived the elder called out to arthur in a cheery voice from the inner apartment in which he and morgan were engaged and the valet presently came in bearing a little packet to pens addressmr arthurs letters and papers morgan said which he had brought from mr arthurs chambers in london and which consisted chiefly of numbers of the pall mall gazette which our friend mr finucane thought his collaborateur would like to see the papers were tied together the letters in an envelope addressed to pen in the lastnamed gentlemans handwriting among the letters there was a little note addressed as a former letter we have heard of had been to arthur pendennis esquire which arthur opened with a start and a blush and read with a very keen pang of interest and sorrow and regard she had come to arthurs house fanny bolton saidand found that he was gonegone away to germany without ever leaving a word for heror answer to her last letter in which she prayed but for one word of kindnessor the books which he had promised her in happier times before he was ill and which she would like to keep in remembrance of him she said she would not reproach those who had found her at his bedside when he was in the fever and knew nobody and who had turned the poor girl away without a word she thought she should have died she said of that but doctor goodenough had kindly tended her and kept her life when perhaps the keeping of it was of no good and she forgave every body and as for arthur she would pray for him forever and when he was so ill and they cut off his hair she had made so free as to keep one little lock for herself and that she owned and might she still keep it or would his mamma order that that should be gave up too she was willing to obey him in all things and couldnt but remember that once he was so kind oh so good and kind to his poor fanny when major pendennis fresh and smirking from his toilet came out of his bedroom to his sittingroom he found arthur with this note before him and an expression of savage anger on his face which surprised the elder gentleman what news from london my boy he rather faintly asked are the duns at you that you look so glum do you know any thing about this letter sir arthur asked what letter my good sir said the other drily at once perceiving what had happened you know what i meanabout about missabout fanny boltonthe poor dear little girl arthur broke out when was she in my room was she there when i was deliriousi fancied she waswas she who sent her out of my chambers who intercepted her letters to me who dared to do it did you do it uncle its not my practice to tamper with gentlemens letters or to answer damned impertinent questions major pendennis cried out in a great tremor of emotion and indignation there was a girl in your rooms when i came up at great personal inconveinence daymyand to meet with a return of this kind for my affection to you is not pleasant by gad sirnot at all pleasant thats not the question sir arthur said hotlyandand i beg your pardon uncle you were you always have been most kind to me but i say again did you say any thing harsh to this poor girl did you send her away from me i never spoke a word to the girl the uncle said and i never sent her away from you and know no more about her and wish to know no more about her than about the man in the moon then its my mother that did it arthur broke out did my mother send that poor child away i repeat i know nothing about it sir the elder said testily lets change the subject if you please ill never forgive the person who did it said arthur bouncing up and seizing his hat the major cried out stop arthur for gods sake stop but before he had uttered his sentence arthur had rushed out of the room and at the next minute the major saw him striding rapidly down the street that led toward his home get breakfast said the old fellow to morgan and he wagged his head and sighed as he looked out of the window poor helenpoor soul therell be a row i knew there would and begad all the fats in the fire when pen reached home he only found warrington in the ladies drawingroom waiting their arrival in order to conduct them to the room where the little english colony at rosenbad held their sunday church helen and laura had not appeared as yet the former was ailing and her daughter was with her pens wrath was so great that he could not defer expressing it he flung fannys letter across the table to his friend look there warrington he said she tended me in my illness she rescued me out of the jaws of death and this is the way they have treated the dear little creature they have kept her letters from me they have treated me like a child and her like a dog poor thing my mother has done this if she has you must remember it is your mother warrington interposed it only makes the crime the greater because it is she who has done it pen answered she ought to have been the poor girls defender not her enemy she ought to go down on her knees and ask pardon of her i ought i will i am shocked at the cruelty which has been shown her what she gave me her all and this is her return she sacrifices every thing for me and they spurn her hush said warrington they can hear you from the next room hear let them hear pen cried out only so much the louder those may overhear my talk who intercept my letters i say this poor girl has been shamefully used and i will do my best to right her i will the door of the neighboring room opened and laura came forth with pale and stern face she looked at pen with glances from which beamed pride defiance aversion arthur your mother is very ill she said it is a pity that you should speak so loud as to disturb her it is a pity that i should have been obliged to speak at all pen answered and i have more to say before i have done i should think what you have to say will hardly be fit for me to hear laura said haughtily you are welcome to hear it or not as you like said mr pen i shall go in now and speak to my mother laura came rapidly forward so that she should not be overheard by her friend within not now sir she said to pen you may kill her if you do your conduct has gone far enough to make her wretched what conduct cried out pen in a fury who dares impugn it who dares meddle with me is it you who are the instigator of this persecution i said before it was a subject of which it did not become me to hear or to speak laura said but as for mamma if she had acted otherwise than she did with regard toto the person about whom you seem to take such an interest it would have been i that must have quitted your house and not thatthat person by heavens this is too much pen cried out with a violent execration perhaps that is what you wished laura said tossing her head up no more of this if you please i am not accustomed to hear such subjects spoken of in such language and with a stately courtesy the young lady passed to her friends room looking her adversary full in the face as she retreated and closed the door upon him pen was bewildered with wonder perplexity fury at this monstrous and unreasonable persecution he burst out into a loud and bitter laugh as laura quitted him and with sneers and revilings as a man who jeers under an operation ridiculed at once his own pain and his persecutors anger the laugh which was one of bitter humor and no unmanly or unkindly expression of suffering under most cruel and unmerited torture was heard in the next apartment as some of his unlucky previous expressions had been and like them entirely misinterpreted by the hearers it struck like a dagger into the wounded and tender heart of helen it pierced laura and inflamed the highspirited girl with scorn and anger and it was to this hardened libertine she thoughtto this boaster of low intrigues that i had given my heart away he breaks the most sacred laws thought helen he prefers the creature of his passion to his own mother and when he is upbraided he laughs and glories in his crime she gave me her all i heard him say it argued the poor widow and he boasts of it and laughs and breaks his mothers heart the emotion the shame the grief the mortification almost killed her she felt she should die of his unkindness warrington thought of lauras speechperhaps that is what you wished she loves pen still he said it was jealousy made her speakcome away pen come away and let us go to church and get calm you must explain this matter to your mother she does not appear to know the truth nor do you quite my good fellow come away and let us talk about it and again he muttered to himself perhaps that is what you wished yes she loves him why shouldnt she love him whom else would i have her love what can she be to me but the dearest and the fairest and the best of women so leaving the women similarly engaged within the two gentlemen walked away each occupied with his own thoughts and silent for a considerable space i must set this matter right thought honest george as she loves him stilli must set his mind right about the other woman and with this charitable thought the good fellow began to tell more at large what bows had said to him regarding miss boltons behavior and fickleness and he described how the girl was no better than a little lightminded flirt and perhaps he exaggerated the good humor and contentedness which he had himself as he thought witnessed in her behavior in the scene with mr huxter now all bowss statements had been colored by an insane jealousy and rage on that old mans part and instead of allaying pens renascent desire to see his little conquest again warringtons accounts inflamed and angered pendennis and made him more anxious than before to set himself right as he persisted in phrasing it with fanny they arrived at the churchdoor presently but scarce one word of the service and not a syllable of mr shambles sermon did either of them comprehend probablyso much was each engaged with his own private speculations the major came up to them after the service with his wellbrushed hat and wig and his jauntiest most cheerful air he complimented them upon being seen at church again he said that every commeilfaut person made a point of attending the english service abroad and he walked back with the young men prattling to them in garrulous goodhumor and making bows to his acquaintances as they passed and thinking innocently that pen and george were both highly delighted by his anecdotes which they suffered to run on in a scornful and silent acquiescence at the time of mr shambles sermon an erratic anglican divine hired for the season at places of english resort and addicted to debts drinking and even to roulette it was said pen chafing under the persecution which his womankind inflicted upon him had been meditating a great act of revolt and of justice as he had worked himself up to believe and warrington on his part had been thinking that a crisis in his affairs had likewise come and that it was necessary for him to break away from a connection which every day made more and more wretched and dear to him yes the time was come he took those fatal words perhaps that is what you wished as a text for a gloomy homily which he preached to himself in the dark pew of his own heart while mr shamble was feebly giving utterance to his sermon chapter xix fairoaks to let illustration our poor widow with the assistance of her faithful martha of fairoaks who laughed and wondered at the german ways and superintended the affairs of the simple household had made a little feast in honor of major pendenniss arrival of which however only the major and his two younger friends partook for helen sent to say that she was too unwell to dine at their table and laura bore her company the major talked for the party and did not perceive or choose to perceive what a gloom and silence pervaded the other two sharers of the modest dinner it was evening before helen and laura came into the sittingroom to join the company there she came in leaning on laura with her back to the waning light so that arthur could not see how palid and woestricken her face was and as she went up to pen whom she had not seen during the day and placed her fond arms on his shoulder and kissed him tenderly laura left her and moved away to another part of the room pen remarked that his mothers voice and her whole frame trembled her hand was clammy cold as she put it up to his forehead piteously embracing him the spectacle of her misery only added somehow to the wrath and testiness of the young man he scarcely returned the kiss which the suffering lady gave him and the countenance with which he met the appeal of her look was hard and cruel she persecutes me he thought within himself and she comes to me with the air of a martyr you look very ill my child she said i dont like to see you look in that way and she tottered to a sofa still holding one of his passive hands in her thin cold clinging fingers i have had much to annoy me mother pen said with a throbbing breast and as he spoke helens heart began to beat so that she sate almost dead and speechless with terror warrington laura and major pendennis all remained breathless aware that a storm was about to break i have had letters from london arthur continued and one that has given me more pain than i ever had in my life it tells me that former letters of mine have been intercepted and purloined away from me thatthat a young creature who has shown the greatest love and care for me has been most cruelly used byby you mother for gods sake stop cried out warrington shes illdont you see she is ill let him go on said the widow faintly let him go on and kill her said laura rushing up to her mothers side speak on sir and see her die it is you who are cruel cried pen more exasperated and more savage because his own heart naturally soft and weak revolted indignantly at the injustice of the very suffering which was laid at his door it is you that are cruel who attribute all this pain to me it is you who are cruel with your wicked reproaches your wicked doubts of me your wicked persecutions of those who love meyes those who love me and who brave every thing for me and whom you despise and trample upon because they are of lower degree than you shall i tell you what i will dowhat i am resolved to do now that i know what your conduct has been i will go back to this poor girl whom you turned out of my doors and ask her to come back and share my home with me ill defy the pride which persecutes her and the pitiless suspicion which insults her and me do you mean pen that you here the widow with eager eyes and outstretched hands was breaking out but laura stopped her silence hush dear mother she cried and the widow hushed savagely as pen spoke she was only too eager to hear what more he had to say go on arthur go on arthur was all she said almost swooning away as she spoke by gad i say he shant go on or i wont hear him by gad the major said trembling too in his wrath if you choose sir after all weve done for you after all ive done for you myself to insult your mother and disgrace your name by allying yourself with a lowborn kitchengirl go and do it by gad but let us maam have no more to do with him i wash my hands of you siri wash my hands of you im an old fellowi aint long for this world i come of as ancient and honorable a family as any in england by gad and i did hope before i went off the hooks by gad that the fellow that id liked and brought up and nursed through life by jove would do something to show me that our nameyes the name of pendennis by gad was left undishonored behind us but if he wont dammy i say amen by g both my father and my brother jack were the proudest men in england and i never would have thought that there would come this disgrace to my nameneverandand im ashamed that its arthur pendennis the old fellows voice here broke off into a sob it was a second time that arthur had brought tears from those wrinkled lids the sound of his breaking voice stayed pens anger instantly and he stopped pacing the room as he had been doing until that moment laura was by helens sofa and warrington had remained hitherto an almost silent but not uninterested spectator of the family storm as the parties were talking it had grown almost dark and after the lull which succeeded the passionate outbreak of the major georges deep voice as it here broke trembling into the twilight room was heard with no small emotion by all will you let me tell you something about myself my kind friends he said you have been so good to me maamyou have been so kind to me laurai hope i may call you so sometimesmy dear pen and i have been such friends thatthat i have long wanted to tell you my story such as it is and would have told it to you earlier but that it is a sad one and contains anothers secret however it may do good for arthur to know itit is right that every one here should it will divert you from thinking about a subject which out of a fatal misconception has caused a great deal of pain to all of you may i please tell you mrs pendennis pray speak was all helen said and indeed she was not much heeding her mind was full of another idea with which pens words had supplied her and she was in a terror of hope that what he had hinted might be as she wished george filled himself a bumper of wine and emptied it and began to speak you all of you know how you see me he said a man without a desire to make an advance in the world careless about reputation and living in a garret and from hand to mouth though i have friends and a name and i dare say capabilities of my own that would serve me if i had a mind but mind i have none i shall die in that garret most likely and alone i nailed myself to that doom in early life shall i tell you what it was that interested me about arthur years ago and made me inclined toward him when first i saw him the men from our college at oxbridge brought up accounts of that early affair with the chatteris actress about whom pen has often talked to me since and who but for the majors generalship might have been your daughterinlaw maam i cant see pen in the dark but he blushes im sure and i dare say miss bell does and my friend major pendennis i dare say laughs as he ought to dofor he won what would have been arthurs lot now had he been tied at nineteen to an illiterate woman older than himself with no qualities in common between them to make one a companion for the other no equality no confidence and no love speedily what could he have been but most miserable and when he spoke just now and threatened a similar union be sure it was but a threat occasioned by anger which you must give me leave to say maam was very natural on his part for after a generous and manly conductlet me say who know the circumstances wellmost generous and manly and selfdenying which is rare with himhe has met from some friends of his with a most unkind suspicion and has had to complain of the unfair treatment of another innocent person toward whom he and you all are under much obligation the widow was going to get up here and warrington seeing her attempt to rise said do i tire you maam o nogo ongo on said helen delighted and he continued i liked him you see because of that early history of his which had come to my ears in college gossip and because i like a man if you will pardon me for saying so miss laura who shows that he can have a great unreasonable attachment for a woman that was why we became friendsand are all friends herefor always arent we he added in a lower voice leaning over to her and pen has been a great comfort and companion to a lonely and unfortunate man i am not complaining of my lot you see for no mans is what he would have it and up in my garret where you left the flowers and with my old books and my pipe for a wife i am pretty contented and only occasionally envy other men whose careers in life are more brilliant or who can solace their ill fortune by what fate and my own fault has deprived me ofthe affection of a woman or a child here there came a sigh from somewhere near warrington in the dark and a hand was held out in his direction which however was instantly withdrawn for the prudery of our females is such that before all expression of feeling or natural kindness and regard a woman is taught to think of herself and the proprieties and to be ready to blush at the very slightest notice and checking as of course it ought this spontaneous motion modesty drew up again kindly friendship shrank back ashamed of itself and warrington resumed his history my fate is such as i made it and not lucky for me or for others involved in it i too had an adventure before i went to college and there was no one to save me as major pendennis saved pen pardon me miss laura if i tell this story before you it is as well that you all of you should hear my confession before i went to college as a boy of eighteen i was at a private tutors and there like arthur i became attached or fancied i was attached to a woman of a much lower degree and a greater age than my own you shrink from me no i dont laura said and here the hand went out resolutely and laid itself in warringtons she had divined his story from some previous hints let fall by him and his first words at its commencement she was a yeomans daughter in the neighborhood warrington said with rather a faltering voice and i fanciedwhat all young men fancy her parents knew who my father was and encouraged me with all sorts of coarse artifices and scoundrel flatteries which i see now about their house to do her justice i own she never cared for me but was forced into what happened by the threats and compulsion of her family would to god that i had not been deceived but in these matters we are deceived because we wish to be so and i thought i loved that poor woman what could come of such a marriage i found before long that i was married to a boor she could not comprehend one subject that interested me her dullness palled upon me till i grew to loathe it and after some time of a wretched furtive unioni must tell you all i found letters somewhere and such letters they were which showed me that her heart such as it was had never been mine but had always belonged to a person of her own degree at my fathers death i paid what debts i had contracted at college and settled every shilling which remained to me in an annuity upon upon those who bore my name on condition that they should hide themselves away and not assume it they have kept that condition as they would break it for more money if i had earned fame or reputation that woman would have come to claim it if i had made a name for myself those who had no right to it would have borne it and i entered life at twenty god help mehopeless and ruined beyond remission i was the boyish victim of vulgar cheats and perhaps it is only of late i have found out how hardah how hardit is to forgive them i told you the moral before pen and now i have told you the fable beware how you marry out of your degree i was made for a better lot than this i think but god has awarded me this oneand so you see it is for me to look on and see others successful and others happy with a heart that shall be as little bitter as possible by gad sir cried the major in high good humor i intended you to marry miss laura here and by gad master shallow i owe you a thousand pound warrington said how dye mean a thousand it was only a pony sir replied the major simply at which the other laughed as for helen she was so delighted that she started up and said god bless yougod forever bless you mr warrington and kissed both his hands and ran up to pen and fell into his arms yes dearest mother he said as he held her to him and with a noble tenderness and emotion embraced and forgave her i am innocent and my dear dear mother has done me a wrong oh yes my child i have wronged you thank god i have wronged you helen whispered come away arthurnot herei want to ask my child to forgive meandand my god to forgive me and to bless you and love you my son he led her tottering into her room and closed the door as the three touched spectators of the reconciliation looked on in pleased silence ever after ever after the tender accents of that voice faltering sweetly at his earthe look of the sacred eyes beaming with an affection unutterablethe quiver of the fond lips smiling mournfullywere remembered by the young man and at his best moments and at his hours of trial and grief and at his times of success or well doing the mothers face looked down upon him and blessed him with its gaze of pity and purity as he saw it in that night when she yet lingered with him and when she seemed ere she quite left him an angel transfigured and glorified with lovefor which love as for the greatest of the bounties and wonders of gods provision for us let us kneel and thank our father the moon had risen by this time arthur recollected well afterward how it lighted up his mothers sweet pale face their talk or his rather for she scarcely could speak was more tender and confidential than it had been for years before he was the frank and generous boy of her early days and love he told her the story the mistake regarding which had caused her so much painhis struggles to fly from temptation and his thankfulness that he had been able to overcome it he never would do the girl wrong never or wound his own honor or his mothers pure heart the threat that he would return was uttered in a moment of exasperation of which he repented he never would see her again but his mother said yes he should and it was she who had been proud and culpableand she would like to give fanny bolton somethingand she begged her dear boys pardon for opening the letter and she would write to the young girl ifif she had time poor thing was it not natural that she should love her arthur and again she kissed him and she blessed him as they were talking the clock struck nine and helen reminded him how when he was a little boy she used to go up to his bedroom at that hour and hear him say our father and once more oh once more the young man fell down at his mothers sacred knees and sobbed out the prayer which the divine tenderness uttered for us and which has been echoed for twenty ages since by millions of sinful and humbled men and as he spoke the last words of the supplication the mothers head fell down on her boys and her arms closed round him and together they repeated the words for ever and ever and amen a little time after it might have been a quarter of an hour laura heard arthurs voice calling from within laura laura she rushed into the room instantly and found the young man still on his knees and holding his mothers hand helens head had sunk back and was quite pale in the moon pen looked round scared with a ghastly terror help laura help he saidshes faintedshes laura screamed and fell by the side of helen the shriek brought warrington and major pendennis and the servants to the room the sainted woman was dead the last emotion of her soul here was joy to be henceforth uncheckered and eternal the tender heart beat no more it was to have no more pangs no more doubts no more griefs and trials its last throb was love and helens last breath was a benediction the melancholy party bent their way speedily homewards and helen was laid by her husbands side at clavering in the old church where she had prayed so often for a while laura went to stay with dr portman who read the service over his dear sister departed amidst his own sobs and those of the little congregation which assembled round helens tomb there were not many who cared for her or who spoke of her when gone scarcely more than of a nun in a cloister did people know of that pious and gentle lady a few words among the cottagers whom her bounty was accustomed to relieve a little talk from house to house at clavering where this lady told how their neighbor died of a complaint in the heart while that speculated upon the amount of property which the widow had left and a third wondered whether arthur would let fairoaks or live in it and expected that he would not be long getting through his propertythis was all and except with one or two who cherished her the kind soul was forgotten by the next marketday would you desire that grief for you should last for a few more weeks and does afterlife seem less solitary provided that our names when we go down into silence are echoing on this side of the grave yet for a little while and human voices are still talking about us she was gone the pure soul whom only two or three loved and knew the great blank she left was in lauras heart to whom her love had been every thing and who had now but to worship her memory i am glad that she gave me her blessing before she went away warrington said to pen and as for arthur with a humble acknowledgment and wonder at so much affection he hardly dared to ask of heaven to make him worthy of it though he felt that a saint there was interceding for him all the ladys affairs were found in perfect order and her little property ready for transmission to her son in trust for whom she held it papers in her desk showed that she had long been aware of the complaint one of the heart under which she labored and knew it would suddenly remove her and a prayer was found in her handwriting asking that her end might be as it was in the arms of her son laura and arthur talked over her sayings all of which the former most fondly remembered to the young mans shame somewhat who thought how much greater her love had been for helen than his own he referred himself entirely to laura to know what helen would have wished should be done what poor persons she would have liked to relieve what legacies or remembrances she would have wished to transmit they packed up the vase which helen in her gratitude had destined to dr goodenough and duly sent it to the kind doctor a silver coffeepot which she used was sent off to portman a diamond ring with her hair was given with affectionate greeting to warrington it must have been a hard day for poor laura when she went over to fairoaks first and to the little room which she had occupied and which was hers no more and to the widows own blank chamber in which those two had passed so many beloved hours there of course were the clothes in the wardrobe the cushion on which she prayed the chair at the toilet the glass that was no more to reflect her dear sad face after she had been here awhile pen knocked and led her down stairs to the parlor again and made her drink a little wine and said god bless you as she touched the glass nothing shall ever be changed in your room he said it is always your roomit is always my sisters room shall it not be so laura and laura said yes among the widows papers was found a packet marked by the widow letters from lauras father and which arthur gave to her they were the letters which had passed between the cousins in the early days before the marriage of either of them the ink was faded in which they were written the tears dried out that both perhaps had shed over them the grief healed now whose bitterness they chronicled the friends doubtless united whose parting on earth had caused to both pangs so cruel and laura learned fully now for the first time what the tie was which had bound her so tenderly to helen how faithfully her more than mother had cherished her fathers memory how truly she had loved him how meekly resigned him one legacy of his mothers pen remembered of which laura could have no cognizance it was that wish of helens to make some present to fanny bolton and pen wrote to her putting his letter under an envelope to mr bows and requesting that gentleman to read it before he delivered it to fanny dear fanny pen said i have to acknowledge two letters from you one of which was delayed in my illness pen found the first letter in his mothers desk after her decease and the reading it gave him a strange pang and to thank you my kind nurse and friend who watched me so tenderly during my fever and i have to tell you that the last words of my dear mother who is no more were words of goodwill and gratitude to you for nursing me and she said she would have written to you had she had timethat she would like to ask your pardon if she had harshly treated youand that she would beg you to show your forgiveness by accepting some token of friendship and regard from her pen concluded by saying that his friend george warrington esq of lambcourt temple was trustee of a little sum of money of which the interest would be paid to her until she became of age or changed her name which would always be affectionately remembered by her grateful friend a pendennis the sum was in truth but small although enough to make a little heiress of fanny bolton whose parents were appeased and whose father said mr p had acted quite as the gentlemanthough bows growled out that to plaster a wounded heart with a banknote was an easy kind of sympathy and poor fanny felt only too clearly that pens letter was one of farewell sending hundredpound notes to porters daughters is all devlish well old major pendennis said to his nephew whom as the proprietor of fairoaks and the head of the family he now treated with marked deference and civility and as there was a little ready money at the bank and your poor mother wished it theres perhaps no harm done but my good lad id have you to remember that youve not above five hundred a year though thanks to me the world gives you credit for being a doosid deal better off and on my knees i beg you my boy dont break into your capital stick to it sir dont speculate with it sir keep your land and dont borrow on it tatham tells me that the chatteris branch of the railway maywill almost certainly pass through chatteris and if it can be brought on this side of the brawl sir and through your fields theyll be worth a devlish deal of money and your five hundred a year will jump up to eight or nine whatever it is keep it i implore you keep it and i say pen i think you should give up living in those dirty chambers in the temple and get a decent lodging and i should have a man sir to wait upon me and a horse or two in town in the season all this will pretty well swallow up your income and i know you must live close but remember you have a certain place in society and you cant afford to cut a poor figure in the world what are you going to do in the winter you dont intend to stay down here or i suppose to go on writing for thatwhatdyecallemthat newspaper warrington and i are going abroad again sir for a little and then we shall see what is to be done arthur replied and youll let fairoaks of course good school in the neighborhood cheap country devlish nice place for east india colonels or families wanting to retire ill speak about it at the club there are lots of fellows at the club want a place of that sort i hope laura will live in it for the winter at least and will make it her home arthur replied at which the major pishd and pshad and said that there ought to be convents begad for english ladies and wished that miss bell had not been there to interfere with the arrangements of the family and that she would mope herself to death alone in that place indeed it would have been a very dismal abode for poor laura who was not too happy either in doctor portmans household and in the town where too many things reminded her of the dear parent whom she had lost but old lady rockminster who adored her young friend laura as soon as she read in the paper of her loss and of her presence in the country rushed over from baymouth where the old lady was staying and insisted that laura should remain six months twelve months all her life with her and to her ladyships house martha from fairoaks as femme de chambre accompanied her young mistress pen and warrington saw her depart it was difficult to say which of the young men seemed to regard her the most tenderly your cousin is pert and rather vulgar my dear but he seems to have a good heart little lady rockminster said who said her say about every bodybut i like bluebeard best tell me is he touche au coeur mr warrington has been longengaged laura said dropping her eyes nonsense child and good heavens my dear thats a pretty diamond cross what do you mean by wearing it in the morning arthurmy brother gave it to me just now it wasit was she could not finish the sentence the carriage passed over the bridge and by the dear dear gate of fairoakshome no more chapter xx old friends it chanced at that great english festival at which all london takes a holiday upon epsom downs that a great number of the personages to whom we have been introduced in the course of this history were assembled to see the derby in a comfortable open carriage which had been brought to the ground by a pair of horses might be seen mrs bungay of paternosterrow attired like solomon in all his glory and having by her side modest mrs shandon for whom since the commencement of their acquaintance the worthy publishers lady had maintained a steady friendship bungay having recreated himself with a copious luncheon was madly shying at the sticks hard by till the perspiration ran off his bald pate shandon was shambling about among the drinking tents and gipsies finucane constant in attendance on the two ladies to whom gentlemen of their acquaintance and connected with the publishing house came up to pay a visit among others mr archer came up to make her his bow and told mrs bungay who was on the course yonder was the prime minister his lordship had just told him to back borax for the race but archer thought muffineer the better horse he pointed out countless dukes and grandees to the delighted mrs bungay look yonder in the grand stand he said there sits the chinese embassador with the mandarins of his suite fouchoofoo brought me over letters of introduction from the governorgeneral of india my most intimate friend and i was for some time very kind to him and he had his chopsticks laid for him at my table whenever he chose to come and dine but he brought his own cook with him andwould you believe it mrs bungayone day when i was out and the embassador was with mrs archer in our garden eating gooseberries of which the chinese are passionately fond the beast of a cook seeing my wifes dear little blenheim spaniel that we had from the duke of maryborough himself whose ancestors life mrs archers greatgreatgrandfather saved at the battle of malplaquet seized upon the poor little devil cut his throat and skinned him and served him up stuffed with forced meat in the second course law said mrs bungay you may fancy my wifes agony when she knew what had happened the cook came screaming upstairs and told us that she had found poor fidos skin in the area just after we had all of us tasted of the dish she never would speak to the embassador againnever and upon my word he has never been to dine with us since the lord mayor who did me the honor to dine liked the dish very much and eaten with green peas it tastes rather like duck you dont say so now cried the astonished publishers lady fact upon my word look at that lady in blue seated by the embassador that is lady flamingo and they say she is going to be married to him and return to pekin with his excellency she is getting her feet squeezed down on purpose but shell only cripple herself and will never be able to do itnever my wife has the smallest foot in england and wears shoes for a sixyears old child but what is that to a chinese ladys foot mrs bungay who is that carriage as mr pendennis is with mr archer mrs bungay presently asked he and mr warrington was here just now hes aughty in his manners that mr pendennis and well he may be for im told he keeps tiptop company as he ad a large fortune left him mr archer hes in black still i see eighteen hundred a year in land and twentytwo thousand five hundred in the threeandahalf per cents thats about it said mr archer law why you know every thing mr a cried the lady of paternoster row i happen to know because i was called in about poor mrs pendenniss will mr archer replied pendenniss uncle the major seldom does any thing without me and as he is likely to be extravagant weve tied up the property so that he cant make ducks and drakes with it how do you do my lorddo you know that gentleman ladies you have read his speeches in the house it is lord rochester lord fiddlestick cried out finucane from the box sure its tom staples of the morning advertiser archer is it archer said simply well im very shortsighted and upon my word i thought it was rochester that gentleman with the double operaglass another nod is lord john and the tall man with him dont you know him is sir james you know em because you see em in the house growled finucane i know them because they are kind enough to allow me to call them my most intimate friends archer continued look at the duke of hampshire what a pattern of a fine old english gentleman he never misses the derby archer he said to me only yesterday i have been at sixtyfive derbies appeared on the field for the first time on a piebald pony when i was seven years old with my father the prince of wales and colonel hanger and only missing two racesone when i had the measles at eton and one in the waterloo year when i was with my friend wellington in flanders and who is that yellow carriage with the pink and yellow parasols that mr pendennis is talking to and ever so many gentlemen asked mrs bungay that is lady clavering of clavering park next estate to my friend pendennis that is the young son and heir upon the box hes awfully tipsy the little scamp and the young lady is miss amory lady claverings daughter by a first marriage and uncommonly sweet upon my friend pendennis but ive reason to think he has his heart fixed elsewhere you have heard of young mr fokerthe great brewer foker you knowhe was going to hang himself in consequence of a fatal passion for miss amory who refused him but was cut down just in time by his valet and is now abroad under a keeper how happy that young fellow is sighed mrs bungay whod have thought when he came so quiet and demure to dine with us three or four years ago he would turn out such a grand character why i saw his name at court the other day and presented by the marquis of steyne and all and in every party of the nobility his names down as sure as a gun i introduced him a good deal when he first came up to town mr archer said and his uncle major pendennis did the rest halloo theres cobden here of all men in the world i must go and speak to him goodby mrs bungay good morning mrs shandon an hour previous to this time and at a different part of the course there might have been seen an old stagecoach on the battered roof of which a crowd of shabby raffs were stamping and hallooing as the great event of the daythe derby racerushed over the green sward and by the shouting millions of people assembled to view that magnificent scene this was wheelers the harlequins head drag which had brought down a company of choice spirits from bowstreet with a slapup luncheon in the boot as the whirling race flashed by each of the choice spirits bellowed out the name of the horse or the colors which he thought or he hoped might be foremost the cornet its muffineer its blue sleeves yallow cap yallow cap yallow cap and so forth yelled the gentlemen sportsmen during that delicious and thrilling minute before the contest was decided and as the fluttering signal blew out showing the number of the famous horse podasokus as winner of the race one of the gentlemen on the harlequins head drag sprang up off the roof as if he was a pigeon and about to fly away to london or york with the news but his elation did not lift him many inches from his standingplace to which he came down again on the instant causing the boards of the crazy old coachroof to crack with the weight of his joy hurrah hurrah he bawled out podasokus is the horse supper for ten wheeler my boy ask you all round of course and damn the expense illustration and the gentlemen on the carriage the shabby swaggerers the dubious bucks said thank youcongratulate you colonel sup with you with pleasure and whispered to one another the colonel stands to win fifteen hundred and he got the odds from a good man too and each of the shabby bucks and dusky dandies began to eye his neighbor with suspicion lest that neighbor taking his advantage should get the colonel into a lonely place and borrow money of him and the winner on podasokus could not be alone during the whole of that afternoon so closely did his friends watch him and each other at another part of the course you might have seen a vehicle certainly more modest if not more shabby than that battered coach which had brought down the choice spirits from the harlequins head this was cab no which had conveyed a gentleman and two ladies from the cabstand in the strand whereof one of the ladies as she sate on the box of the cab enjoying with her mamma and their companion a repast of lobstersalad and bitter ale looked so fresh and pretty that many of the splendid young dandies who were strolling about the course and enjoying themselves at the noble diversion of sticks and talking to the beautifully dressed ladies in the beautiful carriages on the hill forsook these fascinations to have a glance at the smiling and rosycheeked lass on the cab the blushes of youth and goodhumor mantled on the girls cheeks and played over that fair countenance like the pretty shining cloudlets on the serene sky over head the elder ladys cheek was red too but that was a permanent mottled rose deepening only as it received fresh draughts of pale ale and brandyandwater until her face emulated the rich shell of the lobster which she devoured the gentleman who escorted these two ladies was most active in attendance upon them here on the course as he had been during the previous journey during the whole of that animated and delightful drive from london his jokes had never ceased he spoke up undauntedly to the most awful drags full of the biggest and most solemn guardsmen as to the humblest donkeychaise in which bob the dustman was driving molly to the race he had fired astonishing volleys of what is called chaff into endless windows as he passed into lines of grinning girls schools into little regiments of shouting urchins hurrahing behind the railings of their classical and commercial academies into casements whence smiling maidservants and nurses tossing babies or demure old maiden ladies with dissenting countenances were looking and the pretty girl in the straw bonnet with pink ribbon and her mamma the devourer of lobsters had both agreed that when he was in spirits there was nothing like that mr sam he had crammed the cab with trophies won from the bankrupt proprietors of the sticks hard by and with countless pincushions woodenapples backyboxes jackintheboxes and little soldiers he had brought up a gipsy with a tawny child in her arms to tell the fortunes of the ladies and the only cloud which momentarily obscured the sunshine of that happy party was when the teller of fate informed the young lady that she had had reason to beware of a fair man who was false to her that she had had a bad illness and that she would find that a dark man would prove true the girl looked very much abashed at this news her mother and the young man interchanged signs of wonder and intelligence perhaps the conjuror had used the same words to a hundred different carriages on that day making his way solitary among the crowd and the carriages and noting according to his wont the various circumstances and characters which the animated scene presented a young friend of ours came suddenly upon cab and the little group of persons assembled on the outside of the vehicle as he caught sight of the young lady on the box she started and turned pale her mother became redder than ever the heretofore gay and triumphant mr sam immediately assumed a fierce and suspicious look and his eyes turned savagely from fanny bolton whom the reader no doubt has recognized in the young lady of the cab to arthur pendennis advancing to meet her arthur too looked dark and suspicious on perceiving mr samuel huxter in company with his old acquaintances but his suspicion was that of alarmed morality and i dare say highly creditable to mr arthur like the suspicion of mrs lynx when she sees mr brown and mrs jones talking together or when she remarks mrs lamb twice or thrice in a handsome operabox there may be no harm in the conversation of mr b and mrs j and mrs lambs opera box though she notoriously cant afford one may be honestly come by but yet a moralist like mrs lynx has a right to the little precautionary fright and arthur was no doubt justified in adopting that severe demeanor of his fannys heart began to patter violently huxters fists plunged into the pockets of his paletot clenched themselves involuntarily and armed themselves as it were in ambush mrs bolton began to talk with all her might and with a wonderful volubility and lor she was so appy to see mr pendennis and how well he was a lookin and wed been talkin about mr p only jest before hadnt we fanny and if this was the famous hepsom races that they talked so much about she didnt care for her part if she never saw them again and how was major pendennis and that kind mr warrington who brought mr ps great kindness to fanny and she never would forget it never and mr warrington was so tall he almost broke his ead up against their lodge door you recollect mr warrington a knockin of his headdont you fanny while mrs bolton was so discoursing i wonder how many thousands of thoughts passed through fannys mind and what dear times sad struggles lonely griefs and subsequent shamefaced consolations were recalled to her what pangs had the poor little thing as she thought how much she had loved him and that she loved him no more there he stood about whom she was going to die ten months since dandified supercilious with a black crape to his white hat and jet buttons in his shirt front and a pink in his coat that some one else had probably given him with the tightest lavendercolored gloves sewn with black and the smallest of canes and mr huxter wore no gloves and great blucher boots and smelt very much of tobacco certainly and looked oh it must be owned he looked as if a bucket of water would do him a great deal of good all these thoughts and a myriad of others rushed through fannys mind as her mamma was delivering herself of her speech and as the girl from under her eyes surveyed pendennissurveyed him entirely from head to foot the circle on his white forehead that his hat left when he lifted it his beautiful beautiful hair had grown again the trinkets at his watchchain the ring on his hand under his glove the neat shining boot so so unlike sams highlowand after her hand had given a little twittering pressure to the lavendercolored kid grasp which was held out to it and after her mother had delivered herself of her speech all fanny could find to say was this is mr samuel huxter whom you knew formerly i believe sir mr samuel you know you knew mr pendennis formerlyandandwill you take a little refreshment these little words tremulous and uncolored as they were yet were understood by pendennis in such a manner as to take a great load of suspicion from off his mindof remorse perhaps from his heart the frown on the countenance of the prince of fairoaks disappeared and a goodnatured smile and a knowing twinkle of the eyes illuminated his highnesss countenance i am very thirsty he said and i will be glad to drink your health fanny and i hope mr huxter will pardon me for having been very rude to him the last time we met and when i was so ill and out of spirits that indeed i scarcely knew what i said and herewith the lavendercolored dexter kidglove was handed out in token of amity to huxter the dirty fist in the young surgeons pocket was obliged to undouble itself and come out of its ambush disarmed the poor fellow himself felt as he laid it in pens hand how hot his own was and how blackit left black marks on pens gloves he saw themhe would have liked to have clenched it again and dashed it into the others goodhumored face and have seen there upon that ground with fanny with all england looking on which was the best manhe sam huxter of bartholomews or that grinning dandy pen with ineffable goodhumor took a glasshe didnt mind what it washe was content to drink after the ladies and he filled it with frothing lukewarm beer which he pronounced to be delicious and which he drank cordially to the health of the party as he was drinking and talking on in an engaging manner a young lady in a shot dovecolored dress with a white parasol lined with pink and the prettiest dovecolored boots that ever stepped passed by pen leaning on the arm of a stalwart gentleman with a military mustache the young lady clenched her little fist and gave a mischievous sidelook as she passed pen he of the mustaches burst out into a jolly laugh he had taken off his hat to the ladies of cab no you should have seen fanny boltons eyes watching after the dovecolored young lady immediately huxter perceived the direction which they took they ceased looking after the dovecolored nymph and they turned and looked into sam huxters orbs with the most artless goodhumored expression what a beautiful creature fanny said what a lovely dress did you remark mr sam such little little hands it was capting strong said mrs bolton and who was the young woman i wonder a neighbor of mine in the countrymiss amory arthur saidlady claverings daughter youve seen sir francis often in shepherds inn mrs bolton as he spoke fanny built up a perfect romance in three volumes lovefaithlessnesssplendid marriage at st georges hanoversquare brokenhearted maidand sam huxter was not the hero of that storypoor sam who by this time had got out an exceedingly rank cuba cigar and was smoking it under fannys little nose after that confounded prig pendennis joined and left the party the sun was less bright to sam huxter the sky less bluethe sticks had no attraction for himthe bitter beer hot and undrinkablethe world was changed he had a quantity of peas and a tin peashooter in the pocket of the cab for amusement on the homeward route he didnt take them out and forgot their existence until some other wag on their return from the races fired a volley into sams sad face upon which salute after a few oaths indicative of surprise he burst into a savage and sardonic laugh but fanny was charming all the way home she coaxed and snuggled and smiled she laughed pretty laughs she admired everything she took out the darling little jackintheboxes and was so obliged to sam and when they got home and mr huxter still with darkness on his countenance was taking a frigid leave of hershe burst into tears and said he was a naughty unkind thing upon which with a burst of emotion almost as emphatic as hers the young surgeon held the girl in his armsswore that she was an angel and that he was a jealous brute owned that he was unworthy of her and that he had no right to hate pendennis and asked her implored her to say once more that she that she whatthe end of the question and fannys answer were pronounced by lips that were so near each other that no bystander could hear the words mrs bolton only said come come mr hno nonsense if you please and i think youve acted like a wicked wretch and been most uncommon cruel to fanny that i do when arthur left no he went to pay his respects to the carriage to which and to the side of her mamma the dove colored author of mes larmes had by this time returned indefatigable old major pendennis was in waiting upon lady clavering and had occupied the back seat in her carriage the box being in possession of young hopeful under the care of captain strong a number of dandies and men of a certain fashionof military bucks of young rakes of the public offices of those who may be styled mens men rather than ladieshad come about the carriage during its station on the hilland had exchanged a word or two with lady clavering and a little talk a little chaff some of the most elegant of the men styled their conversation with miss amory they had offered her sportive bets and exchanged with her all sorts of freetalk and knowing innuendoes they pointed out to her who was on the course and the who was not always the person a young lady should know when pen came up to lady claverings carriage he had to push his way through a crowd of these young bucks who were paying their court to miss amory in order to arrive as near that young lady who beckoned him by many pretty signals to her side je lai vue she said elle a de bien beaux yeux vous etes un monstre why monster said pen with a laugh honi soit qui mal y pense my young friend yonder is as well protected as any young lady in christendom she has her mamma on one side her pretendu on the other could any harm happen to a girl between those two one does not know what may or may not arrive said miss blanche in french when a girl has the mind and when she is pursued by a wicked monster like you figure to yourself colonel that i come to find monsieur your nephew near to a cab by two ladies and a man oh such a man and who ate lobsters and who laughed who laughed it did not strike me that the man laughed pen said and as for lobsters i thought he would have liked to eat me after the lobsters he shook hands with me and griped me so that he bruised my glove black and blue he is a young surgeon he comes from clavering dont you remember the gilt pestle and mortar in highstreet if he attends you when you are sick continued miss amory he will kill you he will serve you right for you are a monster the perpetual recurrence to the word monster jarred upon pen she speaks about these matters a great deal too lightly he thought if i had been a monster as she calls it she would have received me just the same this is not the way in which an english lady should speak or think laura would not speak in that way thank god and as he thought so his own countenance fell of what are you thinking are you going to bouder me at present blanche asked major scold your mechant nephew he does not amuse me at all he is as bete as captain crackenbury what are you saying about me miss amory said the guardsman with a grin if its any thing good say it in english for i dont understand french when its spoke so devilish quick it aint any thing good crack said crackenburys fellow captain clinker lets come away and dont spoil sport they say pendennis is sweet upon her im told hes a devilish clever fellow sighed crackenbury lady violet lebas says hes a devilish clever fellow he wrote a work or a poem or something and he writes those devilish clever things in thein the papers you know dammy i wish i was a clever fellow clinker thats past wishing for crack my boy the other said i cant write a good book but i think i can make a pretty good one on the derby what a flat clavering is and the begum i like that old begum shes worth ten of her daughter how pleased the old girl was at winning the lottery claverings safe to pay up aint he asked captain crackenbury i hope so said his friend and they disappeared to enjoy themselves among the sticks before the end of the days amusements many more gentlemen of lady claverings acquaintance came up to her carriage and chatted with the party which it contained the worthy lady was in high spirits and goodhumor laughing and talking according to her wont and offering refreshments to all her friends until her ample baskets and bottles were emptied and her servants and postillions were in such a royal state of excitement as servants and postillions commonly are upon the derby day the major remarked that some of the visitors to the carriage appeared to look with rather queer and meaning glances toward its owner how easily she takes it one man whispered to another the begums made of money the friend replied how easily she takes what thought old pendennis has any body lost any money lady clavering said she was happy in the morning because sir francis had promised her not to bet mr welbore the country neighbor of the claverings was passing the carriage when he was called back by the begum who rallied him for wishing to cut her why didnt he come before why didnt he come to lunch her ladyship was in great delight she told himshe told every bodythat she had won five pounds in a lottery as she conveyed this piece of intelligence to him mr welbore looked so particularly knowing and withal melancholy that a dismal apprehension seized upon major pendennis he would go and look after the horses and those rascals of postillions who were so long in coming round when he came back to the carriage his usually benign and smirking countenance was obscured by some sorrow what is the matter with you now the goodnatured begum asked the major pretended a headache from the fatigue and sunshine of the day the carriage wheeled off the course and took its way londonwards not the least brilliant equipage in that vast and picturesque procession the tipsy drivers dashed gallantly over the turf amid the admiration of footpassengers the ironical cheers of the little donkeycarriages and spring vans and the loud objurgations of horseandchaise men with whom the reckless postboys came in contact the jolly begum looked the picture of good humor as she reclined on her splendid cushions the lovely sylphide smiled with languid elegance many an honest holidaymaker with his family wadded into a taxcart many a cheap dandy working his way home on his weary hack admired that brilliant turnout and thought no doubt how happy those swells must be strong sat on the box still with a lordly voice calling to the postboys and the crowd master frank had been put inside of the carriage and was asleep there by the side of the major dozing away the effects of the constant luncheon and champagne of which he had freely partaken the major was revolving in his mind meanwhile the news the receipt of which had made him so grave if sir francis clavering goes on in this way pendennis the elder thought this little tipsy rascal will be as bankrupt as his father and grandfather before him the begums fortune cant stand such drains upon it no fortune can stand them she has paid his debts halfadozen times already a few years more of the turf and a few coups like this will ruin her dont you think we could get up races at clavering mamma miss amory asked yes we must have them there again there were races there in the old times the good old times its a national amusement you know and we could have a clavering ball and we might have dances for the tenantry and rustic sports in the parkoh it would he charming capital fun said mamma wouldnt it major the turf is a very expensive amusement my dear lady major pendennis answered with such a rueful face that the begum rallied him and asked laughingly whether he had lost money on the race after a slumber of about an hour and a half the heir of the house began to exhibit symptoms of wakefulness stretching his youthful arms over the majors face and kicking his sisters knees as she sate opposite to him when the amiable youth was quite restored to consciousness he began a sprightly conversation i say ma he said ive gone and done it this time i have what have you gone and done franky dear asked mamma how much is seventeen halfcrowns two pound and halfacrown aint it i drew borax in our lottery but i bought podasokus and manmilliner of leggat minor for two open tarts and a bottle of ginger beer you little wicked gambling creature how dare you begin so soon cried miss amory hold your tongue if you please who ever asked your leave miss the brother said and i say ma well franky dear youll tip me all the same you know when i go back and here he broke out into a laugh i say ma shall i tell you something the begum expressed her desire to hear this something and her son and heir continued when me and strong was down at the grand stand after the race and i was talking to leggat minor who was there with his governor i saw pa look as savage as a bear and i say ma leggat minor told me that he heard his governor say that pa had lost seven thousand backing the favorite ill never back the favorite when im of age no nohang me if i do leave me alone strong will you captain strong captain strong is this true cried out the unfortunate begum has sir francis been betting again he promised me he wouldnt he gave me his word of honor he wouldnt strong from his place on the box had overheard the end of young claverings communication and was trying in vain to stop his unlucky tongue im afraid its true maam he said turning round i deplore the loss as much as you can he promised me as he promised you but the play is too strong for him he cant refrain from it lady clavering at this sad news burst into a fit of tears she deplored her wretched fate as the most miserable of woman she declared she would separate and pay no more debts for this ungrateful man she narrated with tearful volubility a score of stories only too authentic which showed how her husband had deceived and how constantly she had befriended him and in this melancholy condition while young hopeful was thinking about the two guineas which he himself had won and the major revolving in his darkened mind whether certain plans which he had been forming had better not be abandoned the splendid carriage drove up at length to the begums house in grosvenorplace the idlers and boys lingering about the place to witness according to public wont the close of the derby day cheering the carriage as it drew up and envying the happy folks who descended from it and its for the son of this man that i am made a beggar blanche said quivering with anger as she walked up stairs leaning on the majors armfor this cheatfor this blacklegfor this liarfor this robber of women calm yourself my dear miss blanche the old gentleman said i pray calm yourself you have been hardly treated most unjustly but remember that you have always a friend in me and trust to an old fellow who will try and serve you and the young lady and the heir of the hopeful house of clavering having retired to their beds the remaining three of the epsom party remained for some time in deep consultation chapter xxi explanations illustration almost a year as the reader will perceive has passed since an event described a few pages back arthurs black coat is about to be exchanged for a blue one his person has undergone other more pleasing and remarkable changes his wig has been laid aside and his hair though somewhat thinner has returned to public view and he has had the honor of appearing at court in the uniform of a cornet of the clavering troop of theshire yeomanry cavalry being presented to the sovereign by the marquis of steyne this was a measure strongly and pathetically urged by arthurs uncle the major would not hear of a year passing before this ceremony of gentlemanhood was gone through the old gentleman thought that his nephew should belong to some rather more select club than the megatherium and has announced every where in the world his disappointment that the young mans property has turned out not by any means as well as he could have hoped and is under fifteen hundred a year that is the amount at which pendenniss property is set down in the world where his publishers begin to respect him much more than formerly and where even mammas are by no means uncivil to him for if the pretty daughters are naturally to marry people of very different expectations at any rate he will be eligible for the plain ones and if the brilliant and fascinating myra is to hook an earl poor little beatrice who has one shoulder higher than the other must hang on to some boor through life and why should not mr pendennis be her support in the very first winter after the accession to his mothers fortune mrs hawxby in a countryhouse caused her beatrice to learn billiards from mr pendennis and would be driven by nobody but him in the pony carriage because he was literary and her beatrice was literary too and declared that the young man under the instigation of his horrid old uncle had behaved most infamously in trifling with beatrices feelings the truth is the old gentleman who knew mrs hawxbys character and how desperately that lady would practice upon unwary young men had come to the countryhouse in question and carried arthur out of the danger of her immediate claws though not out of the reach of her tongue the elder pendennis would have had his nephew pass a part of the christmas at clavering whither the family had returned but arthur had not the heart for that clavering was too near poor old fairoaks and that was too full of sad recollections for the young man we have lost sight of the claverings too until their reappearance upon the epsom raceground and must give a brief account of them in the interval during the past year the world has not treated any member of the clavering family very kindly lady clavering one of the bestnatured women that ever enjoyed a good dinner or made a slip in grammar has had her appetite and goodnature sadly tried by constant family grievances and disputes such as make the efforts of the best french cook unpalatable and the most delicatelystuffed sofacushion hard to lie on id rather have a turnip strong for dessert than that pineapple and all them muscatel grapes from clavering says poor lady clavering looking at her dinnertable and confiding her griefs to her faithful friend if i could but have a little quiet to eat it with oh how much happier i was when i was a widow and before all this money fell in to me the clavering family had indeed made a false start in life and had got neither comfort nor position nor thanks for the hospitalities which they administered nor a return of kindness from the people whom they entertained the success of their first london season was doubtful and their failure afterward notorious human patience was not great enough to put up with sir francis clavering people said he was too hopelessly low dull and disreputable you could not say what but there was a taint about the house and its entourages who was the begum with her money and without her hs and where did she come from what an extraordinary little piece of conceit the daughter was with her gallicised graces and daring affectations not fit for wellbred english girls to associate with what strange people were those they assembled round about them sir francis clavering was a gambler living notoriously in the society of blacklegs and profligates hely clinker who was in his regiment said that he not only cheated at cards but showed the white feather what could lady rockminster have meant by taking her up after the first season indeed lady rockminster who had taken up lady clavering put her down the great ladies would not take their daughters to her parties the young men who attended them behaved with the most odious freedom and scornful familiarity and poor lady clavering herself avowed that she was obliged to take what she called the canal into her parlor because the tiptops wouldnt come she had not the slightest illwill toward the canal the poor dear lady or any pride about herself or idea that she was better than her neighbor but she had taken implicitly the orders which on her entry into the world her social godmother had given her she had been willing to know whom they knew and ask whom they asked the canal in fact was much pleasanter than what is called society but as we said before that to leave a mistress is easy while on the contrary to be left by her is cruel so you may give up society without any great pang or any thing but a sensation of relief at the parting but severe are the mortifications and pains you have if society gives up you one young man of fashion we have mentioned who at least it might have been expected would have been found faithful among the faithless and harry foker esq was indeed that young man but he had not managed matters with prudence and the unhappy passion at first confided to pen became notorious and ridiculous to the town was carried to the ears of his weak and fond mother and finally brought under the cognizance of the baldheaded and inflexible foker senior when mr foker learned this disagreeable news there took place between him and his son a violent and painful scene which ended in the poor little gentlemans banishment from england for a year with a positive order to return at the expiration of that time and complete his marriage with his cousin or to retire into private life and three hundred a year altogether and never see parent or brewery more mr henry foker went away then carrying with him that grief and care which passes free at the strictest customhouses and which proverbially accompanies the exile and with this crape over his eyes even the parisian boulevard looked melancholy to him and the sky of italy black to sir francis clavering that year was a most unfortunate one the events described in the last chapter came to complete the ruin of the year it was that year of grace in which as our sporting readers may remember lord harrowhills horse he was a classical young nobleman and named his stud out of the iliadwhen podasokus won the derby to the dismay of the knowing ones who pronounced the winning horses name in various extraordinary ways and who backed borax who was nowhere in the race sir francis clavering who was intimate with some of the most rascally characters of the turf and of course had valuable information had laid heavy odds against the winning horse and backed the favorite freely and the result of his dealings was as his son correctly stated to poor lady clavering a loss of seven thousand pounds indeed it was a cruel blow upon the lady who had discharged her husbands debts many times over who had received as many times his oaths and promises of amendment who had paid his moneylenders and horsedealers who had furnished his town and country houses and who was called upon now instantly to meet this enormous sum the penalty of her cowardly husbands extravagance it has been described in former pages how the elder pendennis had become the adviser of the clavering family and in his quality of intimate friend of the house had gone over every room of it and even seen that ugly closet which we all of us have and in which according to the proverb the family skeleton is locked up about the baronets pecuniary matters if the major did not know it was because clavering himself did not know them and hid them from himself and others in such a hopeless entanglement of lies that it was impossible for adviser or attorney or principal to get an accurate knowledge of his affairs but concerning lady clavering the major was much better informed and when the unlucky mishap of the derby arose he took upon himself to become completely and thoroughly acquainted with all her means whatsoever they where and was now accurately informed of the vast and repeated sacrifices which the widow amory had made in behalf of her present husband he did not concealand he had won no small favor from miss blanche by avowing ithis opinion that lady claverings daughter had been hardly treated at the expense of her son by her second marriage and in his conversations with lady clavering had fairly hinted that he thought miss blanche ought to have a better provision we have said that he had already given the widow to understand that he knew all the particulars of her early and unfortunate history having been in india at the time whenwhen the painful circumstances occurred which had ended in her parting from her first husband he could tell her where to find the calcutta newspaper which contained the account of amorys trial and he showed and the begum was not a little grateful to him for his forbearance how being aware all along of this mishap which had befallen her he had kept all knowledge of it to himself and been constantly the friend of her family interested motives my dear lady clavering he said of course i may have had we all have interested motives and mine i dont conceal from you was to make a marriage between my nephew and your daughter to which lady clavering perhaps with some surprise that the major should choose her family for a union with his own said she was quite willing to consent but frankly he said my dear lady my boy has but five hundred a year and a wife with ten thousand pounds to her fortune would scarcely better him we could do better for him than that permit me to say and he is a shrewd cautious young fellow who has sown his wild oats nowwho has very good parts and plenty of ambitionand whose object in marrying is to better himself if you and sir francis choseand sir francis take my word for it will refuse you nothingyou could put arthur in a way to advance very considerably in the world and show the stuff which he has in him of what use is that seat in parliament to clavering who scarcely ever shows his face in the house or speaks a word there im told by gentlemen who heard my boy at oxbridge that he was famous as an orator begadand once put his foot into the stirrup and mount him ive no doubt he wont be the last of the field maam ive tested the chap and know him pretty well i think he is much too lazy and careless and flighty a fellow to make a jogtrot journey and arrive as your lawyers do at the end of their lives but give him a start and good friends and an opportunity and take my word for it hell make himself a name that his sons shall be proud of i dont see any way for a fellow like him to parvenir but by making a prudent marriagenot with a beggerly heiressto sit down for life upon a miserable fifteen hundred a yearbut with somebody whom he can help and who can help him forward in the world and whom he can give a good name and a station in the country begad in return for the advantages which she brings him it would be better for you to have a distinguished soninlaw than to keep your husband on in parliament whos of no good to himself or to any body else there and thats i say why ive been interested about you and offer you what i think a good bargain for both you know i look upon arthur as one of the family almost now said the goodnatured begum he comes and goes when he likes and the more i think of his dear mother the more i see theres few people so goodnone so good to me and im sure i cried when i heard of her death and would have gone into mourning for her myself only black dont become me and i know who his mother wanted him to marry laura i meanwhom old lady rockminster has taken such a fancy to and no wonder shes a better girl than my girl i know both and my betsyblanche i meanaint been a comfort to me major its laura penn ought to marry marry on five hundred a year my dear good soul you are mad major pendennis said think over what i have said to you do nothing in your affairs with that unhappy husband of yours without consulting me and remember that old pendennis is always your friend for some time previous pens uncle had held similar language to miss amory he had pointed out to her the convenience of the match which he had at heart and was bound to say that mutual convenience was of all things the very best in the world to marry uponthe only thing look at your lovemarriages my dear young creature the lovematch people are the most notorious of all for quarreling afterward and a girl who runs away with jack to gretna green constantly runs away with tom to switzerland afterward the great point in marriage is for people to agree to be useful to one another the lady brings the means and the gentleman avails himself of them my boys wife brings the horse and begad pen goes in and wins the plate thats what i call a sensible union a couple like that have something to talk to each other about when they come together if you had cupid himself to talk toif blanche and pen were cupid and psyche begadtheyd begin to yawn after a few evenings if they had nothing but sentiment to speak on as for miss amory she was contented enough with pen as long as there was nobody better and how many other young ladies are like herand how many love marriages carry on well to the lastand how many sentimental firms do not finish in bankruptcyand how many heroic passions dont dwindle down into despicable indifference or end in shameful defeat these views of life and philosophy the major was constantly according to his custom inculcating to pen whose mind was such that he could see the right on both sides of many questions and comprehending the sentimental life which was quite out of the reach of the honest majors intelligence could understand the practical life too and accommodate himself or think he could accommodate himself to it so it came to pass that during the spring succeeding his mothers death he became a good deal under the influence of his uncles advice and domesticated in lady claverings house and in a measure was accepted by miss amory without being a suitor and was received without being engaged the young people were extremely familiar without being particularly sentimental and met and parted with each other in perfect goodhumor and i thought pendennis am the fellow who eight years ago had a grand passion and last year was raging in a fever about briseis yes it was the same pendennis and time had brought to him as to the rest of us its ordinary consequences consolations developments we alter very little when we talk of this man or that woman being no longer the same person whom we remember in youth and remark of course to deplore changes in our friends we dont perhaps calculate that circumstance only brings out the latent defect or quality and does not create it the selfish languor and indifference of todays possession is the consequence of the selfish ardor of yesterdays pursuit the scorn and weariness which cries vanitas vanitatum is but the lassitude of the sick appetite palled with pleasure the insolence of the successful parvenu is only the necessary continuance of the career of the needy struggler our mental changes are like our gray hairs or our wrinklesbut the fulfillment of the plan of mortal growth and decay that which is snowwhite now was glossy black once that which is sluggish obesity today was boisterous rosy health a few years back that calm weariness benevolent resigned and disappointed was ambition fierce and violent but a few years since and has only settled into submissive repose after many a battle and defeat lucky he who can bear his failure so generously and give up his broken sword to fate the conqueror with a manly and humble heart are you not awestricken you friendly reader who taking the page up for a moments light reading lay it down perchance for a graver reflectionto think how you who have consummated your success or your disaster may be holding marked station or a hopeless and nameless place in the crowds who have passed through how many struggles of defeat success crime remorse to yourself only knownwho may have loved and grown cold wept and laughed again how oftento think how you are the same you whom in childhood you remember before the voyage of life began it has been prosperous and you are riding into port the people huzzaing and the guns salutingand the lucky captain bows from the ships side and there is a care under the star on his breast which no body knows of or you are wrecked and lashed hopeless to a solitary spar out at seathe sinking man and the successful one are thinking each about home very likely and remembering the time when they were children alone on the hopeless spar drowning out of sight alone in the midst of the crowd applauding you chapter xxii conversations illustration our goodnatured begum was at first so much enraged at this last instance of her husbands duplicity and folly that she refused to give sir francis clavering any aid in order to meet his debts of honor and declared that she would separate from him and leave him to the consequences of his incorrigible weakness and waste after that fatal days transactions at the derby the unlucky gambler was in such a condition of mind that he was disposed to avoid every bodyalike his turfassociates with whom he had made debts which he trembled lest he should not have the means of paying and his wife his longsuffering banker on whom he reasonably doubted whether he should be allowed any longer to draw when lady clavering asked the next morning whether sir francis was in the house she received answer that he had not returned that night but had sent a messenger to his valet ordering him to forward clothes and letters by the bearer strong knew that he should have a visit or a message from him in the course of that or the subsequent day and accordingly got a note beseeching him to call upon his distracted friend f c at shorts hotel blackfriars and ask for mr francis there for the baronet was a gentleman of that peculiarity of mind that he would rather tell a lie than not and always began a contest with fortune by running away and hiding himself the boots of mr shorts establishment who carried claverings message to grosvenorplace and brought back his carpetbag was instantly aware who was the owner of the bag and he imparted his information to the footman who was laying the breakfasttable who carried down the news to the servants hall who took it to mrs bonner my ladys housekeeper and confidential maid who carried it to my lady and thus every single person in the grosvenorplace establishment knew that sir francis was in hiding under the name of francis at an inn in the blackfriarsroad and sir franciss coachman told the news to other gentlemens coachmen who carried it to their masters and to the neighboring tattersalls where very gloomy anticipations were formed that sir francis clavering was about to make a tour in the levant in the course of that day the number of letters addressed to sir francis clavering bart which found their way to his hall table was quite remarkable the french cook sent in his account to my lady the tradesmen who supplied her ladyships table and messrs finer and gimcrack the mercers and ornamental dealers and madame crinoline the eminent milliner also forwarded their little bills to her ladyship in company with miss amorys private and by no means inconsiderable account at each establishment in the afternoon of the day after the derby when strong after a colloquy with his principal at shorts hotel whom he found crying and drinking curacoa called to transact business according to his custom at grosvenorplace he found all these suspicious documents ranged in the baronets study and began to open them and examine them with a rueful countenance mrs bonner my ladys maid and housekeeper came down upon him while engaged in this occupation mrs bonner a part of the family and as necessary to her mistress as the chevalier was to sir francis was of course on lady claverings side in the dispute between her and her husband and as by duty bound even more angry than her ladyship herself she wont pay if she takes my advice mrs bonner said youll please to go back to sir francis captainand he lurking about in a low publichouse and dont dare to face his wife like a manand say that we wont pay his debts no longer we made a man of him we took him out of jail and other folks too perhaps weve paid his debts over and over againwe set him up in parliament and gave him a house in town and country and where he dont dare to show his face the shabby sneak weve given him the horse he rides and the dinner he eats and the very clothes he has on his back and we will give him no more our fortune such as is left of it is left to ourselves and we wont waste any more of it on this ungrateful man well give him enough to live upon and leave him thats what well do and thats what you may tell him from susan bonner susan bonners mistress hearing of strongs arrival sent for him at this juncture and the chevalier went up to her ladyship not without hopes that he should find her more tractable than her factotum mrs bonner many a time before had he pleaded his clients cause with lady clavering and caused her goodnature to relent he tried again once more he painted in dismal colors the situation in which he had found sir francis and would not answer for any consequences which might ensue if he could not find means of meeting his engagements kill hisself laughed mrs bonner kill hisself will he dyings the best thing he could do strong vowed that he had found him with the razors on the table but at this in her turn lady clavering laughed bitterly hell do himself no harm as long as theres a shilling left of which he can rob a poor woman his lifes quite safe captain you may depend upon that ah it was a bad day that ever i set eyes on him hes worse than the first man cried out my ladys aiddecamp he was a man he wasa wild devil but he had the courage of a manwhereas this fellowwhats the use of my lady paying his bills and selling her diamonds and forgiving him hell be as bad again next year the very next chance he has hell be a cheating of her and robbing of her and her money will go to keep a pack of rogues and swindlersi dont mean you captainyouve been a good friend to us enough bating we wish wed never set eyes on you the chevalier saw from the words which mrs bonner had let slip regarding the diamonds that the kind begum was disposed to relent once more at least and that there were hopes still for his principal upon my word maam he said with a real feeling of sympathy for lady claverings troubles and admiration for her untiring goodnature and with a show of enthusiasm which advanced not a little his graceless patrons causeany thing you say against clavering or mrs bonner here cries out against me is no better than we deserve both of us and it was an unlucky day for you when you saw either he has behaved cruelly to you and if you were not the most generous and forgiving woman in the world i know there would be no chance for him but you cant let the father of your son be a disgraced man and send little frank into the world with such a stain upon him tie him down bind him by any promises you like i vouch for him that he will subscribe them and break em said mrs bonner and keep em this time cried out strong he must keep them if you could have seen how he

its dreadful he dont think much of making my dear missus cry said mrs bonnerpoor dear soullook if he does captain if youve the soul of a man clavering strong said to his principal when he recounted this scene to him youll keep your promise this time and so help me heaven if you break word with her ill turn against you and tell all what all cried mr francis to whom his embassador brought the news back at shorts hotel where strong found the baronet crying and drinking curacoa psha do you suppose i am a fool burst out strong do you suppose i could have lived so long in the world frank clavering with out having my eyes about me you know i have but to speak and you are a beggar tomorrow and i am not the only man who knows your secret who else does gasped clavering old pendennis does or i am very much mistaken he recognized the man the first night he saw him when he came drunk into your house he knows it does he shrieked out clavering damn himkill him youd like to kill us all wouldnt you old boy said strong with a sneer puffing his cigar the baronet dashed his weak hand against his forehead perhaps the other had interpreted his wish rightly oh strong he cried if i dared id put an end to myself for im the dest miserable dog in all england its that that makes me so wild and reckless its that which makes me take to drink and he drank with a trembling hand a bumper of his fortifierthe curacoa and to live about with these thieves i know theyre thieves every one of em dd thieves andand how can i help itand i didnt know it you knowand by gad im innocentand until i saw the dd scoundrel first i knew no more about it than the deadand ill fly and ill go abroad out of the reach of the confounded hells and ill bury myself in a forest by gad and hang myself up to a treeand ohim the most miserable beggar in all england and so with more tears shrieks and curses the impotent wretch vented his grief and deplored his unhappy fate and in the midst of groans and despair and blasphemy vowed his miserable repentance the honored proverb which declares that to be an ill wind which blows good to nobody was verified in the case of sir francis clavering and another of the occupants of mr strongs chambers in shepherds inn the man was good by a lucky hap with whom colonel altamont made his bet and on the settling day of the derbyas captain clinker who was appointed to settle sir francis claverings book for him for lady clavering by the advice of major pendennis would not allow the baronet to liquidate his own money transactions paid over the notes to the baronets many creditorscolonel altamont had the satisfaction of receiving the odds of thirty to one in fifties which he had taken against the winning horse of the day numbers of the colonels friends were present on the occasion to congratulate him on his luckall altamonts own set and the gents who met in the private parlor of the convivial wheeler my host of the harlequins head came to witness their comrades good fortune and would have liked with a generous sympathy for success to share in it now was the time tom driver had suggested to the colonel to have up the specie ship that was sunk in the gulf of mexico with the three hundred and eighty thousand dollars on board besides bars and doubloons the tredyddlums were very lowto be bought for an old songnever was such an opportunity for buying shares mr keightley insinuated and jack holt pressed forward his tobaccosmuggling scheme the audacity of which pleased the colonel more than any other of the speculations proposed to him then of the harlequins head boys there was jack hackstraw who knew of a pair of horses which the colonel must buy tom fleet whose satirical paper the swell wanted but two hundred pounds of capital to be worth a thousand a year to any manwith such a power and influence colonel you rogue and the entree of all the greenrooms in london tom urged while little moss abrams entreated the colonel not to listen to these absurd fellows with their humbugging speculations but to invest his money in some good bills which moss could get for him and which would return him fifty per cent as safe as the bank of england each and all of these worthies came round the colonel with their various blandishments but he had courage enough to resist them and to button up his notes in the pocket of his coat and go home to strong and sport the outer door of the chambers honest strong had given his fellowlodger good advice about all his acquaintances and though when pressed he did not mind frankly taking twenty pounds himself out of the colonels winnings strong was a great deal too upright to let others cheat him he was not a bad fellow when in good fortune this altamont he ordered a smart livery for grady and made poor old costigan shed tears of quickly dried gratitude by giving him a fivepound note after a snug dinner at the backkitchen and he bought a green shawl for mrs bolton and a yellow one for fanny the most brilliant sacrifices of a regentstreet haberdashers window and a short time after this upon her birthday which happened in the month of june miss amory received from a friend a parcel containing an enormous brassinlaid writingdesk in which there was a set of amethysts the most hideous eyes ever looked upona musical snuffbox and two keepsakes of the year before last and accompanied with a couple of gownpieces of the most astounding colors the receipt of which goods made the sylphide laugh and wonder immoderately now it is a fact that colonel altamont had made a purchase of cigars and french silks from some duffers in fleetstreet about this period and he was found by strong in the open auctionroom in cheapside having invested some money in two desks several pairs of richlyplated candlesticks a dinner epergne and a bagatelleboard the dinner epergne remained at chambers and figured at the banquets there which the colonel gave pretty freely it seemed beautiful in his eyes until jack holt said it looked as if it had been taken in a bill and jack holt certainly knew the dinners were pretty frequent at chambers and sir francis clavering condescended to partake of them constantly his own house was shut up the successor of mirobolant who had sent in his bills so prematurely was dismissed by the indignant lady clavering the luxuriance of the establishment was greatly pruned and reduced one of the large footmen was cashiered upon which the other gave warning not liking to serve without his mate or in a family where ony one footman was kep general and severe economical reforms were practiced by the begum in her whole household in consequence of the extravagance of which her graceless husband had been guilty the major as her ladyships friend strong on the part of poor clavering her ladyships lawyer and the honest begum herself executed these reforms with promptitude and severity after paying the baronets debts the settlement of which occasioned considerable public scandal and caused the baronet to sink even lower in the worlds estimation than he had been before lady clavering quitted london for tunbridge wells in high dudgeon refusing to see her reprobate husband whom nobody pitied clavering remained in london patiently by no means anxious to meet his wifes just indignation and sneaked in and out of the house of commons whence he and captain raff and mr marker would go to have a game at billiards and a cigar or showed in the sporting publichouses or might be seen lurking about lincolns inn and his lawyers where the principals kept him for hours waiting and the clerks winked at each other as he sat in their office no wonder that he relished the dinners at shepherds inn and was perfectly resigned there resigned he was so happy nowhere else he was wretched among his equals who scorned him but here he was the chief guest at the table where they continually addressed him with yes sir francis and no sir francis where he told his wretched jokes and where he quavered his dreary little french song after strong had sung his jovial chorus and honest costigan had piped his irish ditties such a jolly menage as strongs with gradys irish stew and the chevaliers brew of punch after dinner would have been welcome to many a better man than clavering the solitude of whose great house at home frightened him where he was attended only by the old woman who kept the house and his valet who sneered at him yes dammit said he to his friends in shepherds inn that fellow of mine i must turn him away only i owe him two years wages curse him and cant ask my lady he brings me my tea cold of a morning with a demd leaden teaspoon and he says my ladys sent all the plate to the bankers because it aint safe now aint it hard that she wont trust me with a single teaspoonaint it ungentlemanlike altamont you know my ladys of low birththat isi beg your pardonhemthat is its most cruel of her not to show more confidence in me and the very servants begin to laughthe dam scoundrels ill break every bone in their great hulking bodies curse em i will they dont answer my bell andand my man was at vauxhall last night with one of my dress shirts and my velvet waistcoat on i know it was minethe confounded impudent blackguardand he went on dancing before my eyes confound him im sure hell live to be hangedhe deserves to be hangedall those infernal rascals of valets he was very kind to altamont now he listened to the colonels loud stories when altamont described howwhen he was working his way home once from new zealand where he had been on a whaling expeditionhe and his comrades had been obliged to shirk on board at night to escape from their wives by joveand how the poor devils put out in their canoes when they saw the ship under sail and paddled madly after her how he had been lost in the bush once for three months in new south wales when he was there once on a trading speculation how he had seen boney at saint helena and been presented to him with the rest of the officers of the indiaman of which he was a mateto all these tales and over his cups altamont told many of them and it must be owned lied and bragged a great deal sir francis now listened with great attention making a point of drinking wine with altamont at dinner and of treating him with every distinction leave him alone i know what hes acoming to altamont said laughing to strong who remonstrated with him and leave me alone i know what im atelling very well i was officer on board an indiaman so i was i traded to new south wales so i did in a ship of my own and lost her i became officer to the nawaub so i did only me and my royal master have had a difference strongthats it whos the better or the worse for what i tell or knows any thing

goodhumoredly youre right old boy he said you always keep your head cool you doand when i begin to talk too muchi say when i begin to pitch i authorize you and order you and command you to put away the rumbottle take my counsel altamont strong said gravely and mind how you deal with that man dont make it too much his interest to get rid of you or who knows what he may do the event for which with cynical enjoyment altamont had been on the lookout came very speedily one day strong being absent upon an errand for his principal sir francis made his appearance in the chambers and found the envoy of the nawaub alone he abused the world in general for being heartless and unkind to him he abused his wife for being ungenerous to him he abused strong for being ungratefulhundreds of pounds had he given ned strongbeen his friend for life and kept him out of jail by joveand now ned was taking her ladyships side against him and abetting her in her infernal unkind treatment of him theyve entered into a conspiracy to keep me penniless altamont the baronet said they dont give me as much pocketmoney as frank has at school why dont you go down to richmond and borrow of him clavering altamont broke out with a savage laugh he wouldnt see his poor old beggar of a father without pocketmoney would he i tell you ive been obliged to humiliate myself cruelly clavering said look here sirlook here at these pawntickets fancy a member of parliament and an old english baronet by gad obliged to put a drawingroom clock and a buhl inkstand up the spout and a gold ducks head paperholder that i dare

confounded scoundrel cry a little dont mind cryin before meitll relieve you clavering the other said why i say old feller what a happy feller i once thought you and what a miserable son of a gun you really are its a shame that they treat me so aint it clavering went onfor though ordinarily silent and apathetic about his own griefs the baronet could whine for an hour at a time andand by gad sir i havent got the money to pay the very cab thats waiting for me at the door and the porteress that mrs bolton lent me three shillins and i dont like to ask her for any more and i asked that dd old costigan the confounded old penniless irish miscreant and he hadnt got a shillin the beggar and campions out of town or else hed do a little bill for me i know he would i thought you swore on your

intend to touch the confounded black and red and by that time my lady as you call her jimmy i used to saywill have come round again and youll be ready for me you know and come down handsomely to yours truly at this juncture of their conversation strong returned nor did the baronet care much about prolonging the talk having got the money and he made his way from shepherds inn and went home and bullied his servant in a manner so unusually brisk and insolent that the man concluded his master must have pawned some more of the house furniture or at any rate have come into possession of some ready money and yet ive looked over the house morgan and i dont think he has took any more of the things sir franciss valet said to major pendenniss man as they met at their club soon after my lady locked up amost all the befews afore she went away and he couldnt take away the picters and lookingglasses in a cab and he wouldnt spout the fenders and fireironshe aint so bad as that but hes got

to give him the notes down to pay his liabilities after the race only your governor said which he wrote it on a piece of paper and passed it across the table to the lawyer and my lady that some one else had better book up for him for hed have kep some of the money hes a sly old cove your govnor the expression of old cove thus flippantly applied by the younger gentleman to himself and his master displeased mr morgan exceedingly on the first occasion when mr lightfoot used the obnoxious expression his comrades anger was only indicated by a silent frown but on the second offense morgan who was smoking his cigar elegantly and holding it on the tip of his penknife withdrew the cigar from his lips and took his young friend to task dont call major pendennis an old cove if youll ave the goodness lightfoot and dont call me an old cove nether such words aint used in society and we have lived in the fust society both at ome and foring weve been intimate with the fust statesmen of europe when we go abroad we dine with prince metternitch and louy philup reglar we go here to the best houses the tiptops i tell you we ride with lord john and the noble whycount at the edd of foring affairs we dine with the earl of burgrave and are consulted by the marquis of steyne in every think we ought to know a thing or two mr lightfoot youre a young man im an old cove as you say weve both seen the world and we both know that it aint money nor bein a baronet nor avin a town and country ouse nor a paltry five or six thousand a year its ten mr morgan cried mr lightfoot with great animation it may have been sir morgan said with calm severity it may have been mr lightfoot but it aint six now nor five sir its been doosedly dipped and cut into sir by the confounded extravygance of your master with his helbowshakin and his bill discountin and his cottage in the regency park and his many wickednesses hes a bad un mr lightfoota bad lot sir and that you know and it aint money sirnot such money as that

they would have blackballed you without me as sure as your name is frederic i know they would mr morgan said the other with much humility well then dont call me an old cove sir it aint gentlemanlike frederic lightfoot which i knew you when you was a cabboy and when your father was in trouble and got you the place you have now when the frenchman went away and if you think sir that because youre making up to mrs bonner who may have saved her two thousand poundand i dare say she has in fiveandtwenty years as she have lived confidential maid to lady claveringyet sir you must remember who put

pounds a good bit you see mr morgan and well get the clavering arms for a very little and thatll be no bad thing when the railroad runs through clavering and when we are there i hope youll come and see us mr morgan its a stoopid place and no society said mr morgan i know it well in mrs pendenniss time we used to go down reglar and the hair refreshed me after the london racket the railroad will improve mr arthurs property remarked lightfoot whats about the figure of it should you say sir under fifteen hundred sir answered morgan at which the other who knew the extent of poor arthurs acres thrust his tongue in his cheek but remained wisely silent is his man any good mr morgan lightfoot resumed pigeon aint used to society as yet but hes young and has good talents and has read a good deal and i dessay he will do very well replied morgan he wouldnt quite do for this kind of thing lightfoot for he aint seen the world yet when the pint of sherry for which mr lightfoot called upon mr morgans announcement that he declined to drink spirits had been discussed by the two gentlemen who held the wine up to the light and smacked their lips and winked their eyes at it and rallied the landlord as to the vintage in the most approved manner of connoisseurs morgans ruffled equanimity was quite restored and he was prepared to treat his young friend with perfect goodhumor what dyou think about miss amory lightfoottell us in confidence nowdo you think we should do wellyou understandif we make miss a into mrs a p comprendy vous she and her mas always quarrelin said mr lightfoot bonner is more than a match for the old lady and treats sir francis like thatlike this year spill which i fling into the grate but she darent say a word to miss amory no more dare none of us when a visitor comes in she smiles and languishes youd think that butter wouldnt melt in her mouth and the minute he is gone very likely she flares up like a little demon and says things fit to send you wild if mr arthur comes its do lets sing that there delightful song or come and write me them pooty verses in this halbum and very likely shes been a rilin her mother or sticking pins into her maid a minute before she do stick pins into her and pinch her mary hann showed me one of her arms quite black and blue and i recklect mrs bonner whos as jealous of me as a old cat boxed her ears for showing me and then you should see miss at luncheon when theres nobody but the family she makes bleave she never eats and my you should only jest see her she has mary hann to bring her up plumcakes and creams into her bedroom and the cooks the only man in the house shes civil to bonner says how the second season in london mr soppington was agoin to propose for her and actially came one day and sor her fling a book into the fire and scold her mother so that he went down softly by the back droringroom door which he came in by and next thing we heard of him was he was married to miss rider oh shes a devil that little blanche and thats my candig apinium mr morgan apinion not apinium lightfoot my good fellow mr morgan said with parental kindness and then asked of his own bosom with a sigh why the deuce does my governor want master arthur to marry such a girl as this and the teteatete of the two gentlemen was broken up by the entry of other gentlemen members of the clubwhen fashionable towntalk politics cribbage and other amusements ensued and the conversation became general the gentlemans club was held in the parlor of the wheel of fortune publichouse in a snug little bylane leading out of one of the great streets of may fair and frequented by some of the most select gentlemen about town their masters affairs debts intrigues adventures their ladies good and bad qualities and quarrels with their husbands all the family secrets were here discussed with perfect freedom and confidence and here when about to enter into a new situation a gentleman was enabled to get every requisite information regarding the family of which he proposed to become a member liveries it may be imagined were excluded from this select precinct and the powdered heads of the largest metropolitan footmen might bow down in vain entreating admission into the gentlemans club these outcast giants in plush took their beer in an outer apartment of the wheel of fortune and could no more get an entry into the club room than a pall mall tradesman or a lincolns inn attorney could get admission into bays or spratts and it is because the conversation which we have been permitted to overhear here in some measure explains the characters and bearings of our story that we have ventured to introduce the reader into a society so exclusive chapter xxiii the way of the world illustration a short time after the piece of good fortune which befel colonel altamont at epsom that gentleman put into execution his projected foreign tour and the chronicler of the polite world who goes down to londonbridge for the purpose of taking leave of the people of fashion who quit this country announced that among the company on board the soho to antwerp last saturday were sir robert lady and the misses hodge mr sergeant kewsy and mrs and miss kewsy colonel altamont major coddy c the colonel traveled in state and as became a gentleman he appeared in a rich traveling costume he drank brandyandwater freely during the passage and was not sick as some of the other passengers were and he was attended by his body servant the faithful irish legionary who had been for some time in waiting upon himself and captain strong in their chambers of shepherds inn the chevalier partook of a copious dinner at blackwall with his departing friend the colonel and one or two others who drank many healths to altamont at that liberal gentlemans expense strong old boy the chevaliers worthy chum said if you want a little money nows your time im your man youre a good feller and have been a good feller to me and a twenty pound note more or less will make no odds to me but strong said no he didnt want any money he was flush quite flushthat is not flush enough to pay you back your last loan altamont but quite able to carry on for some time to comeand so with a not uncordial greeting between them the two parted had the possession of money really made altamont more honest and amiable than he had hitherto been or only caused him to seem more amiable in strongs eyes perhaps he really was better and money improved him perhaps it was the beauty of wealth strong saw and respected but he argued within himself this poor devil this unlucky outcast of a returned convict is ten times as good a fellow as my friend sir francis clavering bart he has pluck and honesty in his way he will stick to a friend and face an enemy the other never had courage to do either and what is it that has put the poor devil under a cloud he was only a little wild and signed his fatherinlaws name many a man has done worse and come to no wrong and holds his head up clavering does no he dont hold his head up he never did in his best days and strong perhaps repented him of the falsehood which he had told to the freehanded colonel that he was not in want of money but it was a falsehood on the side of honesty and the chevalier could not bring down his stomach to borrow a second time from his outlawed friend besides he could get on clavering had promised him some not that claverings promises were much to be believed but the chevalier was of a hopeful turn and trusted in many chances of catching his patron and waylaying some of those stray remittances and supplies in the procuring of which for his principal lay mr strongs chief business he had grumbled about altamonts companionship in the shepherds inn chambers but he found those lodgings more glum now without his partner than with him the solitary life was not agreeable to his social soul and he had got into extravagant and luxurious habits too having a servant at his command to run his errands to arrange his toilet and to cook his meal it was rather a grand and touching sight now to see the portly and handsome gentleman painting his own boots and broiling his own mutton chop it has been before stated that the chevalier had a wife a spanish lady of vittoria who had gone back to her friends after a few months union with the captain whose head she broke with a dish he began to think whether he should not go back and see his juanita the chevalier was growing melancholy after the departure of his friend the colonel or to use his own picturesque expression was down on his luck these moments of depression and intervals of illfortune occur constantly in the lives of heroes marius at minturnae charles edward in the highlands napoleon before elba what great man has not been called upon to face evil fortune from clavering no supplies were to be had for some time the fiveandtwenty pounds or pony which the exemplary baronet had received from mr altamont had fled out of claverings keeping as swiftly as many previous ponies he had been down the river with a choice party of sporting gents who dodged the police and landed in essex where they put up billy bluck to fight dick the cabman whom the baronet backed and who had it all his own way for thirteen rounds when by an unluckly blow in the windpipe billy killed him its always my luck strong sir francis said the betting was three to one on the cabman and i thought myself as sure of thirty pounds as if i had it in my pocket and dammy i owe my man lightfoot fourteen pound now which hes lent and paid for me and he duns methe confounded impudent blackguard and i wish to heaven i knew any way of getting a bill done or of screwing a little out of my lady ill give you half ned upon my soul and honor ill give you half if you can get any body to do us a little fifty illustration but ned said sternly that he had given his word of honor as a gentleman that he would be no party to any future billtransactions in which her husband might engage who had given his word of honor too and the chevalier said that he at least would keep his word and would black his own boots all his life rather than break his promise and what is more he vowed he would advise lady clavering that sir francis was about to break his faith toward her upon the very first hint which he could get that such was claverings intention upon this information sir francis clavering according to his custom cried and cursed very volubly he spoke of death as his only resource he besought and implored his dear strong his best friend his dear old ned not to throw him over and when he quitted his dearest ned as he went down the stairs of shepherds inn swore and blasphemed at ned as the most infernal villain and traitor and blackguard and coward under the sun and wished ned was in his grave and in a worse place only he would like the confounded ruffian to live until frank clavering had had his revenge out of him in strongs chambers the baronet met a gentleman whose visits were now as it has been shown very frequent in shepherds inn mr samuel huxter of clavering that young fellow who had poached the walnuts in clavering park in his youth and had seen the baronet drive through the street at home with four horses and prance up to church with powdered footmen had an immense respect for his member and a prodigious delight in making his acquaintance he introduced himself with much blushing and trepidation as a clavering manson of mr huxter of the marketplacefather attended sir franciss keeper coxwood when his gun burst and took off three fingersproud to make sir franciss acquaintance all of which introduction sir francis received affably and honest huxter talked about sir francis to the chaps at bartholomews and told fanny in the lodge that after all there was nothing like a thoroughbred un a regular good old english gentleman one of the olden time to which fanny replied that she thought sir francis was an ojous creatureshe didnt know whybut she couldnt abear himshe was sure he was wicked and low and meanshe knew he was and when sam to this replied that sir francis was very affable and had borrowed half a sov of him quite kindly fanny burst into a laugh pulled sams long hair which was not yet of irreproachable cleanliness patted his chin and called him a stoopid stoopid old foolish stoopid and said that sir francis was always borrering money of every body and that mar had actially refused him twice and had to wait three months to get seven shillings which he had borrered of er dont say er but her borrer but borrow actially but actually fanny mr huxter repliednot to a fault in her argument but to grammatical errors in her statement well then her and borrow and hactuallythere then you stoopid said the other and the scholar made such a pretty face that the grammar master was quickly appeased and would have willingly given her a hundred more lessons on the spot at the price which he took for that one of course mrs bolton was by and i suppose that fanny and mr sam were on exceedingly familiar and confidential terms by this time and that time had brought to the former certain consolations and soothed certain regrets which are deucedly bitter when they occur but which are no more than toothpulling or any other pang eternal as you sit surrounded by respect and affection happy honored and flattered in your old age your foibles gently indulged your least words kindly cherished your garrulous old stories received for the hundredth time with dutiful forbearance and neverfailing hypocritical smiles the women of your house constant in their flatteries the young men hushed and attentive when you begin to speak the servants awestricken the tenants cap in hand and ready to act in the place of your worships horses when your honor takes a driveit has often struck you o thoughtful dives that this respect and these glories are for the main part transferred with your feesimple to your successorthat the servants will bow and the tenants shout for your son as for you that the butler will fetch him the wine improved by a little keeping thats now in your cellar and that when your night is come and the light of your life is gone down as sure as the morning rises after you and without you the sun of prosperity and flattery shines on your heir men come and bask in the halo of consols and acres that beams round about him the reverence is transferred with the estate of which with all its advantages pleasures respect and goodwill he in turn becomes the lifetenant how long do you wish or expect that your people will regret you how much time does a man devote to grief before he begins to enjoy a great man must keep his heir at his feast like a living memento mori if he holds very much by life the presence of the other must be a constant sting and warning make ready to go says the successor to your honor i am waiting and i could hold it as well as you what has this reference to the possible reader to do with any of the characters of this history do we wish to apologize for pen because he has got a white hat and because his mourning for his mother is fainter all the lapse of years all the career of fortune all the events of life however strongly they may move or eagerly excite him never can remove that sainted image from his heart or banish that blessed love from its sanctuary if he yields to wrong the dear eyes will look sadly upon him when he dares to meet them if he does well endures pain or conquers temptation the ever present love will greet him he knows with approval and pity if he falls plead for him if he suffers cheer himbe with him and accompany him always until death is past and sorrow and sin are no more is this mere dreaming or on the part of an idle storyteller useless moralizing may not the man of the world take his moment too to be grave and thoughtful ask of your own hearts and memories brother and sister if we do not live in the dead and to speak reverently prove god by love of these matters pen and warrington often spoke in many a solemn and friendly converse in after days and pendenniss mother was worshiped in his memory and canonized there as such a saint ought to be lucky he in life who knows a few such women a kind provision of heaven it was that sent us such and gave us to admire that touching and wonderful spectacle of innocence and love and beauty but as it is certain that if in the course of these sentimental conversations any outer stranger major pendennis for instance had walked into pens chambers arthur and warrington would have stopped their talk and chosen another subject and discoursed about the opera or the last debate in parliament or miss joness marriage with captain smith or what notso let us imagine that the public steps in at this juncture and stops the confidential talk between author and reader and begs us to resume our remarks about this world with which both are certainly better acquainted than with that other one into which we have just been peeping on coming into his property arthur pendennis at first comported himself with a modesty and equanimity which obtained his friend warringtons praises though arthurs uncle was a little inclined to quarrel with his nephews meanness of spirit for not assuming greater state and pretensions now that he had entered on the enjoyment of his kingdom he would have had arthur installed in handsome quarters and riding on showy park hacks or in wellbuilt cabriolets every day i am too absent arthur said with a laugh to drive a cab in london the omnibuses would cut me in two or i should send my horses head into the ladies carriage windows and you wouldnt have me driven about by my servant like an apothecary uncle no major pendennis would on no account have his nephew appear like an apothecary the august representative of the house of pendennis must not so demean himself and when arthur pursuing his banter said and yet i daresay sir my father was proud enough when he first set up his gig the old major hemmed and had and his wrinkled face reddened with a blush as he answered you know what bonaparte said sir il faut laver son linge sale en famille there is no need sir for you to brag that your father was aa medical man he came of a most ancient but fallen house and was obliged to reconstruct the family fortunes as many a man of good family has done before him you are like the fellow in sterne sirthe marquis who came to demand his sword again your father got back yours for you you are a man of landed estate by gad sir and a gentlemannever forget you are a gentleman then arthur slily turned on his uncle the argument which he had heard the old gentleman often use regarding himself in the society which i have the honor of frequenting through your introduction who cares to ask about my paltry means or my humble gentility uncle he asked it would be absurd of me to attempt to compete with the great folks and all that thay can ask from us is that we should have a decent address and good manners but for all that sir i should belong to a better club or two the uncle answered i should give an occasional dinner and select my society well and i should come out of that horrible garret in the temple sir and so arthur compromised by descending to the second floor in lambcourt warrington still occupying his old quarters and the two friends being determined not to part one from the other cultivate kindly reader those friendships of your youth it is only in that generous time that they are formed how different the intimacies of after days are and how much weaker the grasp of your own hand after it has been shaken about in twenty years commerce with the world and has squeezed and dropped a thousand equally careless palms as you can seldom fashion your tongue to speak a new language after twenty the heart refuses to receive friendship pretty soon it gets too hard to yield to the impression so pen had many acquaintances and being of a jovial and easy turn got more daily but no friend like warrington and the two men continued to live almost as much in common as the knights of the temple riding upon one horse for pens was at warringtons service and having their chambers and their servitor in common mr warrington had made the acquaintance of pens friends of grosvenorplace during their last unlucky season in london and had expressed himself no better satisfied with sir francis and lady clavering and her ladyships daughter than was the public in general the world is right george said about those people the young men laugh and talk freely before those ladies and about them the girl sees people whom she has no right to know and talks to men with whom no girl should have an intimacy did you see those two reprobates leaning over lady claverings carriage in the park the other day and leering under miss blanches bonnet no good mother would let her daughter know those men or admit them within her doors the begum is the most innocent and goodnatured soul alive interposed pen she never heard any harm of captain blackball or read that trial in which charley lovelace figures do you suppose that honest ladies read and remember the chronique scandaleuse as well as you you old grumbler would you like laura bell to know those fellows warrington asked his face turning rather red would you let any woman you loved be contaminated by their company i have no doubt that poor begum is ignorant of their histories it seems to me she is ignorant of a great number of better things it seems to me that your honest begum is not a lady pen it is not her fault doubtless that she has not had the education or learned the refinements of a lady she is as moral as lady portsea who has all the world at her balls and as refined as mrs bull who breaks the kings english and has halfadozen dukes at her table pen answered rather sulkily why should you and i be more squeamish than the rest of the world why are we to visit the sins of her fathers on this harmless kind creature she never did any thing but kindness to you or any mortal soul as far as she knows she does her best she does not set up to be more than she is she gives you the best dinners she can buy and the best company she can get she pays the debts of that scamp of a husband of hers she spoils her boy like the most virtuous mother in england her opinion about literary matters to be sure is not much and i daresay she never read a line of wordsworth or heard of tennyson in her life no more has mrs flanagan the laundress growled out pens mentor no more has betty the housemaid and i have no word of blame against them but a highsouled man doesnt make friends of these a gentleman doesnt choose these for his companions or bitterly rues it afterward if he do are you who are setting up to be a man of the world and philosopher to tell me that the aim of life is to guttle three courses and dine off silver do you dare to own to yourself that your ambition in life is good claret and that youll dine with any provided you get a stalled ox to feed on you call me a cynicwhy what a monstrous cynicism it is which you and the rest of you men of the world admit id rather live upon raw turnips and sleep in a hollow tree or turn backwoodsman or savage than degrade myself to this civilization and own that a french cook was the thing in life best worth living for because you like a raw beefsteak and a pipe afterward broke out pen you give yourself airs of superiority over people whose tastes are more dainty and are not ashamed of the world they live in who goes about professing particular admiration or esteem or friendship or gratitude even for the people one meets every day if a asks me to his house and gives me his best i take his good things for what they are worth and no more i do not profess to pay him back in friendship but in the conventions money of society when we part we part without any grief when we meet we are tolerably glad to see one another if i were only to live with my friends your black muzzle old george is the only face i should see you are your uncles pupil said warrington rather sadly and you speak like a worldling and why not asked pendennis why not acknowledge the world i stand upon and submit to the conditions of the society which we live in and live by i am older than you george in spite of your grizzled whiskers and have seen much more of the world than you have in your garret here shut up with your books and your reveries and your ideas of oneandtwenty i say i take the world as it is and being of it will not be ashamed of it if the time is out of joint have i any calling or strength to set it right indeed i dont think you have much of either growled pens interlocutor if i doubt whether i am better than my neighbor arthur continuedif i concede that i am no betteri also doubt whether he is better than i i see men who begin with ideas of universal reform and who before their beards are grown propound their loud plans for the regeneration of mankind give up their schemes after a few years of bootless talking and vainglorious attempts to lead their fellows and after they have found that men will no longer hear them as indeed they never were in the least worthy to be heard sink quietly into the rank and fileacknowledging their aims impracticable or thankful that they were never put into practice the fiercest reformers grow calm and are fain to put up with things as they are the loudest radical orators become dumb quiescent placemen the most fervent liberals when out of power become humdrum conservatives or downright tyrants or despots in office look at thiers look at guizot in opposition and in place look at the whigs appealing to the country and the whigs in power would you say that the conduct of these men is an act of treason as the radicals bawlwho would give way in their turn were their turn ever to come no only that they submit to circumstances which are stronger than theymarch as the world marches toward reform but at the worlds pace and the movements of the vast body of mankind must needs be slowforego this scheme as impracticable on account of oppositionthat as immature because against the sense of the majorityare forced to calculate drawbacks and difficulties as well as to think of reforms and advancesand compelled finally to submit and to wait and to compromise the right honorable arthur pendennis could not speak better or be more satisfied with himself if he was first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer warrington said selfsatisfied why selfsatisfied continued pen it seems to me that my skepticism is more respectful and more modest than the revolutionary ardor of other folks many a patriot of eighteen many a spoutingclub orator would turn the bishops out of the house of lords tomorrow and throw the lords out after the bishops and throw the throne into the thames after the peers and the bench is that man more modest than i who take these institutions as i find them and wait for time and truth to develop or fortify or if you like destroy them a college tutor or a noblemans toady who appears one fine day as my right reverend lord in a silk apron and a shovelhat and assumes benedictory airs over me is still the same man we remember at oxbridge when he was truckling to the tufts and bullying the poor undergraduates in the lectureroom an hereditary legislator who passes his time with jockeys and blacklegs and balletgirls and who is called to rule over me and his other betters because his grandfather made a lucky speculation in the funds or found a coal or tinmine on his property or because his stupid ancestor happened to be in command of ten thousand men as brave as himself who overcame twelve thousand frenchmen or fifty thousand indianssuch a man i say inspires me with no more respect than the bitterest democrat can feel toward him but such as he is he is a part of the old society to which we belong and i submit to his lordship with acquiescence and he takes his place above the best of us at all dinner parties and there bides his time i dont want to chop his head off with a guillotine or to fling mud at him in the streets when they call such a man a disgrace to his order and such another who is good and gentle refined and generous who employs his great means in promoting every kindness and charity and art and grace of life in the kindest and most gracious manner an ornament to his rankthe question as to the use and propriety of the order is not in the least affected one way or other there it is extant among us a part of our habits the creed of many of us the growth of centuries the symbol of a most complicated traditionthere stand my lord the bishop and my lord the hereditary legislatorwhat the french call transactions both of themrepresenting in their present shape mailclad barons and doublesworded chiefs from whom their lordships the hereditaries for the most part dont descend and priests professing to hold an absolute truth and a divinely inherited power the which truth absolute our ancestors burned at the stake and denied there the which divine transmissible power still exists in printto be believed or not pretty much at choice and of these i say i acquiesce that they exist and no more if you say that these schemes devised before printing was known or steam was born when thought was an infant scared and whipped and truth under its guardians was gagged and swathed and blindfolded and not allowed to lift its voice or to look out or to walk under the sun before men were permitted to meet or to trade or to speak with each otherif any one says as some faithful souls do that these schemes are for ever and having been changed and modified constantly are to be subject to no farther development or decay i laugh and let the man speak but i would have toleration for these as i would ask it for my own opinions and if they are to die i would rather they had a decent and natural than an abrupt and violent death you would have sacrificed to jove warrington said had you lived in the time of the christian persecutions perhaps i would said pen with some sadness perhaps i am a cowardperhaps my faith is unsteady but this is my own reserve what i argue here is that i will not persecute make a faith or a dogma absolute and persecution becomes a logical consequence and dominic burns a jew or calvin an arian or nero a christian or elizabeth or mary a papist or protestant or their father both or either according to his humor and acting without any pangs of remorsebut on the contrary with strict notions of duty fulfilled make dogma absolute and to inflict or to suffer death becomes easy and necessary and mahomets soldiers shouting paradise paradise and dying on the christian spears are not more or less praiseworthy than the same men slaughtering a townful of jews or cutting off the heads of all prisoners who would not acknowledge that there was but one prophet of god a little while since young one warrington said who had been listening to his friends confessions neither without sympathy nor scorn for his mood led him to indulge in both you asked me why i remained out of the strife of the world and looked on at the great labor of my neighbor without taking any part in the struggle why what a mere dilettante you own yourself to be in this confession of general skepticism and what a listless spectator yourself you are sixandtwenty years old and as blase as a rake of sixty you neither hope much nor care much nor believe much you doubt about other men as much as about yourself were it made of such pococuranti as you the world would be intolerable and i had rather live in a wilderness of monkeys and listen to their chatter than in a company of men who denied every thing were the world composed of saint bernards or saint dominics it would be equally odious said pen and at the end of a few scores of years would cease to exist altogether would you have every man with his head shaved and every woman in a cloistercarrying out to the full the ascetic principle would you have conventicle hymns twanging from every lane in every city in the world would you have all the birds of the forest sing one note and fly with one feather you call me a skeptic because i acknowledge what is and in acknowledging that be it linnet or lark a priest or parson be it i mean any single one of the infinite varieties of the creatures of god whose very name i would be understood to pronounce with reverence and never to approach but with distant awe i say that the study and acknowledgment of that variety among men especially increases our respect and wonder for the creator commander and ordainer of all these minds so different and yet so unitedmeeting in a common adoration and offering up each according to his degree and means of approaching the divine centre his acknowledgment of praise and worship each singing to recur to the bird simile his natural song and so arthur the hymn of a saint or the ode of a poet or the chant of a newgate thief are all pretty much the same in your philosophy said george even that sneer could be answered were it to the point pendennis replied but it is not and it could be replied to you that even to the wretched outcry of the thief on the tree the wisest and the best of all teachers we know of the untiring comforter and consoler promised a pitiful hearing and a certain hope hymns of saints odes of poets who are we to measure the chances and opportunities the means of doing or even judging right and wrong awarded to men and to establish the rule for meting out their punishments and rewards we are as insolent and unthinking in judging of mens morals as of their intellects we admire this man as being a great philosopher and set down the other as a dullard not knowing either or the amount of truth in either or being certain of the truth any where we sing te deum for this hero who has won a battle and de profundis for that other one who has broken out of prison and has been caught afterward by the policemen our measure of rewards and punishments is most partial and incomplete absurdly inadequate utterly worldly and we wish to continue it into the next world into that next and awful world we strive to pursue men and send after them our impotent party verdicts of condemnation or acquittal we set up our paltry little rods to measure heaven immeasurable as if in comparison to that newtons mind or pascals or shakspeares was any loftier than mine as if the ray which travels from the sun would reach me sooner than the man who blacks my boots measured by that altitude the tallest and the smallest among us are so alike diminutive and pitifully base that i say we should take no count of the calculation and it is a meanness to reckon the difference your figure fails there arthur said the other better pleased if even by common arithmetic we can multiply as we can reduce almost infinitely the great reckoner must take count of all and the small is not small or the great great to his infinity i dont call those calculations in question arthur said i only say that yours are incomplete and premature false in consequence and by every operation multiplying into wider error i do not condemn the man who murdered socrates and damned galileo i say that they damned galileo and murdered socrates and yet but a moment since you admitted the propriety of acquiescence in the present and i suppose all other tyrannies no but that if an opponent menaces me of whom and without cost of blood and violence i can get rid i would rather wait him out and starve him out than fight him out fabius fought hannibal skeptically who was his roman coadjutor whom we read of in plutarch when we were boys who scoffed at the others procrastination and doubted his courage and engaged the enemy and was beaten for his pains in these speculations and confessions of arthur the reader may perhaps see allusions to questions which no doubt have occupied and discomposed himself and which he has answered by very different solutions to those come to by our friend we are not pledging ourselves for the correctness of his opinions which readers will please to consider are delivered dramatically the writer being no more answerable for them than for the sentiments uttered by any other character of the story our endeavor is merely to follow out in its progress the development of the mind of a worldly and selfish but not ungenerous or unkind or truthavoiding man and it will be seen that the lamentable stage to which his logic at present has brought him is one of general skepticism and sneering acquiescence in the world as it is or if you like so to call it a belief qualified with scorn in all things extant the tastes and habits of such a man prevent him from being a boisterous demagogue and his love of truth and dislike of cant keep him from advancing crude propositions such as many loud reformers are constantly ready with much more of uttering downright falsehoods in arguing questions or abusing opponents which he would die or starve rather than use it was not in our friends nature to be able to utter certain lies nor was he strong enough to protest against others except with a polite sneer his maxim being that he owed obedience to all acts of parliament as long as they were not repealed and to what does this easy and skeptical life lead a man friend arthur was a sadducee and the baptist might be in the wilderness shouting to the poor who were listening with all their might and faith to the preachers awful accents and denunciations of wrath or woe or salvation and our friend the sadducee would turn his sleek mule with a shrug and a smile from the crowd and go home to the shade of his terrace and muse over preacher and audience and turn to his roll of plato or his pleasant greek songbook babbling of honey and hybla and nymphs and fountains and love to what we say does this skepticism lead it leads a man to a shameful loneliness and selfishness so to speakthe more shameful because it is so goodhumored and conscienceless and serene conscience what is conscience why accept remorse what is public or private faith mythuses alike enveloped in enormous tradition if seeing and acknowledging the lies of the world arthur as see them you can with only too fatal a clearness you submit to them without any protest farther than a laugh if plunged yourself in easy sensuality you allow the whole wretched world to pass groaning by you unmoved if the fight for the truth is taking place and all men of honor are on the ground armed on the one side or the other and you alone are to lie on your balcony and smoke your pipe out of the noise and the danger you had better have died or never have been at all than such a sensual coward the truth friend arthur said imperturbably where is the truth show it me that is the question between us i see it on both sides i see it in the conservative side of the house and among the radicals and even on the ministerial benches i see it in this man who worships by act of parliament and is rewarded with a silk apron and five thousand a year in that man who driven fatally by the remorseless logic of his creed gives up every thing friends fame dearest ties closest vanities the respect of an army of churchmen the recognized position of a leader and passes over truthimpelled to the enemy in whose ranks he will serve henceforth as a nameless private soldieri see the truth in that man as i do in his brother whose logic drives him to quite a different conclusion and who after having passed a life in vain endeavors to reconcile an irreconcileable book flings it at last down in despair and declares with tearful eyes and hands up to heaven his revolt and recantation if the truth is with all these why should i take side with any one of them some are called upon to preach let them preach of these preachers there are somewhat too many methinks who fancy they have the gift but we can not all be parsons in church that is clear some must sit silent and listen or go to sleep mayhap have we not all our duties the head charityboy blows the bellows the master canes the other boys in the organloft the clerk sings out amen from the desk and the beadle with the staff opens the door for his reverence who rustles in silk up to the cushion i wont cane the boys nay or say amen always or act as the churchs champion and warrior in the shape of the beadle with the staff but i will take off my hat in the place and say my prayers there too and shake hands with the clergyman as he steps on the grass outside dont i know that his being there is a compromise and that he stands before me an act of parliament that the church he occupies was built for other worship that the methodist chapel is next door and that bunyan the tinker is bawling out the tidings of damnation on the common hard by yes i am a sadducee and i take things as i find them and the world and the acts of parliament of the world as they are and as i intend to take a wife if i find onenot to be madly in love and prostrate at her feet like a foolnot to worship her as an angel or to expect to find her as suchbut to be goodnatured to her and courteous expecting goodnature and pleasant society from her in turn and so george if ever you hear of my marrying depend on it it wont be a romantic attachment on my side and if you hear of any good place under government i have no particular scruples that i know of which would prevent me from accepting your offer o pen you scoundrel i know what you mean here warrington broke out this is the meaning of your skepticism of your quietism of your atheism my poor fellow youre going to sell yourself and heaven help you youre going to make a bargain which will degrade you and make you miserable for life and theres no use talking of it if you are once bent on it the devil wont prevent you on the contrary hes on my side isnt he george said pen with a laugh what good cigars these are come down and have a little dinner at the club the chefs in town and hell cook a good one for me no you wont dont be sulky old boy im going down toto the country tomorrow chapter xxiv which accounts perhaps for chapter xxiii illustration the information regarding the affairs of the clavering family which major pendennis had acquired through strong and by his own personal interference as the friend of the house was such as almost made the old gentleman pause in any plans which he might have once entertained for his nephews benefit to bestow upon arthur a wife with two such fathersinlaw as the two worthies whom the guileless and unfortunate lady clavering had drawn in her marriage ventures was to benefit no man and though the one in a manner neutralized the other and the appearance of amory or altamont in public would be the signal for his instantaneous withdrawal and condign punishmentfor the fugitive convict had cut down the officer in charge of himand a rope would be inevitably his end if he came again under british authorities yet no guardian would like to secure for his ward a wife whose parent was to be got rid of in such a way and the old gentlemans notion always had been that altamont with the gallows before his eyes would assuredly avoid recognition while at the same time by holding the threat of his discovery over clavering the latter who would lose every thing by amorys appearance would be a slave in the hands of the person who knew so fatal a secret but if the begum paid claverings debts many times more her wealth would be expended altogether upon this irreclaimable reprobate and her heirs whoever they might be would succeed but to an emptied treasury and miss amory instead of bringing her husband a good income and a seat in parliament would bring to that individual her person only and her pedigree with that lamentable note of sus per coll at the name of the last male of her line there was however to the old schemer revolving these things in his mind another course yet open the which will appear to the reader who may take the trouble to peruse a conversation which presently ensued between major pendennis and the honorable baronet the member for clavering when a man under pecuniary difficulties disappears from among his usual friends and equalsdives out of sight as it were from the flock of birds in which he is accustomed to sail it is wonderful at what strange and distant nooks he comes up again for breath i have known a pall mall lounger and rotten row buck of no inconsiderable fashion vanish from among his comrades of the clubs and the park and be discovered very happy and affable at an eighteenpenny ordinary in billingsgate another gentleman of great learning and wit when out running the constables were i to say he was a literary man some critics would vow that i intended to insult the literary profession once sent me his address at a little publichouse called the fox under the hill down a most darksome and cavernous archway in the strand such a man under such misfortunes may have a house but he is never in his house and has an address where letters may be left but only simpletons go with the hopes of seeing him only a few of the faithful know where he is to be found and have the clew to his hidingplace so after the disputes with his wife and the misfortunes consequent thereon to find sir francis clavering at home was impossible ever since i hast him for my book which is fourteen pound he dont come home till three oclock and purtends to be asleep when i bring his water of a mornin and dodges hout when im down stairs mr lightfoot remarked to his friend morgan and announced that he should go down to my lady and be butler there and marry his old woman in like manner after his altercations with strong the baronet did not come near him and fled to other haunts out of the reach of the chevaliers reproaches out of the reach of conscience if possible which many of us try to dodge and leave behind us by changes of scenes and other fugitive stratagems so though the elder pendennis having his own ulterior object was bent upon seeing pens country neighbor and representative in parliament it took the major no inconsiderable trouble and time before he could get him into such a confidential state and conversation as were necessary for the ends which the major had in view for since the major had been called in as family friend and had cognizance of claverings affairs conjugal and pecuniary the baronet avoided him as he always avoided all his lawyers and agents when there was an account to be rendered or an affair of business to be discussed between them and never kept any appointment but when its object was the raising of money thus previous to catching this most shy and timorous bird the major made more than one futile attempt to hold him on one day it was a most innocentlooking invitation to dinner at greenwich to meet a few friends the baronet accepted suspected something and did not come leaving the major who indeed proposed to represent in himself the body of friends to eat his whitebait done on another occasion the major wrote and asked for ten minutes talk and the baronet instantly acknowledged the note and made the appointment at four oclock the next day at bayss precisely he carefully underlined the precisely but though four oclock came as in the course of time and destiny it could not do otherwise no clavering made his appearance indeed if he had borrowed twenty pounds of pendennis he could not have been more timid or desirous of avoiding the major and the latter found that it was one thing to seek a man and another to find him before the close of that day in which strongs patron had given the chevalier the benefit of so many blessings before his face and curses behind his back sir francis clavering who had pledged his word and his oath to his wifes advisers to draw or accept no more bills of exchange and to be content with the allowance which his victimized wife still awarded him had managed to sign his respectable name to a piece of stamped paper which the baronets friend mr moss abrams had carried off promising to have the bill done by a party with whose intimacy mr abrams was favored and it chanced that strong heard of this transaction at the place where the writings had been drawnin the back parlor namely of mr santiagos cigarshop where the chevalier was constantly in the habit of spending an hour in the evening he is at his old work again mr santiago told his customer he and moss abrams were in my parlor moss sent out my boy for a stamp it must have been a bill for fifty pound i heard the baronet tell moss to date it two months back he will pretend that it is an old bill and that he forgot it when he came to a settlement with his wife the other day i daresay they will give him some more money now he is clear a man who has the habit of putting his unlucky name to promises to pay at six months has the satisfaction of knowing too that his affairs are known and canvassed and his signature handed round among the very worst knaves and rogues of london mr santiagos shop was close by st jamessstreet and burystreet where we have had the honor of visiting our friend major pendennis in his lodgings the major was walking daintily toward his apartment as strong burning with wrath and redolent of havanna strode along the same pavement opposite to him confound these young men how they poison every thing with their smoke thought the major here comes a fellow with mustaches and a cigar every fellow who smokes and wears mustaches is a low fellow oh its mr strongi hope you are well mr strong and the old gentleman making a dignified bow to the chevalier was about to pass into his house directing toward the lock of the door with trembling hand the polished doorkey we have said that at the long and weary disputes and conferences regarding the payment of sir francis claverings last debts strong and pendennis had both been present as friends and advisers of the baronets unlucky family strong stopped and held out his hand to his brother negotiator and old pendennis put out toward him a couple of ungracious fingers what is your good news said major pendennis patronizing the other still farther and condescending to address to him an observation for old pendennis had kept such good company all his life that he vaguely imagined he honored common men by speaking to them still in town mr strong i hope i see you well my news is bad news sir strong answered it concerns our friends at tunbridge wells and i should like to talk to you about it clavering is at his old tricks again major pendennis indeed pray do me the favor to come into my lodging cried the major with awakened interest and the pair entered and took possession of his drawingroom here seated strong unburdened himself of his indignation to the major and spoke at large of claverings recklessness and treachery no promises will bind him sir he said you remember when we met sir with my ladys lawyer how he wouldnt be satisfied with giving his honor but wanted to take his oath on his knees to his wife and rang the bell for a bible and swore perdition on his soul if he ever would give another bill he has been signing one this very day sir and will sign as many more as you please for ready money and will deceive any body his wife or his child or his old friend who has backed him a hundred times why theres a bill of his and mine will be due next week i thought we had paid all not that one strong said blushing he asked me not to mention it andandi had half the money for that major and they will be down on me but i dont care for it im used to it its lady clavering that riles me its a shame that that goodnatured woman who has paid him out of jail a score of times should be ruined by his heartlessness a parcel of billstealers boxers any rascals get his money and he dont scruple to throw an honest fellow over would you believe it sir he took money of altamontyou know whom i mean indeed of that singular man who i think came tipsy once to sir franciss house major pendennis said with impenetrable countenance who is altamont mr strong i am sure i dont know if you dont know the chevalier answered with a look of surprise and suspicion to tell you frankly said the major i have my suspicions i supposemind i only supposethat in our friend claverings life who between you and me captain strong we must own is about as loose a fish as any in my acquaintancethere are no doubt some queer secrets and stories which he would not like to have known none of us would and very likely this fellow who calls himself altamont knows some story against clavering and has some hold on him and gets money out of him on the strength of his information i know some of the best men of the best families in england who are paying through the nose in that way but their private affairs are no business of mine mr strong and it is not to be supposed that because i go and dine with a man i pry into his secrets or am answerable for all his past life and so with our friend clavering i am most interested for his wifes sake and her daughters who is a most charming creature and when her ladyship asked me i looked into her affairs and tried to set them straight and shall do so again you understand to the hest of my humble power and ability if i can make myself useful and if i am called uponyou understand if i am called uponandbytheway this mr altamont mr strong how is this mr altamont i believe you are acquainted with him is he in town i dont know that i am called upon to know where he is major pendennis said strong rising and taking up his hat in dudgeon for the majors patronizing manner and impertinence of caution offended the honest gentleman not a little pendenniss manner altered at once from a tone of hauteur to one of knowing goodhumor ah captain strong you are cautious too i see and quite right my good sir quite right we dont know what ears walls may have sir or to whom we may be talking and as a man of the world and an old soldieran old and distinguished soldier i have been told captain strongyou know very well that there is no use in throwing away your fire you may have your ideas and i may put two and two together and have mine but there are things which dont concern him that many a man had better not know eh captain and which i for one wont know until i have reason for knowing them and that i believe is your maxim too with regard to our friend the baronet i think with you it would be most advisable that he should be checked in his imprudent courses and most strongly reprehend any mans departure from his word or any conduct of his which can give any pain to his family or cause them annoyance in any way that is my full and frank opinion and i am sure it is yours certainly said mr strong drily i am delighted to hear it delighted that an old brother soldier should agree with me so fully and i am exceedingly glad of the lucky meeting which has procured me the good fortune of your visit good evening thank you morgan show the door to captain strong and strong preceded by morgan took his leave of major pendennis the chevalier not a little puzzled at the old fellows prudence and the valet to say the truth to the full as much perplexed at his masters reticence for mr morgan in his capacity of accomplished valet moved here and there in a house as silent as a shadow and as it so happened during the latter part of his masters conversation with his visitor had been standing very close to the door and had overheard not a little of the talk between the two gentlemen and a great deal more than he could understand who is that altamont know any thing about him and strong mr morgan asked of mr lightfoot on the next convenient occasion when they met at the club strongs his man of business draws the governors bills and indosses em and does his odd jobs and that and i suppose altamonts in it too mr lightfoot replied that kiteflying you know mr m always takes two or three on em to set the paper going altamont put the pot on at the derby and won a good bit of money i wish the governor could get some somewhere and i could get my book paid up do you think my lady would pay his debts again morgan asked find out that for me lightfoot and ill make it worth your while my boy major pendennis had often said with a laugh that his valet morgan was a much richer man than himself and indeed by a long course of careful speculation this wary and silent attendant had been amassing a considerable sum of money during the years which he had passed in the majors service where he had made the acquaintance of many other valets of distinction from whom he had learned the affairs of their principals when mr arthur came into his property but not until then morgan had surprised the young gentleman by saying that he had a little sum of money some fifty or a hundred pound which he wanted to lay out to advantage perhaps the gentlemen in the temple knowing about affairs and business and that could help a poor fellow to a good investment morgan would be very much obliged to mr arthur most grateful and obliged indeed if arthur could tell him of one when arthur laughingly replied that he knew nothing about money matters and knew no earthly way of helping morgan the latter with the utmost simplicity was very grateful very grateful indeed to mr arthur and if mr arthur should want a little money before his rents was paid perhaps he would kindly remember that his uncles old and faithful servant had some as he would like to put out and be most proud if he could be useful anyways to any of the family the prince of fairoaks who was tolerably prudent and had no need of ready money would as soon have thought of borrowing from his uncles servant as of stealing the valets pockethandkerchief and was on the point of making some haughty reply to morgans offer but was checked by the humor of the transaction morgan a capitalist morgan offering to lend to him the joke was excellent on the other hand the man might be quite innocent and the proposal of money a simple offer of goodwill so arthur withheld the sarcasm that was rising to his lips and contented himself by declining mr morgans kind proposal he mentioned the matter to his uncle however and congratulated the latter on having such a treasure in his service it was then that the major said that he believed morgan had been getting devilish rich for a devilish long time in fact he had bought the house in burystreet in which his master was a lodger and had actually made a considerable sum of money from his acquaintance with the clavering family and his knowledge obtained through his master that the begum would pay all her husbands debts by buying up as many of the baronets acceptances as he could raise money to purchase of these transactions the major however knew no more than most gentlemen do of their servants who live with us all our days and are strangers to us so strong custom is and so pitiless the distinction between class and class so he offered to lend you money did he the elder pendennis remarked to his nephew hes a devlish sly fellow and a devlish rich fellow and theres many a nobleman would like to have such a valet in his service and borrow from him too and he aint a bit changed monsieur morgan he does his work just as well as everhes always ready to my bellsteals about the room like a cathes so devlishly attached to me morgan on the day of strongs visit the major bethought him of pens story and that morgan might help him and rallied the valet regarding his wealth with that free and insolent way which so highplaced a gentleman might be disposed to adopt toward so unfortunate a creature i hear that you have got some money to invest morgan said the major its mr arthur has been telling hang him thought the valet im glad my place is such a good one thank you sirive no reason to complain of my place nor of my master replied morgan demurely youre a good fellow and i believe you are attached to me and im glad you get on well and i hope youll be prudent and not be taking a publichouse or that kind of thing a publichouse thought morganme in a publichousethe old fooldammy if i was ten years younger id set in parlyment before i died that i would no thank you kindly sir i dont think of the public line sir and ive got my little savings pretty well put out sir you do a little in the discounting way eh morgan yes sir a very littleii beg your pardon sirmight i be so free as to ask a question speak on my good fellow the elder said graciously about sir francis claverings paper sir do you think hes any longer any good sir will my lady pay on em any more sir what youve done something in that business already yes sir a little replied morgan dropping down his eyes and i dont mind owning sir and i hope i may take the liberty of saying sir that a little more would make me very comfortable if it turned out as well as the last why how much have you netted by him in gads name asked the major ive done a good bit sir at it that i own sir having some information and made acquaintance with the famly through your kindness i put on the pot sir you did what i laid my money on siri got all i could and borrowed and bought sir franciss bills many of em had his name and the gentlemans as is just gone out edward strong esquire sir and of course i know of the blow hup and shindy as is took place in grosvenorplace sir and as i may as well make my money as another id be very much obleeged to you if youd tell me whether my lady will come down any more although major pendennis was as much surprised at this intelligence regarding his servant as if he had heard that morgan was a disguised marquis about to throw off his mask and assume his seat in the house of peers and although he was of course indignant at the audacity of the fellow who had dared to grow rich under his nose and without his cognizance yet he had a natural admiration for every man who represented money and success and found himself respecting morgan and being rather afraid of that worthy as the truth began to dawn upon him well morgan said he i mustnt ask how rich you are and the richer the better for your sake im sure and if i could give you any information that could serve you i would speedily help you but frankly if lady clavering asks me whether she shall pay any more of sir franciss debts i shall advise and i hope she wont though i fear she willand that is all i know and so you are aware that sir francis is beginning again in hisehreckless and imprudent course at his old games sircant prevent that gentleman he will do it mr strong was saying that a mr moss abrams was the holder of one of sir francis coverings notes do you know any thing of this mr abrams or the amount of the bill dont know the billknow abrams quite well sir i wish you would find out about it for me and i wish you would find out where i can see sir francis clavering morgan and morgan said thank you sir yes sir i will sir and retired from the room as he had entered it with his usual stealthy respect and quiet humility leaving the major to muse and wonder over what he had just heard the next morning the valet informed major pendennis that he had seen mr abrams what was the amount of the bill that gentleman was desirous to negotiate and that the baronet would be sure to be in the back parlor of the wheel of fortune tavern that day at one oclock to this appointment sir francis clavering was punctual and as at one oclock he sat in the parlor of the tavern in question surrounded by spittoons windsor chairs cheerful prints of boxers trotting horses and pedestrians and the lingering of last nights tobacco fumesas the descendant of an ancient line sate in this delectable place accommodated with an old copy of bells life in london much blotted with beer the polite major pendennis walked into the apartment so its you old boy asked the baronet thinking that mr moss abrams had arrived with the money how do you do sir francis clavering i wanted to see you and followed you here said the major at sight of whom the others countenance fell now that he had his opponent before him the major was determined to make a brisk and sudden attack upon him and went into action at once i know he continued who is the exceedingly disreputable person for whom you took me clavering and the errand which brought you here it aint your business is it asked the baronet with a sulky and deprecatory look why are you following me about and taking the command and meddling in my affairs major pendennis ive never done you any harm have i ive never had your money and i dont choose to be dodged about in this way and domineered over i dont choose it and i wont have it if lady clavering has any proposal to make to me let it be done in the regular way and through the lawyers id rather not have you i am not come from lady clavering the major said but of my own accord to try and remonstrate with you clavering and see if you can be kept from ruin it is but a month ago that you swore on your honor and wanted to get a bible to strengthen the oath that you would accept no more bills but content yourself with the allowance which lady clavering gives you all your debts were paid with that proviso and you have broken it this mr abrams has a bill of yours for sixty pounds its an old bill i take my solemn oath its an old bill shrieked out the baronet you drew it yesterday and you dated three months back purposely by gad clavering you sicken me with lies i cant help telling you so ive no patience with you by gad you cheat every body yourself included ive seen a deal of the world but i never met your equal at humbugging its my belief you had rather lie than not have you come here you old old beast to tempt me toto pitch into you andand knock your old head off said the baronet with a poisonous look of hatred at the major what sir shouted out the old major rising to his feet and clasping his cane and looking so fiercely that the baronets tone instantly changed toward him no no said clavering piteously i beg your pardon i didnt mean to be angry or say any thing unkind only youre so damned harsh to me major pendennis what is it you want of me why have you been hunting me so do you want money out of me too by jove you know ive not got a shillingand so clavering according to his custom passed from a curse into a whimper major pendennis saw from the others tone that clavering knew his secret was in the majors hands ive no errand from any body or no design upon you pendennis said but an endeavor if its not too late to save you and your family from utter ruin through the infernal recklessness of your courses i knew your secret i didnt know it when i married her upon my oath i didnt know it till the dd scoundrel came back and told me himself and its the misery about that which makes me so reckless pendennis indeed it is the baronet cried clasping his hands i knew your secret from the very first day when i saw amory come drunk into your diningroom in grosvenorplace i never forget faces i remember that fellow in sidney a convict and he remembers me i know his trial the date of his marriage and of his reported death in the bush i could swear to him and i know that you are no more married to lady clavering than i am ive kept your secret well enough for ive not told a single soul that i know itnot your wife not yourself till now poor lady c it would cut her up dreadfully whimpered sir francis and it wasnt my fault major you know it wasnt rather than allow you to go on ruining her as you do i will tell her clavering and tell all the world too that is what i swear i will do unless i can come to some terms with you and put some curb on your infernal folly by play debt and extravagance of all kind youve got through half your wifes fortune and that of her legitimate heirs mindher legitimate heirs here it must stop you cant live together youre not fit to live in a great house like clavering and before three years more were over would not leave a shilling to carry on ive settled what must be done you shall have six hundred a year you shall go abroad and live on that you must give up parliament and get on as well as you can if you refuse i give you my word ill make the real state of things known tomorrow ill swear to amory who when identified will go back to the country from whence he came and will rid the widow of you and himself together and so that boy of yours loses at once all title to old snells property and it goes to your wifes daughter aint i making myself pretty clearly understood you wouldnt be so cruel to that poor boy would you pendennis asked the father pleading piteously hang it think about him hes a nice boy though hes devlish wild i ownhes devlish wild its you who are cruel to him said the old moralist why sir youll ruin him yourself inevitably in three years yes but perhaps i wont have such devlish bad luck you know the luck must turn and ill reform by gad ill reform and if you were to split on me it would cut up my wife so you know it would most infernally to be parted from you said the old major with a sneer you know she wont live with you again but why cant lady c live abroad or at bath or at tunbridge or at the doose and i go on here clavering continued i like being here better than abroad and i like being in parliament its devlish convenient being in parliament theres very few seats like mine left and if i gave it to em i should not wonder the ministry would give me an island to govern or some devlish good thing for you know im a gentleman of devlish good family and have a handle to my name andand that sort of thing major pendennis eh dont you see dont you think theyd give me something devlish good if i was to play my cards well and then you know id save money and be kept out of the way of the confounded hells and rouge et noirandand so id rather not give up parliament please for at one instant to hate and defy a man at the next to weep before him and at the next to be perfectly confidential and friendly with him was not an unusual process with our versatileminded baronet as for your seat in parliament the major said with something of a blush on his cheek and a certain tremor which the other did not see you must part with that sir francis clavering toto me what are you going into the house major pendennis nonot i but my nephew arthur is a very clever fellow and would make a figure there and when clavering had two members his father might very likely have been one andand i should like arthur to be there the major said dammy does he know it too cried out clavering nobody knows any thing out of this room pendennis answered and if you do this favor for me i hold my tongue if not im a man of my word and will do what i have said i say major said sir francis with a peculiarly humble smile youyou couldnt get me my first quarter in advance could you like the best of fellows you can do any thing with lady clavering and upon my oath ill take up that bill of abrams the little dam scoundrel i know hell do me in the businesshe always does and if you could do this for me wed see major and i think your best plan would be to go down in september to clavering to shoot and take my nephew with you and introduce him yes that will be the best time and we will try and manage about the advance arthur may lend him that thought old pendennis confound him a seat in parliament is worth a hundred and fifty pounds and clavering you understand of course my nephew knows nothing about this business you have a mind to retire he is a clavering man and a good representative for the borough you introduce him and your people vote for himyou see when can you get me the hundred and fifty major when shall i come and see you will you be at home this evening or tomorrow morning will you have any thing here theyve got some devlish good bitters in the bar i often have a glass of bitters it sets one up so the old major would take no refreshment but rose and took his leave of the baronet who walked with him to the door of the wheel of fortune and then strolled into the bar where he took a glass of gin and bitters with the landlady there and a gentleman connected with the ring who boarded at the wheel of f coming in he and sir francis clavering and the landlord talked about the fights and the news of the sporting world in general and at length mr moss abrams arrived with the proceeds of the baronets bill from which his own handsome commission was deducted and out of the remainder sir francis stood a dinner at greenwich to his distinguished friend and passed the evening gayly at vauxhall meanwhile major pendennis calling a cab in piccadilly drove to lambcourt temple where he speedily was closeted with his nephew in deep conversation after their talk they parted on very good terms and it was in consequence of that unreported conversation whereof the reader nevertheless can pretty well guess the bearing that arthur expressed himself as we have heard in the colloquy with warrington which is reported in the last chapter when a man is tempted to do a tempting thing he can find a hundred ingenious reasons for gratifying his liking and arthur thought very much that he would like to be in parliament and that he would like to distinguish himself there and that he need not care much what side he took as there was falsehood and truth on every side and on this and on other matters he thought he would compromise with his conscience and that sadduceeism was a very convenient and goodhumored profession of faith chapter xxv phillis and corydon illustration on a picturesque common in the neighborhood of tunbridge wells lady clavering had found a pretty villa whither she retired after her conjugal disputes at the end of that unlucky london season miss amory of course accompanied her mother and master clavering came home for the holidays with whom blanches chief occupation was to fight and quarrel but this was only a home pastime and the young schoolboy was not fond of home sports he found cricket and horses and plenty of friends at tunbridge the goodnatured begums house was filled with a constant society of young gentlemen of thirteen who ate and drank much too copiously of tarts and champagne who rode races on the lawn and frightened the fond mother who smoked and made themselves sick and the diningroom unbearable to miss blanche she did not like the society of young gentlemen of thirteen as for that fair young creature any change as long as it was change was pleasant to her and for a week or two she would have liked poverty and a cottage and bread and cheese and for a night perhaps a dungeon and bread and water and so the move to tunbridge was by no means unwelcome to her she wandered in the woods and sketched trees and farmhouses she read french novels habitually she drove into tunbridge wells pretty often and to any play or ball or conjuror or musician who might happen to appear in the place she slept a great deal she quarreled with mamma and frank during the morning she found the little village school and attended it and first fondled the girls and thwarted the mistress then scolded the girls and laughed at the teacher she was constant at church of course it was a pretty little church of immense antiquitya little anglonorman bijou built the day before yesterday and decorated with all sorts of painted windows carved saints heads gilt scripture texts and open pews blanche began forthwith to work a most correct highchurch altarcover for the church she passed for a saint with the clergyman for a while whom she quite took in and whom she coaxed and wheedled and fondled so artfully that poor mrs smirke who at first was charmed with her then bore with her then would hardly speak to her was almost mad with jealousy mrs smirke was the wife of our old friend smirke pens tutor and poor helens suitor he had consoled himself for her refusal with a young lady from clapham whom his mamma provided when the latter died our friends views became every day more and more pronounced he cut off his coat collar and let his hair grow over his back he rigorously gave up the curl which he used to sport on his forehead and the tie of his neckcloth of which he was rather proud he went without any tie at all he went without dinner on fridays he read the roman hours and intimated that he was ready to receive confessions in the vestry the most harmless creature in the world he was denounced as a black and a most dangerous jesuit and papist by muffin of the dissenting chapel and mr simeon knight at the old church mr smirke had built his chapel of ease with the money left him by his mother at clapham lord lord what would she have said to hear a table called an altar to see candlesticks on it to get letters signed on the feast of saint soandso or the vigil of saint whatdoyoucallem all these things did the boy of clapham practice his faithful wife following him but when blanche had a conference of near two hours in the vestry with mr smirke belinda paced up and down on the grass where there were only two little gravestones as yet she wished that she had a third there only only he would offer very likely to that creature who had infatuated him in a fortnight no she would retire she would go into a convent and profess and leave him such bad thoughts had smirkes wife and his neighbors regarding him these thinking him in direct correspondence with the bishop of rome that bewailing errors to her even more odious and fatal and yet our friend meant no earthly harm the postoffice never brought him any letters from the pope he thought blanche to be sure at first the most pious gifted rightthinking fascinating person he had ever met and her manner of singing the chants delighted himbut after a while he began to grow rather tired of miss amory her ways and graces grew stale somehow then he was doubtful about miss amory then she made a disturbance in his school lost her temper and rapped the childrens fingers blanche inspired this admiration and satiety somehow in many men she tried to please them and flung out all her graces at once came down to them with all her jewels on all her smiles and cajoleries and coaxings and ogles then she grew tired of them and of trying to please them and never having cared about them dropped them and the men grew tired of her and dropped her too it was a happy night for belinda when blanche went away and her husband with rather a blush and a sigh said he had been deceived in her he had thought her endowed with many precious gifts he feared they were mere tinsel he thought she had been a rightthinking person he feared she had merely made religion an amusementshe certainly had quite lost her temper to the schoolmistress and beat polly ruckers knuckles cruelly belinda flew to his arms there was no question about the grave or the veil any more he tenderly embraced her on the forehead there is none like thee my belinda he said throwing his fine eyes up to the ceiling precious among women as for blanche from the instant she lost sight of him and belinda she never thought or cared about either any more but when arthur went down to pass a few days at tunbridge wells with the begum this stage of indifference had not arrived on miss blanches part or on that of the simple clergyman smirke believed her to be an angel and wonder of a woman such a perfection he had never seen and sate listening to her music in the summer evenings openmouthed rapt in wonder tealess and breadandbutterless fascinating as he had heard the music of the opera to behe had never but once attended an exhibition of that nature which he mentioned with a blush and a sighit was on that day when he had accompanied helen and her son to the play at chatterishe could not conceive any thing more delicious more celestial he had almost said than miss amorys music she was a most gifted being she had a precious soul she had the most remarkable talentsto all outward seeming the most heavenly disposition c it was in this way that being then at the height of his own fever and bewitchment for blanche smirke discoursed to arthur about her the meeting between the two old acquaintances had been very cordial arthur loved any body who loved his mother smirke could speak on that theme with genuine feeling and emotion they had a hundred things to tell each other of what had occurred in their lives arthur would perceive smirke said that hishis views on church matters had developed themselves since their acquaintance mrs smirke a most exemplary person seconded them with all her endeavors he had built this little church on his mothers demise who had left him provided with a sufficiency of worldly means though in the cloister himself he had heard of arthurs reputation he spoke in the kindest and most saddened tone he held his eyelids down and bowed his fair head on one side arthur was immensely amused with him with his airs with his follies and simplicity with his blank stock and long hair with his real goodness kindness friendliness of feeling and his praises of blanche pleased and surprised our friend not a little and made him regard her with eyes of particular favor the truth is blanche was very glad to see arthur as one is glad to see an agreeable man in the country who brings down the last news and stories from the great city who can talk better than most country folks at least can talk that darling london jargon so dear and indispensable to london people so little understood by persons out of the world the first day pen came down he kept blanche laughing for hours after dinner she sang her songs with redoubled spirit she did not scold her mother she fondled and kissed her to the honest begums surprise when it came to be bedtime she said deja with the prettiest air of regret possible and was really quite sorry to go to bed and squeezed arthurs hand quite fondly he on his side gave her pretty palm a very cordial pressure our young gentleman was of that turn that eyes very moderately bright dazzled him illustration she is very much improved thought pen looking out into the night very much i suppose the begum wont mind my smoking with the window open shes a jolly good old woman and blanche is immensely improved i liked her manner with her mother tonight i liked her laughing way with that stupid young cub of a boy whom they oughtnt to allow to get tipsy she sang those little verses very prettily they were devilish pretty verses too though i say it who shouldnt say it and he hummed a tune which blanche had put to some verses of his own ah what a fine night how jolly a cigar is at night how pretty that little saxon church looks in the moonlight i wonder what old warringtons doing yes shes a dayvlish nice little thing as my uncle says o heavenly here broke out a voice from a clematiscovered casement neara girls voice it was the voice of the author of mes larmes pen burst into a laugh dont tell about my smoking he said leaning out of his own window o go on i adore it cried the lady of mes larmes heavenly night heavenly heavenly moon but i most shut my window and not talk to you on account of les moeurs how droll they are les moeurs adieu and pen began to sing the good night to don basilio the next day they were walking in the fields together laughing and chatteringthe gayest pair of friends they talked about the days of their youth and blanche was prettily sentimental they talked about laura dearest laurablanche had loved her as a sister was she happy with that odd lady rockminster wouldnt she come and stay with them at tunbridge o what walks they would take together what songs they would singthe old old songs lauras voice was splendid did arthurshe must call him arthurremember the songs they sang in the happy old days now he was grown such a great man and had such a succes c c and the day after which was enlivened with a happy ramble through the woods to penshurst and a sight of that pleasant park and hall came that conversation with the curate which we have narrated and which made our young friend think more and more is she all this perfection he asked himself has she become serious and religious does she tend schools and visit the poor is she kind to her mother and brother yes i am sure of that i have seen her and walking with his old tutor over his little parish and going to visit his school it was with inexpressible delight that pen found blanche seated instructing the children and fancied to himself how patient she must be how goodnatured how ingenuous how really simple in her tastes and unspoiled by the world and do you really like the country he asked her as they walked together i should like never to see that odious city again o arthurthat is mrwell arthur thenones good thoughts grow up in these sweet woods and calm solitudes like those flowers which wont bloom in london you know the gardener comes and changes our balconies once a week i dont think i shall bear to look london in the face againits odious smoky brazen face but heigho why that sigh blanche never mind why yes i do mind why tell me tell me every thing i wish you hadnt come down and a second edition of mes soupirs came out you dont want me blanche i dont want you to go away i dont think this house will be very happy without you and thats why i wish that you never had come mes soupirs were here laid aside and mes larmes had begun ah what answer is given to those in the eyes of a young woman what is the method employed for drying them what took place o ringdoves and roses o dews and wildflowers o waving greenwoods and balmy airs of summer here were two battered london rakes taking themselves in for a moment and fancying that they were in love with each other like phillis and corydon when one thinks of country houses and country walks one wonders that any man is left unmarried chapter xxvi temptation illustration easy and frankspoken as pendennis commonly was with warrington how came it that arthur did not inform the friend and depository of all his secrets of the little circumstances which had taken place at the villa near tunbridge wells he talked about the discovery of his old tutor smirke freely enough and of his wife and of his anglonorman church and of his departure from clapham to rome but when asked about blanche his answers were evasive or general he said she was a goodnatured clever little thingthat rightly guided she might make no such bad wife after all but that he had for the moment no intention of marriage that his days of romance were over that he was contented with his present lot and so forth in the mean time there came occasionally to lamb court temple pretty little satin envelopes superscribed in the neatest handwriting and sealed with one of those admirable ciphers which if warrington had been curious enough to watch his friends letters or indeed if the cipher had been decipherable would have shown george that mr arthur was in correspondence with a young lady whose initials were b a to these pretty little compositions mr pen replied in his best and gallantest manner with jokes with news of the town with points of wit nay with pretty little verses very likely in reply to the versicles of the muse of mes larmes blanche we know rhymes with branch and stanch and launch and no doubt a gentleman of pens ingenuity would not forego these advantages of position and would ring the pretty little changes upon these pleasing notes indeed we believe that those loveverses of mr pens which had such a pleasing success in the roseleaves that charming annual edited by lady violet lebas and illustrated by portraits of the female nobility by the famous artist pinkney were composed at this period of our heros life and were first addressed to blanche per post before they figured in print cornets as it were to pinkneys pictorial garland verses are all very well the elder pendennis said who found pen scratching down one of these artless effusions at the club as he was waiting for his dinner and letterwriting if mamma allows it and between such old country friends of course there may be a correspondence and that sort of thingbut mind pen and dont commit yourself my boy for who knows what the doose may happen the best way is to make your letters safe i never wrote a letter in all my life that would commit me and demmy sir i have had some experience of women and the worthy gentleman growing more garrulous and confidential with his nephew as he grew older told many affecting instances of the evil results consequent upon this want of caution to many persons in societyhow from using too ardent expressions in some poetical notes to the widow naylor young spoony had subjected himself to a visit of remonstrance from the widows brother colonel flint and thus had been forced into a marriage with a woman old enough to be his mother how when louisa salter had at length succeeded in securing young sir john bird hopwood of the blues produced some letters which miss s had written to him and caused a withdrawal on birds part who afterward was united to miss stickney of lyme regis c the major if he had not reading had plenty of observation and could back his wise saws with a multitude of modern instances which he had acquired in a long and careful perusal of the great book of the world pen laughed at the examples and blushing a little at his uncles remonstrances said that he would bear them in mind and be cautious he blushed perhaps because he had borne them in mind because he was cautious because in his letters to miss blanche he had from instinct or honesty perhaps refrained from any avowals which might compromise him dont you remember the lesson i had sir in lady mirabelsmiss fotheringays affair i am not to be caught again uncle arthur said with mock frankness and humility old pendennis congratulated himself and his nephew heartily on the latters prudence and progress and was pleased at the position which arthur was taking as a man of the world no doubt if warrington had been consulted his opinion would have been different and he would have told pen that the boys foolish letters were better than the mans adroit compliments and slippery gallantries that to win the woman he loves only a knave or a coward advances under cover with subterfuges and a retreat secured behind him but pen spoke not on this matter to mr warrington knowing pretty well that he was guilty and what his friends verdict would be colonel altamont had not been for many weeks absent on his foreign tour sir francis clavering having retired meanwhile into the country pursuant to his agreement with major pendennis when the ills of fate began to fall rather suddenly and heavily upon the sole remaining partner of the little firm of shepherds inn when strong at parting with altamont refused the loan proffered by the latter in the fullness of his purse and the generosity of his heart he made such a sacrifice to conscience and delicacy as caused him many an aftertwinge and pang and he feltit was not very many hours in his life he had experienced the feelingthat in this juncture of his affairs he had been too delicate and too scrupulous why should a fellow in want refuse a kind offer kindly made why should a thirsty man decline a pitcher of water from a friendly hand because it was a little soiled strongs conscience smote him for refusing what the other had fairly come by and generously proffered and he thought ruefully now it was too late that altamonts cash would have been as well in his pocket as in that of the gamblinghouse proprietor at baden or ems with whom his excellency would infallibly leave his derby winnings it was whispered among the tradesmen billdiscounters and others who had commercial dealings with captain strong that he and the baronet had parted company and that the captains paper was henceforth of no value the tradesmen who had put a wonderful confidence in him hithertofor who could resist strongs jolly face and frank and honest demeanornow began to pour in their bills with a cowardly mistrust and unanimity the knocks at the shepherds inn chambers door were constant and tailors bootmakers pastrycooks who had furnished dinners in their own persons or by the boys their representatives held levees on strongs stairs to these were added one or two persons of a less clamorous but far more sly and dangerous sortthe young clerks of lawyers namely who lurked about the inn or concerted with mr campions young man in the chambers hard by having in their dismal pocketbooks copies of writs to be served on edward strong requiring him to appear on an early day next term before our sovereign lady the queen and answer to c c illustration from this invasion of creditors poor strong who had not a guinea in his pocket had of course no refuge but that of the englishmans castle into which he retired shutting the outer and inner door upon the enemy and not quitting his stronghold until after nightfall against this outer barrier the foe used to come and knock and curse in vain while the chevalier peeped at them from behind the little curtain which he had put over the orifice of his letterbox and had the dismal satisfaction of seeing the faces of furious clerk and fiery dun as they dashed up against the door and retreated from it but as they could not be always at his gate or sleep on his staircase the enemies of the chevalier sometimes left him free strong when so pressed by his commercial antagonists was not quite alone in his defense against them but had secured for himself an ally or two his friends were instructed to communicate with him by a system of private signals and they thus kept the garrison from starving by bringing in necessary supplies and kept up strongs heart and prevented him from surrendering by visiting him and cheering him in his retreat two of neds most faithful allies were huxter and miss fanny bolton when hostile visitors were prowling about the inn fannys little sisters were taught a particular cry or joedel which they innocently whooped in the court when fanny and huxter came up to visit strong they archly sang this same note at his door when that barrier was straightway opened the honest garrison came out smiling the provisions and the pot of porter were brought in and in the society of his faithful friends the beleaguered one passed a comfortable night there are some men who could not live under this excitement but strong was a brave man as we have said who had seen service and never lost heart in peril but besides allies our general had secured for himself under difficulties that still more necessary aida retreat it has been mentioned in a former part of this history how messrs costigan and bows lived in the house next door to captain strong and that the window of one of their rooms was not very far off the kitchenwindow which was situated in the upper story of strongs chambers a leaden waterpipe and gutter served for the two and strong looking out from his kitchen one day saw that he could spring with great ease up to the sill of his neighbors window and clamber up the pipe which communicated from one to the other he had laughingly shown this refuge to his chum altamont and they had agreed that it would be as well not to mention the circumstance to captain costigan whose duns were numerous and who would be constantly flying down the pipe into their apartments if this way of escape were shown to him but now that the evil days were come strong made use of the passage and one afternoon burst in upon bows and costigan with his jolly face and explained that the enemy was in waiting on his staircase and that he had taken this means of giving them the slip so while mr markss aiddecamps were in waiting in the passage of no strong walked down the steps of no dined at the albion went to the play and returned home at midnight to the astonishment of mrs bolton and fanny who had not seen him quit his chambers and could not conceive how he could have passed the line of sentries strong bore this siege for some weeks with admirable spirit and resolution and as only such an old and brave soldier would for the pains and privations which he had to endure were enough to depress any man of ordinary courage and what vexed and riled him to use his own expression was the infernal indifference and cowardly ingratitude of clavering to whom he wrote letter after letter which the baronet never acknowledged by a single word or by the smallest remittance though a fivepound note as strong said at that time would have been a fortune to him but better days were in store for the chevalier and in the midst of his despondency and perplexities there came to him a most welcome aid yes if it hadnt been for this good fellow here said strong for a good fellow you are altamont my boy and hang me if i dont stand by you as long as i live i think pendennis it would have been all up with ned strong it was the fifth week of my being kept a prisoner for i couldnt be always risking my neck across that waterpipe and taking my walks abroad through poor old coss window and my spirit was quite broken sirdammy quite beat and i was thinking of putting an end to myself and should have done it in another week when who should drop down from heaven but altamont heaven aint exactly the place ned said altamont i came from badenbaden said he and id had a deuced lucky month there thats all well sir he took up markss bill and he paid the other fellows that were upon me like a man sir that he did said strong enthusiastically and i shall be very happy to stand a bottle of claret for this company and as many more as the company chooses said mr altamont with a blush hallo waiter bring us a magnum of the right sort do you hear and well drink our healths all round sirand may every good fellow like strong find another good fellow to stand by him at a pinch thats my sentiment mr pendennis though i dont like your name no and why asked arthur strong pressed the colonels foot under the table here and altamont rather excited filled up another bumper nodded to pen drank off his wine and said he was a gentleman and that was sufficient and they were all gentlemen the meeting between these all gentlemen took place at richmond whither pendennis had gone to dinner and where he found the chevalier and his friend at table in the coffeeroom both of the latter were exceedingly hilarious talkative and excited by wine and strong who was an admirable storyteller told the story of his own siege and adventures and escapes with great liveliness and humor and described the talk of the sheriffs officers at his door the pretty little signals of fanny the grotesque exclamations of costigan when the chevalier burst in at his window and his final rescue by altamont in a most graphic manner and so as greatly to interest his hearers as for me its nothing altamont said when a ships paid off a chap spends his money you know and its the fellers at the black and red at badenbaden that did it i won a good bit of money there and intend to win a good bit more dont i strong im going to take him with me ive got a system ill make his fortune i tell you ill make your fortune if you likedammy every bodys fortune but what ill do and no mistake boys i promise you ill put in for that little fanny dammy sir what do you think she did she had two pound and im blest if she didnt go and lend it to ned strong didnt she ned lets drink her health with all my heart said arthur and pledged this toast with the greatest cordiality mr altamont then began with the greatest volubility and at great length to describe his system he said that it was infallible if played with coolness that he had it from a chap at baden who had lost by it it was true but because he had not capital enough if he could have stood one more turn of the wheel he would have all his money back that he and several more chaps were going to make a bank and try it and that he would put every shilling he was worth into it and had come back to this country for the express purpose of fetching away his money and captain strong that strong should play for him that he could trust strong and his temper much better than he could his own and much better than bloundellbloundell or the italian that stood in as he emptied his bottle the colonel described at full length all his plans and prospects to pen who was interested in listening to his story and the confessions of his daring and lawless goodhumor i met that queer fellow altamont the other day pen said to his uncle a day or two afterward altamont what altamont theres lord westports son said the major no no the fellow who came tipsy into claverings diningroom one day when we were there said the nephew laughing and he said he did not like the name of pendennis though he did me the honor to think that i was a good fellow i dont know any man of the name of altamont i give you my honor said the impenetrable major and as for your acquaintance i think the less you have to do with him the better arthur arthur laughed again he is going to quit the country and make his fortune by a gambling system he and my amiable college acquaintance bloundell are partners and the colonel takes out strong with him as aiddecamp what is it that binds the chevalier and clavering i wonder i should think mind you pen i should think but of course i have only the idea that there has been something in claverings previous life which gives these fellows and some others a certain power over him and if there should be such a secret which is no affair of ours my boy dammy i say it ought to be a lesson to a man to keep himself straight in life and not to give any man a chance over him why i think you have some means of persuasion over clavering uncle or why should he give me that seat in parliament clavering thinks he aint fit for parliament the major answered no more he is whats to prevent him from putting you or any body else into his place if he likes do you think that the government or the opposition would make any bones about accepting the seat if he offered it to them why should you be more squeamish than the first men and the most honorable men and men of the highest birth and position in the country begad the major had an answer of this kind to most of pens objections and pen accepted his uncles replies not so much because he believed them but because he wished to believe them we do a thingwhich of us has not not because every body does it but because we like it and our acquiescence alas proves not that every body is right but that we and the rest of the world are poor creatures alike at his next visit to tunbridge mr pen did not forget to amuse miss blanche with the history which he had learned at richmond of the chevaliers imprisonment and of altamonts gallant rescue and after he had told his tale in his usual satirical way he mentioned with praise and emotion little fannys generous behavior to the chevalier and altamonts enthusiasm in her behalf miss blanche was somewhat jealous and a good deal piqued and curious about fanny among the many confidential little communications which arthur made to miss amory in the course of their delightful rural drives and their sweet evening walks it may be supposed that our hero would not forget a story so interesting to himself and so likely to be interesting to her as that of the passion and care of the poor little ariadne of shepherds inn his own part in that drama he described to do him justice with becoming modesty the moral which he wished to draw from the tale being one in accordance with his usual satirical mood viz that women get over their first loves quite as easily as men do for the fair blanche in their intimes conversations did not cease to twit mr pen about his notorious failure in his own virgin attachment to the fotheringay and number one being withdrawn transfer themselves to number two without much difficulty and poor little fanny was offered up in sacrifice as an instance to prove this theory what griefs she had endured and surmounted what bitter pangs of hopeless attachment she had gone through what time it had taken to heal those wounds of the tender little bleeding heart mr pen did not know or perhaps did not choose to know for he was at once modest and doubtful about his capabilities as a conqueror of hearts and averse to believe that he had executed any dangerous ravages on that particular one though his own instance and argument told against himself in this case for if as he said miss fanny was by this time in love with her surgical adorer who had neither good looks nor good manners nor wit nor any thing but ardor and fidelity to recommend him must she not in her first sickness of the lovecomplaint have had a serious attack and suffered keenly for a man who had certainly a number of the showy qualities which mr huxter wanted you wicked odious creature miss blanche said i believe that you are enraged with fanny for being so impudent as to forget you and that you are actually jealous of mr huxter perhaps miss amory was right as the blush which came in spite of himself and tingled upon pendenniss cheek one of those blows with which a mans vanity is constantly slapping his face proved to pen that he was angry to think he had been superseded by such a rival by such a fellow as that without any conceivable good quality oh mr pendennis although this remark does not apply to such a smart fellow as you if nature had not made that provision for each sex in the credulity of the other which sees good qualities where none exist good looks in donkeys ears wit in their numskulls and music in their bray there would not have been near so much marrying and giving in marriage as now obtains and as is necessary for the due propagation and continuance of the noble race to which we belong jealous or not pen said and blanche i dont say no i should have liked fanny to have come to a better end than that i dont like histories that end in that cynical way and when we arrive at the conclusion of the story of a pretty girls passion to find such a figure as huxters at the last page of the tale is all life a compromise my lady fair and the end of the battle of love an ignoble surrender is the search for the cupid which my poor little psyche pursued in the darknessthe god of her souls longingthe god of the blooming cheek and rainbow pinionsto result in huxter smelling of tobacco and gallypots i wish though i dont see it in life that people could be like jenny and jessamy or my lord and lady clementina in the storybook and fashionable novels and at once under the ceremony and as it were at the parsons benediction become perfectly handsome and good and happy ever after and dont you intend to be good and happy pray monsieur le misanthropeand are you very discontented with your lotand will your marriage be a compromise asked the author of mes larmes with a charming moueand is your psyche an odious vulgar wretch you wicked satirical creature i cant abide you you take the hearts of young things play with them and fling them away with scorn you ask for love and trample on it youyou make me cry that you do arthur andand dontand i wont be consoled in that wayand i think fanny was quite right in leaving such a heartless creature again i dont say no said pen looking very gloomily at blanche and not offering by any means to repeat the attempt at consolation which had elicited that sweet monosyllable dont from the young lady i dont think i have much of what people call heart but i dont profess it i made my venture when i was eighteen and lighted my lamp and went in search of cupid and what was my discovery of lovea vulgar dancing woman i failed as every body does almost every body only it is luckier to fail before marriage than after merci du choix monsieur said the sylphide making a courtesy look my little blanche said pen taking her hand and with his voice of sad goodhumor at least i stoop to no flatteries quite the contrary said miss blanche and tell you no foolish lies as vulgar men do why should you and i with our experience ape romance and dissemble passion i do not believe miss blanche amory to be peerless among the beautiful nor the greatest poetess nor the most surpassing musician any more than i believe you to be the tallest woman in the whole worldlike the giantess whose picture we saw as we rode through the fair yesterday but if i dont set you up as a heroine neither do i offer you your very humble servant as a hero but i think you arewell there i think you are very sufficiently goodlooking merci miss blanche said with another courtesy i think you sing charmingly im sure youre clever i hope and believe that you are goodnatured and that you will be companionable and so provided i bring you a certain sum of money and a seat in parliament you condescend to fling to me your royal pockethandkerchief said blanche que dhonneur we used to call your highness the prince of fairoaks what an honor to think that i am to be elevated to the throne and to bring the seat in parliament as backsheesh to the sultan i am glad i am clever and that i can play and sing to your liking my songs will amuse my lords leisure and if thieves are about the house said pen grimly pursuing the simile forty besetting thieves in the shape of lurking cares and enemies in ambush and passions in arms my morgiana will dance round me with a tambourine and kill all my rogues and thieves with a smile wont she but pen looked as if he did not believe that she would ah blanche he continued after a pause dont be angry dont be hurt at my truthtelling dont you see that i always take you at your word you say you will be a slave and dancei say dance you say i take you with what you bring i say i take you with what you bring to the necessary deceits and hypocrisies of our life why add any that are useless and unnecessary if i offer myself to you because i think we have a fair chance of being happy together and because by your help i may get for both of us a good place and a not undistinguished name why ask me to feign raptures and counterfeit romance in which neither of us believe do you want me to come wooing in a prince prettymans dress from the masquerade warehouse and to pay you compliments like sir charles grandison do you want me to make you verses as in the days when we werewhen we were children i will if you like and sell them to bacon and bungay afterward shall i feed my pretty princess with bonbons mais jadore les bonbons moi said the little sylphide with a queer piteous look i can buy a hatful at fortnum and masons for a guinea and it shall have its bonbons its pootty little sugarplums that it shall pen said with a bitter smile nay my dear nay my dearest little blanche dont cry dry the pretty eyes i cant bear that and he proceeded to offer that consolation which the circumstance required and which the tears the genuine tears of vexation which now sprang from the angry eyes of the author of mes larmes demanded the scornful and sarcastic tone of pendennis quite frightened and overcame the girl ii dont want your consolation ii never wassospoken to befby any of mymyby any bodyshe sobbed out with much simplicity any body shouted out pen with a savage burst of laughter and blanche blushed one of the most genuine blushes which her cheek had ever exhibited and she cried out o arthur vous etes un homme terrible she felt bewildered frightened oppressed the worldly little flirt who had been playing at love for the last dozen years of her life and yet not displeased at meeting a master tell me arthur she said after a pause in this strange lovemaking why does sir francis clavering give up his seat in parliament au fait why does he give it to me asked arthur now blushing in his turn you always mock me sir she said if it is good to be in parliament why does sir francis go out my uncle has talked him over he always said that you were not sufficiently provided for in thethe family disputes when your mamma paid his debts so liberally it was stipulated i suppose that youthat is that ithat is upon my word i dont know why he goes out of parliament pen said with rather a forced laugh you see blanche that you and i are two good little children and that this marriage has been arranged for us by our mammas and uncles and that we must be obedient like a good little boy and girl so when pen went to london he sent blanche a box of bonbons each sugar plum of which was wrapped up in readymade french verses of the most tender kind and besides dispatched to her some poems of his own manufacture quite as artless and authentic and it was no wonder that he did not tell warrington what his conversations with miss amory had been of so delicate a sentiment were they and of a nature so necessarily private and if like many a worse and better man arthur pendennis the widows son was meditating an apostasy and going to sell himself towe all know whomat least the renegade did not pretend to be a believer in the creed to which he was ready to swear and if every woman and man in this kingdom who has sold her or himself for money or position as mr pendennis was about to do would but purchase a copy of his memoirs what tons of volumes the publishers would sell chapter xxvii in which pen begins his canvass illustration melancholy as the great house at clavering park had been in the days before his marriage when its bankrupt proprietor was a refugee in foreign lands it was not much more cheerful now when sir francis clavering came to inhabit it the greater part of the mansion was shut up and the baronet only occupied a few of the rooms on the ground floor where his housekeeper and her assistant from the lodge gate waited upon the luckless gentleman in his forced retreat and cooked a part of the game which he spent the dreary mornings in shooting lightfoot his man had passed over to my ladys service and as pen was informed in a letter from mr smirke who performed the ceremony had executed his prudent intention of marrying mrs bonner my ladys woman who in her mature years was stricken with the charms of the youth and endowed him with her savings and her mature person to be landlord and landlady of the clavering arms was the ambition of both of them and it was agreed that they were to remain in lady claverings service until quarterday arrived when they were to take possession of their hotel pen graciously promised that he would give his election dinner there when the baronet should vacate his seat in the young mans favor and as it had been agreed by his uncle to whom clavering seemed to be able to refuse nothing arthur came down in september on a visit to clavering park the owner of which was very glad to have a companion who would relieve his loneliness and perhaps would lend him a little ready money pen furnished his host with the desirable supplies a couple of days after he had made his appearance at clavering and no sooner were these small funds in sir franciss pocket than the latter found he had business at chatteris and at the neighboring wateringplaces of whichshire boasts many and went off to see to his affairs which were transacted as might be supposed at the county racegrounds and billiardrooms arthur could live alone well enough having many mental resources and amusements which did not require other persons company he could walk with the gamekeeper of a morning and for the evenings there was a plenty of books and occupation for a literary genius like mr arthur and who required but a cigar and a sheet of paper or two to make the night pass away pleasantly in truth in two or three days he had found the society of sir francis clavering perfectly intolerable and it was with a mischievous eagerness and satisfaction that he offered clavering the little pecuniary aid which the latter according to his custom solicited and supplied him with the means of taking flight from his own house besides our ingenious friend had to ingratiate himself with the townspeople of clavering and with the voters of the borough which he hoped to represent and he set himself to this task with only the more eagerness remembering how unpopular he had before been in clavering and determined to vanquish the odium which he had inspired among the simple people there his sense of humor made him delight in this task naturally rather reserved and silent in public he became on a sudden as frank easy and jovial as captain strong he laughed with every body who would exchange a laugh with him shook hands right and left with what may be certainly called a dexterous cordiality made his appearance at the marketday and the farmers ordinary and in fine acted like a consummate hypocrite and as gentlemen of the highest birth and most spotless integrity act when they wish to make themselves agreeable to their constituents and have some end to gain of the country folks how is it that we allow ourselves not to be deceived but to be ingratiated so readily by a glib tongue a ready laugh and a frank manner we know for the most part that it is false coin and we take it we know that it is flattery which it costs nothing to distribute to every body and we had rather have it than be without it friend pen went about at clavering laboriously simple and adroitly pleased and quite a different being from the scornful and rather sulky young dandy whom the inhabitants remembered ten years ago the rectory was shut up doctor portman was gone with his gout and his family to harrowgatean event which pen deplored very much in a letter to the doctor in which in a few kind and simple words he expressed his regret at not seeing his old friend whose advice he wanted and whose aid he might require some day but pen consoled himself for the doctors absence by making acquaintance with mr simcoe the opposition preacher and with the two partners of the clothfactory at chatteris and with the independent preacher there all of whom he met at the clavering athenaeum which the liberal party had set up in accordance with the advanced spirit of the age and perhaps in opposition to the aristocratic old readingroom into which the edinburgh review had once scarcely got an admission and where no tradesmen were allowed an entrance he propitiated the younger partner of the clothfactory by asking him to dine in a friendly way at the park he complimented the honorable mrs simcoe with hares and partridges from the same quarter and a request to read her husbands last sermon and being a little unwell one day the rascal took advantage of the circumstance to show his tongue to mr huxter who sent him medicines and called the next morning how delighted old pendennis would have been with his pupil pen himself was amused with the sport in which he was engaged and his success inspired him with a wicked goodhumor illustration and yet as he walked out of clavering of a night after presiding at a meeting of the athenaeum or working through an evening with mrs simcoe who with her husband was awed by the young londoners reputation and had heard of his social successes as he passed over the old familiar bridge of the rushing brawl and heard that wellremembered sound of waters beneath and saw his own cottage of fairoaks among the trees their darkling outlines clear against the starlit sky different thoughts no doubt came to the young mans mind and awakened pangs of grief and shame there there still used to be a light in the windows of the room which he remembered so well and in which the saint who loved him had passed so many hours of care and yearning and prayer he turned away his gaze from the faint light which seemed to pursue him with its wan reproachful gaze as though it was his mothers spirit watching and warning how clear the night was how keen the stars shone how ceaseless the rush of the flowing waters the old home trees whispered and waved gently their dark heads and branches over the cottage roof yonder in the faint starlight glimmer was the terrace where as a boy he walked of summer evenings ardent and trustful unspotted untried ignorant of doubts or passions sheltered as yet from the worlds contamination in the pure and anxious bosom of love the clock of the near town tolling midnight with a clang disturbs our wanderers reverie and sends him onward toward his nights restingplace through the lodge into clavering avenue and under the dark arcades of the rustling limes when he sees the cottage the next time it is smiling in sunset those bedroom windows are open where the light was burning the night before and pens tenant captain stokes of the bombay artillery whose mother old mrs stokes lives in clavering receives his landlords visit with great cordiality shows him over the grounds and the new pond he has made in the backgarden from the stables talks to him confidentially about the roof and chimneys and begs mr pendennis to name a day when he will do himself and mrs stokes the pleasure to c pen who has been a fortnight in the country excuses himself for not having called sooner upon the captain by frankly owning that he had not the heart to do it i understand you sir the captain says and mrs stokes who had slipped away at the ring of the bell how odd it seemed to pen to ring the bell comes down in her best gown surrounded by her children the young ones clamber about stokes the boy jumps into an armchair it was pens fathers armchair and arthur remembers the days when he would as soon have thought of mounting the kings throne as of seating himself in that armchair he asks if miss stokesshe is the very image of her mammaif she can play he should like to hear a tune on that piano she plays he hears the notes of the old piano once more enfeebled by age but he does not listen to the player he is listening to laura singing as in the days of their youth and sees his mother bending and beating time over the shoulder of the girl the dinner at fairoaks given in pens honor by his tenant and at which old mrs stokes captain glanders squire hobnell and the clergyman and his lady from tinckleton were present was very stupid and melancholy for pen until the waiter from clavering who aided the captains stableboy and mrs stokess butler whom pen remembered as a street boy and who was now indeed barber in that place dropped a plate over pens shoulder on which mr hobnell who also employed him remarked i suppose hodson your hands are slippery with bearsgrease hes always dropping the crockery about that hodson ishaw haw on which hodson blushed and looked so disconcerted that pen burst out laughing and good humor and hilarity were the order of the evening for the second course there was a hare and partridges top and bottom and when after the withdrawal of the servants pen said to the vicar of tinckleton i think mr stooks you should have asked hodson to cut the hare the joke was taken instantly by the clergyman who was followed in the course of a few minutes by captains stokes and glanders and by mr hobnell who arrived rather late but with an immense guffaw while mr pen was engaged in the country in the above schemes it happened that the lady of his choice if not of his affections came up to london from the tunbridge villa bound upon shopping expeditions or important business and in company of old mrs bonner her mothers maid who had lived and quarreled with blanche many times since she was an infant and who now being about to quit lady claverings service for the hymeneal state was anxious like a good soul to bestow some token of respectful kindness upon her old and young mistress before she quitted them altogether to take her post as the wife of lightfoot and landlady of the clavering arms the honest woman took the benefit of miss amorys taste to make the purchase which she intended to offer her ladyship and requested the fair blanche to choose something for herself that should be to her liking and remind her of her old nurse who had attended her through many a wakeful night and eventful teething and childish fever and who loved her like a child of her own amost these purchases were made and as the nurse insisted on buying an immense bible for blanche the young lady suggested that bonner should purchase a large johnsons dictionary for her mamma each of the two women might certainly profit by the present made to her then mrs bonner invested money in some bargains in linendrapery which might be useful at the clavering arms and bought a red and yellow neckhandkerchief which blanche could see at once was intended for mr lightfoot younger than herself by at least fiveandtwenty years mrs bonner regarded that youth with a fondness at once parental and conjugal and loved to lavish ornaments on his person which already glittered with pins rings shirtstuds and chains and seals purchased at the good creatures expense illustration it was in the strand that mrs bonner made her purchases aided by miss blanche who liked the fun very well and when the old lady had bought every thing that she desired and was leaving the shop blanche with a smiling face and a sweet bow to one of the shop said pray sir will you have the kindness to show us the way to shepherds inn shepherds inn was but a few score of yards off old castle street was close by the elegant young shopman pointed out the turning which the young lady was to take and she and her companion walked off together shepherds inn what can you want in shepherds inn miss blanche bonner inquired mr strong lives there do you want to go and see the captain i should like to see the captain very well i like the captain but it is not him i want i want to see a dear little good girl who was very kind toto mr arthur when he was so ill last year and saved his life almost and i want to thank her and ask her if she would like any thing i looked out several of my dresses on purpose this morning bonner and she looked at bonner as if she had a right to admiration and had performed an act of remarkable virtue blanche indeed was very fond of sugarplums she would have fed the poor upon them when she had had enough and given a country girl a ball dress when she had worn it and was tired of it pretty girl pretty young woman mumbled mrs bonner i know i want no pretty young women come about lightfoot and in imagination she peopled the clavering arms with a harem of the most hideous chambermaids and barmaids blanche with pink and blue and feathers and flowers and trinkets that wondrous invention a chatelaine was not extant yet or she would have had one we may be sure and a shot silk dress and a wonderful mantle and a charming parasol presented a vision of elegance and beauty such as bewildered the eyes of mrs bolton who was scrubbing the lodgefloor of shepherds inn and caused betsyjane and ameliarann to look with delight blanche looked on them with a smile of ineffable sweetness and protection like rowena going to see ivanhoe like marie antoinette visiting the poor in the famine like the marchioness of carabas alighting from her carriage and four at a paupertenants door and taking from john no ii the packet of epsom salts for the invalids benefit carrying it with her own imperial hand into the sick roomblanche felt a queen stepping down from her throne to visit a subject and enjoyed all the bland consciousness of doing a good action my good woman i want to see fannyfanny bolton is she here mrs bolton had a sudden suspicion from the splendor of blanches appearance that it must be a playactor or something worse what do you want with fanny pray she asked i am lady claverings daughteryou have heard of sir francis clavering and i wish very much indeed to see fanny bolton pray step in missbetsyjane wheres fanny betsyjane said fanny had gone into no staircase on which mrs bolton said she was probably in strongs rooms and bade the child go and see if she was there in captain strongs rooms oh let us go to captain strongs rooms cried out miss blanche i know him very well you dearest little girl show us the way to captain strong cried out miss blanche for the floor reeked with the recent scrubbing and the goddess did not like the smell of brown soap and as they passed up the stairs a gentleman by the name of costigan who happened to be swaggering about the court and gave a very knowing look with his oi under blanches bonnet remarked to himself thats a devilish foine gyurll bedad goan up to sthrong and altamont theyre always having foine gyurlls up their stairs halloohwhats that he presently said looking up at the windows from which some piercing shrieks issued at the sound of the voice of a distressed female the intrepid cos rushed up the stairs as fast as his old legs would carry him being nearly overthrown by strongs servant who was descending the stair cos found the outer door of strongs chambers opened and began to thunder at the knocker after many and fierce knocks the inner door was partially unclosed and strongs head appeared its oi me boy hwhats that noise sthrong asked costigan go to the d was the only answer and the door was shut on coss venerable red nose and he went down stairs muttering threats at the indignity offered to him and vowing that he would have satisfaction in the meanwhile the reader more lucky than captain costigan will have the privilege of being made acquainted with the secret which was withheld from that officer it has been said of how generous a disposition mr altamont was and when he was well supplied with funds how liberally he spent them of a hospitable turn he had no greater pleasure than drinking in company with other people so that there was no man more welcome at greenwich and richmond than the emissary of the nawaub of lucknow now it chanced that on the day when blanche and mrs bonner ascended the staircase to strongs room in shepherds inn the colonel had invited miss delaval of thetheatre royal and her mother mrs hodge to a little party down the river and it had been agreed that they were to meet at chambers and thence walk down to a port in the neighboring strand to take water so that when mrs bonner and mes larmes came to the door where grady altamonts servant was standing the domestic said walk in ladies with the utmost affability and led them into the room which was arranged as if they had been expected there indeed two bouquets of flowers bought at covent garden that morning and instances of the tender gallantry of altamont were awaiting his guests upon the table blanche smelt at the bouquet and put her pretty little dainty nose into it and tripped about the room and looked behind the curtains and at the books and prints and at the plan of clavering estate hanging up on the wall and had asked the servant for captain strong and had almost forgotten his existence and the errand about which she had come namely to visit fanny bolton so pleased was she with the new adventure and the odd strange delightful droll little idea of being in a bachelors chambers in a queer old place in the city grady meanwhile with a pair of ample varnished boots had disappeared into his masters room blanche had hardly the leisure to remark how big the boots were and how unlike mr strongs the womens come said grady helping his master to the boots did you ask em if they would take a glass of any thing asked altamont grady came outhe says will you take any thing to drink the domestic asked of them at which blanche amused with the artless question broke out into a pretty little laugh and asked of mrs bonner shall we take any thing to drink well you may take it or lave it said mr grady who thought his offer slighted and did not like the contemptuous manners of the newcomers and so left them will we take any thing to drink blanche asked again and again began to laugh grady bawled out a voice from the chamber withina voice that made mrs bonner start grady did not answer his song was heard from afar off from the kitchen his upper room where grady was singing at his work grady my coat again roared the voice from within why that is not mr strongs voice said the sylphide still half laughing grady my coatbonner who is grady my coat we ought to go away bonner still looked quite puzzled at the sound of the voice which she had heard the bedroom door here opened and the individual who had called out grady my coat appeared without the garment in question he nodded to the women and walked across the room i beg your pardon ladies grady bring my coat down sir well my dears its a fine day and well have a jolly lark at he said no more for here mrs bonner who had been looking at him with scared eyes suddenly shrieked out amory amory and fell back screaming and fainting in her chair the man so apostrophized looked at the woman an instant and rushing up to blanche seized her and kissed her yes betsy he said by git is me mary bonner knew me what a fine gal weve grown but its a secret mind im dead though im your father your poor mother dont know it what a pretty gal weve grown kiss mekiss me close my betsy dit i love you im your old father betsy or blanche looked quite bewildered and began to scream too once twice thrice and it was her piercing shrieks which captain costigan heard as he walked the court below at the sound of these shrieks the perplexed parent clasped his hands his wristbands were open and on one brawny arm you could see letters tattooed in blue and rushing to his apartment came back with an eau de cologne bottle from his grand silver dressingcase with the fragrant contents of which he began liberally to sprinkle bonner and blanche the screams of these women brought the other occupants of the chamber into the room grady from his kitchen and strong from his apartment in the upper story the latter at once saw from the aspect of the two women what had occurred grady go and wait in the court he said and if any body comes you understand me is it the playactress and her mother said grady yesconfound yousay that theres nobody in chambers and the partys off for today shall i say that sir and after i bought them bokays asked grady of his master yes said amory with a stamp of his foot and strong going to the door too reached it just in time to prevent the entrance of captain costigan who had mounted the stair the ladies from the theatre did not have their treat to greenwich nor did blanche pay her visit to fanny bolton on that day and cos who took occasion majestically to inquire of grady what the mischief was and who was cryinghad for answer that twas a woman another of them and that they were in gradys opinion the cause of most all the mischief in the world chapter xxviii in which pen begins to doubt about his election illustration while pen in his own county was thus carrying on his selfish plans and parliamentary schemes news came to him that lady rockminster had arrived at baymouth and had brought with her our friend laura at the announcement that laura his sister was near him pen felt rather guilty his wish was to stand higher in her esteem perhaps than in that of any other person in the world she was his mothers legacy to him he was to be her patron and protector in some sort how would she brave the news which he had to tell her and how should he explain the plans which he was meditating he felt as if neither he nor blanche could bear lauras dazzling glance of calm scrutiny and as if he would not dare to disclose his worldly hopes and ambitions to that spotless judge at her arrival at baymouth he wrote a letter thither which contained a great number of fine phrases and protests of affection and a great deal of easy satire and raillery in the midst of all which mr pen could not help feeling that he was in a panic and that he was acting like a rogue and hypocrite how was it that a single countrygirl should be the object of fear and trembling to such an accomplished gentleman as mr pen his worldly tactics and diplomacy his satire and knowledge of the world could not bear the test of her purity he felt somehow and he had to own to himself that his affairs were in such a position that he could not tell the truth to that honest soul as he rode from clavering to baymouth he felt as guilty as a schoolboy who doesnt know his lesson and is about to face the awful master for is not truth the master always and does she not have the power and hold the book under the charge of her kind though somewhat wayward and absolute patroness lady rockminster laura had seen somewhat of the world in the last year had gathered some accomplishments and profited by the lessons of society many a girl who had been accustomed to that too great tenderness in which lauras early life had been passed would have been unfitted for the changed existence which she now had to lead helen worshiped her two children and thought as homebred women will that all the world was made for them or to be considered after them she tended laura with a watchfulness of affection which never left her if she had a headache the widow was as alarmed as if there had never been an aching head before in the world she slept and woke read and moved under her mothers fond superintendence which was now withdrawn from her along with the tender creature whose anxious heart would beat no more and painful moments of grief and depression no doubt laura had when she stood in the great careless world alone nobody heeded her griefs or her solitude she was not quite the equal in social rank of the lady whose companion she was or of the friends and relatives of the imperious but kind old dowager some very likely bore her no goodwillsome perhaps slighted her it might have been that servants were occasionally rude their mistress certainly was often laura not seldom found herself in family meetings the confidence and familiarity of which she felt were interrupted by her intrusion and her sensitiveness of course was wounded at the idea that she should give or feel this annoyance how many governesses are there in the world thought cheerful laurahow many ladies whose necessities make them slaves and companions by profession what bad tempers and coarse unkindness have not these to encounter how infinitely better my lot is with these really kind and affectionate people than that of thousands of unprotected girls it was with this cordial spirit that our young lady adapted herself to her new position and went in advance of her fortune with a trustful smile did you ever know a person who met fortune in that way whom the goddess did not regard kindly are not even bad people won by a constant cheerfulness and a pure and affectionate heart when the babes in the wood in the ballad looked up fondly and trustfully at those notorious rogues whom their uncle had set to make away with the little folks we all know how one of the rascals relented and made away with the othernot having the heart to be unkind to so much innocence and beauty oh happy they who have that virgin loving trust and sweet smiling confidence in the world and fear no evil because they think none miss laura bell was one of these fortunate persons and besides the gentle widows little cross which as we have seen pen gave her had such a sparkling and brilliant kohinoor in her bosom as is even more precious than that famous jewel for it not only fetches a price and is retained by its owner in another world where diamonds are stated to be of no value but here too is of inestimable worth to its possessor is a talisman against evil and lightens up the darkness of life like cogia hassans famous stone so that before miss bell had been a year in lady rockminsters house there was not a single person in it whose love she had not won by the use of this talisman from the old lady to the lowest dependent of her bounty laura had secured the goodwill and kindness of every body with a mistress of such a temper my ladys woman who had endured her mistress for forty years and had been clawed and scolded and jibed every day and night in that space of time could not be expected to have a good temper of her own and was at first angry against miss laura as she had been against her ladyships fifteen preceding companions but when laura was ill at paris this old woman nursed her in spite of her mistress who was afraid of catching the fever and absolutely fought for her medicine with martha from fairoaks now advanced to be miss lauras own maid as she was recovering grandjean the chef wanted to kill her by the numbers of delicacies which he dressed for her and wept when she ate her first slice of chicken the swiss majordomo of the house celebrated miss bells praises in almost every european language which he spoke with indifferent incorrectness the coachman was happy to drive her out the page cried when he heard she was ill and calverley and coldstream those two footmen so large so calm ordinarily and so difficult to move broke out into extraordinary hilarity at the news of her convalescence and intoxicated the page at a wine shop to fete lauras recovery even lady diana pynsent our former acquaintance mr pynsent had married by this time lady diana who had had a considerable dislike to laura for some time was so enthusiastic as to say that she thought miss bell was a very agreeable person and that grandmamma had found a great trouvaille in her all this goodwill and kindness laura had acquired not by any arts not by any flattery but by the simple force of goodnature and by the blessed gift of pleasing and being pleased on the one or two occasions when he had seen lady rockminster the old lady who did not admire him had been very pitiless and abrupt with our young friend and perhaps pen expected when he came to baymouth to find laura installed in her house in the quality of humble companion and treated no better than himself when she heard of his arrival she came running down stairs and i am not sure that she did not embrace him in the presence of calverley and coldstream not that those gentleman ever told if the fractus orbis had come to a smash if laura instead of kissing pen had taken her scissors and snipped off his headcalverly and coldstream would have looked on impavidly without allowing a grain of powder to be disturbed by the calamity laura had so much improved in health and looks that pen could not but admire her the frank and kind eyes which met his beamed with good health the cheek which he kissed blushed with beauty as he looked at her artless and graceful pure and candid he thought he had never seen her so beautiful why should he remark her beauty now so much and remark too to himself that he had not remarked it sooner he took her fair trustful hand and kissed it fondly he looked in her bright clear eyes and read in them that kindling welcome which he was always sure to find there he was affected and touched by the tender tone and the pure sparkling glance their innocence smote him somehow and moved him how good you are to me laurasister said pen i dont deserve that you shouldthat you should be so kind to me mamma left you to me she said stooping down and brushing his forehead with her lips hastily you know you were to come to me when you were in trouble or to tell me when you were very happy that was our compact arthur last year before we parted are you very happy now or are you in trouble which is it and she looked at him with an arch glance of kindness do you like going into parliament do you intend to distinguish yourself there how i shall tremble for your first speech do you know about the parliament plan then pen asked knowall the world knows i have heard it talked about many times lady rockminsters doctor talked about it today i daresay it will be in the chatteris paper tomorrow it is all over the county that sir francis clavering of clavering is going to retire in behalf of mr arthur pendennis of fairoaks and that the young and beautiful miss blanche amory is what that too asked pendennis that too dear arthur tout se sait as somebody would say whom i intend to be very fond of and who i am sure is very clever and pretty i have had a letter from blanche the kindest of letters she speaks so warmly of you arthur i hopei know she feels what she writes when is it to be arthur why did you not tell me i may come and live with you then maynt i my home is yours dear laura and every thing i have pen said if i did not tell you it was becausebecausei do not know nothing is decided as yet no words have passed between us but you think blanche could be happy with medont you not a romantic fondness you know i have no heart i think ive told her so only a sobersided attachment and want my wife on one side of the fire and my sister on the other parliament in the session and fairoaks in the holidays and my laura never to leave me until somebody who has a right comes to take her away somebody who has a rightsomebody with a right why did pen as he looked at the girl and slowly uttered the words begin to feel angry and jealous of the invisible somebody with the right to take her away anxious but a minute ago how she would take the news regarding his probable arrangements with blanche pen was hurt somehow that she received the intelligence so easily and took his happiness for granted until somebody comes laura said with a laugh i will stay at home and be aunt laura and take care of the children when blanche is in the world i have arranged it all i am an excellent housekeeper do you know i have been to market at paris with mrs beck and have taken some lessons from m grandjean and i have had some lessons in paris in singing too with the money which you sent me you kind boy and i can sing much better now and i have learned to dance though not so well as blanche and when you become a minister of state blanche shall present me and with this and with a provoking goodhumor she performed for him the last parisian courtesy lady rockminster came in while this courtesy was being performed and gave to arthur one finger to shake which he took and over which he bowed as well as he could which in truth was very clumsily so you are going to be married sir said the old lady scold him lady rockminster for not telling us laura said going away which in truth the old lady began instantly to do so you are going to marry and to go into parliament in place of that goodfornothing sir francis clavering i wanted him to give my grandson his seatwhy did he not give my grandson his seat i hope you are to have a great deal of money with miss amory i wouldnt take her without a great deal sir francis clavering is tired of parliament pen said wincing andand i rather wish to attempt that career the rest of the story is at least premature i wonder when you had laura at home you could take up with such an affected little creature as that the old lady continued i am very sorry miss amory does not please your ladyship said pen smiling you meanthat it is no affair of mine and that i am not going to marry her well im not and im very glad i am nota little odious thingwhen i think that a man could prefer her to my laura ive no patience with him and so i tell you mr arthur pendennis i am very glad you see laura with such favorable eyes pen said you are very glad and you are very sorry what does it matter sir whether you are very glad or very sorry a young man who prefers miss amory to miss bell has no business to be sorry or glad a young man who takes up with such a crooked lump of affectation as that little amoryfor she is crooked i tell you she isafter seeing my laura has no right to hold up his head again where is your friend bluebeard the tall young man i meanwarrington isnt his name why does he not come down and marry laura what do the young men mean by not marrying such a girl as that they all marry for money now you are all selfish and cowards we ran away with each other and made foolish matches in my time i have no patience with the young men when i was at paris in the winter i asked all the three attaches at the embassy why they did not fall in love with miss bell they laughedthey said they wanted money you are all selfishyou are all cowards i hope before you offered miss bell to the attaches said pen with some heat you did her the favor to consult her miss bell has only a little money miss bell must marry soon somebody must make a match for her sir and a girl cant offer herself said the old dowager with great state laura my dear ive been telling your cousin that all the young men are selfish and that there is not a pennyworth of romance left among them he is as bad as the rest have you been asking arthur why he wont marry me said laura with a kindling smile coming back and taking her cousins hand she had been away perhaps to hide some traces of emotion which she did not wish others to see he is going to marry somebody else and i intend to be very fond of her and to go and live with them provided he then does not ask every bachelor who comes to his house why he does not marry me the terrors of pens conscience being thus appeased and his examination before laura over without any reproaches on the part of the latter pen began to find that his duty and inclination led him constantly to baymouth where lady rockminster informed him that a place was always reserved for him at her table and i recommend you to come often the old lady said for grandjean is an excellent cook and to be with laura and me will do your manners good it is easy to see that you are always thinking about yourself dont blush and stammeralmost all young men are always thinking about themselves my sons and grandsons always were until i cured them come here and let us teach you to behave properly you will not have to carve that is done at the sidetable hecker will give you as much wine as is good for you and on days when you are very good and amusing you shall have some champagne hecker mind what i say mr pendennis is miss lauras brother and you will make him comfortable and see that he does not have too much wine or disturb me while i am taking my nap after dinner you are selfish i intend to cure you of being selfish you will dine here when you have no other engagements and if it rains you had better put up at the hotel as long as the good lady could order every body round about her she was not hard to please and all the slaves and subjects of her little dowager court trembled before her but loved her she did not receive a very numerous or brilliant society the doctor of course was admitted as a constant and faithful visitor the vicar and his curate and on public days the vicars wife and daughters and some of the season visitors at baymouth were received at the old ladys entertainments but generally the company was a small one and mr arthur drank his wine by himself when lady rockminster retired to take her doze and to be played and sung to sleep by laura after dinner if my music can give her a nap said the goodnatured girl ought i not to be very glad that i can do so much good lady rockminster sleeps very little of nights and i used to read to her until i fell ill at paris since when she will not hear of my sitting up why did you not write to me when you were ill asked pen with a blush what good could you do me i had martha to nurse me and the doctor every day you are too busy to write to women or to think about them you have your books and your newspapers and your politics and your railroads to occupy you i wrote when i was well and pen looked at her and blushed again as he remembered that during all the time of her illness he had never written to her and had scarcely thought about her in consequence of his relationship pen was free to walk and ride with his cousin constantly and in the course of those walks and rides could appreciate the sweet frankness of her disposition and the truth simplicity and kindliness of her fair and spotless heart in their mothers lifetime she had never spoken so openly or so cordially as now the desire of poor helen to make an union between her two children had caused a reserve on lauras part toward pen for which under the altered circumstances of arthurs life there was now no necessity he was engaged to another woman and laura became his sister at oncehiding or banishing from herself any doubts which she might have as to his choice striving to look cheerfully forward and hope for his prosperity promising herself to do all that affection might do to make her mothers darling happy their talk was often about the departed mother and it was from a thousand stories which laura told him that arthur was made aware how constant and absorbing that silent maternal devotion had been which had accompanied him present and absent through life and had only ended with the fond widows last breath one day the people in clavering saw a lad in charge of a couple of horses at the churchyardgate and it was told over the place that pen and laura had visited helens grave together since arthur had come down into the country he had been there once or twice but the sight of the sacred stone had brought no consolation to him a guilty man doing a guilty deed a mere speculator content to lay down his faith and honor for a fortune and a worldly career and owning that his life was but a contemptible surrenderwhat right had he in the holy place what booted it to him in the world he lived in that others were no better than himself arthur and laura rode by the gates of fairoaks and he shook hands with his tenants children playing on the lawn and the terracelaura looked steadily at the cottage wall at the creeper on the porch and the magnolia growing up to her window mr pendennis rode by today one of the boys told his mother with a lady and he stopped and talked to us and he asked for a bit of honeysuckle off the porch and gave it the lady i couldnt see if she was pretty she had her veil down she was riding one of cramps horses out of baymouth as they rode over the downs between home and baymouth pen did not speak much though they rode very close together he was thinking what a mockery life was and how men refuse happiness when they may have it or having it kick it down or barter it with their eyes open for a little worthless money or beggarly honor and then the thought came what does it matter for the little space the lives of the best and purest of us are consumed in a vain desire and end in a disappointment as the dear souls who sleeps in her grave yonder she had her selfish ambition as much as caesar had and died balked of her lifes longing the stone covers over our hopes and our memories our place knows us not other peoples children are playing on the grass he broke out in a hard voice where you and i used to play laura and you see how the magnolia we planted has grown up since our time i have been round to one or two of the cottages where my mother used to visit it is scarcely more than a year that she is gone and the people whom she used to benefit care no more for her death than for queen annes we are all selfish the world is selfish there are but a few exceptions like you my dear to shine like good deeds in a naughty world and make the blackness more dismal i wish you would not speak in that way arthur said laura looking down and bending her head to the honeysuckle on her breast when you told the little boy to give me this you were not selfish a pretty sacrifice i made to get it for you said the sneerer but your heart was kind and full of love when you did so one can not ask for more than love and kindness and if you think humbly of yourself arthur the love and kindness are not diminishedare they i often thought our dearest mother spoiled you at home by worshiping you and that if you arei hate the wordwhat you say her too great fondness helped to make you so and as for the world when men go out into it i suppose they can not be otherwise than selfish you have to fight for yourself and to get on for yourself and to make a name for yourself mamma and your uncle both encouraged you in this ambition if it is a vain thing why pursue it i suppose such a clever man as you intend to do a great deal of good to the country by going into parliament or you would not wish to be there what are you going to do when you are in the house of commons women dont understand about politics my dear pen said sneering at himself as he spoke but why dont you make us understand i could never tell about mr pynsent why he should like to be there so much he is not a clever man he certainly is not a genius pynsent said pen lady diana says that he attends committees all day that then again he is at the house all night that he always votes as he is told that he never speaks that he will never get on beyond a subordinate place and as his grandmother tells him he is choked with redtape are you going to follow the same career arthur what is there in it so brilliant that you should be so eager for it i would rather that you should stop at home and write booksgood books kind books with gentle kind thoughts such as you have dear arthur and such as might do people good to read and if you do not win fame what then you own it is vanity and you can live very happily without it i must not pretend to advise but i take you at your own word about the world and as you own it is wicked and that it tires you ask you why you dont leave it and what would you have me do asked arthur i would have you bring your wife to fairoaks to live there and study and do good round about you i would like to see your own children playing on the lawn arthur and that we might pray in our mothers church again once more dear brother if the world is a temptation are we not told to pray that we may not be led into it do you think blanche would make a good wife for a petty country gentleman do you think i should become the character very well laura pen asked remember temptation walks about the hedgerows as well as the city streets and idleness is the greatest tempter of all what doesdoes mr warrington say said laura as a blush mounted up to her cheek and of which pen saw the fervor though lauras veil fell over her face to hide it pen rode on by lauras side silently for a while georges name so mentioned brought back the past to him and the thoughts which he had once had regarding george and laura why should the recurrence of the thought agitate him now that he knew the union was impossible why should he be curious to know if during the months of their intimacy laura had felt a regard for warrington from that day until the present time george had never alluded to his story and arthur remembered now that since then george had scarcely ever mentioned lauras name at last he came close to her tell me something laura he said she put back her veil and looked at him what is it arthur she askedthough from the tremor of her voice she guessed very well tell mebut for georges misfortunei never knew him speak of it before or since that daywould youwould you have given himwhat you refused me yes pen she said bursting into tears he deserved you better than i did poor arthur groaned forth with an indescribable pang at his heart i am but a selfish wretch and george is better nobler truer than i am god bless him yes pen said laura reaching out her hand to her cousin and he put his arm round her and for a moment she sobbed on his shoulder the gentle girl had had her secret and told it in the widows last journey from fairoaks when hastening with her mother to arthurs sick bed laura had made a different confession and it was only when warrington told his own story and described the hopeless condition of his life that she discovered how much her feelings had changed and with what tender sympathy with what great respect delight and admiration she had grown to regard her cousins friend until she knew that some plans she might have dreamed of were impossible and that warrington reading in her heart perhaps had told his melancholy story to warn her she had not asked herself whether it was possible that her affections could change and had been shocked and scared by the discovery of the truth how should she have told it to helen and confessed her shame poor laura felt guilty before her friend with the secret which she dared not confide to her felt as if she had been ungrateful for helens love and regard felt as if she had been wickedly faithless to pen in withdrawing that love from him which he did not even care to accept humbled even and repentant before warrington lest she should have encouraged him by undue sympathy or shown the preference which she began to feel the catastrophe which broke up lauras home and the grief and anguish which she felt for her mothers death gave her little leisure for thoughts more selfish and by the time she rallied from that grief the minor was also almost cured it was but for a moment that she had indulged a hope about warrington her admiration and respect for him remained as strong as ever but the tender feeling with which she knew she had regarded him was schooled into such calmness that it may be said to have been dead and passed away the pang which it left behind was one of humility and remorse o how wicked and proud i was about arthur she thought how selfconfident and unforgiving i never forgave from my heart this poor girl who was fond of him or him for encouraging her love and i have been more guilty than she poor little artless creature i professing to love one man could listen to another only too eagerly and would not pardon the change of feelings in arthur while i myself was changing and unfaithful and so humiliating herself and acknowledging her weakness the poor girl sought for strength and refuge in the manner in which she had been accustomed to look for them she had done no wrong but there are some folks who suffer for a fault ever so trifling as much as others whose stout consciences can walk under crimes of almost any weight and poor laura chose to fancy that she had acted in this delicate juncture of her life as a very great criminal she determined that she had done pen a great injury by withdrawing that love which privately in her mothers hearing she had bestowed upon him that she had been ungrateful to her dead benefactress by ever allowing herself to think of another or of violating her promise and that considering her own enormous crimes she ought to be very gentle in judging those of others whose temptations were much greater very likely and whose motives she could not understand a year back laura would have been indignant at the idea that arthur should marry blanche and her high spirit would have risen as she thought that from worldly motives he should stoop to one so unworthy now when the news was brought to her of such a chance the intelligence was given to her by old lady rockminster whose speeches were as direct and rapid as a slap on the face the humbled girl winced a little at the blow but bore it meekly and with a desperate acquiescence he has a right to marry he knows a great deal more of the world than i do she argued with herself blanche may not be so lightminded as she seemed and who am i to be her judge i daresay it is very good that arthur should go into parliament and distinguish himself and my duty is to do every thing that lies in my power to aid him and blanche and to make his home happy i daresay i shall live with them if i am godmother to one of their children i will leave her my three thousand pounds and forthwith she began to think what she could give blanche out of her small treasures and how best to conciliate her affection she wrote her forthwith a kind letter in which of course no mention was made of the plans in contemplation but in which laura recalled old times and spoke her goodwill and in reply to this she received an eager answer from blanche in which not a word about marriage was said to be sure but mr pendennis was mentioned two or three times in the letter and they were to be henceforth dearest laura and dearest blanche and loving sisters and so forth when pen and laura reached home after lauras confession pens noble acknowledgment of his own inferiority and generous expression of love for warrington causing the girls heart to throb and rendering doubly keen those tears which she sobbed on his shoulder a little slim letter was awaiting miss bell in the hall which she trembled rather guiltily as she unsealed and which pen blushed as he recognized for he saw instantly that it was from blanche laura opened it hastily and cast her eyes quickly over it as pen kept his fixed on her blushing she dates from london laura said she has been with old bonner lady claverings maid bonner is going to marry lightfoot the butler where do you think blanche has been she cried out eagerly to paris to scotland to the casino to shepherds inn to see fanny but fanny wasnt there and blanche is going to leave a present for her isnt it kind of her and thoughtful and she handed the letter to pen who read i saw madame mere who was scrubbing the room and looked at me with very scrubby looks but la belle fanny was not au logis and as i heard that she was in captain strongs apartments bonner and i mounted au troisieme to see this famous beauty another disappointmentonly the chevalier strong and a friend of his in the room so we came away after all without seeing the enchanting fanny je tenvoie mille et mille baisers when will that horrid canvassing be over sleeves are worn c c c after dinner the doctor was reading the times a young gentleman i attended when he was here some eight or nine years ago has come into a fine fortune the doctor said i see here announced the death of john henry foker esq of logwood hall at pau in the pyrenees on the th ult chapter xxix in which the major is bidden to stand and deliver illustration any gentleman who has frequented the wheel of fortune publichouse where it may be remembered that mr james morgans club was held and where sir francis clavering had an interview with major pendennis is aware that there are three rooms for guests upon the ground floor besides the bar where the landlady sits one is a parlor frequented by the public at large to another room gentlemen in livery resort and the third apartment on the door of which private is painted is that hired by the club of the confidentials of which messrs morgan and lightfoot were members the noiseless morgan had listened to the conversation between strong and major pendennis at the latters own lodgings and had carried away from it matter for much private speculation and a desire of knowledge had led him to follow his master when the major came to the wheel of fortune and to take his place quietly in the confidential room while pendennis and clavering had their discourse in the parlor there was a particular corner in the confidential room from which you could hear almost all that passed in the next apartment and as the conversation between the two gentlemen there was rather angry and carried on in a high key morgan had the benefit of overhearing almost the whole of it and what he heard strengthened the conclusions which his mind had previously formed he knew altamont at once did he when he saw him in sidney clavering aint no more married to my lady than i am altamonts the man altamonts a convick young harthur comes into parlyment and the govnor promises not to split by jove what a sly old rogue it is that old govnor no wonder hes anxious to make the match between blanche and harthur why shell have a hundred thousand if shes a penny and bring her man a seat in parlyment into the bargain nobody saw but a physiognomist would have liked to behold the expression of mr morgans countenance when this astounding intelligence was made clear to him but for my hage and the confounded prejudices of society he said surveying himself in the glass dammy james morgan you might marry her yourself but if he could not marry miss blanche and her fortune morgan thought he could mend his own by the possession of this information and that it might be productive of benefit to him from very many sources of all the persons whom the secret affected the greater number would not like to have it known for instance sir francis clavering whose fortune it involved would wish to keep it quiet colonel altamont whose neck it implicated would naturally be desirous to hush it and that young hupstart beast mr harthur who was for gettin into parlyment on the strenth of it and was as proud as if he was a duke with half a million a year such we grieve to say was morgans opinion of his employers nephew would pay any think sooner than let the world know that he was married to a convicks daughter and had got his seat in parlyment by trafficking with this secret as for lady c morgan thought if shes tired of clavering and wants to get rid of him shell pay if shes frightened about her son and fond of the little beggar shell pay all the same and miss blanche will certainly come down handsome to the man who will put her into her rights which she was unjustly defrauded of them and no mistake dammy concluded the valet reflecting upon this wonderful hand which luck had given him to play with such cards as these james morgan you are a made man it may be a reglar enewity to me every one of em must susscribe and with what ive made already i may cut business give my old govnor warning turn gentleman and have a servant of my own begad entertaining himself with calculations such as these that were not a little likely to perturb a mans spirit mr morgan showed a very great degree of selfcommand by appearing and being calm and by not allowing his future prospects in any way to interfere with his present duties one of the persons whom the story chiefly concerned colonel altamont was absent from london when morgan was thus made acquainted with his history the valet knew of sir francis claverings shepherds inn haunt and walked thither an hour or two after the baronet and pendennis had had their conversation together but that bird was flown colonel altamont had received his derby winnings and was gone to the continent the fact of his absence was exceedingly vexatious to mr morgan hell drop all that money at the gamblingshops on the rhind thought morgan and i might have had a good bit of it its confounded annoying to think hes gone and couldnt have waited a few days longer hope triumphant or deferred ambition or disappointment victory or patient ambush morgan bore all alike with similar equable countenance until the proper day came the majors boots were varnished and his hair was curled his early cup of tea was brought to his bedside his oaths rebukes and senile satire borne with silent obsequious fidelity who would think to see him waiting upon his master packing and shouldering his trunks and occasionally assisting at table at the countryhouses where he might be staying that morgan was richer than his employer and knew his secrets and other peoples in the profession mr morgan was greatly respected and admired and his reputation for wealth and wisdom got him much renown at most suppertables the younger gentlemen voted him stoopid a feller of no idears and a fogey in a word but not one of them would not say amen to the heartfelt prayer which some of the most seriousminded among the gentlemen uttered when i die may i cut up as well as morgan pendennis as became a man of fashion major pendennis spent the autumn passing from house to house of such country friends as were at home to receive him and if the duke happened to be abroad or the marquis in scotland condescending to sojourn with sir john or the plain squire to say the truth the old gentlemans reputation was somewhat on the wane many of the men of his time had died out and the occupants of their halls and the present wearers of their titles knew not major pendennis and little cared for his traditions of the wild prince and poyns and of the heroes of fashion passed away it must have struck the good man with melancholy as he walked by many a london door to think how seldom it was now opened for him and how often he used to knock at itto what banquets and welcome he used to pass through ita score of years back he began to own that he was no longer of the present age and dimly to apprehend that the young men laughed at him such melancholy musings must come across many a pall mall philosopher the men thinks he are not such as they used to be in his time the old grand manner and courtly grace of life are gone what is castlewood house and the present castlewood compared to the magnificence of the old mansion and owner the late lord came to london with four postchaises and sixteen horses all the north road hurried out to look at his cavalcade the people in london streets even stopped as his procession passed them the present lord travels with five bagmen in a railway carriage and sneaks away from the station smoking a cigar in a brougham the late lord in autumn filled castlewood with company who drank claret till midnight the present man buries himself in a hut on a scotch mountain and passes november in two or three closets in an entresol at paris where his amusements are a dinner at a cafe and a box at a little theatre what a contrast there is between his lady lorraine the regents lady lorraine and her little ladyship of the present era he figures to himself the first beautiful gorgeous magnificent in diamonds and velvets daring in rouge the wits of the world the old wits the old polished gentlemennot the canaille of today with their language of the cabstand and their coats smelling of smoke bowing at her feet and then thinks of todays lady lorrainea little woman in a black silk gown like a governess who talks astronomy and laboring classes and emigration and the deuce knows what and lurks to church at eight oclock in the morning abbotslorraine that used to be the noblest house in the county is turned into a monasterya regular la trappe they dont drink two glasses of wine after dinner and every other man at table is a country curate with a white neckcloth whose talk is about polly higsons progress at school or widow watkinss lumbago and the other young men those lounging guardsmen and great lazy dandiessprawling over sofas and billiardtables and stealing off to smoke pipes in each others bedrooms caring for nothing reverencing nothing not even an old gentleman who has known their fathers and their betters not even a pretty womanwhat a difference there is between these men who poison the very turnips and stubblefields with their tobacco and the gentlemen of our time thinks the major the breed is gonetheres no use for em theyre replaced by a parcel of damned cottonspinners and utilitarians and young sprigs of parsons with their hair combed down their backs im getting old theyre getting past me they laugh at us old boys thought old pendennis and he was not far wrong the times and manners which he admired were pretty nearly gonethe gay young men larked him irreverently while the serious youth had a grave pity and wonder at him which would have been even more painful to bear had the old gentleman been aware of its extent but he was rather simple his examination of moral questions had never been very deep it had never struck him perhaps until very lately that he was otherwise than a most respectable and rather fortunate man is there no old age but his without reverence did youthful folly never jeer at other bald pates for the past two or three years he had begun to perceive that his day was well nigh over and that the men of the new time had begun to reign after a rather unsuccessful autumn season then during which he was faithfully followed by mr morgan his nephew arthur being engaged as we have seen at clavering it happened that major pendennis came back for awhile to london at the dismal end of october when the fogs and the lawyers come to town who has not looked with interest at those loaded cabs piled boxes and crowded children rattling through the streets on the dun october evenings stopping at the dark houses where they discharge nurse and infant girls matron and father whose holidays are over yesterday it was france and sunshine or broadstairs and liberty today comes work and a yellow fog and ye gods what a heap of bills there lies in masters study and the clerk has brought the lawyers papers from chambers and in half an hour the literary man knows that the printers boy will be in the passage and mr smith with that little account that particular little account has called presentient of your arrival and has left word that he will call tomorrow morning at ten who among us has not said goodby to his holiday returned to dun london and his fate surveyed his labors and liabilities laid out before him and been aware of that inevitable little account to settle smith and his little account in the morning symbolize duty difficulty struggle which you will meet let us hope friend with a manly and honest heart and you think of him as the children are slumbering once more in their own beds and the watchful housewife tenderly pretends to sleep old pendennis had no special labors or bills to encounter on the morrow as he had no affection at home to soothe him he had always money in his desk sufficient for his wants and being by nature and habit tolerably indifferent to the wants of other people these latter were not likely to disturb him but a gentleman may be out of temper though he does not owe a shilling and though he may be ever so selfish he must occasionally feel dispirited and lonely he had had two or three twinges of gout in the countryhouse where he had been staying the birds were wild and shy and the walking over the plowed fields had fatigued him deucedly the young men had laughed at him and he had been peevish at table once or twice he had not been able to get his whist of an evening and in fine was glad to come away in all his dealings with morgan his valet he had been exceedingly sulky and discontented he had sworn at him and abused him for many days past he had scalded his mouth with bad soup at swindon he had left his umbrella in the railroad carriage at which piece of forgetfulness he was in such a rage that he cursed morgan more freely than ever both the chimneys smoked furiously in his lodgings and when he caused the windows to be flung open he swore so acrimoniously that morgan was inclined to fling him out of window too through that opened casement the valet swore after his master as pendennis went down the street on his way to the club bayss was not at all pleasant the house had been new painted and smelt of varnish and turpentine and a large streak of white paint inflicted itself on the back of the old boys furcollared surtout the dinner was not good and the three most odious men in all london old hawkshaw whose cough and accompaniments are fit to make any man uncomfortable old colonel gripley who seizes on all the newspapers and that irreclaimable old bore jawkins who would come and dine at the next table to pendennis and describe to him every innbill which he had paid in his foreign tour each and all of these disagreeable personages and incidents had contributed to make major pendennis miserable and the club waiter trod on his toe as he brought him his coffee never alone appear the immortals the furies always hunt in company they pursued pendennis from home to the club and from the club home while the major was absent from his lodgings morgan had been seated in the landladys parlor drinking freely of hot brandyandwater and pouring out on mrs brixham some of the abuse which he had received from his master upstairs mrs brixham was morgans slave he was his landladys landlord he had bought the lease of the house which she rented he had got her name and her sons to acceptances and a bill of sale which made him master of the luckless widows furniture the young brixham was a clerk in an insurance office and morgan could put him into what he called quod any day mrs brixham was a clergymans widow and mr morgan after performing his duties on the first floor had a pleasure in making the old lady fetch him his bootjack and his slippers she was his slave the little black profiles of her son and daughter the very picture of tiddlecot church where she was married and her poor dear brixham lived and died was now morgans property as it hung there over the mantlepiece of his backparlor morgan sate in the widows backroom in the excurates old horsehair studychair making mrs brixham bring supper for him and fill his glass again and again the liquor was bought with the poor womans own coin and hence morgan indulged in it only the more freely and he had eaten his supper and was drinking a third tumbler when old pendennis returned from the club and went upstairs to his rooms mr morgan swore very savagely at him and his bell when he heard the latter and finished his tumbler of brandy before he went up to answer the summons he received the abuse consequent on this delay in silence nor did the major condescend to read in the flushed face and glaring eyes of the man the anger under which he was laboring the old gentlemans footbath was at the fire his gown and slippers awaiting him there morgan knelt down to take his boots off with due subordination and as the major abused him from above kept up a growl of maledictions below at his feet thus when pendennis was crying confound you sir mind that strapcurse you dont wrench my foot off morgan sotto voce below was expressing a wish to strangle him drown him and punch his head off the boots removed it became necessary to divest mr pendennis of his coat and for this purpose the valet had necessarily to approach very near to his employer so near that pendennis could not but perceive what mr morgans late occupation had been to which he adverted in that simple and forcible phraseology which men are sometimes in the habit of using to their domestics informing morgan that he was a drunken beast and that he smelt of brandy at this the man broke out losing patience and flinging up all subordination im drunk am i im a beast am i im dd am i you infernal old miscreant shall i wring your old head off and drownd yer in that pail of water do you think im agoin to bear your confounded old harrogance you old wigsby chatter your old hivories at me do you you grinning old baboon come on if you are a man and can stand to a man ha you coward knives knives if you advance a step ill send it into you said the major seizing up a knife that was on the table near him go down stairs you drunken brute and leave the house send for your book and your wages in the morning and never let me see your insolent face again this dd impertinence of yours has been growing for some months past you have been growing too rich you are not fit for service get out of it and out of the house and where would you wish me to go pray out of the ouse asked the man and wont it be equal convenient tomorrow mornintootyfay mame shose sivvaplay munseer silence you beast and go cried out the major illustration morgan began to laugh with rather a sinister laugh look yere pendennis he said seating himself since ive been in this room youve called me beast brute dog and dd me havent you how do you suppose one man likes that sort of talk from another how many years have i waited on you and how many damns and cusses have you given me along with my wages do you think a mans a dog that you can talk to him in this way if i choose to drink a little why shouldnt i ive seen many a gentleman drunk formly and peraps have the abit from them i aint agoin to leave this house old feller and shall i tell you why the house is my house every stick of furnitur in it is mine excep your old traps and your showerbath and your wigbox ive bought the place i tell you with my own industry and perseverance i can show a hundred pound where you can show a fifty or your damned supersellious nephew either ive served you honorable done every thing for you these dozen years and im a dog am i im a beast am i thats the language for gentlemen not for our rank but ill bear it no more i throw up your service im tired on it ive combed your old wig and buckled your old girths and waistbands long enough i tell you dont look savage at me im sitting in my own chair in my own room atelling the truth to you ill be your beast and your brute and your dog no more major pendennis alfpay the fury of the old gentleman met by the servants abrupt revolt had been shocked and cooled by the concussion as much as if a sudden showerbath or a pail of cold water had been flung upon him that effect produced and his anger calmed morgans speech had interested him and he rather respected his adversary and his courage in facing him as of old days in the fencingroom he would have admired the opponent who hit him you are no longer my servant the major said and the house may be yours but the lodgings are mine and you will have the goodness to leave them tomorrow morning when we have settled our accounts i shall remove into other quarters in the mean time i desire to go to bed and have not the slightest wish for your farther company well have a settlement dont you be afraid morgan said getting up from his chair i aint done with you yet nor with your family nor with the clavering family major pendennis and that you shall know have the goodness to leave the room sirim tired said the major hah youll be more tired of me afore youve done answered the man with a sneer and walked out of the room leaving the major to compose himself as best he might after the agitation of this extraordinary scene he sate and mused by his fireside over the past events and the confounded impudence and ingratitude of servants and thought how he should get a new man how devilish unpleasant it was for a man of his age and with his habits to part with a fellow to whom he had been accustomed how morgan had a receipt for bootvarnish which was incomparably better and more comfortable to the feet than any he had ever tried how very well he made muttonbroth and tended him when he was unwell gad its a hard thine to lose a fellow of that sort but he must go thought the major he has grown rich and impudent since he has grown rich he was horribly tipsy and abusive tonight we must part and i must go out of the lodgings dammy i like the lodgings im used to em its very unpleasant at my time of life to change my quarters and so on mused the old gentleman the showerbath had done him good the testiness was gone the loss of the umbrella the smell of paint at the club were forgotten under the superior excitement confound the insolent villain thought the old gentleman he understood my wants to a nicety he was the best servant in england he thought about his servant as a man thinks of a horse that has carried him long and well and that has come down with him and is safe no longer how the deuce to replace him where can he get such another animal in these melancholy cogitations the major who had donned his own dressing gown and replaced his head of hair a little gray had been introduced into the coiffure of late by mr truefitt which had given the majors head the most artless and respectable appearance in these cogitations we say the major who had taken off his wig and put on his nighthandkerchief sate absorbed by the fireside when a feeble knock came at his door which was presently opened by the landlady of the lodgings god bless my soul mrs brixham cried out the major startled that a lady should behold him in the simple appareil of his nighttoilet itits very late mrs brixham illustration i wish i might speak to you sir said the landlady very piteously about morgan i suppose he has cooled himself at the pump cant take him back mrs brixham impossible id determined to part with him before when i heard of his dealings in the discount businessi suppose youve heard of them mrs brixham my servants a capitalist begad o sir said mrs brixham i know it to my cost i borrowed from him a little money five years ago and though i have paid him many times over i am entirely in his power i am ruined by him sir every thing i had is his hes a dreadful man eh mrs brixham tant pisdevlish sorry for you and that i must quit your house after lodging here so long theres no help for it i must go he says we must all go sir sobbed out the luckless widow he came down stairs from you just nowhe had been drinking and it always makes him very wickedand he said that you had insulted him sir and treated him like a dog and spoken to him unkindly and he swore he would be revenged andand i owe him a hundred and twenty pounds sirand he has a bill of sale of all my furnitureand says he will turn me out of my house and send my poor george to prison he has been the ruin of my family that man devlish sorry mrs brixham pray take a chair what can i do could you not intercede with him for us george will give half his allowance my daughter can send something if you will but stay on sir and pay a quarters rent in advance my good madam i would as soon give you a quarter in advance as not if i were going to stay in the lodgings but i cant and i cant afford to fling away twenty pounds my good madam im a poor halfpay officer and want every shilling i have begad as far as a few pounds goessay five poundsi dont sayand shall be most happy and that sort of thing and ill give it you in the morning with pleasure butbut its getting late and i have made a railroad journey gods will be done sir said the poor woman drying her tears i must bear my fate and a devlish hard one it is and most sincerely i pity you mrs brixham iill say ten pounds if you will permit me good night mr morgan sir when he came down stairs and whenwhen i besought him to have pity on me and told him he had been the ruin of my family said something which i did not well understandthat he would ruin every family in the housethat he knew something would bring you down tooand that you should pay him for youryour insolence to him ii must own to you that i went down on my knees to him sir and he said with a dreadful oath against you that he would have you on your knees meby gad that is too pleasant where is the confounded fellow he went away sir he said he should see you in the morning o pray try and pacify him and save me and my poor boy and the widow went away with this prayer to pass her night as she might and look for the dreadful morrow the last words about himself excited major pendennis so much that his compassion for mrs brixhams misfortunes was quite forgotten in the consideration of his own case me on my knees thought he as he got into bed confound his impudence who ever saw me on my knees what the devil does the fellow know gad ive not had an affair these twenty years i defy him and the old campaigner turned round and slept pretty sound being rather excited and amused by the events of the daythe last day in burystreet he was determined it should be for its impossible to stay on with a valet over me and a bankrupt landlady what good can i do this poor devil of a woman ill give her twenty poundtheres warringtons twenty pound which he has just paidbut whats the use shell want more and more and more and that cormorant morgan will swallow all no dammy i cant afford to know poor people and tomorrow ill say goodbyto mrs brixham and mr morgan chapter xxx in which the major neither yields his money nor his life illustration early next morning pendenniss shutters were opened by morgan who appeared as usual with a face perfectly grave and respectful bearing with him the old gentlemans clothes cans of water and elaborate toilet requisites its you is it said the old fellow from his bed i shant take you back again you understand i ave not the least wish to be took back agin major pendennis mr morgan said with grave dignity nor to serve you nor hany man but as i wish you to be comftable as long as you stay in my house i came up to do whats nessary and once more and for the last time mr james morgan laid out the silver dressingcase and strapped the shining razor these offices concluded he addressed himself to the major with an indescribable solemnity and said thinkin that you would most likely be in want of a respectable pusson until you suited yourself i spoke to a young man last night who is ere indeed said the warrior in the tentbed he ave lived in the fust families and i can vouch for his respectability you are monstrous polite grinned the old major and the truth is that after the occurrences of the previous evening morgan had gone out to his own club at the wheel of fortune and there finding frosch a courier and valet just returned from a foreign tour with young lord cubley and for the present disposable had represented to mr frosch that he morgan had a devil of a blow hup with his own govner and was goin to retire from the business haltogether and that if frosch wanted a tempory job he might probbly have it by applying in bury street you are very polite said the major and your recommendation i am sure will have every weight morgan blushed he felt his master was achaffin of him the man have waited on you before sir he said with great dignity lord de la pole sir gave him to his nephew young lord cubley and he have been with him on his foring tour and not wishing to go to fitzurse castle which froschs chest is delicate and he can not bear the cold in scotland he is free to serve you or not as you choose i repeat sir that you are exceedingly polite said the major come in froschyou will do very wellmr morgan will you have the great kindness to i shall show him what is nessary sir and what is customry for you to wish to ave done will you please to take breakfast ere or at the club major pendennis with your kind permission i will breakfast here and afterward we will make our little arrangements if you please sir will you now oblige me by leaving the room morgan withdrew the excessive politeness of his exemployer made him almost as angry as the majors bitterest words and while the old gentleman is making his mysterious toilet we will also modestly retire after breakfast major pendennis and his new aiddecamp occupied themselves in preparing for their departure the establishment of the old bachelor was not very complicated he encumbered himself with no useless wardrobe a bible his mothers a roadbook pens novel calf elegant and the duke of wellingtons dispatches with a few prints maps and portraits of that illustrious general and of various sovereigns and consorts of this country and of the general under whom major pendennis had served in india formed his literary and artistical collection he was always ready to march at a few hours notice and the cases in which he had brought his property into his lodgings some fifteen years before were still in the lofts amply sufficient to receive all his goods these the young woman who did the work of the house and who was known by the name of betty to her mistress and of slavey to mr morgan brought down from their resting place and obediently dusted and cleaned under the eyes of the terrible morgan his demeanor was guarded and solemn he had spoken no word as yet to mrs brixham respecting his threats of the past night but he looked as if he would execute them and the poor widow tremblingly awaited her fate old pendennis armed with his cane superintended the package of his goods and chattels under the hands of mr frosch and the slavey burned such of his papers as he did not care to keep flung open doors and closets until they were all empty and now all boxes and chests were closed except his desk which was ready to receive the final accounts of mr morgan that individual now made his appearance and brought his books as i wish to speak to you in privick peraps you will ave the kindness to request frosch to step down stairs he said on entering bring a couple of cabs frosch if you pleaseand wait down stairs until i ring for you said the major morgan saw frosch down stairs watched him go along the street upon his errand and produced his books and accounts which were simple and very easily settled and now sir said he having pocketed the check which his exemployer gave him and signed his name to his book with a flourish and now that accounts is closed between us sir he said i porpose to speak to you as one man to another morgan liked the sound of his own voice and as an individual indulged in public speaking whenever he could get an opportunity at the club or the housekeepers room and i must tell you that im in possussion of certing information and may i inquire of what nature pray asked the major its valuble information major pendennis as you know very well i know of a marriage as is no marriageof a honorable baronet as is no more married than i am and which his wife is married to somebody else as you know too sir pendennis at once understood all ha this accounts for your behavior you have been

secret and to trade on it why shouldnt i go halves major pendennis ive found it out too look here i aint goin to be unreasonable with you make it worth my while and ill keep the thing close let mr arthur take his seat and his rich wife if you like i dont want to marry her but i will have my share as sure as my names james morgan and if i dont and if you dont sirwhat pendennis asked if i dont i

a seat in parlyment out of sir francis and a fortune out of his wife mr pendennis knows no more of this business than the babe unborn sir cried the major aghast no more than lady clavering than miss amory does tell that to the marines major replied the valet that cock wont fight with me do you doubt my word you villain no bad language i dont care one twopenceapny whether your words true or not i tell you i intend this to be a nice little annuity to me major for i have every one of you and i aint such a fool as to let you go i should say that you might make it five hundred a year to me among you easy pay me down the first quarter now and im as mum as a mouse just give me a note for one twentyfive theres your checkbook on your desk and theres this too you villain cried the old gentleman in the desk to which the valet pointed was a little doublebarreled pistol which had belonged to pendenniss old patron the indian commanderinchief and which had accompanied him in many a campaign one more word you scoundrel and ill shoot you like a mad dog stopby jove ill do it now youll assault me will you youll strike at an old man will you you lying coward kneel down and say your prayers sir for by the lord you shall die the majors face glared with rage at his adversary who looked terrified before him for a moment and at the next with a shriek of murder sprang toward the open window under which a policeman happened to be on his beat murder police bellowed mr morgan to his surprise major pendennis wheeled away the table and walked to the other window which was also open he beckoned the policeman come up here policeman he said and then went and placed himself against the door you miserable sneak he said to morgan the pistol hasnt been loaded these fifteen years as you have known very well if you had not been such a coward that policeman is coming and i will have him up and have your trunks searched i have reason to believe that you are a thief sir i know you are ill swear to the things you gave em to meyou gave em to me cried morgan the major laughed well see he said and the guilty valet remembered some fine lawnfronted shirtsa certain goldheaded cane an operaglass which he had forgotten to bring down and of which he had assumed the use along with certain articles of his masters clothes which the old dandy neither wore nor asked for policeman x entered followed by the scared mrs brixham and her maidofallwork who had been at the door and found some difficulty in closing it against the street amateurs who wished to see the row the major began instantly to speak i have had occasion to discharge this drunken scoundrel he said both last night and this morning he insulted and assaulted me i am an old man and took up a pistol you see it is not loaded and this coward cried out before he was hurt i am glad you are come i was charging him with taking my property and desired to examine his trunks and his room the velvet cloak you aint worn these three years nor the weskits and i thought i might take the shirts and ii take my hoath i intended to put back the hoperaglass roared morgan writhing with rage and terror the man acknowledges that he is a thief the major said calmly he has been in my service for years and i have treated him with every kindness and confidence we will go upstairs and examine his trunks in those trunks mr morgan had things which he would fain keep from public eyes mr morgan the bill discounter gave goods as well as money to his customers he provided young spendthrifts with snuffboxes and pins and jewels and pictures and cigars and of a very doubtful quality those cigars and jewels and pictures were their display at a policeoffice the discovery of his occult profession and the exposure of the majors property which he had appropriated indeed rather than stolenwould not have added to the reputation of mr morgan he looked a piteous image of terror and discomfiture hell smash me will he thought the major ill crush him now and finish with him but he paused he looked at poor mrs brixhams scared face and he thought for a moment to himself that the man brought to bay and in prison might make disclosures which had best be kept secret and that it was best not to deal too fiercely with a desperate man stop he said policeman ill speak with this man by himself do you give mr morgan in charge said the policeman i have brought no charge as yet the major said with a significant look at his man thank you sir whispered morgan very low go outside the door and wait there policeman if you pleasenow morgan you have played one game with me and you have not had the best of it my good man no begad youve not had the best of it though you had the best hand and youve got to pay too now you scoundrel yes sir said the man ive

esquire of burystreet st jamess a major in her majestys service acknowledge that i received liberal wages and board wages from my employer during fifteen years you cant object to that i am sure said the major during fifteen years wrote morgan in which time by my own care and prudence the dictator resumed i have managed to amass sufficient money to purchase the house in which my master resides and besides to effect other savings among other persons from whom i have had money i may mention my present tenant mrs brixham who in consideration of sixty pounds advanced by me five years since has paid back to me the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds sterling besides giving me a note of hand for one hundred and twenty pounds which i restore to her at the desire of my late master major arthur pendennis and therewith free her furniture of which i had a bill of sale have you written i think if this pistol was loaded id blow your brains out said morgan no you wouldnt you have too great a respect for your valuable life my good man the major answered let us go on and begin a new sentence and having in return for my masters kindness stolen his property from him which i acknowledge to be now upstairs in my trunks and having uttered falsehoods regarding his and other honorable families i do hereby in consideration of his clemency to me express my regret for uttering these falsehoods and for stealing his property and declare that i am not worthy of belief and that i hopeyes begadthat i hope to amend for the future signed james morgan im dd if i sign it said morgan my good man it will happen to you whether you sign or no begad said the old fellow chuckling at his own wit there i shall not use this you understand unlessunless i am compelled to do so mrs brixham and our friend the policeman will witness it i dare say without reading it and i will give the old lady back her note of hand and say which you will confirm that she and you are quits i see there is frosch come back with the cab for my trunks i shall go to an hotel you may come in now policeman mr morgan and i have arranged our little dispute if mrs brixham will sign this paper and you policeman will do so i shall be very much obliged to you both mrs brixham you and your worthy landlord mr morgan are quits i wish you joy of him let frosch come and pack the rest of the things frosch aided by the slavey under the calm superintendence of mr morgan carried major pendenniss boxes to the cabs in waiting and mrs brixham when her persecutor was not by came and asked a heavens blessing upon the major her preserver and the best and quietest and kindest of lodgers and having given her a finger to shake which the humble lady received with a courtesy and over which she was ready to make a speech full of tears the major cut short that valedictory oration and walked out of the house to the hotel in jermyn street which was not many steps from morgans door that individual looking forth from the parlorwindow discharged any thing but blessings at his parting guest but the stout old boy could afford not to be frightened at mr morgan and flung him a look of great contempt and humor as he strutted away with his cane major pendennis had not quitted his house of bury street many hours and mr morgan was enjoying his otium in a dignified manner surveying the evening fog and smoking a cigar on the doorsteps when arthur pendennis esq the hero of this history made his appearance at the wellknown door my uncle out i suppose morgan he said to the functionary knowing full well that to smoke was treason in the presence of the major major pendennis is hout sir said morgan with gravity bowing but not touching the elegant cap which he wore major pendennis have left this ouse today sir and i have no longer the honor of being in his service sir indeed and where is he i believe he ave taken tempory lodgings at coxs otel in jummin street said mr morgan and added after a pause are you in town for some time pray sir are you in chambers i should like to have the honor of waiting on you there and would be thankful if you would favor me with a quarter of an hour do you want my uncle to take you back asked arthur insolent and goodnatured i want no such thing id see him the man glared at him for a minute but he stopped no sir thank you he said in a softer voice its only with you that i wish to speak on some business which concerns you and perhaps you would favor me by walking into my house if it is but for a minute or two i will listen to you morgan said arthur and thought to himself i suppose the fellow wants me to patronize him and he entered the house a card was already in the front windows proclaiming that apartments were to be let and having introduced mr pendennis into the diningroom and offered him a chair mr morgan took one himself and proceeded to convey some information to him with which the reader has already had cognizance chapter xxxi in which pendennis counts his eggs illustration our friend had arrived in london on that day only though but for a brief visit and having left some fellowtravelers at an hotel to which he had conveyed them from the west he hastened to the chambers in lambcourt which were basking in as much sun as chose to visit that dreary but not altogether comfortless building freedom stands in lieu of sunshine in chambers and templars grumble but take their ease in their inn pens domestic announced to him that warrington was in chambers too and of course arthur ran up to his friends room straightway and found it as of old perfumed with the pipe and george once more at work at his newspapers and reviews the pair greeted each other with the rough cordiality which young englishmen use one to another and which carries a great deal of warmth and kindness under its rude exterior warrington smiled and took his pipe out of his mouth and said well young one pen advanced and held out his hand and said how are you old boy and so this greeting passed between two friends who had not seen each other for months alphonse and frederic would have rushed into each others arms and shrieked ce bon coeur ce cher alphonse over each others shoulders max and wilhelm would have bestowed half a dozen kisses scented with havanna upon each others mustaches well young one how are you old boy is what two britons say after saving each others lives possibly the day before tomorrow they will leave off shaking hands and only wag their heads at one another as they come to breakfast each has for the other the very warmest confidence and regard each would share his purse with the other and hearing him attacked would break out in the loudest and most enthusiastic praise of his friend but they part with a mere goodby they meet with a mere howdyoudo and they dont write to each other in the interval curious modesty strange stoical decorum of english friendship yes we are not demonstrative like those confounded foreigners says hardman who not only shows no friendship but never felt any all his life long been in switzerland says pen yes says warrington couldnt find a bit of tobacco fit to smoke till we came to strasburg where i got some caporal the mans mind is full very likely of the great sights which he has seen of the great emotions with which the vast works of nature have inspired it but his enthusiasm is too coy to show itself even to his closest friend and he veils it with a cloud of tobacco he will speak more fully of confidential evenings however and write ardently and frankly about that which he is shy of saying the thoughts and experience of his travel will come forth in his writings as the learning which he never displays in talk enriches his style with pregnant allusion and brilliant illustration colors his generous eloquence and points his wit the elder gives a rapid account of the places which he has visited in his tour he has seen switzerland north italy and the tyrolhe has come home by vienna and dresden and the rhine he speaks about these places in a shy sulky voice as if he had rather not mention them at all and as if the sight of them had rendered him very unhappy the outline of the elder mans tour thus gloomily sketched out the young one begins to speak he has been in the countryvery much boredcanvassinguncommonly slowhe is here for a day or two and going on toto the neighborhood of tunbridge wells to some friendsthat will be uncommonly slow too how hard it is to make an englishman acknowledge that he is happy and the seat in parliament pen have you made it all right asks warrington all rightas soon as parliament meets and a new writ can be issued clavering retires and i step into his shoes says pen and under which king does bezonian speak or die asked warrington do we come out as liberal conservative or as government man or on our own hook hem there are no politics now every mans politics at least are pretty much the same i have not got acres enough to make me a protectionist nor could i be one i think if i had all the land in the county i shall go pretty much with government and in advance of them upon some social questions which i have been getting up during the vacation dont grin you old cynic i have been getting up the blue books and intend to come out rather strong on the sanitary and colonization questions we reserve to ourselves the liberty of voting against government though we are generally friendly we are however friends of the people avant tout we give lectures at the clavering institute and shake hands with the intelligent mechanics we think the franchise ought to be very considerably enlarged at the same time we are free to accept office some day when the house has listened to a few crack speeches from us and the administration perceives our merit i am not moses said pen with as usual somewhat of melancholy in his voice i have no laws from heaven to bring down to the people from the mountain i dont belong to the mountain at all or set up to be a leader and reformer of mankind my faith is not strong enough for that nor my vanity nor my hypocrisy great enough i will tell no lies george that i promise you and do no more than coincide in those which are necessary and pass current and cant be got in without recalling the whole circulation give a man at least the advantage of his skeptical turn if i find a good thing to say in the house i will say it a good measure i will support it a fair place i will take it and be glad of my luck but i would no more flatter a great man than a mob and now you know as much about my politics as i do what call have i to be a whig whiggism is not a divine institution why not vote with the liberal conservatives they have done for the nation what the whigs would never have done without them who converted boththe radicals and the country outside i think the morning post is often right and punch is often wrong i dont profess a call but take advantage of a chance parlons dautre chose the next thing at your heart after ambition is love i suppose warrington said how have our young loves prospered are we going to change our condition and give up our chambers are you going to divorce me arthur and take unto yourself a wife i suppose so she is very goodnatured and lively she sings and she dont mind smoking shell have a fair fortunei dont know how muchbut my uncle augurs every thing from the begums generosity and says that she will come down very handsomely and i think blanche is devilish fond of me said arthur with a sigh that means that we accept her caresses and her money havent we said before that life was a transaction pendennis said i dont pretend to break my heart about her i have told her pretty fairly what my feelings areandand have engaged myself to her and since i saw her last and for the last two months especially while i have been in the country i think she has been growing fonder and fonder of me and her letters to me and especially to laura seem to show it mine have been simple enoughno raptures nor vows you understandbut looking upon the thing as an affaire faite and not desirous to hasten or defer the completion and laura how is she warrington asked frankly laura george said pen looking his friend hard in the face by heaven laura is the best and noblest and dearest girl the sun ever shone upon his own voice fell as he spoke it seemed as if he could hardly utter the words he stretched out his hand to his comrade who took it and nodded his head have you only found out that now young un warrington said after a pause who has not learned things too late george cried arthur in his impetuous way gathering words and emotion as he went on whose life is not a disappointment who carries his heart entire to the grave without a mutilation i never knew any body who was happy quite or who has not had to ransom himself out of the hands of fate with the payment of some dearest treasure or other lucky if we are left alone afterward when we have paid our fine and if the tyrant visits us no more suppose i have found out that i have lost the greatest prize in the world now that it cant be minethat for years i had an angel under my tent and let her goam i the only oneah dear old boy am i the only one and do you think my lot is easier to bear because i own that i deserve if shes gone from us gods blessing be with her she might have staid and i lost her its like undine isnt it george she was in this room once said george he saw her therehe heard the sweet low voicehe saw the sweet smile and eyes shining so kindlythe face remembered so fondlythought of in what nightwatchesblest and loved alwaysgone now a glass that had held a nosegaya bible with helens handwritingwere all that were left him of that brief flower of his life say it is a dream say it passes better the recollection of a dream than an aimless waking from a blank stupor the two friends sate in silence awhile each occupied with his own thoughts and aware of the others pen broke it presently by saying that he must go and seek for his uncle and report progress to the old gentleman the major had written in a very bad humor the major was getting old i should like to see you in parliament and snugly settled with a comfortable house and an heir to the name before i make my bow show me these the major wrote and then let old arthur pendennis make room for the younger fellows he has walked the pall mall pave long enough there is a kindness about the old heathen said warrington he cares for somebody besides himself at least for some other part of himself besides that which is buttoned into his own coatfor you and your race he would like to see the progeny of the pendennises multiplying and increasing and hopes that they may inherit the land the old patriarch blesses you from the club window of bayss and is carried off and buried under the flags of st jamess church in sight of piccadilly and the cabstand and the carriages going to the levee it is an edifying ending the new blood i bring into the family mused pen is rather tainted if i had chosen i think my fatherinlaw amory would not have been the progenitor i should have desired for my race nor my grandfatherinlaw snell nor our oriental ancestors by the way who was amory amory was lieutenant of an indiaman blanche wrote some verses about him about the storm the mountain wave the seamans grave the gallant father and that sort of thing amory was drowned commanding a country ship between calcutta and sydney amory and the begum werent happy together she has been unlucky in her selection of husbands the good old lady for between ourselves a more despicable creature than sir francis clavering of clavering park baronet never never legislated for his country broke in warrington at which pen blushed rather by the way at baden said warrington i found our friend the chevalier strong in great state and wearing his orders he told me that he had quarreled with clavering of whom he seemed to have almost as bad an opinion as you have and in fact i think though i will not be certain confided to me his opinion that clavering was an utter scoundrel that fellow bloundell who taught you cardplaying at oxbridge was with strong and time i think has brought out his valuable qualities and rendered him a more accomplished rascal than he was during your undergraduateship but the king of the place was the famous colonel altamont who was carrying all before him giving fetes to the whole society and breaking the bank it was said my uncle knows something about that fellowclavering knows something about him theres something louche regarding him but come i must go to burystreet like a dutiful nephew and taking his hat pen prepared to go i will walk too said warrington and they descended the stairs stopping however at pens chambers which as the reader has been informed were now on the lower story here pen began sprinkling himself with eaudecologne and carefully scenting his hair and whiskers with that odoriferous water what is the matter youve not been smoking is it my pipe that has poisoned you growled warrington i am going to call upon some women said pen imim going to dine with em they are passing through town and are at an hotel in jermynstreet warrington looked with goodnatured interest at the young fellow dandifying himself up to a pitch of completeness and appearing at length in a gorgeous shirtfront and neckcloth fresh gloves and glistening boots george had a pair of thick highlows and his old shirt was torn about the breast and ragged at the collar where his blue beard had worn it well young un said he simply i like you to be a buck somehow when i walk about with you it is as if i had a rose in my buttonhole and you are still affable i dont think there is any young fellow in the temple turns out like you and i dont believe you were ever ashamed of walking with me yet dont laugh at me george said pen i say pen continued the other sadly if you writeif you write to laura i wish you would say god bless her for me pen blushed and then looked at warrington and thenand then burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughing im going to dine with her he said i brought her and lady rockminster up from the country todaymade two days of itslept last night at bathi say george come and dine too i may ask any one i please and the old lady is constantly talking about you george refused george had an article to write george hesitated and oh strange to say at last he agreed to go it was agreed that they should go and call upon the ladies and they marched away in high spirits to the hotel in jermynstreet once more the dear face shone upon him once more the sweet voice spoke to him and the tender hand pressed a welcome there still wanted halfanhour to dinner you will go and see your uncle now mr pendennis old lady rockminster said you will not bring him to dinnernohis old stories are intolerable and i want to talk to mr warrington i daresay he will amuse us i think we have heard all your stories we have been together for two whole days and i think we are getting tired of each other so obeying her ladyships orders arthur went down stairs and walked to his uncles lodgings chapter xxxii fiat justitia illustration the dinner was served when arthur returned and lady rockminster began to scold him for arriving late but laura looking at her cousin saw that his face was so pale and scared that she interrupted her imperious patroness and asked with tender alarm what had happened was arthur ill arthur drank a large bumper of sherry i have heard the most extraordinary news i will tell you afterward he said looking at the servants he was very nervous and agitated during the dinner dont tramp and beat so with your feet under the table lady rockminster said you have trodden on fido and upset his saucer you see mr warrington keeps his boots quiet at the dessertit seemed as if the unlucky dinner would never be overlady rockminster said this dinner has been exceedingly stupid i suppose something has happened and that you want to speak to laura i will go and have my nap i am not sure that i shall have any teano good night mr warrington you must come again and when there is no business to talk about and the old lady tossing up her head walked away from the room with great dignity george and the others had risen with her and warrington was about to go away and was saying goodnight to laura who of course was looking much alarmed about her cousin when arthur said pray stay george you should hear my news too and give me your counsel in this case i hardly know how to act in it its something about blanche arthur said laura her heart beating and her cheek blushing as she thought it had never blushed in her life yesand the most extraordinary story said pen when i left you to go to my uncles lodgings i found his servant morgan who has been with him so long at the door and he said that he and his master had parted that morning that my uncle had quitted the house and had gone to an hotelthis hotel i asked for him when i came in but he was gone out to dinner morgan then said that he had something of a most important nature to communicate to me and begged me to step into the house his house it is now it appears the scoundrel has saved a great deal of money while in my uncles service and is now a capitalist and a millionaire for what i know well i went into the house and what do you think he told me this must be a secret between us allat least if we can keep it now that it is in possession of that villain blanches father is not dead he has come to life again the marriage between clavering and the begum is no marriage and blanche i suppose is her grandfathers heir said warrington perhaps but the child of what a father amory is an escaped convictclavering knows it my uncle knows itand it was with this piece of information held over clavering in terrorem that the wretched old man got him to give up his borough to me blanche doesnt know it said laura nor poor lady clavering no said pen blanche does not even know the history of her father she knew that he and her mother had separated and had heard as a child from bonner her nurse that mr amory was drowned in new south wales he was there as a convict not as a ships captain as the poor girl thought lady clavering has told me that they were not happy and that her husband was a bad character she would tell me all she said some day and i remember her saying to me with tears in her eyes that it was hard for a woman to be forced to own that she was glad to hear her husband was dead and that twice in her life she should have chosen so badly what is to be done now the man cant show and claim his wife death is probably over him if he discovers himself return to transportation certainly but the rascal has held the threat of discovery over clavering for some time past and has extorted money from him time after time it is our friend colonel altamont of course said warrington i see all now if the rascal comes back continued arthur morgan who knows his secret will use it over himand having it in his possession proposes to extort money from us all the dd rascal supposed i was cognizant of it said pen white with anger asked me if i would give him an annuity to keep it quiet threatened me me as if i was trafficking with this wretched old begums misfortune and would extort a seat in parliament out of that miserable clavering good heavens was my uncle mad to tamper in such a conspiracy fancy our mothers son laura trading on such a treason i cant fancy it dear arthur said laura seizing arthurs hand and kissing it no broke out warringtons deep voice with a tremor he surveyed the two generous and loving young people with a pang of indescribable love and pain no our boy cant meddle with such a wretched intrigue as that arthur pendennis cant marry a convicts daughter and sit in parliament as member for the hulks you must wash your hands of the whole affair pen you must break off you must give no explanations of why and wherefore but state that family reasons render a match impossible it is better that those poor women should fancy you false to your word than that they should know the truth besides you can get from that dog claveringi can fetch that for you easily enoughan acknowledgement that the reasons which you have given to him as the head of the family are amply sufficient for breaking off the union dont you think with me laura he scarcely dared to look her in the face as he spoke any lingering hope that he might haveany feeble hold that he might feel upon the last spar of his wrecked fortune he knew he was casting away and he let the wave of his calamity close over him pen had started up while he was speaking looking eagerly at him he turned his head away he saw laura rise up also and go to pen and once more take his hand and kiss it she thinks so toogod bless her said george her fathers shame is not blanches fault dear arthur is it laura said very pale and speaking very quickly suppose you had been married would you desert her because she had done no wrong are you not pledged to her would you leave her because she is in misfortune and if she is unhappy wouldnt you console her our mother would had she been here and as she spoke the kind girl folded her arms round him and buried her face upon his heart our mother is an angel with god pen sobbed out and you are the dearest and best of womenthe dearest the dearest and the best teach me my duty pray for me that i may do itpure heart god bless yougod bless you my sister amen groaned out warrington with his head in his hands she is right he murmured to himself she cant do any wrong i think that girl indeed she looked and smiled like an angel many a day after he saw that smilesaw her radiant face as she looked up at pensaw her putting back her curls blushing and smiling and still looking fondly toward him she leaned for a moment her little fair hand on the table playing on it and now and now she said looking at the two gentlemen and what now asked george and now we will have some tea said miss laura with her smile but before this unromantic conclusion to a rather sentimental scene could be suffered to take place a servant brought word that major pendennis had returned to the hotel and was waiting to see his nephew upon this announcement laura not without some alarm and an appealing look to pen which said behave yourself wellhold to the right and do your dutybe gentle but firm with your unclelaura we say with these warnings written in her face took leave of the two gentlemen and retreated to her dormitory warrington who was not generally fond of tea yet grudged that expected cup very much why could not old pendennis have come in an hour later well an hour sooner or later what matter the hour strikes at last the inevitable moment comes to say farewell the hand is shaken the door closed and the friend gone and the brief joy over you are alone in which of those many windows of the hotel does her light beam perhaps he asks himself as he passes down the street he strides away to the smokingroom of a neighboring club and there applies himself to his usual solace of a cigar men are brawling and talking loud about politics operagirls horseracing the atrocious tyranny of the committee bearing this sacred secret about him he enters into this brawl talk away each louder than the other rattle and crack jokes laugh and tell your wild stories it is strange to take ones place and part in the midst of the smoke and din and think every man here has his secret ego most likely which is sitting lonely and apart away in the private chamber from the loud game in which the rest of us is joining arthur as he traversed the passages of the hotel felt his anger rousing up within him he was indignant to think that yonder old gentleman whom he was about to meet should have made him such a tool and puppet and so compromised his honor and good name the old fellows hand was very cold and shaky when arthur took it he was coughing he was grumbling over the fire frosch could not bring his dressinggown or arrange his papers as that dd confounded impudent scoundrel of a morgan the old gentleman bemoaned himself and cursed morgans ingratitude with peevish pathos the confounded impudent scoundrel he was drunk last night and challenged me to fight him pen and bedad at one time i was so excited that i thought i should have driven a knife into him and the infernal rascal has made ten thousand pound i believeand deserves to be hanged and will be but curse him i wish he could have lasted out my time he knew all my ways and dammy when i rang the bell the confounded thief brought the thing i wantednot like that stupid german lout and what sort of time have you had in the country been a good deal with lady rockminster you cant do better she is one of the old schoolvieille ecole bonne ecole hey dammy they dont make gentlemen and ladies now and in fifty years youll hardly know one man from another but theyll last my time i aint long for this business i am getting very old pen my boy and gad i was thinking today as i was packing up my little library theres a bible among the books that belonged to my poor mother i would like you to keep that pen i was thinking sir that you would most likely open the box when it was your property and the old fellow was laid under the sod sir and the major coughed and wagged his old head over the fire his agehis kindness disarmed pens anger somewhat and made arthur feel no little compunction for the deed which he was about to do he knew that the announcement which he was about to make would destroy the darling hope of the old gentlemans life and create in his breast a woeful anger and commotion heyheyim off sir nodded the elder but id like to read a speech of yours in the times before i gomr pendennis said unaccustomed as i am to public speakinghey sir hey arthur begad you look devlish well and healthy sir i always said my brother jack would bring the family right you must go down into the west and buy the old estate sir nec tenui penna hey well rise again sirrise again on the wingand begad i shouldnt be surprised that you will be a baronet before you die his words smote pen and it is i he thought that am going to fling down the poor old fellows aircastle well it must be here goes ii went into your lodgings at burystreet though i did not find you pen slowly beganand i talked with morgan uncle indeed the old gentlemans cheek began to flush involuntarily and he muttered the cats out of the bag now begad he told me a story sir which gave me the deepest surprise and pain said pen the major tried to look unconcerned whatthat story about aboutwhatdoyoucallem hey about miss amorys fatherabout lady claverings first husband and who he is and what hema devilish awkward affair said the old man rubbing his nose iive been aware of thatehconfounded circumstance for some time i wish i had known it sooner or not at all said arthur gloomily he is all safe thought the senior greatly relieved gad i should have liked to keep it from you altogetherand from those two poor women who are as innocent as unborn babes in the transaction you are right there is no reason why the two women should hear it and i shall never tell themthough that villain morgan perhaps may arthur said gloomily he seems disposed to trade upon his secret and has already proposed terms of ransom to me i wish i had known of the matter earlier sir it is not a very pleasant thought to me that i am engaged to a convicts daughter the very reason why i kept it from youmy dear boy but miss amory is not a convicts daughter dont you see miss amory is the daughter of lady clavering with fifty or sixty thousand pounds for a fortune and her fatherinlaw a baronet and country gentleman of high reputation approves of the match and gives up his seat in parliament to his soninlaw what can be more simple is it true sir begad yes it is true of course its true amorys dead i tell you he is dead the first sign of life he shows he is dead he cant appear we have him at a deadlock like the fellow in the playthe critic heydevilish amusing play that critic monstrous witty man sheridan and so was his son by gad sir when i was at the cape i remember the old gentlemans garrulity and wish to conduct arthur to the cape perhaps arose from a desire to avoid the subject which was near est his nephews heart but arthur broke out interrupting him if you had told me this tale sooner i believe you would have spared me and yourself a great deal of pain and disappointment and i should not have found myself tied to an engagement from which i cant in honor recede no begad weve fixed youand a man whos fixed to a seat in parliament and a pretty girl with a couple of thousand a year is fixed to no bad thing let me tell you said the old man great heavens sir said arthur are you blind cant you see see what young gentleman asked the other see that rather than trade upon this secret of amorys arthur cried out i would go and join my fatherinlaw at the hulks see that rather than take a seat in parliament as a bribe from clavering for silence i would take the spoons off the table see that you have given me a felons daughter for a wife doomed me to poverty and shame cursed my career when it might have beenwhen it might have been so different but for you dont you see that we have been playing a guilty game and have been overreached that in offering to marry this poor girl for the sake of her money and the advancement she would bring i was degrading myself and prostituting my honor what in heavens name do you mean sir cried the old man i mean to say that there is a measure of baseness which i cant pass arthur said i have no other words for it and am sorry if they hurt you i have felt for months past that my conduct in this affair has been wicked sordid and worldly i am rightly punished by the event and having sold myself for money and a seat in parliament by losing both how do you mean that you lose either shrieked the old gentleman who the devils to take your fortune or your seat away from you by g clavering shall give em to you you shall have every shilling of eighty thousand pounds ill keep my promise to miss amory sir said arthur and begad her parents shall keep theirs to you not so please god arthur answered i have sinned but heaven help me i will sin no more i will let clavering off from that bargain which was made without my knowledge i will take no money with blanche but that which was originally settled upon her and i will try to make her happy you have done it you have brought this on me sir but you knew no better and i forgive arthurin gods namein your fathers who by heavens was the proudest man alive and had the honor of the family always at heartin minefor the sake of a poor broken down old fellow who has always been devlish fond of youdont fling this chance awayi pray you i beg you i implore you my dear dear boy dont fling this chance away its the making of you youre sure to get on youll be a baronet its three thousand a year dammy on my knees there i beg of you dont do this and the old man actually sank down on his knees and seizing one of arthurs hands looked up piteously at him it was cruel to remark the shaking hands the wrinkled and quivering face the old eyes weeping and winking the broken voice ah sir said arthur with a groan you have brought pain enough on me spare me this you have wished me to marry blanche i marry her for gods sake sir rise i cant bear it youyou mean to say that you will take her as a beggar and be one yourself said the old gentleman rising up and coughing violently i look at her as a person to whom a great calamity has befallen and to whom i am promised she can not help the misfortune and as she had my word when she was prosperous i shall not withdraw it now she is poor i will not take claverings seat unless afterward it should be given of his free will i will not have a shilling more than her original fortune have the kindness to ring the bell said the old gentleman i have done my best and said my say and im a devlish old fellow andandit dont matter andand shakspeare was rightand cardinal wolseybegadand had i but served my god as ive served youyes on my knees by jove to my own nephewi mightnt have beengoodnight sir you neednt trouble yourself to call again arthur took his hand which the old man left to him it was quite passive and clammy he looked very much oldened and it seemed as if the contest and defeat had quite broken him on the next day he kept his bed and refused to see his nephew chapter xxxiii in which the deck begins to clear when arrayed in his dressinggown pen walked up according to custom to warringtons chambers next morning to inform his friend of the issue of the last nights interview with his uncle and to ask as usual for georges advice and opinion mrs flanagan the laundress was the only person whom arthur found in the dear old chambers george had taken a carpethag and was gone his address was to his brothers house in suffolk packages addressed to the newspaper and review for which he wrote lay on the table awaiting delivery i found him at the table when i came the dear gentleman mrs flanagan said writing at his papers and one of the candles was burned out and hard as his bed is he wasnt in it all night sir indeed having sat at the club until the brawl there became intolerable to him george had walked home and had passed the night finishing some work on which he was employed and to the completion of which he bent himself with all his might the labor was done and the night was worn away somehow and the tardy november dawn came and looked in on the young man as he sate over his desk in the next days paper or quarters review many of us very likely admired the work of his genius the variety of his illustration the fierce vigor of his satire the depth of his reason there was no hint in his writing of the other thoughts which occupied him and always accompanied him in his worka tone more melancholy than was customary a satire more bitter and impatient than that which he afterward showed may have marked the writings of this period of his life to the very few persons who knew his style or his name we have said before could we know the mans feelings as well as the authors thoughtshow interesting most books would be more interesting than merry i suppose harlequins face behind his mask is always grave if not melancholycertainly each man who lives by the pen and happens to read this must remember if he will his own experiences and recall many solemn hours of solitude and labor what a constant care sate at the side of the desk and accompanied him fever or sickness were lying possibly in the next room a sick child might be there with a wife watching over it terrified and in prayer or grief might be bearing him down and the cruel mist before the eyes rendering the paper scarce visible as he wrote on it and the inexorable necessity drove on the pen what man among us has not had nights and hours like these but to the manly heartsevere as these pangs are they are endurable long as the night seems the dawn comes at last and the wounds heal and the fever abates and rest comes and you can afford to look back on the past misery with feelings that are any thing but bitter two or three books for reference fragments of torn up manuscript drawers open pens and inkstand lines half visible on the blotting paper a bit of sealing wax twisted and bitten and broken into sundry piecessuch relics as these were about the table and pen flung himself down in georges empty chairnoting things according to his wont or in spite of himself there was a gap in the bookcase next to the old college plato with the boniface arms where helens bible used to be he has taken that with him thought pen he knew why his friend was gone dear dear old george pen rubbed his hand over his eyes o how much wiser how much better how much nobler he is than i he thought where was such a friend or such a brave heart where shall i ever hear such a frank voice and kind laughter where shall i ever see such a true gentleman no wonder she loved him god bless him what was i compared to him what could she do else but love him to the end of our days we will be her brothers as fate wills that we can be no more well be her knights and wait on her and when were old well say how we loved her dear dear old george when pen descended to his own chambers his eye fell on the letterbox of his outer door which he had previously overlooked and there was a little note to a p esq in georges wellknown handwriting george had put into pens box probably as he was going away dr peni shall be half way home when you breakfast and intend to stay over christmas in norfolk or elsewhere i have my own opinion of the issue of matters about which we talked in jstreet yesterday and think my presence de trop vale gw give my very best regards and adieux to your cousin and so george was gone and mrs flanagan the laundress ruled over his empty chambers illustration pen of course had to go and see his uncle on the day after their colloquy and not being admitted he naturally went to lady rockministers apartments where the old lady instantly asked for bluebeard and insisted that he should come to dinner bluebeard is gone pen said and he took out poor georges scrap of paper and handed it to laura who looked at itdid not look at pen in return but passed the paper back to him and walked away pen rushed into an eloquent eulogium upon his dear old george to lady rockminister who was astonished at his enthusiasm she had never heard him so warm in praise of any body and told him with her usual frankness that she didnt think it had been in his nature to care so much about any other person as mr pendennis was passing in waterlooplace in one of his many walks to the hotel where laura lived and whither duty to his uncle carried arthur every day arthur saw issuing from messrs gimcracks celebrated shop an old friend who was followed to his brougham by an obsequious shopman bearing parcels the gentleman was in the deepest mourning the brougham the driver and the horse were in mourning grief in easy circumstances and supported by the comfortablest springs and cushions was typified in the equipage and the little gentleman its proprietor what foker hail foker cried out penthe reader no doubt has likewise recognized arthurs old schoolfellowand he held out his hand to the heir of the late lamented john henry foker esq the master of logwood and other houses the principal partner in the great brewery of foker co the greater portion of fokers entire a little hand covered with a glove of the deepest ebony and set off by three inches of a snowy wristband was put forth to meet arthurs salutation the other little hand held a little morocco case containing no doubt something precious of which mr foker had just become proprietor in messrs gimcracks shop pens keen eyes and satiric turn showed him at once upon what errand mr foker had been employed and he thought of the heir in horace pouring forth the gathered wine of his fathers vats and that human nature is pretty much the same in regentstreet as in the via sacra le roi est mort vive le roi said arthur ah said the other yes thank youvery much obliged how do you do pen very busygoodby and he jumped into the black brougham and sate like a little black care behind the black coachman he had blushed on seeing pen and showed other signs of guilt and perturbation which pen attributed to the novelty of his situation and on which he began to speculate in his usual sardonic manner yes so wags the world thought pen the stone closes over harry the fourth and harry the fifth reigns in his stead the old ministers at the brewery come and kneel before him with their books the draymen his subjects fling up their red caps and shout for him what a grave deference and sympathy the bankers and the lawyers show there was too great a stake at issue between those two that they should ever love each other very cordially as long as one man keeps another out of twenty thousand a year the younger must be always hankering after the crown and the wish must be the father to the thought of possession thank heaven there was no thought of money between me and our dear mother laura there never could have been you would have spurned it cried laura why make yourself more selfish than you are pen and allow your mind to own for an instant that it would have entertained suchsuch dreadful meanness you make me blush for you arthur you make me her eyes finished this sentence and she passed her handkerchief across them there are some truths which women will never acknowledge pen said and from which your modesty always turns away i do not say that i ever knew the feeling only that i am glad i had not the temptation is there any harm in that confession of weakness we are all taught to ask to be delivered from evil arthur said laura in a low voice i am glad if you were spared from that great crime and only sorry to think that you could by any possibility have been led into it but you never could and you dont think you could your acts are generous and kind you disdain mean actions you take blanche without money and without a bribe yes thanks be to heaven dear brother you could not have sold yourself away i knew you could not when it came to the day and you did not praise bebe where praise is due why does this horrid skepticism pursue you my arthur why doubt and sneer at your own heartat every ones oh if you knew the pain you give mehow i lie awake and think of those hard sentences dear brother and wish them unspoken unthought do i cause you many thoughts and many tears laura asked arthur the fullness of innocent love beamed from her in reply a smile heavenly pure a glance of unutterable tenderness sympathy pity shone in her faceall which indications of love and purity arthur beheld and worshiped in her as you would watch them in a child as one fancies one might regard them in an angel ii dont know what i have done he said simply to have merited such regard from two such women it is like undeserved praise lauraor too much good fortune which frightens oneor a great post when a man feels that he is not fit for it ah sister how weak and wicked we are how spotless and full of love and truth heaven made you i think for some of you there has been no fall he said looking at the charming girl with an almost paternal glance of admiration you cant help having sweet thoughts and doing good actions dear creature they are the flowers which you bear and what else sir asked laura i see a sneer coming over your face what is it why does it come to drive all the good thoughts away a sneer is there i was thinking my dear that nature in making you so good and loving did very well but but what what is that wicked but and why are you always calling it up but will come in spite of us but is reflection but is the skeptics familiar with whom he has made a compact and if he forgets it and indulges in happy daydreams or building of air castles or listens to sweet music let us say or to the bells ringing to church but taps at the door and says master i am here you are my master but i am yours go where you will you cant travel without me i will whisper to you when you are on your knees at church i will be at your marriage pillow i will sit down at your table with your children i will be behind your deathbed curtain that is what but is pen said pen you frighten me cried laura do you know what but came and said to me just now when i was looking at you but said if that girl had reason as well as love she would love you no more if she knew you as you arethe sullied selfish being which you knowshe must part from you and could give you no love and no sympathy didnt i say he added fondly that some of you seem exempt from the fall love you know but the knowledge of evil is kept from you what is this you young folks are talking about asked lady rockminster who at this moment made her appearance in the room having performed in the mystic retirement of her own apartments and under the hands of her attendant those elaborate toiletrites without which the worthy old lady never presented herself to public view mr pendennis you are always coming here it is very pleasant to be here arthur said and we were talking when you came in about my friend foker whom i met just now and who as your ladyship knows has succeeded to his fathers kingdom he has a very fine property he has fifteen thousand a year he is my cousin he is a very worthy young man he must come and see me said lady rockminster with a look at laura he has been engaged for many years past to his cousin lady lady ann is a foolish little chit lady rockminster said with much dignity and i have no patience with her she has outraged every feeling of society she has broken her fathers heart and thrown away fifteen thousand a year thrown away what has happened asked pen it will be the talk of the town in a day or two and there is no need why i should keep the secret any longer said lady rockminster who had written and received a dozen letters on the subject i had a letter yesterday from my daughter who was staying at drummington until all the world was obliged to go away on account of the frightful catastrophe which happened there when mr foker came home from nice and after the funeral lady ann went down on her knees to her father said that she never could marry her cousin that she had contracted another attachment and that she must die rather than fulfill her contract poor lord rosherville who is dreadfully embarrassed showed his daughter what the state of his affairs was and that it was necessary that the arrangements should take place and in fine we all supposed that she had listened to reason and intended to comply with the desires of her family but what has happenedlast thursday she went out after breakfast with her maid and was married in the very church in drummington park to mr hobson her fathers own chaplain and her brothers tutor a redhaired widower with two children poor dear rosherville is in a dreadful way he wishes henry foker should marry alice or barbara but alice is marked with the smallpox and barbara is ten years older than he is and of course now the young man is his own master he will think of choosing for himself the blow on lady agnes is very cruel she is inconsolable she has the house in grosvenorstreet for her life and her settlement which was very handsome have you not met her yes she dined one day at lady claveringsthe first day i saw you and a very disagreeable young man i thought you were but i have formed you we have formed him havent we laura where is bluebeard let him come that horrid grindley the dentist will keep me in town another week to the latter part of her ladyships speech arthur gave no ear he was thinking for whom could foker be purchasing those trinkets which he was carrying away from the jewelers why did harry seem anxious to avoid him could he be still faithful to the attachment which had agitated him so much and sent him abroad eighteen months back psha the bracelets and presents were for some of harrys old friends of the opera or the french theatre rumors from naples and paris rumors such as are borne to club smokingrooms had announced that the young man had found distractions or precluded from his virtuous attachment the poor fellow had flung himself back upon his old companions and amusementsnot the only man or woman whom society forces into evil or debars from good not the only victim of the worlds selfish and wicked laws as a good thing when it is to be done can not be done too quickly laura was anxious that pens marriage intentions should be put into execution as speedily as possible and pressed on his arrangements with rather a feverish anxiety why could she not wait pen could afford to do so with perfect equanimity but laura would hear of no delay she wrote to pen she implored pen she used every means to urge expedition it seemed as if she could have no rest until arthurs happiness was complete she offered herself to dearest blanche to come and stay at tunbridge with her when lady rockminster should go on her intended visit to the reigning house of rockminster and although the old dowager scolded and ordered and commanded laura was deaf and disobedient she must go to tunbridge she would go to tunbridge she who ordinarily had no will of her own and complied smilingly with any bodys whim and caprices showed the most selfish and obstinate determination in this instance the dowager lady must nurse herself in her rheumatism she must read herself to sleep if she would not hear her maid whose voice croaked and who made sad work of the sentimental passages in the novelslaura must go and be with her new sister in another week she proposed with many loves and regards to dear lady clavering to pass some time with dearest blanche dearest blanche wrote instantly in reply to dearest lauras no to say with what extreme delight she should welcome her sister how charming it would be to practice their old duets together to wander oer the grassy sward and amidst the yellowing woods of penshurst and southborough blanche counted the hours till she should embrace her dearest friend laura no expressed her delight at dearest blanches affectionate reply she hoped that their friendship would never diminish that the confidence between them would grow in after years that they should have no secrets from each other that the aim of the life of each would be to make one person happy blanche no followed in two days how provoking their house was very small the two spare bedrooms were occupied by that horrid mrs planter and her daughter who had thought proper to fall ill she always fell ill in country houses and she could not or would not be moved for some days laura no it was indeed very provoking l had hoped to hear one of dearest bs dear songs on friday but she was the more consoled to wait because lady r was not very well and liked to be nursed by her poor major pendennis was very unwell too in the same hoteltoo unwell even to see arthur who was constant in his calls on his uncle arthurs heart was full of tenderness and affection she had known arthur all her life she would answeryes even in italics she would answerfor his kindness his goodness and his gentleness blanche no what is this most surprising most extraordinary letter from ap what does dearest laura know about it what has happened what what mystery is enveloped under his frightful reserve blanche no requires an explanation and it can not be better given than in the surprising and mysterious letter of arthur pendennis chapter xxxiv mr and mrs sam huxter dear blanche arthur wrote you are always reading and dreaming pretty dramas and exciting romances in real life are you now prepared to enact a part of one and not the pleasantest part dear blanchethat in which the heroine takes possession of her fathers palace and wealth and introducing her husband to the loyal retainers and faithful vassals greets her happy bridegroom with all of this is mine and thine but the other characterthat of the luckless lady who suddenly discovers that she is not the princes wife but claude melnottes the beggars that of alnaschars wife who comes in just as her husband has kicked over the tray of porcelain which was to be the making of his fortune but stay alnaschar who kicked down the china was not a married man he had cast his eye on the viziers daughter and his hopes of her went to the ground with the shattered bowls and teacups will you be the viziers daughter and refuse and laugh to scorn alnaschar or will you be the lady of lyons and love the penniless claude melnotte i will act that part if you like i will love you my best in return i will do my all to make your humble life happy for humble it will be at least the odds are against any other conclusion we shall live and die in a poor prosy humdrum way there will be no stars and epaulets for the hero of our story i shall write one or two more stories which will presently be forgotten i shall be called to the bar and try to get on in my profession perhaps some day if i am very lucky and work very hard which is absurd i may get a colonial appointment and you may be an indian judges lady meanwhile i shall buy back the pall mall gazette the publishers are tired of it since the death of poor shandon and will sell it for a small sum warrington will be my right hand and write it up to a respectable sale i will introduce you to mr finucane the subeditor and i know who in the end will be mrs finucanea very nice gentle creature who has lived sweetly through a sad lifeand we will jog on i say and look out for better times and earn our living decently you shall have the operaboxes and superintend the fashionable intelligence and break your little heart in the poets corner shall we live over the officesthere are four very good rooms a kitchen and a garret for laura in catherinestreet in the strand or would you like a house in the waterlooroadit would be very pleasant only there is that halfpenny toll at the bridge the boys may go to kings college maynt they does all this read to you like a joke ah dear blanche it is no joke and i am sober and telling the truth our fine daydreams are gone our carriage has whirled out of sight like cinderellas our house in belgravia has been whisked away into the air by a malevolent genius and i am no more a member of parliament than i am a bishop on his bench in the house of lords or a duke with a garter at his knee you know pretty well what my property is and your own little fortune we may have enough with those two to live in decent comfort to take a cab sometimes when we go out to see our friends and not to deny ourselves an omnibus when we are tired but that is all is that enough for you my little dainty lady i doubt sometimes whether you can bear the life which i offer youat least it is fair that you should know what it will be if you say yes arthur i will follow your fate whatever it may be and be a loyal and loving wife to aid and cheer youcome to me dear blanche and may god help me so that i may do my duty to you if not and you look to a higher station i must not bar blanches fortunei will stand in the crowd and see your ladyship go to court where you are presented and you shall give me a smile from your chariot window i saw lady mirable going to the drawingroom last season the happy husband at her side glittered with stars and cordons all the flowers in the garden bloomed in the coachmans bosom will you have these and the chariot or walk on foot and mend your husbands stockings i can not tell you nowafterward i might should the day come when we may have no secrets from one anotherwhat has happened within the last few hours which has changed all my prospects in life but so it is that i have learned something which forces me to give up the plans which i had formed and many vain and ambitious hopes in which i had been indulging i have written and dispatched a letter to sir francis clavering saying that i can not accept his seat in parliament until after my marriage in like manner i can not and will not accept any larger fortune with you than that which has always belonged to you since your grandfathers death and the birth of your halfbrother your good mother is not in the least awarei hope she never may beof the reasons which force me to this very strange decision they arise from a painful circumstance which is attributable to none of our faults but having once befallen they are as fatal and irreparable as that shock which overset honest alnaschars porcelain and shattered all his hopes beyond the power of mending i write gayly enough for there is no use in bewailing such a hopeless mischance we have not drawn the great prize in the lottery dear blanche but i shall be contented enough without it if you can be so and i repeat with all my heart that i will do my best to make you happy and now what news shall i give you my uncle is very unwell and takes my refusal of the seat in parliament in sad dudgeon the scheme was his poor old gentleman and he naturally bemoans its failure but warrington laura and i had a council of war they know this awful secret and back me in my decision you must love george as you love what is generous and upright and noble and as for laurashe must be our sister blanche our saint our good angel with two such friends at home what need we care for the world without or who is member for clavering or who is asked or not asked to the great balls of the season to this frank communication came back the letter from blanche to laura and one to pen himself which perhaps his own letter justified you are spoiled by the world blanche wrote you do not love your poor blanche as she would be loved or you would not offer thus lightly to take her or leave her no arthur you love me nota man of the world you have given me your plighted troth and are ready to redeem it but that entire affection that love whole and abiding wherewhere is that vision of my youth i am but a pastime of your life and i would be its allbut a fleeting thought and i would be your whole soul i would have our two hearts one but ah my arthur how lonely yours is how little you give me of it you speak of our parting with a smile on your lip of our meeting and you care not to hasten it is life but a disillusion then and are the flowers of our garden faded away i have wepti have prayedi have passed sleepless hoursi have shed bitter bitter tears over your letter to you i bring the gushing poesy of my beingthe yearnings of the soul that longs to be lovedthat pines for love love love beyond allthat flings itself at your feet and cries love me arthur your heart beats no quicker at the kneeling appeal of my loveyour proud eye is dimmed by no tear of sympathyyou accept my souls treasure as though twere dross not the pearls from the unfathomable deeps of affection not the diamonds from the caverns of the heart you treat me like a slave and bid me bow to my master is this the guerdon of a free maidenis this the price of a lifes passion ah me when was it otherwise when did love meet with aught but disappointment could i hope fond fool to be the exception to the lot of my race and lay my fevered brow on a heart that comprehended my own foolish girl that i was one by one all the flowers of my young life have faded away and this the last the sweetest the dearest the fondly the madly loved the wildly cherishedwhere is it but no more of this heed not my bleeding heartbless you bless you always arthur i will write more when i am more collected my racking brain renders thought almost impossible i long to see laura she will come to us directly we return from the country will she not and you cold one b the words of this letter were perfectly clear and written in blanches neatest hand upon her scented paper and yet the meaning of the composition not a little puzzled pen did blanche mean to accept or to refuse his polite offer her phrases either meant that pen did not love her and she declined him or that she took him and sacrificed herself to him cold as he was he laughed sardonically over the letter and over the transaction which occasioned it he laughed to think how fortune had jilted him and how he deserved his slippery fortune he turned over and over the musky giltedged riddle it amused his humor he enjoyed it as if it had been a funny story he was thus seated twiddling the queer manuscript in his hand joking grimly to himself when his servant came in with a card from a gentleman who wished to speak to him very particularly and if pen had gone out into the passage he would have seen sucking his stick rolling his eyes and showing great marks of anxiety his old acquaintance mr samuel huxter mr huxter on particular business pray beg mr huxter to come in said pen amused rather and not the less so when poor sam appeared before him pray take a chair mr huxter said pen in his most superb manner in what way can i be of service to you i had rather not speak before the flunkbefore the man mr pendennis on which mr arthurs attendant quitted the room im in a fix said mr huxter gloomily indeed she sent me to you continued the young surgeon what fanny is she well i was coming to see her but i have had a great deal of business since my return to london i heard of you through my governor and jack hobnell broke in huxter i wish you joy mr pendennis both of the borough and the lady sir fanny wishes you joy too he added with something of a blush theres many a slip between the cup and the lip who knows what may happen mr huxter or who will sit in parliament for clavering next session you can do any thing with my governor continued mr huxter you got him clavering park the old boy was very much pleased sir at your calling him in hobnell wrote me so do you think you could speak to the governor for me mr pendennis and tell him what ive gone and done it sir said huxter with a particular look youyou dont mean to say you haveyou have done any wrong to that dear little creature sir said pen starting up in a great fury i hope not said huxter with a hangdog look but ive married her and i know there will be an awful shindy at home it was agreed that i should be taken into partnership when i had passed the college and it was to have been huxter and son but i would have it confound it its all over now and the old boys wrote to me that hes coming up to town for drugs he will be here tomorrow and then it must all come out and when did this event happen asked pen not over well pleased most likely that a person who had once attracted some portion of his royal good graces should have transferred her allegiance and consoled herself for his loss last thursday was five weeksit was two days after miss amory came to shepherds inn huxter answered pen remembered that blanche had written and mentioned her visit i was called in huxter said i was in the inn looking after old coss leg and about something else too very likely and i met strong who told me there was a woman taken ill in chambers and went up to give her my professional services it was the old lady who attends miss amoryher housekeeper or some such thing she was taken with strong hysterics i found her kicking and screaming like a good onein strongs chamber along with him and colonel altamont and miss amory crying and as pale as a sheet and altamont fuming abouta regular kick up they were two hours in the chambers and the old woman went whooping off in a cab she was much worse than the young one i called in grosvenorplace next day to see if i could be of any service but they were gone without so much as thanking me and the day after i had business of my own to attend toa bad business too said mr huxter gloomily but its done and cant be undone and we must make the best of it she has known the story for a month thought pen with a sharp pang of grief and a gloomy sympathythis accounts for her letter of today she will not implicate her father or divulge his secret she wishes to let me off from the marriageand finds a pretextthe generous girl do you know who altamont is sir asked huxter after the pause during which pen had been thinking of his own affairs fanny and i have talked him over and we cant help fancying that its mrs lightfoots first husband come to life again and she who has just married a second perhaps lightfoot wont be very sorry for it sighed huxter looking savagely at arthur for the demon of jealousy was still in possession of his soul and now and more than ever since his marriage the poor fellow fancied that fannys heart belonged to his rival let us talk about your affairs said pen show me how i can be of any service to you huxter let me congratulate you on your marriage i am thankful that fanny who is so good so fascinating so kind a creature has found an honest man and a gentleman who will make her happy show me what i can do to help you she thinks you can sir said huxter accepting pens proffered hand and im very much obliged to you im sure and that you might talk over my father and break the business to him and my mother who always has her back up about being a clergymans daughter fanny aint of a good family i know and not up to us in breeding and thatbut shes a huxter now illustration the wife takes the husbands rank of course said pen and with a little practice in society continued huxter imbibing his stick shell be as good as any girl in clavering you should hear her sing and play on the piano did you ever old bows taught her and shell do on the stage if the governor was to throw me over but id rather not have her there she cant help being a coquette mr pendennis she cant help it dammy sir ill be bound to say that two or three of the bartholomew chaps that ive brought into my place are sitting with her now even jack linton that i took down as my best man is as bad as the rest and she will go on singing and making eyes at him its what bows says if there were twenty men in a room and one not taking notice of her she wouldnt be satisfied until the twentieth was at her elbow you should have her mother with her said pen laughing she must keep the lodge she cant see so much of her family as she used i cant you know sir go on with that lot consider my rank in life said huxter putting a very dirty hand up to his chin au fait said mr pen who was infinitely amused and concerning whom mutato nomine and of course concerning nobody else in the world the fable might have been narrated as the two gentlemen were in the midst of this colloquy another knock came to pens door and his servant presently announced mr bows the old man followed slowly his pale face blushing and his hand trembling somewhat as he took pens he coughed and wiped his face in his checked cotton pockethandkerchief and sat down with his hands on his knees the sun shining on his bald head pen looked at the homely figure with no small sympathy and kindness this man too has had his griefs and his wounds arthur thought this man too has brought his genius and his heart and laid them at a womans feet where she spurned them the chance of life has gone against him and the prize is with that creature yonder fannys bridegroom thus mutely apostrophized had winked meanwhile with one eye at old bows and was driving holes in the floor with the cane which he loved so we have lost mr bows and here is the lucky winner pen said looking hard at the old man here is the lucky winner sir as you say i suppose you have come from my place asked huxter who having winked at bows with one eye now favored pen with a wink of the othera wink which seemed to say infatuated old boyyou understandover head and ears in love with herpoor old fool yes i have been there ever since you went away it was mrs sam who sent me after you who said that she thought you might be doing something stupidsomething like yourself huxter theres as big fools as i am growled the young surgeon a few praps said the old man not many let us trust yes she sent me after you for fear you should offend mr pendennis and i daresay because she thought you wouldnt give her message to him and beg him to go and see her and she knew i would take her errand did he tell you that sir huxter blushed scarlet and covered his confusion with an imprecation pen laughed the scene suited his bitter humor more and more i have no doubt mr huxter was going to tell me arthur said and very much flattered i am sure i shall be to pay my respects to his wife its in charterhouselane over the bakers on the right hand side as you go from st johnsstreet continued bows without any pity you know smithfield mr pendennis st johnsstreet leads into smithfield dr johnson has been down the street many a time with ragged shoes and a bundle of pennyalining for the gents magazine you literary gents are better off noweh you ride in your cabs and wear yellow kid gloves now i have known so many brave and good men fail and so many quacks and impostors succeed that you mistake me if you think i am puffed up by my own personal good luck old friend arthur said sadly do you think the prizes of life are carried by the most deserving and set up that mean test of prosperity for merit you must feel that you are as good as i i have never questioned it it is you that are peevish against the freaks of fortune and grudge the good luck that befalls others its not the first time you have unjustly accused me bows perhaps you are not far wrong sir said the old fellow wiping his bald forehead i am thinking about myself and grumbling most men do when they get on that subject heres the fellow thats got the prize in the lottery heres the fortunate youth i dont know what you are driving at huxter said who had been much puzzled as the above remarks passed between his two companions perhaps not said bows drily mrs h sent me here to look after you and to see that you brought that little message to mr pendennis which you didnt you see and so she was right women always are they have always a reason for every thing why sir he said turning round to pen with a sneer she had a reason even for giving me that message i was sitting with her after you left us very quiet and comfortable i was talking away and she was mending your shirts when your two young friends jack linton and bob blades looked in from bartholomews and then it was she found out that she had this message to send you neednt hurry yourself she dont want you back again theyll stay these two hours i daresay huxter rose with great perturbation at this news and plunged his stick into the pocket of his paletot and seized his hat youll come and see us sir wont you he said to pen youll talk over the governor wont you sir if i can get out of this place and down to clavering you will promise to attend me gratis if ever i fall ill at fairoaks will you huxter pen said goodnaturedly i will do any thing i can for you i will come and see mrs huxter immediately and we will conspire together about what is to be done i thought that would send him out sir bows said dropping into his chair again as soon as the young surgeon had quitted the room and its all true sirevery word of it she wants you back again and sends her husband after you she cajoles every body the little devil she tries it on you on me on poor costigan on the young chaps from bartholomews shes got a little court of em already and if theres nobody there she practices on the old german baker in the shop or coaxes the black sweeper at the crossing is she fond of that fellow asked pen there is no accounting for likes and dislikes bows answered yes she is fond of him and having taken the thing into her head she would not rest until she married him they had their bans published at st clements and nobody heard it or knew any just cause or impediment and one day she slips out of the porters lodge and has the business done and goes off to gravesend with lothario and leaves a note for me to go and explain all things to her ma bless you the old woman knew it as well as i did though she pretended ignorance and so she goes and im alone again i miss her sir tripping along that court and coming for her singing lesson and ive no heart to look into the porters lodge now which looks very empty without her the little flirting thing and i go and sit and dangle about her lodgings like an old fool she makes em very trim and nice though gets up all huxters shirts and clothes cooks his little dinner and sings at her business like a little lark whats the use of being angry i lent em three pound to go on with for they havent got a shilling till the reconciliation and pa comes down when bows had taken his leave pen carried his letter from blanche and the news which he had just received to his usual adviser laura it was wonderful upon how many points mr arthur who generally followed his own opinion now wanted another persons counsel he could hardly so much as choose a waistcoat without referring to miss bell if he wanted to buy a horse he must have miss bells opinion all which marks of deference tended greatly to the amusement of the shrewd old lady with whom miss bell lived and whose plans regarding her protegee we have indicated arthur produced blanches letter then to laura and asked her to interpret it laura was very much agitated and puzzled by the contents of the note it seems to me she said as if blanche is acting very artfully and wishes so to place matters that she may take me or leave me is it not so it is i am afraid a kind of duplicity which does not augur well for your future happiness and is a bad reply to your own candor and honesty arthur do you know i think i thinki scarcely like to say what i think said laura with a deep blush but of course the blushing young lady yielded to her cousins persuasion and expressed what her thoughts were it looks to me arthur as if there might bethere might be somebody else said laura with a repetition of the blush and if there is broke in arthur and if i am free once again will the best and dearest of all women you are not free dear brother laura said calmly you belong to another of whom i own it grieves me to think ill but i cant do otherwise it is very odd that in this letter she does not urge you to tell her the reason why you have broken arrangements which would have been so advantageous to you and avoids speaking on the subject she somehow seems to write as if she knows her fathers secret pen said yes she must know it and told the story which he had just heard from huxter of the interview at shepherds inn it was not so that she described the meeting said laura and going to her desk produced from it that letter of blanches which mentioned her visit to shepherds inn another disappointmentonly the chevalier strong and a friend of his in the room this was all that blanche had said but she was bound to keep her fathers secret pen laura added and yet and yetit is very puzzling the puzzle was this that for three weeks after this eventful discovery blanche had been only too eager about her dearest arthur was urging as strongly as so much modesty could urge the completion of the happy arrangements which were to make her arthurs forever and now it seemed as if something had interfered to mar these happy arrangementsas if arthur poor was not quite so agreeable to blanche as arthur rich and a member of parliamentas if there was some mystery at last she said tunbridge wells is not very far off is it arthur hadnt you better go and see her they had been in town a week and neither had thought of that simple plan before chapter xxxv shows how arthur had better have taken a returnticket illustration the train carried arthur only too quickly to tunbridge though he had time to review all the circumstances of his life as he made the brief journey and to acknowledge to what sad conclusions his selfishness and waywardness had led him here is the end of hopes and aspirations thought he of romance and ambitions where i yield or where i am obstinate i am alike unfortunate my mother implores me and i refuse an angel say i had taken her forced on me as she was laura would never have been an angel to me i could not have given her my heart at anothers instigation i never could have known her as she is had i been obliged to ask another to interpret her qualities and point out her virtues i yield to my uncles solicitations and accept on his guarantee blanche and a seat in parliament and wealth and ambition and a career and seefortune comes and leaves me the wife without the dowry which i had taken in compensation of a heart why was i not more honest or am i not less so it would have cost my poor old uncle no pangs to accept blanches fortune whencesoever it came he cant even understand he is bitterly indignantheartstricken almostat the scruples which actuate me in refusing it i dissatisfy every body a maimed weak imperfect wretch it seems as if i am unequal to any fortune i neither make myself nor any one connected with me happy what prospect is there for this poor little frivolous girl who is to take my obscure name and share my fortune i have not even ambition to excite me or selfesteem enough to console myself much more her for my failure if i were to write a book that should go through twenty editions why i should be the very first to sneer at my reputation say i could succeed at the bar and achieve a fortune by bullying witnesses and twisting evidence is that a fame which would satisfy my longings or a calling in which my life would be well spent how i wish i could be that priest opposite who never has lifted his eyes from his breviary except when we were in reigate tunnel when he could not see or that old gentleman next him who scowls at him with eyes of hatred over his newspaper the priest shuts his eyes to the world but has his thoughts on the book which is his directory to the world to come his neighbor hates him as a monster tyrant persecutor and fancies burning martyrs and that pale countenance looking on and lighted up by the flame these have no doubts these march on trustfully bearing their load of logic would you like to look at the paper sir here interposed the stout gentleman it had a flaming article against the order of the blackcoated gentleman who was traveling with them in the carriage and pen thanked him and took it and pursued his reverie without reading two sentences of the journal and yet would you take either of those mens creeds with its consequences he thought ah me you must bear your own burden fashion your own faith think your own thoughts and pray your own prayer to what mortal ear could i tell all if i had a mind or who could understand all who can tell anothers shortcomings lost opportunities weigh the passions which overpower the defects which incapacitate reasonwhat extent of truth and right his neighbors mind is organized to perceive and to dowhat invisible and forgotten accident terror of youth chance or mischance of fortune may have altered the whole current of life a grain of sand may alter it as the flinging of a pebble may end it who can weigh circumstances passions temptations that go to our good and evil account save one before whose awful wisdom we kneel and at whose mercy we ask absolution here it ends thought pen this day or tomorrow will wind up the account of my youth a weary retrospect alas a sad history with many a page i would fain not look back on but who has not been tired or fallen and who has escaped without scars from that struggle and his head fell on his breast and the young mans heart prostrated itself humbly and sadly before that throne where sits wisdom and love and pity for all and made its confession what matters about fame or poverty he thought if i marry this woman i have chosen may i have strength and will to be true to her and to make her happy if i have children pray god teach me to speak and to do the truth among them and to leave them an honest name there are no splendors for my marriage does my life deserve any i begin a new phase of it a better than the last may it be i pray heaven the train stopped at tunbridge as pen was making these reflections and he handed over the newspaper to his neighbor of whom he took leave while the foreign clergyman in the opposite corner still sate with his eyes on his book pen jumped out of the carriage then his carpetbag in hand and briskly determined to face his fortune a fly carried him rapidly to lady claverings house from the station and as he was transported thither arthur composed a little speech which he intended to address to blanche and which was really as virtuous honest and wellminded an oration as any man of his turn of mind and under his circumstances could have uttered the purport of it wasblanche i cannot understand from your last letter what your meaning is or whether my fair and frank proposal to you is acceptable or no i think you know the reason which induces me to forego the worldly advantages which a union with you offered and which i could not accept without as i fancy being dishonored if you doubt of my affection here i am ready to prove it let smirke be called in and let us be married out of hand and with all my heart i purpose to keep my vow and to cherish you through life and to be a true and a loving husband to you from the fly arthur sprang out then to the halldoor where he was met by a domestic whom he did not know the man seemed to be surprised at the approach of the gentleman with the carpetbag which he made no attempt to take from arthurs hands her ladyships not at home sir the man remarked i am mr pendennis arthur said where is lightfoot lightfoot is gone answered the man my lady is out and my orders was i hear miss amorys voice in the drawingroom said arthur take the bag to a dressingroom if you please and passing by the porter he walked straight toward that apartment from which as the door opened a warble of melodious notes issued our little siren was at her piano singing with all her might and fascinations master clavering was asleep on the sofa indifferent to the music but near blanche sat a gentleman who was perfectly enraptured with her strain which was of a passionate and melancholy nature as the door opened the gentleman started up with a hullo the music stopped with a little shriek from the singer frank clavering woke up from the sofa and arthur came forward and said what foker how do you do foker he looked at the piano and there by miss amorys side was just such another purpleleather box as he had seen in harrys hand three days before when the heir of logwood was coming out of a jewelers shop in waterlooplace it was opened and curled round the whitesatin cushion within was oh such a magnificent serpentine bracelet with such a blazing ruby head and diamond tail howdedo pendennis said foker blanche made many motions of the shoulders and gave signs of interest and agitation and she put her handkerchief over the bracelet and then she advanced with a hand which trembled very much to greet pen how is dearest laura she said the face of foker looking up from his profound mourningthat face so piteous and puzzled was one which the readers imagination must depict for himself also that of master frank clavering who looking at the three interesting individuals with an expression of the utmost knowingness had only time to ejaculate the words heres a jolly go and to disappear sniggering illustration pen too had restrained himself up to that minute but looking still at foker whose ears and cheeks tingled with blushes arthur burst out into a fit of laughter so wild and loud that it frightened blanche much more than any the most serious exhibition and this was the secret was it dont blush and turn away foker my boy why man you are a pattern of fidelity could i stand between blanche and such constancycould i stand between miss amory and fifteen thousand a year it is not that mr pendennis blanche said with great dignity it is not money it is not rank it is not gold that moves me but it is constancy it is fidelity it is a whole trustful loving heart offered to me that i treasureyes that i treasure and she made for her handkerchief but reflecting what was underneath it she paused i do not disown i do not disguisemy life is above disguiseto him on whom it is bestowed my heart must be forever barethat i once thought i loved youyes thought i was beloved by you i own how i clung to that faith how i strove i prayed i longed to believe it but your conduct alwaysyour own words so cold so heartless so unkind have undeceived me you trifled with the heart of the poor maiden you flung me back with scorn the troth which i had plighted i have explained allall to mr foker that you have said foker with devotion and conviction in his looks what all said pen with a meaning look at blanche it is i am in fault is it well well blanche be it so i wont appeal against your sentence and bear it in silence i came down here looking to very different things heaven knows and with a heart most truly and kindly disposed toward you i hope you may be happy with another as on my word it was my wish to make you so and i hope my honest old friend here will have a wife worthy of his loyalty his constancy and affection indeed they deserve the regard of any womaneven miss blanche amory shake hands harry dont look askance at me has any body told you that i was a false and heartless character i think youre a foker was beginning in his wrath when blanche interposed henry not a wordi pray you let there be forgiveness youre an angel by jove youre an angel said foker at which blanche looked seraphically up to the chandelier in spite of what has passed for the sake of what has passed i must always regard arthur as a brother the seraph continued we have known each other years we have trodden the same fields and plucked the same flowers together arthur henry i beseech you to take hands and to be friends forgive youi forgive you arthur with my heart i do should i not do so for making me so happy there is only one person of us three whom i pity blanche arthur said gravely and i say to you again that i hope you will make this good fellow this honest and loyal creature happy happy o heavens said harry he could not speak his happiness gushed out at his eyes she dont knowshe cant know how fond i am of her andand who am i a poor little beggar and she takes me up and says shell try and lllove me i aint worthy of so much happiness give us your hand old boy since she forgives you after your heartless conduct and says she loves you ill make you welcome i tell you ill love every body who loves her byif she tells me to kiss the ground ill kiss it tell me to kiss the ground i say tell me i love you so you see i love you so blanche looked up seraphically again her gentle bosom heaved she held out one hand as if to bless harry and then royally permitted him to kiss it she took up the pocket handkerchief and hid her own eyes as the other fair hand was abandoned to poor harrys tearful embrace i swear that is a villain who deceives such a loving creature as that said pen blanche laid down the handkerchief and put hand no softly on fokers head which was bent down kissing and weeping over hand no foolish boy she said it shall be loved as it deserves who could help loving such a silly creature and at this moment frank clavering broke in upon the sentimental trio i say pendennis he said well frank the man wants to be paid and go back hes had some beer ill go back with him cried pen goodby blanche god bless you foker old friend you know neither of you want me here he longed to be off that instant stayi must say one word to you one word in private if you please blanche said you can trust us together cant youhenry the tone in which the word henry was spoken and the appeal ravished foker with delight trust you said he oh who wouldnt trust you come along franky my boy lets have a cigar said frank as they went into the hall she dont like it said foker gently law bless youshe dont mind pendennis used to smoke regular said the candid youth it was but a short word i had to say said blanche to pen with great calm when they were alone you never loved me mr pendennis i told you how much said arthur i never deceived you i suppose you will go back and marry laura continued blanche was that what you had to say said pen you are going to her this very night i am sure of it there is no denying it you never cared for me et vous et moi cest different i have been spoilt early i can not live out of the world out of excitement i could have done so but it is too late if i can not have emotions i must have the world you would offer me neither one nor the other you are blase in every thing even in ambition you had a career before you and you

mon pere the pirate would have wearied you like the rest said pen eh il me faut des emotions said blanche pen had never seen her or known so much about her in all the years of their intimacy as he saw and knew now though he saw more than existed in reality for this young lady was not able to carry out any emotion to the full but had a sham enthusiasm a sham hatred a sham love a sham taste a sham grief each of which flared and shone very vehemently for an instant but subsided and gave place to the next sham emotion chapter xxxvi a chapter of matchmaking illustration upon the platform at tunbridge pen fumed and fretted until the arrival of the evening train to london a full halfhoursix hours it seemed to him but even this immense interval was passed the train arrived the train sped on the london lights came in viewa gentleman who forgot his carpetbag in the train rushed at a cab and said to the man drive as hard as you can go to jermynstreet the cabman although a hansom cabman said thank you for the gratuity which was put into his hand and pen ran up the stairs of the hotel to lady rockminsters apartments laura was alone in the drawingroom reading with a pale face by the lamp the pale face looked up when pen opened the door may we follow him the great moments of life are but moments like the others your doom is spoken in a word or two a single look from the eyes a mere pressure of the hand may decide it or of the lips though they can not speak when lady rockminster who has had her afterdinner nap gets up and goes into her sittingroom we may enter with her ladyship upon my word young people are the first words she says and her attendant makes wondering eyes over her shoulder and well may she say so and well may the attendant cast wondering eyes for the young people are in an attitude and pen in such a position as every young lady who reads this has heard tell of or has seen or hopes or at any rate deserves to see in a word directly he entered the room pen went up to laura of the pale face who had not time even to say what back so soon and seizing her outstretched and trembling hand just as she was rising from her chair fell down on his knees before her and said quickly i have seen her she has engaged herself to harry fokerandand now laura the hand gives a pressurethe eyes beam a replythe quivering lips answer though speechless pens head sinks down in the girls lap as he sobs out come and bless us dear mother and arms as tender as helens once more enfold him in this juncture it is that lady rockminster comes in and says upon my word young people beck leave the room what do you want poking your nose in here pen starts up with looks of triumph still holding lauras hand she is consoling me for my misfortune maam he says what do you mean by kissing her hand i dont know what you will be next doing pen kissed her ladyships i have been to tunbridge he says and seen miss amory and find on my arrival thatthat a villain has supplanted me in her affections he says with a tragedy air is that all is that what you were whimpering on your knees about says the old lady growing angry you might have kept the news till tomorrow yesanother has superseded me goes on pen but why call him villain he is brave he is constant he is young he is wealthy he is beautiful what stuff are you talking sir cried the old lady what has happened miss amory has jilted me and accepted henry foker esq i found her warbling ditties to him as he lay at her feet presents had been accepted vows exchanged these ten days harry was old mrs planters rheumatism which kept dearest laura out of the house he is the most constant and generous of men he has promised the living of logwood to lady anns husband and given her a splendid present on her marriage and he rushed to fling himself at blanches feet the instant he found he was free and so as you cant get blanche you put up with laura is that it sir asked the old lady he acted nobly laura said i acted as she bade me said pen never mind how lady rockminster but to the best of my knowledge and power and if you mean that i am not worthy of laura i know it and pray heaven to better me and if the love and company of the best and purest creature in the world can do so at least i shall have these to help me hm hm replied the old lady to this looking with rather an appeased air at the young people it is all very well but i should have preferred bluebeard and now pen to divert the conversation from a theme which was growing painful to some parties present bethought him of his interview with huxter in the morning and of fanny boltons affairs which he had forgotten under the immediate pressure and excitement of his own and he told the ladies how huxter had elevated fanny to the rank of wife and what terrors he was in respecting the arrival of his father he described the scene with considerable humor taking care to dwell especially upon that part of it which concerned fannys coquetry and irrepressible desire of captivating mankind his meaning being you see laura i was not so guilty in that little affair it was the girl who made love to me and i who resisted as i am no longer present the little siren practices her arts and fascinations upon others let that transaction be forgotten in your mind if you please or visit me with a very gentle punishment for my error laura understood his meaning under the eagerness of his explanations if you did any wrong you repented dear pen she said and you know she added with meaning eyes and blushes that i have no right to reproach you hm grumbled the old lady i should have preferred bluebeard the past is broken away the morrow is before us i will do my best to make your morrow happy dear laura pen said his heart was humbled by the prospect of his happiness it stood awestricken in the contemplation of her sweet goodness and purity he liked his wife better that she had owned to that passing feeling for warrington and laid bare her generous heart to him and shevery likely she was thinking how strange it is that i ever should have cared for another i am vexed almost to think i care for him so little am so little sorry that he is gone away oh in these past two months how i have learned to love arthur i care about nothing but arthur my waking and sleeping thoughts are about him he is never absent from me and to think that he is to be mine mine and that i am to marry him and not to be his servant as i expected to be only this morning for i would have gone down on my knees to blanche to beg her to let me live with him and nowoh it is too much oh mother mother that you were here indeed she felt as if helen were thereby her actually though invisibly a halo of happiness beamed from her she moved with a different step and bloomed with a new beauty arthur saw the change and the old lady rockminster remarked it with her shrewd eyes what a sly demure little wretch you have been she whispered to laurawhile pen in great spirits was laughing and telling his story about huxterand how you have kept your secret how are we to help the young couple said laura of course miss laura felt an interest in all young couples as generous lovers always love other lovers we must go and see them said pen of course we must go and see them said laura i intend to be very fond of fanny let us go this instant lady rockminster may i have the carriage go nowwhy you stupid creature it is eleven oclock at night mr and mrs huxter have got their nightcaps on i daresay and it is time for you to go now goodnight mr pendennis arthur and laura begged for ten minutes more we will go tomorrow morning then i will come and fetch you with martha an earls coronet said pen who no doubt was pleased himself will have a great effect in lambcourt and smithfield staylady rockminster will you join us in a little conspiracy how do you mean conspiracy young man will you please to be a little ill tomorrow and when old mr huxter arrives will you let me call him in if he is put into a good humor at the notion of attending a baronet in the country what influence wont a countess have on him when he is softenedwhen he is quite ripe we will break the secret upon him bring in the young people extort the paternal benediction and finish the comedy a parcel of stuff said the old lady take your hat sir come away miss theremy head is turned another way goodnight young people and who knows but the old lady thought of her own early days as she went away on lauras arm nodding her head and humming to herself with the early morning came laura and martha according to appointment and the desired sensation was let us hope effected in lambcourt whence the three proceeded to wait upon mr and mrs samuel huxter at their residence in charterhouselane the two ladies looked at each other with great interest and not a little emotion on fannys part she had not seen her guardian as she was pleased to call pen in consequence of his bequest since the event had occurred which had united her to mr huxter samuel told me how kind you had been she said you were always very kind mr pendennis andand i hope your friend is better who was took ill in shepherds inn maam my name is laura said the other with a blush i amthat is i wasthat is i am arthurs sister and we shall always love you for being so good to him when he was ill and when we live in the country i hope we shall see each other and i shall be always happy to hear of your happiness fanny we are going to do what you and huxter have done fannywhere is huxter what nice snug lodgings youve got what a pretty cat while fanny is answering these questions in reply to pen laura says to herselfwell now really is this the creature about whom we were all so frightened what could he see in her shes a homely little thing but such manners well she was very kind to himbless her for that mr samuel had gone out to meet his pa mrs huxter said that the old gentleman was to arrive that day at the somerset coffeehouse in the strand and fanny confessed that she was in a sad tremor about the meeting if his parents cast him off what are we to do she said i shall never pardon myself for bringing ruing on my usbands ead you must intercede for us mr arthur if mortal man can you can bend and influence mr huxter senior fanny still regarded pen in the light of a superior being that was evident no doubt arthur thought of the past as he marked the solemn little tragedyairs and looks the little ways the little trepidations vanities of the little bride as soon as the interview was over entered messrs linton and blades who came of course to visit huxter and brought with them a fine fragrance of tobacco they had watched the carriage at the bakers door and remarked the coronet with awe they asked of fanny who was that uncommonly heavy swell who had just driven off and pronounced the countess was of the right sort and when they heard that it was mr pendennis and his sister they remarked that pens father was only a sawbones and that he gave himself confounded airs they had been in huxters company on the night of his little altercation with pen in the back kitchen returning homeward through fleetstreet and as laura was just stating to pens infinite amusement that fanny was very well but that really there was no beauty in herthere might be but she could not see itas they were locked near templebar they saw young huxter returning to his bride the governor had arrived was at the somerset coffeehousewas in tolerable good humorsomething about the railway but he had been afraid to speak aboutabout that business would mr pendennis try it on pen said he would go and call at that moment upon mr huxter and see what might be done huxter junior would lurk outside while that awful interview took place the coronet on the carriage inspired his soul also with wonder and old mr huxter himself beheld it with delight as he looked from the coffeehouse window on that strand which it was always a treat to him to survey and i can afford to give myself a lark sir said mr huxter shaking hands with pen of course you know the news we have got our bill sir we shall have our branch lineour shares are up sirand we buy your three fields along the brawl and put a pretty penny into your pocket mr pendennis indeed that was good news pen remembered that there was a letter from mr tatham at chambers these three days but he had not opened the communication being interested with other affairs i hope you dont intend to grow rich and give up practice said pen we cant lose you at clavering mr huxter though i hear very good accounts of your son my friend dr goodenough speaks most highly of his talents it is hard that a man of your eminence though should be kept in a country town the metropolis would have been my sphere of action sir said mr huxter surveying the strand but a man takes his business where he finds it and i succeeded to that of my father it was my fathers too said pen i sometimes wish i had followed it you sir have taken a more lofty career said the old gentleman you aspire to the senate and to literary honors you wield the poets pen sir and move in the circles of fashion we keep an eye upon you at clavering we read your name in the lists of the select parties of the nobility why it was only the other day that my wife was remarking how odd it was that at a party at the earl of kidderminsters your name was not mentioned to what member of the aristocracy may i ask does that equipage belong from which i saw you descend the countess dowager of rockminster how is her ladyship her ladyship is not very well and when i heard that you were coming to town i strongly urged her to see you mr huxter pen said old huxter felt if he had a hundred votes for clavering he would give them all to pen there is an old friend of yours in the carriagea clavering lady toowill you come out and speak to her asked pen the old surgeon was delighted to speak to a coroneted carriage in the midst of the full strand he ran out bowing and smiling huxter junior dodging about the district beheld the meeting between his father and laura saw the latter put out her hand and presently after a little colloquy with pen beheld his father actually jump into the carriage and drive away with miss bell there was no room for arthur who came back laughing to the young surgeon and told him whither his parent was bound during the whole of the journey that artful laura coaxed and wheedled and cajoled him so adroitly that the old gentleman would have granted her any thing and lady rockminster achieved the victory over him by complimenting him on his skill and professing her anxiety to consult him what were her ladyships symptoms should he meet her ladyships usual medical attendant mr jones was called out of town he should be delighted to devote his very best energies and experience to her ladyships service he was so charmed with his patient that he wrote home about her to his wife and family he talked of nothing but lady rockminster to samuel when that youth came to partake of beefsteak and oystersauce and accompany his parent to the play there was a simple grandeur a polite urbanity a highbred grace about her ladyship which he had never witnessed in any woman her symptoms did not seem alarming he had prescribedspirammonaromat with a little spirmenthpip and orangeflower which would be all that was necessary miss bell seemed to be on the most confidential and affectionate footing with her ladyship she was about to form a matrimonial connection all young people ought to marry such were her ladyships words and the countess condescended to ask respecting my own family and i mentioned you by name to her ladyship sam my boy i shall look in tomorrow when if the remedies which i have prescribed for her ladyship have had the effect which i anticipate i shall probably follow them up by a little spir lavend compand so set my noble patient up what is the theater which is most frequented by theby the higher classes in town hey sam and to what amusement will you take an old country doctor tonight hey sir on the next day when mr huxter called in jermynstreet at twelve oclock lady rockminster had not yet left her room but miss bell and mr pendennis were in waiting to receive him lady rockminster had had a most comfortable night and was getting on as well as possible how had mr huxter amused himself at the theater with his son what a capital piece it was and how charming mrs oleary looked and sang it and what a good fellow young huxter was liked by every body an honor to his profession he has not his fathers manners i grant you or that oldworld tone which is passing away from us but a more excellent sterling fellow never lived he ought to practice in the country whatever you do sir said arthur he ought to marryother people are going to do soand settle the very words that her ladyship used yesterday mr pendennis he ought to marry sam should marry sir the town is full of temptations sir continued pen the old gentleman thought of that houri mrs oleary there is no better safeguard for a young man than an early marriage with an honest affectionate creature no better sir no better and love is better than money isnt it indeed it is said miss bell i agree with so fair an authority said the old gentleman with a bow andand suppose sir pen said that i had a piece of news to communicate to you god bless my soul mr pendennis what do you mean asked the old gentleman suppose i had to tell you that a young man carried away by an irresistible passion for an admirable and most virtuous young creaturewhom every body falls in love withhad consulted the dictates of reason and his heart and had married suppose i were to tell you that that man is my friend that our excellent our truly noble friend the countess dowager of rockminster is truly interested about him and you may fancy what a young man can do in life when that family is interested for him suppose i were to tell you that you know himthat he is herethat he is sam married god bless my soul sir you dont mean that and to such a nice creature dear mr huxter his lordship is charmed with her said pen telling almost the first fib which he has told in the course of this story married the rascal is he thought the old gentleman they will do it sir said pen and went and opened the door mr and mrs samuel huxter issued thence and both came and knelt down before the old gentleman the kneeling little fanny found favor in his sight there must have been something attractive about her in spite of lauras opinion will never do so any more sir said sam get up sir said mr huxter and they got up and fanny came a little nearer and a little nearer still and looked so pretty and pitiful that somehow mr huxter found himself kissing the little cryinglaughing thing and feeling as if he liked it whats your name my dear he said after a minute of this sport fanny papa said mrs samuel chapter xxxvii exeunt omnes illustration our characters are all a month older than they were when the lastdescribed adventures and conversations

clavering where he hopes for the continued patronage of the gentlemen and families of the county this ancient and wellestablished house mr lightfoots manifesto states has been repaired and decorated in a style of the greatest comfort gentlemen hunting with the dumplingbeare hounds will find excellent stabling and loose boxes for horses at the clavering arms a commodious billiardroom has been attached to the hotel and the cellars have been furnished with the choicest wines and spirits selected without regard to expense by cl commercial gentlemen will find the clavering arms a most comfortable place of resort and the scale of charges has been regulated for all so as to meet the economical spirit of the present times indeed there is a considerable air of liveliness about the old inn the clavering arms have been splendidly repainted over the gateway the coffeeroom windows are bright and fresh and decorated with christmas holly the magistrates have met in petty sessions in the cardroom of the old assembly the farmers ordinary is held as of old and frequented by increased numbers who are pleased with mrs lightfoots cuisine her indian curries and mulligatawny soup are especially popular major stokes the respected tenant of fairoaks cottage captain glanders h p and other resident gentry have pronounced in their favor and have partaken of them more than once both in private and at the dinner of the clavering institute attendant on the incorporation of the readingroom and when the chief inhabitants of that flourishing little town met together and did justice to the hostesss excellent cheer the chair was taken by sir francis clavering bart supported by the esteemed rector dr portman the vicechair being ably filled bybarker esq supported by the rev j simcoe and the rev s jowls the enterprising head of the ribbon factory in clavering and chief director of the clavering and chatteris branch of the great western railway which will be opened in another year and upon the works of which the engineers and workmen are now busily engaged an interesting event which is likely to take place in the life of our talented townsman arthur pendennis esq has we understand caused him to relinquish the intentions which he had of offering himself as a candidate for our borough and rumor whispers says the chatteris champion clavering agriculturist and baymouth fishermanthat independent county paper so distinguished for its unswerving principles and loyalty to the british oak and so eligible a medium for advertisementsrumor states says the c c c a and bf that should sir francis claverings failing health oblige him to relinquish his seat in parliament he will vacate it in favor of a young gentleman of colossal fortune and related to the highest aristocracy of the empire who is about to contract a matrimonial alliance with an accomplished and lovely lady connected by the nearest ties with the respected family at clavering park lady clavering and miss amory have arrived at the park for the christmas holidays and we understand that a large number of the aristocracy are expected and that festivities of a peculiarly interesting nature will take place there at the commencement of the new year the ingenious reader will be enabled by the help of the above announcement to understand what has taken place during the little break which has occurred in our narrative although lady rockminster grumbled a little at lauras preference for pendennis over bluebeard those who are aware of the latters secret will understand that the young girl could make no other choice and the kind old lady who had constituted herself miss bells guardian was not illpleased that she was to fulfill the great purpose in life of young ladies and marry she informed her maid of the interesting event that very night and of course mrs beck who was perfectly aware of every single circumstance and kept by martha of fairoaks in the fullest knowledge of what was passing was immensely surprised and delighted mr pendenniss income is so much the railroad will give him so much more he states miss bell has so much and may probably have a little more one day for persons in their degree they will be able to manage very well and i shall speak to my nephew pynsent who i suspect was once rather attached to herbut of course that was out of the question oh of course my lady i should think so indeednot that you know any thing whatever about it or have any business to think at all on the subjecti shall speak to george pynsent who is now chief secretary of the tape and sealing wax office and have mr pendennis made something and beck in the morning you will carry down my compliments to major pendennis and say that i shall pay him a visit at one oclockyes muttered the old lady the major must be reconciled and he must leave his fortune to lauras children accordingly at one oclock the dowager lady rockminster appeared at major pendenniss who was delighted as may be imagined to receive so noble a visitor the major had been prepared if not for the news which her ladyship was about to give him at least with the intelligence that pens marriage with miss amory was broken off the young gentleman bethinking him of his uncle for the first time that day it must be owned and meeting his new servant in the hall of the hotel asked after the majors health from mr frosch and then went into the coffeeroom of the hotel where he wrote a halfdozen lines to acquaint his guardian with what had occurred dear uncle he said if there has been any question between us it is over now i went to tunbridge wells yesterday and found that somebody else had carried off the prize about which we were hesitating miss a without any compunction for me has bestowed herself upon harry foker with his fifteen thousand a year i came in suddenly upon their loves and found and left him in possession and youll be glad to hear tatham writes me that he has sold three of my fields at fairoaks to the railroad company at a great figure i will tell you this and more when we met and am always your affectionateap i think i am aware of what you were about to tell me the major said with a most courtly smile and bow to pens embassadress it was a very great kindness of your ladyship to think of bringing me the news how well you look how very good you are how very kind you have always been to that young man it was for the sake of his uncle said lady rockminster most politely he has informed me of the state of affairs and written me a nice noteyes a nice note continued the old gentleman and i find he has had an increase to his fortuneyes and all things considered i dont much regret that this affair with miss amory is manquee though i wished for it oncein fact all things considered i am very glad of it we must console him major pendennis continued the lady we must get him a wife the truth then came across the majors mind and he saw for what purpose lady rockminster had chosen to assume the office of embassadress it is not necessary to enter into the conversation which ensued or to tell at any length how her ladyship concluded a negotiation which in truth was tolerably easy there could be no reason why pen should not marry according to his own and his mothers wish and as for lady rockminster she supported the marriage by intimations which had very great weight with the major but of which we shall say nothing as her ladyship now of course much advanced in years is still alive and the family might be angry and in fine the old gentleman was quite overcome by the determined graciousness of the lady and her fondness for laura nothing indeed could be more bland and kind than lady rockminsters whole demeanor except for one moment when the major talked about his boy throwing himself away at which her ladyship broke out into a little speech in which she made the major understand what poor pen and his friends acknowledged very humbly that laura was a thousand times too good for him laura was fit to be the wife of a kinglaura was a paragon of virtue and excellence and it must be said that when major pendennis found that a lady of the rank of the countess of rockminster seriously admired miss bell he instantly began to admire her himself so that when herr frosch was requested to walk upstairs to lady rockminsters apartments and inform miss bell and mr arthur pendennis that the major would receive them and laura appeared blushing and happy as she hung on pens arm the major gave a shaky hand to one and the other with no unaffected emotion and cordiality and then went through another salutation to laura which caused her to blush still more happy blushes bright eyes beaming with the light of love the storyteller turns from this group to his young audience and hopes that one day their eyes may all shine so pen having retreated in the most friendly manner and the lovely blanche having bestowed her young affections upon a blushing bridegroom with fifteen thousand a year there was such an outbreak of happiness in lady claverings heart and family as the good begum had not known for many a year and she and blanche were on the most delightful terms of cordiality and affection the ardent foker pressed onward the happy day and was as anxious as might be expected to abridge the period of mourning which had put him in possession of so many charms and amiable qualities of which he had been only as it were the heir apparent not the actual owner until then the gentle blanche every thing that her affianced lord could desire was not averse to gratify the wishes of her fond henry lady clavering came up from tunbridge milliners and jewelers were set to work and engaged to prepare the delightful paraphernalia of hymen lady clavering was in such a good humor that sir francis even benefited by it and such a reconciliation was effected between this pair that sir francis came to london sate at the head of his own table once more and appeared tolerably flush of money at his billiardrooms and gamblinghouses again one day when major pendennis and arthur went to dine in grosvenor place they found an old acquaintance established in the quality of majordomo and the gentleman in black who with perfect politeness and gravity offered them their choice of sweet or dry champagne was no other than mr james morgan the chevalier strong was one of the party he was in high spirits and condition and entertained the company with accounts of his amusements abroad it was my lady who invited me said strong to arthur under his voicethat fellow morgan looked as black as thunder when i came in he is about no good here i will go away first and wait for you and major pendennis at hyde park gate mr morgan helped major pendennis to his great coat when he was quitting the house and muttered something about having accepted a temporary engagement with the clavering family i have got a paper of yours mr morgan said the old gentleman which you can show if you please to sir francis sir and perfectly welcome said mr morgan with downcast eyes im very much obliged to you major pendennis and if i can pay you for all your kindness i will arthur overheard the sentence and saw the look of hatred which accompanied it suddenly cried out that he had forgotten his handkerchief and ran upstairs to the drawingroom again foker was still there still lingering about his siren pen gave the siren a look full of meaning and we suppose that the siren understood meaning looks for when after finding the veracious handkerchief of which he came in quest he once more went out the siren with a laughing voice said o arthurmr pendennisi want you to tell dear laura something and she came out to the door what is it he asked shutting the door have you told harry do you know that villain morgan knows all i know it she said have you told harry no no she said you wont betray me morgan will said pen no he wont said blanche i have promised himnimporte wait until after our marriageo until after our marriageo how wretched i am said the girl who had been all smiles and grace and gayety during the evening arthur said i beg and implore you to tell harry tell him now it is no fault of yours he will pardon you any thing tell him tonight and give her thisil est lawith my love please and i beg your pardon for calling you back and if she will be at madame crinolines at halfpast three and if lady rockminster can spare her i should so like to drive with her in the park and she went in singing and kissing her little hand as morgan the velvetfooted came up the carpeted stair pen heard blanches piano breaking out into brilliant music as he went down to join his uncle and they walked away together arthur briefly told him what he had done what was to be done he asked what is to be done begad said the old gentleman what is to be done but to leave it alone begad let us be thankful said the old fellow with a shudder that we are out of the business and leave it to those it concerns i hope to heaven shell tell him said pen begad shell take her own course said the old man miss amory is a devlish wideawake girl sir and must play her own cards and im doosid glad you are out of itdoosid glad begad whos this smoking o its mr strong again he wants to put in his oar i suppose i tell you dont meddle in the business arthur strong began once or twice as if to converse upon the subject but the major would not hear a word he remarked on the moonlight on apsley house the weather the cabstandsany thing but that subject he bowed stiffly to strong and clung to his nephews arm as he turned down st jamessstreet and again cautioned pen to leave the affair alone it had like to have cost you so much sir that you may take my advice he said when arthur came out of the hotel strongs cloak and cigar were visible a few doors off the jolly chevalier laughed as they met im an old soldier too he said i wanted to talk to you pendennis i have heard of all that has happened and all the chops and changes that have taken place during my absence i congratulate you on your marriage and i congratulate you on your escape tooyou understand me it was not my business to speak but i know this that a certain party is as arrant a littlewellwell never mind what you acted like a man and a trump and are well out of it i have no reason to complain said pen i went back to beg and entreat poor blanche to tell foker all i hope for her sake she will but i fear not there is but one policy strong there is but one and lucky he that can stick to it said the chevalier that rascal morgan means mischief he has been lurking about our chambers for the last two months he has found out that poor mad devil amorys secret he has been trying to discover where he was he has been pumping mr bolton and making old costigan drunk several times he bribed the inn porter to tell him when we came back and he has got into claverings service on the strength of his information he will get very good pay for it mark my words the villain where is amory asked pen at boulogne i believe i left him there and warned him not to come back i have broken with him after a desperate quarrel such as one might have expected with such a madman and im glad to think that he is in my debt now and that i have been the means of keeping him out of more harms than one he has lost all his winnings i suppose said pen no he is rather better than when he went away or was a fortnight ago he had extraordinary luck at baden broke the bank several nights and was the fable of the place he lied himself there with a fellow by the name of bloundell who gathered about him a society of all sorts of sharpers male and female russians germans french english amory got so insolent that i was obliged to thrash him one day within an inch of his life i couldnt help myself the fellow has plenty of pluck and i had nothing for it but to hit out and did he call you out said pen you think if i had shot him i should have done nobody any harm no sir i waited for his challenge but it never came and the next time i met him he begged my pardon and said strong i beg your pardon you whopped me and you served me right i shook hands but i couldnt live with him after that i paid him what i owed him the night before said strong with a blush i pawned every thing to pay him and then i went with my last ten florins and had a shy at the roulette if i had lost i should have let him shoot me in the morning i was weary of my life by jove sir isnt it a shame that a man like me who may have had a few bills out but who never deserted a friend or did an unfair action shouldnt be able to turn his hand to any thing to get bread i made a good night sir at roulette and ive done with that im going into the wine business my wifes relations live at cadiz i intend to bring over spanish wine and hams theres a fortune to be made by it sira fortuneheres my card if you want any sherry or hams recollect ned strong is your man and the chevalier pulled out a handsome card stating that strong and company shepherds inn were sole agents of the celebrated diamond manzanilla of the duke of garbanzos grandee of spain of the first class and of the famous toboso hams fed on acorns only in the country of don quixote come and taste em sircome and try em at my chambers you see ive an eye to business and by jove this time ill succeed pen laughed as he took the card i dont know whether i shall be allowed to go to bachelors parties he said you know im going to but you must have sherry sir you must have sherry i will have it from you depend on it said the other and i think you are very well out of your other partnership that worthy altamont and his daughter correspond i hear pen added after a pause yes she wrote him the longest rigmarole letters that i used to read the sly little devil and he answered under cover to mrs bonner he was for carrying her off the first day or two and nothing would content him but having back his child but she didnt want to come as you may fancy and he was not very eager about it here the chevalier burst out in a laugh why sir do you know what was the cause of our quarrel and boxing match there was a certain widow at baden a madame la baronne de la cruchecassee who was not much better than himself and whom the scoundrel wanted to marry and would but that i told her he was married already i dont think that she was much better than he was i saw her on the pier at boulogne the day i came to england and now we have brought up our narrative to the point whither the announcement in the chatteris champion had already conducted us it wanted but very very few days before that blissful one when foker should call blanche his own the clavering folks had all pressed to see the most splendid new carriage in the whole world which was standing in the coachhouse at the clavering arms and shown in grateful return for drink commonly by mr fokers head coachman madame fribsby was occupied in making some lovely dresses for the tenants daughters who were to figure as a sort of bridemaids chorus at the breakfast and marriage ceremony and immense festivities were to take place at the park upon this delightful occasion yes mr huxter yes a happy tenantry its countrys pride will assemble in the baronial hall where the beards will wag all the ox shall be slain and the cup theyll drain and the bells shall peal quite genteel and my fatherinlaw with the tear of sensibility bedewing his eye shall bless us at his baronial porch that shall be the order of proceedings i think mr huxter and i hope we shall see you and your lovely bride by her husbands side and what will you please to drink sir mrs lightfoot madam you will give to my excellent friend and body surgeon mr huxter mr samuel huxter mrcs every refreshment that your hostel affords and place the festive amount to my account and mr lightfoot sir what will you take though youve had enough already i think yes ha so spoke harry foker in the bar of the clavering arms he had apartments at that hotel and had gathered a circle of friends round him there he treated all to drink who came he was hailfellow with every man he was so happy he danced round madam fribsby mrs lightfoots great ally as she sate pensive in the bar he consoled mrs lightfoot who had already begun to have causes of matrimonial disquiet for the truth must be told that young lightfoot having now the full command of the cellar had none over his own unbridled desires and was tippling and tipsy from morning till night and a piteous sight it was for his fond wife to behold the big youth reeling about the yard and coffeeroom or drinking with the farmers and tradesmen his own neat wines and carefullyselected stock of spirits when he could find time mr morgan the butler came from the park and took a glass at the expense of the landlord of the clavering arms he watched poor lightfoots tipsy vagaries with savage sneers mrs lightfoot felt always doubly uncomfortable when her unhappy spouse was under his comrades eye but a few months married and to think he had got to this madame fribsby could feel for her madame fribsby could tell her stories of men every bit as bad she had had her own woes too and her sad experience of men so it is that nobody seems happy altogether and that theres bitters as mr foker remarked in the cup of every mans life and yet there did not seem to be any in his the honest young fellow it was brimming over with happiness and goodhumor mr morgan was constant in his attentions to foker and yet i dont like him somehow said the candid young man to mrs lightfoot he always seems as if he was measuring me for my coffin somehow painlaws afraid of him painlaws ahem never mind but mainlaws a trump mrs lightfoot indeed my lady was and mrs lightfoot owned with a sigh that perhaps it had been better for her had she never left her mistress no i do not like thee dr fell the reason why i can not tell continued mr foker and he wants to be taken as my head man blanche wants me to take him why does miss amory like him so did miss blanche like him so the notion seemed to disturb mrs lightfoot very much and there came to this worthy landlady another cause for disturbance a letter bearing the boulogne postmark was brought to her one morning and she and her husband were quarreling over it as foker passed down the stairs by the bar on his way to the park his custom was to breakfast there and bask awhile in the presence of armida then as the company of clavering tired him exceedingly and he did not care for sporting he would return for an hour or two to billiards and the society of the clavering arms then it would be time to ride with miss amory and after dining with her he left her and returned modestly to his inn lightfoot and his wife were quarreling over the letter what was that letter from abroad why was she always having letters from abroad who wrote emhe would know he didnt believe it was her brother it was no business of his it was a business of his and with a curse he seized hold of his wife and dashed at her pocket for the letter the poor woman gave a scream and said well take it just as her husband seized on the letter and mr foker entered at the door she gave another scream at seeing him and once more tried to seize the paper lightfoot opened it shaking her away and an inclosure dropped down on the breakfast table hands off man alive cried little harry springing in dont lay hands on a woman sir the man that lays his hand upon a woman save in the way of kindness is ahallo its a letter for miss amory whats this mrs lightfoot mrs lightfoot began in piteous tones of reproach to her husband you unmanly to treat a woman so who took you off the street o you coward to lay your hand upon your wife why did i marry you why did i leave my lady for you why did i spend eight hundred pound in fitting up this house that you might drink and guzzle she gets letters and she wont tell me who writes letters said mr lightfoot with a muzzy voice its a family affair sir will you take any thing sir i will take this letter to miss amory as i am going to the park said foker turning very pale and taking it up from the table which was arranged for the poor landladys breakfast he went away hes comindammy whos acomin whos ja mrs lightfoot curse me whos ja cried the husband mrs lightfoot cried out be quiet you tipsy brute doand running to her bonnet and shawl threw them on saw mr foker walking down the street took the bylane which skirts it and ran as quickly as she could to the lodgegate clavering park foker saw a running figure before him but it was lost when he got to the lodgegate he stopped and asked who was that who had just come in mrs bonner was it he reeled almost in his walk the trees swam before him he rested once or twice against the trunks of the naked limes lady clavering was in the breakfastroom with her son and her husband yawning over his paper goodmorning harry said the begum heres letters lots of letters lady rockminster will be here on tuesday instead of monday and arthur and the major come today and laura is to go dr portmans and come to church from there andwhats the matter my dear what makes you so pale harry where is blanche asked harry in a sickening voice not down yet blanche is always the last said the boy eating muffins shes a regular dawdle she is when youre not here she lays in bed till lunch time be quiet frank said the mother blanche came down presently looking pale and with rather an eager look toward foker then she advanced and kissed her mother and had a face beaming with her very best smiles on when she greeted harry how do you do sir she said and put out both her hands im ill answered harry iive brought a letter for you blanche a letter and from whom is it pray voyons she said i dont knowi should like to know said foker how can i tell until i see it asked blanche has mrs bonner not told you he said with a shaking voice theres some secret you give her the letter lady clavering lady clavering wondering took the letter from poor fokers shaking hand and looked at the superscription as she looked at it she too began to shake in every limb and with a scared face she dropped the letter and running up to frank clutched the boy to her and burst out with a sob take that awayits impossible its impossible what is the matter cried blanche with rather a ghastly smile the letter is only fromfrom a poor pensioner and relative of ours its not true its not true screamed lady clavering no my frankis it clavering blanche had taken up the letter and was moving with it toward the fire but foker ran to her and clutched her arm i must see that letter he said give it to me you shant burn it youyou shall not treat miss amory so in my house cried the baronet give back the letter by jove read itand look at her

at an hotel where there is good company and which is kep in good style i dont know whether i quite approve of your throwing over mr p for mr f and dont think fokers such a pretty name and from your account of him he seems a muff and not a beauty but he has got the rowdy which is the thing so no more my dear little betsy till we meet from your affectionate father j amory altamont read it lady clavering it is too late to keep it from you now said poor foker and the distracted woman having cast her eyes over it again broke out into hysterical screams and convulsively grasped her son they have made an outcast of you my boy she said theyve dishonored your old mother but im innocent frank before god im innocent i didnt know this mr foker indeed indeed i didnt im sure you didnt said foker going up and kissing her hand generous generous harry cried out blanche in an ecstasy but he withdrew his hand which was upon her side and turned from her with a quivering lip thats different he says

that night when arthur warned me dont refuse her harry cried lady clavering take her take every thing i have its all hers you know at my death this boys disinheritedmaster frank who had been looking as scared at the strange scene here burst into a loud crytake every shilling give me just enough to live and to go and hide my head with this child and to fly from both oh theyve both been bad bad men

marry thatthat convicts daughter come away frank my darling come to your poor old mother well hide ourselves but were honest yes we are honest all this while a strange feeling of exultation had taken possession of blanches mind that month with poor harry had been a weary month to her all his fortune and splendor scarcely sufficed to make the idea of himself supportable she was weaned of his simple ways and sick of coaxing and cajoling him stay mamma stay madam she cried out with a gesture which was always appropriate though rather theatrical i have no heart have i i keep the secret of my mothers shame i give up my rights to my halfbrother and my bastard brotheryes my rights and my fortune i dont betray my father and for this i have no heart ill have my rights now and the laws of my country shall give them to me i appeal to my countrys lawsyes my countrys laws the persecuted one returns this day i desire to go to my father and the little lady swept round her hand and thought that she was a heroine you will will you cried out clavering with one of his usual oaths im a magistrate and dammy ill commit him heres a chaise coming perhaps its him let him come a chaise was indeed coming up the avenue and the two women shrieked each their loudest expecting at that moment to see altamont arrive the door opened and mr morgan announced major pendennis and mr pendennis who entered and found all parties engaged in this fierce quarrel a large screen fenced the breakfastroom from the hall and it is probable that according to his custom mr morgan had taken advantage of the screen to make himself acquainted with all that occurred it had been arranged on the previous day that the young people should ride and at the appointed hour in the afternoon mr fokers horses arrived from the clavering arms but miss blanche did not accompany him on this occasion pen came out and shook hands with him on the doorsteps and harry foker rode away followed by his groom in mourning the whole transactions which have occupied the most active part of our history were debated by the parties concerned during those two or three hours many counsels had been given stories told and compromises suggested and at the end harry foker rode away with a sad god bless you from pen there was a dreary dinner at clavering park at which the lately installed butler did not attend and the ladies were both absent after dinner pen said i will walk down to clavering and see if he is come and he walked through the dark avenue across the bridge and road by his own cottagethe once quiet and familiar fields of which were flaming with the kilns and forges of the artificers employed on the new railroad works and so he entered the town and made for the clavering arms it was past midnight when he returned to clavering park he was exceedingly pale and agitated is lady clavering up yet he asked yes she was in her own sittingroom he went up to her and there found the poor lady in a piteous state of tears and agitation it is iarthur he said looking in and entering he took her hand very affectionately and kissed it you were always the kindest of friends to me dear lady clavering he said i love you very much i have got some news for you dont call me by that name she said pressing his hand you were always a good boy arthur and its kind of you to come nowvery kind you sometimes look very like your ma my dear dear good lady clavering arthur repeated with particular emphasis something very strange has happened has any thing happened to him gasped lady clavering o its horrid to think i should be glad of ithorrid he is well he has been and is gone my dear lady dont alarm yourselfhe is gone and you are lady clavering still is it true what he sometimes said to me she screamed outthat he he was married before he married you said pen he has confessed it tonight he will never come back there came another shriek from lady clavering as she flung her arms round pen and kissed him and burst into tears on his shoulder what pen had to tell through a multiplicity of sobs and interruptions must be compressed briefly for behold our prescribed limit is reached and our tale is coming to its end with the branch coach from the railroad which had succeeded the old alacrity and perseverance amory arrived and was set down at the clavering arms he ordered his dinner at the place under his assumed name of altamont and being of a jovial turn he welcomed the landlord who was nothing loth to a share of his wine having extracted from mr lightfoot all the news regarding the family at the park and found from examining his host that mrs lightfoot as she said had kept his counsel he called for more wine of mr lightfoot and at the end of this symposium both being greatly excited went into mrs lightfoots bar she was there taking tea with her friend madame fribsby and lightfoot was by this time in such a happy state as not to be surprised at any thing which might occur so that when altamont shook hands with mrs lightfoot as an old acquaintance the recognition did not appear to him to be in the least strange but only a reasonable cause for further drinking the gentlemen partook then of brandyandwater which they offered to the ladies not heeding the terrified looks of one or the other while they were so engaged at about six oclock in the evening mr morgan sir francis claverings new man came in and was requested to drink he selected his favorite beverage and the parties engaged in general conversation after awhile mr lightfoot began to doze mr morgan had repeatedly given hints to mrs fribsby to quit the premises but that lady strangely fascinated and terrified it would seem or persuaded by mrs lightfoot not to go kept her place her persistence occasioned much annoyance to mr morgan who vented his displeasure in such language as gave pain to mrs lightfoot and caused mr altamont to say that he was a rum customer and not polite to the sex the altercation between the two gentlemen became very painful to the women especially to mrs lightfoot who did every thing to soothe mr morgan and under pretense of giving a pipelight to the stranger she handed him a paper on which she had privily written the words he knows you go there may have been something suspicious in her manner of handing or in her guests of reading the paper for when he got up a short time afterward and said he would go to bed morgan rose too with a laugh and said it was too early to go to bed the stranger then said he would go to his bedroom morgan said he would show him the way at this the guest said come up ive got a brace of pistols up there to blow out the brains of any traitor or skulking spy and glared so fiercely upon morgan that the latter seizing hold of lightfoot by the collar and waking him said john amory i arrest you in the queens name stand by me lightfoot this capture is worth a thousand pounds he put forward his hand as if to seize his prisoner but the other doubling his fist gave morgan with his left hand so fierce a blow on the chest that it knocked him back behind mr lightfoot that gentleman who was athletic and courageous said he would knock his guests head off and prepared to do so as the stranger tearing off his coat and cursing both of his opponents roared to them to come on but with a piercing scream mrs lightfoot flung herself before her husband while with another and louder shriek madame fribsby ran to the stranger and calling out armstrong johnny armstrong seized hold of his naked arm on which a blue tattooing of a heart and mf were visible the ejaculation of madame fribsby seemed to astound and sober the stranger he looked down upon her and cried out its polly by jove mrs fribsby continued to exclaim this is not amory this is johnny

lightfoot and so they kept morgan until the coach came and mr amory or armstrong went away hack to london morgan had followed him but of this event arthur pendennis did not inform lady clavering and left her invoking blessings upon him at her sons door going to kiss him as he was asleep it had been a busy day we have to chronicle the events of but one day more and that was a day when mr arthur attired in a new hat a new blue frockcoat and blue handkerchief in a new fancy waistcoat new boots and new shirtstuds presented by the right honorable the countess dowager of rockminster made his appearance at a solitary breakfasttable in clavering park where he could scarce eat a single morsel of food two letters were laid by his worships plate and he chose to open the first which was in a round clerklike hand in preference to the second more familiar superscription note ran as follows garbanzos wine company shepherds innmonday my dear pendennisin congratulating you heartily upon the event which is to make you happy for life i send my very kindest remembrances to mrs pendennis whom i hope to know even longer than i have already known her and when i call her attention to the fact that one of the most necessary articles to her husbands comfort is pure sherry i know i shall have her for a customer for your worships sake but i have to speak to you of other than my own concerns yesterday afternoon a certain ja arrived at my chambers from clavering which he had left under circumstances of which you are doubtless now aware in spite of our difference i could not but give him food and shelter and he partook freely both of the garbanzos amontillado and the toboso ham and he told me what had happened to him and many other surprising adventures the rascal married at sixteen and has repeatedly since performed that ceremonyin sidney in new zealand in south america in newcastle he says first before he knew our poor friend the milliner he is a perfect don juan and it seemed as if the commendatore had at last overtaken him for as we were at our meal there came three heavy knocks at my outer door which made our friend start i have sustained a siege or two here and went to my usual place to reconnoiter thank my stars i have not a bill out in the world and besides those gentry do not come in that way i found that it was your uncles late valet morgan and a policeman i think a sham policeman and they said they had a warrant to take the person of john armstrong alias amory alias altamont a runaway convict and threatened to break in the oak now sir in my own days of captivity i had discovered a little passage along the gutter into bows and costigans window and i sent jack alias along this covered way not without terror of his life for it had grown very cranky and then after a parley let in mons morgan and friend the rascal had been instructed about that covered way for he made for the room instantly telling the policeman to go down stairs and keep the gate and he charged up my little staircase as if he had known the premises as he was going out of the window we heard a voice that you know from bows garret saying who are ye and hwhat the divvle are ye at youd betther leave the gutther bedad theres a man killed himself already and as morgan crossing over and looking into the darkness was trying to see whether this awful news was true he took a broomstick and with a vigorous dash broke down the pipe of communicationand told me this morning with great glee that he was reminded of that aisy sthratagem by remembering his dorling emilie when she acted the pawrt of cora in the pleeand by the bridge in pezawro bedad i wish that scoundrel morgan had been on the bridge when the general tried his sthratagem if i hear more of jack alias i will tell you he has got plenty of money still and i wanted him to send some to our poor friend the milliner but the scoundrel laughed and said he had no more than he wanted but offered to give any body a lock of his hair farewellbe happy and believe me always truly yours e strong and now for the other letter said pen dear old fellow and he kissed the seal before he broke it warrington tuesday i must not let the day pass over without saying a god bless you to both of you may heaven make you happy dear arthur and dear laura i think pen that you have the best wife in the world and pray that as such you will cherish her and tend her the chambers will be lonely without you dear pen but if i am tired i shall have a new home to go to in the house of my brother and sister i am practicing in the nursery here in order to prepare for the part of uncle george farewell make your wedding tour and come back to your affectionate g w pendennis and his wife read this letter together after doctor portmans breakfast was over and the guests were gone and when the carriage was waiting amidst the crowd at the doctors outer gate but the wicket led into the churchyard of st marys where the bells were pealing with all their might and it was here over helens green grass that arthur showed his wife georges letter for which of those twofor grief was it or for happiness that lauras tears abundantly fell on the paper and once more in the presence of the sacred dust she kissed and blessed her arthur there was only one marriage on that day at clavering church for in spite of blanches sacrifices for her dearest mother honest harry foker could not pardon the woman who had deceived her husband and justly argued that she would deceive him again he went to the pyramids and syria and there left his malady behind him and returned with a fine beard and a supply of tarbooshes and nargillies with which he regales all his friends he lives splendidly and through pens mediation gets his wine from the celebrated vintages of the duke of garbanzos as for poor cos his fate has been mentioned in an early part of this story no very glorious end could be expected to such a career morgan is one of the most respectable men in the parish of st jamess and in the present political movement has pronounced himself like a man and a briton and bowson the demise of mr piper who played the organ at clavering little mrs sam huxter who has the entire command of doctor portman brought bows down from london to contest the organ chair loft and her candidate carried the chair when sir francis clavering quitted this worthless life the same little indefatigable canvasser took the borough by storm and it is now represented by arthur pendennis esq blanche amory it is well known married at paris and the saloons of madame la comtesse de montmorenci de valentinois were among the most suivis of that capital the duel between the count and the young and fiery representative of the mountain alcide de mirobo arose solely from the latter questioning at the club the titles borne by the former nobleman madame de montmorenci de valentinois traveled after the adventure and bungay bought her poems and published them with the countesss coronet emblazoned on the countesss work major pendennis became very serious in his last days and was never so happy as when laura was reading to him with her sweet voice or listening to his stories for this sweet lady is the friend of the young and the old and her life is always passed in making other lives happy and what sort of a husband would this pendennis be many a reader will ask doubting the happiness of such a marriage and the fortune of laura the querists if they meet her are referred to that lady herself who seeing his faults and wayward moodsseeing and owning that there are men better than heloves him always with the most constant affection his children or their mother have never heard a harsh word from him and when his fits of moodiness and solitude are over welcome him back with a neverfailing regard and confidence his friend is his friend stillentirely heartwhole that malady is never fatal to a sound organ and george goes through his part of godpapa perfectly and lives alone if mr pens works have procured him more reputation than has been acquired by his abler friend whom no one knows george lives contented without the fame if the best men do not draw the great prizes in life we know it has been so settled by the ordainer of the lottery we own and see daily how the false and worthless live and prosper while the good are called away and the dear and young perish untimelywe perceive in every mans life the maimed happiness the frequent falling the bootless endeavor the struggle of right and wrong in which the strong often succumb and the swift fail we see flowers of good blooming in foul places as in the most lofty and splendid fortunes flaws of vice and meanness and stains of evil and knowing how mean the best of us is let us give a hand of charity to arthur pendennis with all his faults and shortcomings who does not claim to be a hero but only a man and a brother the end
