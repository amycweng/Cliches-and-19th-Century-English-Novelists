yellowplush's ajew skimmings from the dairy of george iv epistles to the literati memoirs of mr charles j yellowplush miss shum's husband chapter i i was born in the year one of the present or christian hera and am in consquints seven and thirty years old my mamma called me charles james harrington fitzroy yellowplush in compliment to several noble families and to a sellybrated coachmin whom she knew who wore a yellow livry and drove the lord mayor of london why she gev me this genlmn's name is a diffiklty or rayther the name of a part of his dress however it's stuck to me through life in which i was as it were a footman by buth praps he was my father though on this subjict i can't speak suttinly for my ma wrapped up my buth in a mistry i may be illygitmit i may have been changed at nuss but i've always had genlmnly tastes through life and have no doubt that i come of a genlmnly origum the less i say about my parint the better for the dear old creatur was very good to me and i fear had very little other goodness in her why i can't say but i always passed as her nevyou we led a strange life sometimes ma was dressed in sattn and rooge and sometimes in rags and dutt sometimes i got kisses and sometimes kix sometimes gin and sometimes shampang law bless us how she used to swear at me and cuddle me there we were quarrelling and making up sober and tipsy starving and guttling by turns just as ma got money or spent it but let me draw a vail over the seen and speak of her no more its 'sfishant for the public to know that her name was miss montmorency and we lived in the new cut my poor mother died one morning hev'n bless her and i was left alone in this wide wicked wuld without so much money as would buy me a penny roal for my brexfast but there was some amongst our naybors and let me tell you there's more kindness among them poor disrepettable creaturs than in half a dozen lords or barrynets who took pity upon poor sal's orfin for they bust out laffin when i called her miss montmorency and gev me bred and shelter i'm afraid in spite of their kindness that my morrils wouldn't have improved if i'd stayed long among 'em but a benny violent genlmn saw me and put me to school the academy which i went to was called the free school of saint bartholomew's the less the young genlmn wore green baize coats yellow leather whatsisnames a tin plate on the left arm and a cap about the size of a muffing i stayed there sicks years from sicks that is to say till my twelth year during three years of witch i distinguished myself not a little in the musicle way for i bloo the bellus of the church horgin and very fine tunes we played too well it's not worth recounting my jewvenile follies what trix we used to play the applewoman and how we put snuff in the old clark's prayer book my eye but one day a genlmn entered the school room it was on the very day when i went to subtraxion and asked the master for a young lad for a servant they pitched upon me glad enough and nex day found me sleeping in the sculry close under the sink at mr bago's country house at pentonwille bago kep a shop in smithfield market and drov a taring good trade in the hoil and italian way i've heard him say that he cleared no less than fifty pounds every year by letting his front room at hanging time his winders looked right opsit newgit and many and many dozen chaps has he seen hanging there laws was laws in the year ten and they screwed chaps' nex for nex to nothink but my bisniss was at his country house where i made my first ontray into fashnabl life i was knife errint and stable boy then and an't ashamed to own it for my merrits have raised me to what i am two livries forty pound a year malt licker washin silk stocking and wax candles not countin wails which is somethink pretty considerable at our house i can tell you i didn't stay long here for a suckmstance happened which got me a very different situation a handsome young genlmn who kep a tilbry and a ridin horse at livry wanted a tiger i bid at once for the place and being a neat tidy looking lad he took me bago gave me a character and he my first livry proud enough i was of it as you may fancy my new master had some business in the city for he went in every morning at ten got out of his tilbry at the citty road and had it waiting for him at six when if it was summer he spanked round into the park and drove one of the neatest turnouts there wery proud i was in a gold laced hat a drab coat and a red weskit to sit by his side when he drove i already began to ogle the gals in the carridges and to feel that longing for fashionabl life which i've had ever since when he was at the oppera or the play down i went to skittles or to white condick gardens and mr frederic altamont's young man was somebody i warrant to be sure there is very few man servants at pentonwille the poppylation being mostly gals of all work and so though only fourteen i was as much a man down there as if i had been as old as jerusalem but the most singular thing was that my master who was such a gay chap should live in such a hole he had only a ground floor in john street a parlor and a bedroom i slep over the way and only came in with his boots and brexfast of a morning the house he lodged in belonged to mr and mrs shum they were a poor but proliffic couple who had rented the place for many years and they and their family were squeezed in it pretty tight i can tell you shum said he had been a hofficer and so he had he had been a sub deputy assistant vice commissary or some such think and as i heerd afterwards had been obliged to leave on account of his nervousness he was such a coward the fact is that he was considered dangerous to the harmy and sent home he had married a widow buckmaster who had been a miss slamcoe she was a bristol gal and her father being a bankrup in the tallow chandlering way left in course a pretty little sum of money a thousand pound was settled on her and she was as high and mighty as if it had been a millium buckmaster died leaving nothink nothink except four ugly daughters by miss slamcoe and her forty pound a year was rayther a narrow income for one of her appytite and pretensions in an unlucky hour for shum she met him he was a widower with a little daughter of three years old a little house at pentonwille and a little income about as big as her own i believe she bullyd the poor creature into marridge and it was agreed that he should let his ground floor at john street and so add somethink to their means they married and the widow buckmaster was the gray mare i can tell you she was always talking and blustering about her famly the celebrity of the buckmasters and the antickety of the slamcoes they had a six roomed house not counting kitching and sculry and now twelve daughters in all whizz miss buckmasters miss betsy miss dosy miss biddy and miss winny miss shum mary by name shum's daughter and seven others who shall be nameless mrs shum was a fat red haired woman at least a foot taller than s who was but a yard and a half high pale faced red nosed knock kneed bald headed his nose and shut frill all brown with snuff before the house was a little garden where the washin of the famly was all ways hanging there was so many of 'em that it was obliged to be done by relays there was six rails and a stocking on each and four small goosbry bushes always covered with some bit of linning or other the hall was a regular puddle wet dabs of dishclouts flapped in your face soapy smoking bits of flanning went nigh to choke you and while you were looking up to prevent hanging yourself with the ropes which were strung across and about slap came the hedge of a pail against your shins till one was like to be drove mad with hagony the great slattnly doddling girls was always on the stairs poking about with nasty flower pots a cooking something or sprawling in the window seats with greasy curl papers reading greasy novels an infernal pianna was jingling from morning till night two eldest miss buckmasters battle of prag six youngest miss shums in my cottage till i knew every note in the battle of prag and cussed the day when in my cottage was rote the younger girls too were always bouncing and thumping about the house with torn pinnyfores and dogs eard grammars and large pieces of bread and treacle i never see such a house as for mrs shum she was such a fine lady that she did nothink but lay on the drawing room sophy read novels drink scold scream and go into hystarrix little shum kep reading an old newspaper from weeks' end to weeks' end when he was not engaged in teaching the children or goin for the beer or cleanin the shoes for they kep no servant this house in john street was in short a regular pandymony what could have brought mr frederic altamont to dwell in such a place the reason is hobvius he adoared the fust miss shum and suttnly he did not show a bad taste for though the other daughters were as ugly as their hideous ma mary shum was a pretty little pink modest creatur with glossy black hair and tender blue eyes and a neck as white as plaster of parish she wore a dismal old black gownd which had grown too short for her and too tight but it only served to show her pretty angles and feet and bewchus figger master though he had looked rather low for the gal of his art had certainly looked in the right place never was one more pretty or more hamiable i gav her always the buttered toast left from our brexfust and a cup of tea or chocklate as altamont might fancy and the poor thing was glad enough of it i can vouch for they had precious short commons up stairs and she the least of all for it seemed as if which of the shum famly should try to snub the poor thing most there was the four buckmaster girls always at her it was mary git the coal skittle mary run down to the public house for the beer mary i intend to wear your clean stockens out walking or your new bonnet to church only her poor father was kind to her and he poor old muff his kindness was of no use mary bore all the scolding like a hangel as she was no not if she had a pair of wings and a goold trumpet could she have been a greater hangel i never shall forgit one seen that took place it was when master was in the city and so having nothink earthly to do i happened to be listening on the stairs the old scolding was a going on and the old tune of that hojus battle of prag old shum made some remark and miss buckmaster cried out law pa what a fool you are all the gals began laffin and so did mrs shum all that is excep mary who turned as red as flams and going up to miss betsy buckmaster give her two such wax on her great red ears as made them tingle again old mrs shum screamed and ran at her like a bengal tiger her great arms vent veeling about like a vinmill as she cuffed and thumped poor mary for taking her pa's part mary shum who was always a crying before didn't shed a tear now i will do it again she said if betsy insults my father new thumps new shreex and the old horridan went on beatin the poor girl till she was quite exosted and fell down on the sophy puffin like a poppus for shame mary began old shum for shame you naughty gal you for hurting the feelings of your dear mamma and beating your kind sister why it was because she called you a if she did you pert miss said shum looking mighty dignitified i could correct her and not you you correct me indeed said miss betsy turning up her nose if possible higher than before i should like to see you erect me imperence and they all began laffin again by this time mrs s had recovered from the effex of her exsize and she began to pour in her wolly fust she called mary names then shum oh why screeched she why did i ever leave a genteel famly where i ad every ellygance and lucksry to marry a creatur like this he is unfit to be called a man he is unworthy to marry a gentlewoman and as for that hussy i disown her thank heaven she an't a slamcoe she is only fit to be a shum that's true mamma said all the gals for their mother had taught them this pretty piece of manners and they despised their father heartily indeed i have always remarked that in famlies where the wife is internally talking about the merits of her branch the husband is invariably a spooney well when she was exosted again down she fell on the sofy at her old trix more screeching more convulshuns and she wouldn't stop this time till shum had got her half a pint of her old remedy from the blue lion over the way she grew more easy as she finished the gin but mary was sent out of the room and told not to come back agin all day miss mary says i for my heart yurned to the poor gal as she came sobbing and miserable down stairs miss mary says i if i might make so bold here's master's room empty and i know where the cold bif and pickles is oh charles said she nodding her head sadly i'm too retched to have any happytite and she flung herself on a chair and began to cry fit to bust at this moment who should come in but my master i had taken hold of miss mary's hand somehow and do believe i should have kist it when as i said haltamont made his appearance what's this cries he lookin at me as black as thunder or as mr phillips as hickit in the new tragedy of macbuff it's only miss mary sir answered i get out sir says he as fierce as posbil and i felt somethink i think it was the tip of his to touching me behind and found myself nex minit sprawling among the wet flannings and buckets and things the people from up stairs came to see what was the matter as i was cussin and crying out it's only charles ma screamed out miss betsy where's mary says mrs shum from the sofy she's in master's room miss said i she's in the lodger's room ma cries miss shum heckoing me very good tell her to stay there till he comes back and then miss shum went bouncing up the stairs again little knowing of haltamont's return i'd long before observed that my master had an anchoring after mary shum indeed as i have said it was purely for her sake that he took and kep his lodgings at pentonwille excep for the sake of love which is above being mersnary fourteen shillings a wick was a little too strong for two such rat holes as he lived in i do blieve the famly had nothing else but their lodger to live on they brekfisted off his tea leaves they cut away pounds and pounds of meat from his jints he always dined at home and his baker's bill was at least enough for six but that wasn't my business i saw him grin sometimes when i laid down the cold bif of a morning to see how little was left of yesterday's sirline but he never said a syllabub for true love don't mind a pound of meat or so hextra at first he was very kind and attentive to all the gals miss betsy in partickler grew mighty fond of him they sat for whole evenings playing cribbitch he taking his pipe and glas she her tea and muffing but as it was improper for her to come alone she brought one of her sisters and this was genrally mary for he made a pint of asking her too and one day when one of the others came instead he told her very quitely that he hadn't invited her and miss buckmaster was too fond of muffings to try this game on again besides she was jealous of her three grown sisters and considered mary as only a child law bless us how she used to ogle him and quot bits of pottry and play meet me by moonlike on an old gitter she reglar flung herself at his head but he wouldn't have it bein better ockypied elsewhere one night as genteel as possible he brought home tickets for ashley's and proposed to take the two young ladies miss betsy and miss mary in course i recklect he called me aside that afternoon assuming a solamon and misterus hare charles said he are you up to snuff why sir said i i'm genrally considered tolerably downy well says he i'll give you half a suffering if you can manage this bisness for me i've chose a rainy night on purpus when the theatre is over you must be waitin with two umbrellows give me one and hold the other over miss buckmaster and hark ye sir turn to the right when you leave the theater and say the coach is ordered to stand a little way up the street in order to get rid of the crowd we went in a fly hired by mr a and never shall i forgit cartliche's hacting on that memrable night talk of kimble talk of magreedy ashley's for my money with cartlitch in the principal part but this is nothink to the porpus when the play was over i was at the door with the umbrellos it was raining cats and dogs sure enough mr altamont came out presently miss mary under his arm and miss betsy following behind rayther sulky this way sir cries i pushin forward and i threw a great cloak over miss betsy fit to smother her mr a and miss mary skipped on and was out of sight when miss betsy's cloak was settled you may be sure they're only gone to the fly miss it's a little way up the street away from the crowd of carridges and off we turned to the right and no mistake after marchin a little through the plash and mud has anybody seen coxy's fly cries i with the most innocent haxent in the world cox's fly hollows out one chap is it the vaggin you want says another i see the blackin wan pass giggles out another gentlmn and there was such a hinterchange of compliments as you never heerd i pass them over though because some of 'em were not wery genteel law miss said i what shall i do my master will never forgive me and i haven't a single sixpence to pay a coach miss betsy was just going to call one when i said that but the coachman wouldn't have it at that price he said and i knew very well that she hadn't four or five shillings to pay for a wehicle so in the midst of that tarin rain at midnight we had to walk four miles from westminster bridge to pentonwille and what was wuss i didn't happen to know the way a very nice walk it was and no mistake at about half past two we got safe to john street my master was at the garden gate miss mary flew into miss betsy's arms while master begun cussin and swearing at me for disobeying his orders and turning to the right instead of to the left law bless me his hacting of hanger was very near as natral and as terrybl as mr cartlich's in the play they had waited half an hour he said in the fly in the little street at the left of the theater they had drove up and down in the greatest fright possible and at last came home thinking it was in vain to wait any more they gave her 'ot rum and water and roast oysters for supper and this consoled her a little i hope nobody will cast an imputation on miss mary for her share in this adventer for she was as honest a gal as ever lived and i do believe is hignorant to this day of our little strattygim besides all's fair in love and as my master could never get to see her alone on account of her infernal eleven sisters and ma he took this opportunity of expressin his attachment to her if he was in love with her before you may be sure she paid it him back again now ever after the night at ashley's they were as tender as two tuttle doves which fully accounts for the axdent what happened to me in being kicked out of the room and in course i bore no mallis i don't know whether miss betsy still fancied that my master was in love with her but she loved muffings and tea and kem down to his parlor as much as ever now comes the sing'lar part of my history chapter ii but who was this genlmn with a fine name mr frederic altamont or what was he the most mysterus genlmn that ever i knew once i said to him on a wery rainy day sir shall i bring the gig down to your office and he gave me one of his black looks and one of his loudest hoaths and told me to mind my own bizziness and attend to my orders another day it was on the day when miss mary slapped miss betsy's face miss m who adoared him as i have said already kep on asking him what was his buth parentidg and ediccation dear frederic says she why this mistry about yourself and your hactions why hide from your little mary they were as tender as this i can tell you your buth and your professin i spose mr frederic looked black for i was only listening and he said in a voice hagitated by emotion mary said he if you love me ask me this no more let it be sfishnt for you to know that i am a honest man and that a secret what it would be misery for you to larn must hang over all my actions that is from ten o'clock till six they went on chaffin and talking in this melumcolly and mysterus way and i didn't lose a word of what they said for them houses in pentonwille have only walls made of pasteboard and you hear rayther better outside the room than in but though he kep up his secret he swore to her his affektion this day pint blank nothing should prevent him he said from leading her to the halter from makin her his adoarable wife after this was a slight silence dearest frederic mummered out miss speakin as if she was chokin i am yours yours for ever and then silence agen and one or two smax as if there was kissin going on here i thought it best to give a rattle at the door lock for as i live there was old mrs shum a walkin down the stairs it appears that one of the younger gals a looking out of the bed rum window had seen my master come in and coming down to tea half an hour afterwards said so in a cussary way old mrs shum who was a dragon of vertyou cam bustling down the stairs panting and frowning as fat and as fierce as a old sow at feedin time where's the lodger fellow says she to me i spoke loud enough to be heard down the street if you mean ma'am my master mr frederic altamont esquire he's just stept in and is puttin on clean shoes in his bedroom she said nothink in answer but flumps past me and opening the parlor door sees master looking very queer and miss mary a drooping down her head like a pale lily did you come into my famly says she to corrupt my daughters and to destroy the hinnocence of that infamous gal did you come here sir as a seducer or only as a lodger speak sir speak and she folded her arms quite fierce and looked like mrs siddums in the tragic mews i came here mrs shum said he because i loved your daughter or i never would have condescended to live in such a beggarly hole i have treated her in every respect like a genlmn and she is as innocent now ma'm as she was when she was born if she'll marry me i am ready if she'll leave you she shall have a home where she shall be neither bullyd nor starved no hangry frumps of sisters no cross mother in law only an affeckshnat husband and all the pure pleasures of hyming mary flung herself into his arms dear dear frederic says she i'll never leave you miss says mrs shum you ain't a slamcoe nor yet a buckmaster thank god you may marry this person if your pa thinks proper and he may insult me brave me trample on my feelinx in my own house and there's no o o obody by to defend me i knew what she was going to be at on came her histarrix agen and she began screechin and roaring like mad down comes of course the eleven gals and old shum there was a pretty row look here sir says she at the conduck of your precious trull of a daughter alone with this man kissin and dandlin and lawd knows what besides what he cries miss betsy he in love with mary oh the wretch the monster the deceiver and she falls down too screeching away as loud as her mamma for the silly creature fancied still that altamont had a fondness for her silence these women shouts out altamont thundering loud i love your daughter mr shum i will take her without a penny and can afford to keep her if you don't give her to me she'll come of her own will is that enough may i have her we'll talk of this matter sir says mr shum looking as high and mighty as an alderman gals go up stairs with your dear mamma and they all trooped up again and so the skrimmage ended you may be sure that old shum was not very sorry to get a husband for his daughter mary for the old creatur loved her better than all the pack which had been brought him or born to him by mrs buckmaster but strange to say when he came to talk of settlements and so forth not a word would my master answer he said he made four hundred a year reglar he wouldn't tell how but mary if she married him must share all that he had and ask no questions only this he would say as he'd said before that he was a honest man they were married in a few days and took a very genteel house at islington but still my master went away to business and nobody knew where who could he be chapter iii if ever a young kipple in the middlin classes began life with a chance of happiness it was mr and mrs frederic altamont there house at cannon row islington was as comfortable as house could be carpited from top to to pore's rates small furnitur elygant and three deomestix of which i in course was one my life wasn't so easy as in mr a's bachelor days but what then the three w's is my maxum plenty of work plenty of wittles and plenty of wages altamont kep his gig no longer but went to the city in an omlibuster one would have thought i say that mrs a with such an effeckshnut husband might have been as happy as her blessid majisty nothing of the sort for the fust six months it was all very well but then she grew gloomier and gloomier though a did everythink in life to please her old shum used to come reglarly four times a wick to cannon row where he lunched and dined and teed and supd the pore little man was a thought too fond of wine and spirits and many and many's the night that i've had to support him home and you may be sure that miss betsy did not now desert her sister she was at our place mornink noon and night not much to my mayster's liking though he was too good natured to wex his wife in trifles but betsy never had forgotten the recollection of old days and hated altamont like the foul feind she put all kind of bad things into the head of poor innocent missis who from being all gayety and cheerfulness grew to be quite melumcolly and pale and retchid just as if she had been the most misrable woman in the world in three months more a baby comes in course and with it old mrs shum who stuck to mrs' side as close as a wampire and made her retchider and retchider she used to bust into tears when altamont came home she used to sigh and wheep over the pore child and say my child my child your father is false to me or your father deceives me or what will you do when your pore mother is no more or such like sentimental stuff it all came from mother shum and her old trix as i soon found out the fact is when there is a mistry of this kind in the house its a servant's duty to listen and listen i did one day when mrs was cryin as usual and fat mrs shum a sittin consolin her as she called it though heaven knows she only grew wuss and wuss for the consolation well i listened mrs shum was a rockin the baby and missis cryin as yousual pore dear innocint says mrs s heavin a great sigh you're the child of a unknown father and a misrable mother don't speak ill of frederic mamma says missis he is all kindness to me all kindness indeed yes he gives you a fine house and a fine gownd and a ride in a fly whenever you please but where does all his money come from who is he what is he who knows that he mayn't be a murderer or a housebreaker or a utterer of forged notes how can he make his money honestly when he won't say where he gets it why does he leave you eight hours every blessid day and won't say where he goes to oh mary mary you are the most injured of women and with this mrs shum began sobbin and miss betsy began yowling like a cat in a gitter and pore missis cried too tears is so remarkable infeckshus perhaps mamma wimpered out she frederic is a shop boy and don't like me to know that he is not a gentleman a shopboy says betsy he a shopboy o no no no more likely a wretched willain of a murderer stabbin and robing all day and feedin you with the fruits of his ill gotten games more crying and screechin here took place in which the baby joined and made a very pretty consort i can tell you he can't be a robber cries missis he's too good too kind for that besides murdering is done at night and frederic is always home at eight but he can be a forger says betsy a wicked wicked forger why does he go away every day to forge notes to be sure why does he go to the city to be near banks and places and so do it more at his convenience but he brings home a sum of money every day about thirty shillings sometimes fifty and then he smiles and says it's a good day's work this is not like a forger said pore mrs a i have it i have it screams out mrs s the villain the sneaking double faced jonas he's married to somebody else he is and that's why he leaves you the base biggymist at this mrs altamont struck all of a heap fainted clean away a dreadful business it was hystarrix then hystarrix in course from mrs shum bells ringin child squalin suvvants tearin up and down stairs with hot water if ever there is a noosance in the world it's a house where faintain is always goin on i wouldn't live in one no not to be groom of the chambers and git two hundred a year it was eight o'clock in the evenin when this row took place and such a row it was that nobody but me heard master's knock he came in and heard the hooping and screeching and roaring he seemed very much frightened at first and said what is it mrs shum's here says i and mrs in astarrix altamont looked as black as thunder and growled out a word which i don't like to name let it suffice that it begins with a d and ends with a nation and he tore up stairs like mad he bust open the bedroom door missis lay quite pale and stony on the sofy the babby was screechin from the craddle miss betsy was sprawlin over missis and mrs shum half on the bed and half on the ground all howlin and squeelin like so many dogs at the moond when a came in the mother and daughter stopped all of a sudding there had been one or two tiffs before between them and they feared him as if he had been a hogre what's this infernal screeching and crying about says he oh mr altamont cries the old woman you know too well it's about you that this darling child is misrabble and why about me pray madam why sir dare you ask why because you deceive her sir because you are a false cowardly traitor sir because you have a wife elsewhere sir and the old lady and miss betsy began to roar again as loud as ever altamont pawsed for a minnit and then flung the door wide open nex he seized miss betsy as if his hand were a vice and he world her out of the room then up he goes to mrs s get up says he thundering loud you lazy trolloping mischsef making lying old fool get up and get out of this house you have been the cuss and bain of my happyniss since you entered it with your d d lies and novvle rending and histerrix you have perwerted mary and made her almost as mad as yourself my child my child shriex out mrs shum and clings round missis but altamont ran between them and griping the old lady by her arm dragged her to the door follow your daughter ma'm says he and down she went chawls see those ladies to the door he hollows out and never let them pass it again we walked down together and off they went and master locked and double locked the bedroom door after him intendin of course to have a tator tator as they say with his wife you may be sure that i followed up stairs again pretty quick to hear the result of their confidence as they say at st stevenses it was rayther a stormy debate mary says master you're no longer the merry greatful gal i knew and loved at pentonwill there's some secret a pressin on you there's no smilin welcom for me now as there used formly to be your mother and sister in law have perwerted you mary and that's why i've drove them from this house which they shall not re enter in my life o frederic it's you is the cause and not i why do you have any mistry from me where do you spend your days why did you leave me even on the day of your marridge for eight hours and continue to do so every day because says he i makes my livelihood by it i leave you and don't tell you how i make it for it would make you none the happier to know it was in this way the convysation ren on more tears and questions on my missises part more sturmness and silence on my master's it ended for the first time since their marridge in a reglar quarrel wery difrent i can tell you from all the hammerous billing and kewing which had proceeded their nupshuls master went out slamming the door in a fury as well he might says he if i can't have a comforable life i can have a jolly one and so he went off to the hed tavern and came home that evening beesly intawsicated when high words begin in a family drink generally follows on the genlman's side and then fearwell to all conjubial happyniss these two pipple so fond and loving were now sirly silent and full of il wil master went out earlier and came home later missis cried more and looked even paler than before well things went on in this uncomfortable way master still in the mopes missis tempted by the deamons of jellosy and curosity until a singlar axident brought to light all the goings on of mr altamont it was the tenth of january i recklect the day for old shum gev me half a crownd the fust and last of his money i ever see by the way he was dining along with master and they were making merry together master said as he was mixing his fifth tumler of punch and little shum his twelfth or so master said i see you twice in the city to day mr shum well that's curous says shum i was in the city to day's the day when the divvydins god bless 'em is paid and me and mrs s went for our half year's inkem but we only got out of the coach crossed the street to the bank took our money and got in agen how could you see me twice altamont stuttered and stammered and hemd and hawd o says he i was passing passing as you went in and out and he instantly turned the conversation and began talking about pollytix or the weather or some such stuff yes my dear said my missis but how could you see papa twice master didn't answer but talked pollytix more than ever still she would continy on where was you my dear when you saw pa what were you doing my love to see pa twice and so forth master looked angrier and angrier and his wife only pressed him wuss and wuss this was as i said little shum's twelfth tumler and i knew pritty well that he could git very little further for as reglar as the thirteenth came shum was drunk the thirteenth did come and its consquinzes i was obliged to leed him home to john street where i left him in the hangry arms of mrs shum how the d sayd he all the way how the d dd the deddy deddy devil could he have seen me twice chapter iv it was a sad slip on altamont's part for no sooner did he go out the next morning than missis went out too she tor down the street and never stopped till she came to her pa's house at pentonwill she was clositid for an hour with her ma and when she left her she drove straight to the city she walked before the bank and behind the bank and round the bank she came home disperryted having learned nothink and it was now an extraordinary thing that from shum's house for the next ten days there was nothing but expyditions into the city mrs s tho her dropsicle legs had never carred her half so fur before was eternally on the key veve as the french say if she didn't go miss betsy did or misses did they seemed to have an attrackshun to the bank and went there as natral as an omlibus at last one day old mrs shum comes to our house she wasn't admitted when master was there but came still in his absints and she wore a hair of tryumph as she entered mary says she where is the money your husbind brought to you yesterday my master used always to give it to missis when he returned the money ma says mary why here and pulling out her puss she showed a sovrin a good heap of silver and an odd looking little coin that's it that's it cried mrs s a queene anne's sixpence isn't it dear dated seventeen hundred and three it was so sure enough a queen ans sixpence of that very date now my love says she i have found him come with me to morrow and you shall know all and now comes the end of my story the ladies nex morning set out for the city and i walked behind doing the genteel thing with a nosegy and a goold stick we walked down the new road we walked down the city road we walked to the bank we were crossing from that heddyfiz to the other side of cornhill when all of a sudden missis shreeked and fainted spontaceously away i rushed forrard and raised her to my arms spiling thereby a new weskit and a pair of crimson smalcloes i rushed forrard i say very nearly knocking down the old sweeper who was hobbling away as fast as posibil we took her to birch's we provided her with a hackney coach and every lucksury and carried her home to islington that night master never came home nor the nex night nor the nex on the fourth day an octioneer arrived he took an infantry of the furnitur and placed a bill in the window at the end of the wick altamont made his appearance he was haggard and pale not so haggard however not so pale as his miserable wife he looked at her very tendrilly i may say it's from him that i coppied my look to miss he looked at her very tendrilly and held out his arms she gev a suffycating shreek and rusht into his umbraces mary says he you know all now i have sold my place i have got three thousand pounds for it and saved two more i've sold my house and furnitur and that brings me another we'll go abroad and love each other has formly and now you ask me who he was i shudder to relate mr haltamont swep the crossing from the bank to cornhill of cors i left his servis i met him few years after at badden badden where he and mrs a were much respectid and pass for pipple of propaty the amours of mr deuceace dimond cut dimond the name of my nex master was if posbil still more ellygant and youfonious than that of my fust i now found myself boddy servant to the honrabble halgernon percy deuceace youngest and fifth son of the earl of crabs halgernon was a barrystir that is he lived in pump cort temple a wulgar naybrood witch praps my readers don't no suffiz to say it's on the confines of the citty and the choasen aboad of the lawyers of this metrappolish when i say that mr deuceace was a barrystir i don't mean that he went sesshums or surcoats as they call 'em but simply that he kep chambers lived in pump cort and looked out for a commitionarship or a revisinship or any other place that the wig guvvyment could give him his father was a wig pier as the landriss told me and had been a toary pier the fack is his lordship was so poar that he would be anythink or nothink to get provisions for his sons and an inkum for himself i phansy that he aloud halgernon two hundred a year and it would have been a very comforable maintenants only he knever paid him owever the young genlmn was a genlmn and no mistake he got his allowents of nothing a year and spent it in the most honrabble and fashnabble manner he kep a kab he went to holmax and crockfud's he moved in the most xquizzit suckles and trubbld the law boox very little i can tell you those fashnabble gents have ways of getten money witch comman pipple doan't understand though he only had a therd floar in pump cort he lived as if he had the welth of cresas the tenpun notes floo abowt as common as haypince clarrit and shampang was at his house as vulgar as gin and verry glad i was to be sure to be a valley to a zion of the nobillaty deuceace had in his sittin room a large pictur on a sheet of paper the names of his family was wrote on it it was wrote in the shape of a tree a groin out of a man in armer's stomick and the names were on little plates among the bows the pictur said that the deuceaces kem into england in the year along with william conqueruns my master called it his podygree i do bleev it was because he had this pictur and because he was the honrabble deuceace that he mannitched to live as he did if he had been a common man you'd have said he was no better than a swinler it's only rank and buth that can warrant such singularities as my master show'd for it's no use disgysing it the honrabble halgernon was a gambler for a man of wulgar family it's the wust trade that can be for a man of common feelinx of honesty this profession is quite imposbil but for a real thoroughbread genlmn it's the esiest and most prophetable line he can take it may praps appear curious that such a fashnabble man should live in the temple but it must be recklected that it's not only lawyers who live in what's called the ins of cort many batchylers who have nothink to do with lor have here their loginx and many sham barrysters who never put on a wig and gownd twise in their lives kip apartments in the temple instead of bon street pickledilly or other fashnabble places frinstance on our stairkis so these houses are called there was sets of chamberses and only lawyers these was bottom floar screwson hewson and jewson attorneys fust floar mr sergeant flabber opsite mr counslor bruffy and secknd pair mr haggerstony an irish counslor praktising at the old baly and lickwise what they call reporter to the morning post nyouspapper opsite him was wrote mr richard blewitt and on the thud floar with my master lived one mr dawkins this young fellow was a new comer into the temple and unlucky it was for him too he'd better have never been born for it's my firm apinion that the temple ruined him that is with the help of my master and mr dick blewitt as you shall hear mr dawkins as i was gave to understand by his young man had just left the universary of oxford and had a pretty little fortn of his own six thousand pound or so in the stox he was jest of age an orfin who had lost his father and mother and having distinkwished hisself at collitch where he gained seffral prices was come to town to push his fortn and study the barryster's bisness not bein of a very high fammly hisself indeed i've heard say his father was a chismonger or somethink of that lo sort dawkins was glad to find his old oxford frend mr blewitt yonger son to rich squire blewitt of listershire and to take rooms so near him now tho' there was a considdrable intimacy between me and mr blewitt's gentleman there was scarcely any betwixt our masters mine being too much of the aristoxy to associate with one of mr blewitt's sort blewitt was what they call a bettin man he went reglar to tattlesall's kep a pony wore a white hat a blue berd's eye handkercher and a cut away coat in his manners he was the very contrary of my master who was a slim ellygant man as ever i see he had very white hands rayther a sallow face with sharp dark ise and small wiskus neatly trimmed and as black as warren's jet he spoke very low and soft he seemed to be watchin the person with whom he was in convysation and always flatterd everybody as for blewitt he was quite of another sort he was always swearin singing and slappin people on the back as hearty as posbill he seemed a merry careless honest cretur whom one would trust with life and soul so thought dawkins at least who though a quiet young man fond of his boox novvles byron's poems foot playing and such like scientafic amusemints grew hand in glove with honest dick blewitt and soon after with my master the honrabble halgernon poor daw he thought he was makin good connexions and real frends he had fallen in with a couple of the most etrocious swinlers that ever lived before mr dawkins's arrivial in our house mr deuceace had barely condysended to speak to mr blewitt it was only about a month after that suckumstance that my master all of a sudding grew very friendly with him the reason was pretty clear deuceace wanted him dawkins had not been an hour in master's company before he knew that he had a pidgin to pluck blewitt knew this too and bein very fond of pidgin intended to keep this one entirely to himself it was amusin to see the honrabble halgernon manuvring to get this poor bird out of blewitt's clause who thought he had it safe in fact he'd brought dawkins to these chambers for that very porpos thinking to have him under his eye and strip him at leisure my master very soon found out what was mr blewitt's game gamblers know gamblers if not by instink at least by reputation and though mr blewitt moved in a much lower speare than mr deuceace they knew each other's dealins and caracters puffickly well charles you scoundrel says deuceace to me one day he always spoak in that kind way who is this person that has taken the opsit chambers and plays the flute so industrusly it's mr dawkins a rich young gentleman from oxford and a great friend of mr blewittses sir says i they seem to live in each other's rooms master said nothink but he grin'd my eye how he did grin not the fowl find himself could snear more satannickly i knew what he meant imprimish a man who plays the floot is a simpleton secknly mr blewitt is a raskle thirdmo when a raskle and a simpleton is always together and when the simpleton is rich one knows pretty well what will come of it i was but a lad in them days but i knew what was what as well as my master it's not gentlemen only that's up to snough law bless us there was four of us on this stairkes four as nice young men as you ever see mr bruffy's young man mr dawkinses mr blewitt's and me and we knew what our masters was about as well as thay did theirselfs frinstance i can say this for myself there wasn't a paper in deuceace's desk or drawer not a bill a note or mimerandum which i hadn't read as well as he with blewitt's it was the same me and his young man used to read 'em all there wasn't a bottle of wine that we didn't get a glass out of nor a pound of sugar that we didn't have some lumps of it we had keys to all the cubbards we pipped into all the letters that kem and went we pored over all the bill files we'd the best pickens out of the dinners the livvers of the fowls the forcemit balls out of the soup the egs from the sallit as for the coals and candles we left them to the landrisses you may call this robry nonsince it's only our rights a suvvant's purquizzits is as sacred as the laws of hengland well the long and short of it is this richard blewitt esquire was sityouated as follows he'd an incum of three hundred a year from his father out of this he had to pay one hundred and ninety for money borrowed by him at collidge seventy for chambers seventy more for his hoss aty for his suvvant on bord wagis and about three hundred and fifty for a sepparat establishment in the regency park besides this his pockit money say a hunderd his eatin drinkin and wine marchant's bill about two hunderd moar so that you see he laid by a pretty handsome sum at the end of the year my master was diffrent and being a more fashnable man than mr b in course he owed a deal more mony there was fust account contray at crockford's l bills of xchange and i o u's but he didn't pay these in most cases tailors' bills in all hossdealers' do coachbuilder bills contracted at cambridtch sundries l i give this as a curosity pipple doan't know how in many cases fashnabble life is carried on and to know even what a real gnlmn owes is somethink instructif and agreeable but to my tail the very day after my master had made the inquiries concerning mr dawkins witch i mentioned already he met mr blewitt on the stairs and byoutiffle it was to see how this gnlmn who had before been almost cut by my master was now received by him one of the sweetest smiles i ever saw was now vizzable on mr deuceace's countenance he held out his hand covered with a white kid glove and said in the most frenly tone of vice posbill what mr blewitt it is an age since we met what a shame that such near naybors should see each other so seldom mr blewitt who was standing at his door in a pe green dressing gown smoakin a segar and singing a hunting coarus looked surprised flattered and then suspicious why yes says he it is mr deuceace a long time not i think since we dined at sir george hookey's by the by what an evening that was hay mr blewitt what wine what capital songs i recollect your 'may day in the morning' cuss me the best comick song i ever heard i was speaking to the duke of doncaster about it only yesterday you know the duke i think mr blewitt said quite surly no i don't not know him cries master why hang it blewitt he knows you as every sporting man in england does i should think why man your good things are in everybody's mouth at newmarket and so master went on chaffin mr blewitt that genlmn at fust answered him quite short and angry but after a little more flummery he grew as pleased as posbill took in all deuceace's flatry and bleeved all his lies at last the door shut and they both went into mr blewitt's chambers together of course i can't say what past there but in an hour master kem up to his own room as yaller as mustard and smellin sadly of backo smoke i never see any genmln more sick than he was he'd been smoakin seagars along with blewitt i said nothink in course tho i'd often heard him xpress his horrow of backo and knew very well he would as soon swallow pizon as smoke but he wasn't a chap to do a thing without a reason if he'd been smoakin i warrant he had smoked to some porpus i didn't hear the convysation betwean 'em but mr blewitt's man did it was well mr blewitt what capital seagars have you one for a friend to smoak the old fox it wasn't only the seagars he was a smoakin walk in says mr blewitt and they began a chaffin together master very ankshous about the young gintleman who had come to live in our chambers mr dawkins and always coming back to that subject saying that people on the same stairkis ot to be frenly how glad he'd be for his part to know mr dick blewitt and any friend of his and so on mr dick howsever seamed quite aware of the trap laid for him i really don't know this dawkins says he he's a chismonger's son i hear and tho i've exchanged visits with him i doan't intend to continyou the acquaintance not wishin to assoshate with that kind of pipple so they went on master fishin and mr blewitt not wishin to take the hook at no price confound the vulgar thief muttard my master as he was laying on his sophy after being so very ill i've poisoned myself with his infernal tobacco and he has foiled me the cursed swindling boor he thinks he'll ruin this poor cheese monger does he i'll step in and warn him i thought i should bust a laffin when he talked in this style i knew very well what his warning meant lockin the stable door but stealin the hoss fust next day his strattygam for becoming acquainted with mr dawkins we exicuted and very pritty it was besides potry and the flute mr dawkins i must tell you had some other parshallities wiz he was very fond of good eatin and drinkin after doddling over his music and boox all day this young genlmn used to sally out of evenings dine sumptiously at a tavern drinkin all sorts of wine along with his friend mr blewitt he was a quiet young fellow enough at fust but it was mr b who for his own porpuses no doubt had got him into this kind of life well i needn't say that he who eats a fine dinner and drinks too much overnight wants a bottle of soda water and a gril praps in the morning such was mr dawkinses case and reglar almost as twelve o'clock came the waiter from dix coffy house was to be seen on our stairkis bringing up mr d's hot breakfast no man would have thought there was anythink in such a trifling cirkumstance master did though and pounced upon it like a cock on a barlycorn he sent me out to mr morell's in pickledilly for wot's called a strasbug pie in french a patty defau graw he takes a card and nails it on the outside case patty defaw graws come generally in a round wooden box like a drumb and what do you think he writes on it why as follos for the honorable algernon percy deuceace c c c with prince talleyrand's compliments prince tallyram's complimints indeed i laff when i think of it still the old surpint he was a surpint that deuceace and no mistake well by a most extrornary piece of ill luck the nex day punctially as mr dawkinses brexfas was coming up the stairs mr halgernon percy deuceace was going down he was as gay as a lark humming an oppra tune and twizzting round his head his hevy gold headed cane down he went very fast and by a most unlucky axdent struck his cane against the waiter's tray and away went mr dawkinses gril kayann kitchup soda water and all i can't think how my master should have choas such an exact time to be sure his windo looked upon the court and he could see every one who came into our door as soon as the axdent had took place master was in such a rage as to be sure no man ever was in befor he swoar at the waiter in the most dreddfle way he threatened him with his stick and it was only when he see that the waiter was rayther a bigger man than hisself that he was in the least pazzyfied he returned to his own chambres and john the waiter went off for more gril to dixes coffy house this is a most unlucky axdent to be sure charles says master to me after a few minits paws during witch he had been and wrote a note put it into an anvelope and sealed it with his big seal of arms but stay a thought strikes me take this note to mr dawkins and that pye you brought yesterday and hearkye you scoundrel if you say where you got it i will break every bone in your skin these kind of promises were among the few which i knew him to keep and as i loved boath my skinn and my boans i carried the noat and of cors said nothink waiting in mr dawkinses chambus for a few minnits i returned to my master with an anser i may as well give both of these documence of which i happen to have taken coppies i the hon a p deuceace to t s dawkins esq temple tuesday mr deuceace presents his compliments to mr dawkins and begs at the same time to offer his most sincere apologies and regrets for the accident which has just taken place may mr deuceace be allowed to take a neighbor's privilege and to remedy the evil he has occasioned to the best of his power if mr dawkins will do him the favor to partake of the contents of the accompanying case from strasbourg direct and the gift of a friend on whose taste as a gourmand mr dawkins may rely perhaps he will find that it is not a bad substitute for the plat which mr deuceace's awkwardness destroyed it will also mr deuceace is sure be no small gratification to the original donor of the 'pate' when he learns that it has fallen into the hands of so celebrated a bon vivant as mr dawkins t s dawkins esq c c c ii from t s dawkins esq to the hon a p deuceace mr thomas smith dawkins presents his grateful compliments to the hon mr deuceace and accepts with the greatest pleasure mr deuceace's generous proffer it would be one of the happiest moments of mr smith dawkins's life if the hon mr deuceace would extend his generosity still further and condescend to partake of the repast which his munificent politeness has furnished temple tuesday many and many a time i say have i grin'd over these letters which i had wrote from the original by mr bruffy's copyin clark deuceace's flam about prince tallyram was puffickly successful i saw young dawkins blush with delite as he red the note he toar up for or five sheets before he composed the answer to it which was as you red abuff and roat in a hand quite trembling with pleasyer if you could but have seen the look of triumph in deuceace's wicked black eyes when he read the noat i never see a deamin yet but i can phansy a holding a writhing soal on his pitchfrock and smilin like deuceace he dressed himself in his very best clothes and in he went after sending me over to say that he would except with pleasyour mr dawkins's invite the pie was cut up and a most frenly conversation begun betwixt the two genlmin deuceace was quite captivating he spoke to mr dawkins in the most respeckful and flatrin manner agread in every think he said prazed his taste his furniter his coat his classick nolledge and his playin on the floot you'd have thought to hear him that such a polygon of exlens as dawkins did not breath that such a modist sinsear honrabble genlmn as deuceace was to be seen nowhere xcept in pump cort poor daw was complitly taken in my master said he'd introduce him to the duke of doncaster and heaven knows how many nobs more till dawkins was quite intawsicated with pleasyour i know as a fac and it pretty well shows the young genlmn's carryter that he went that very day and ordered new coats on porpos to be introjuiced to the lords in but the best joak of all was at last singin swagrin and swarink up stares came mr dick blewitt he flung opn mr dawkins's door shouting out daw my old buck how are you when all of a sudden he sees mr deuceace his jor dropt he turned chocky white and then burnin red and looked as if a stror would knock him down my dear mr blewitt says my master smilin and offring his hand how glad i am to see you mr dawkins and i were just talking about your pony pray sit down blewitt did and now was the question who should sit the other out but law bless you mr blewitt was no match for my master all the time he was fidgetty silent and sulky on the contry master was charmin i never herd such a flo of conversatin or so many wittacisms as he uttered at last completely beat mr blewitt took his leaf that instant master followed him and passin his arm through that of mr dick led him into our chambers and began talkin to him in the most affabl and affeckshnat manner but dick was too angry to listen at last when master was telling him some long story about the duke of doncaster blewitt burst out a plague on the duke of doncaster come come mr deuceace don't you be running your rigs upon me i ain't the man to be bamboozl'd by long winded stories about dukes and duchesses you think i don't know you every man knows you and your line of country yes you're after young dawkins there and think to pluck him but you shan't no by you shan't the reader must recklect that the oaths which interspussed mr b's convysation i have left out well after he'd fired a wolley of 'em mr deuceace spoke as cool as possbill hark ye blewitt i know you to be one of the most infernal thieves and scoundrels unhung if you attempt to hector with me i will cane you if you want more i'll shoot you if you meddle between me and dawkins i will do both i know your whole life you miserable swindler and coward i know you have already won two hundred pounds of this lad and want all i will have half or you never shall have a penny it's quite true that master knew things but how was the wonder i couldn't see mr b's face during this dialogue bein on the wrong side of the door but there was a considdrable paws after thuse complymints had passed between the two genlmn one walkin quickly up and down the room tother angry and stupid sittin down and stampin with his foot now listen to this mr blewitt continues master at last if you're quiet you shall have half this fellow's money but venture to win a shilling from him in my absence or without my consent and you do it at your peril well well mr deuceace cries dick it's very hard and i must say not fair the game was of my startin and you've no right to interfere with my friend mr blewitt you are a fool you professed yesterday not to know this man and i was obliged to find him out for myself i should like to know by what law of honor i am bound to give him up to you it was charmin to hear this pair of raskles talkin about honor i declare i could have found it in my heart to warn young dawkins of the precious way in which these chaps were going to serve him but if they didn't know what honor was i did and never never did i tell tails about my masters when in their sarvice out in cors the hobligation is no longer binding well the nex day there was a gran dinner at our chambers white soop turbit and lobstir sos saddil of scoch muttn grous and m'arony wines shampang hock maderia a bottle of poart and ever so many of clarrit the compny presint was three wiz the honrabble a p deuceace r blewitt and mr dawkins exquires my i how we genlmn in the kitchin did enjy it mr blewittes man eat so much grous when it was brot out of the parlor that i reely thought he would be sik mr dawkinses genlmn who was only abowt years of age grew so il with m'arony and plumb puddn as to be obleeged to take sefral of mr d's pils which kild him but this is all promiscuous i an't talkin of the survants now but the masters would you bleeve it after dinner and praps bottles of wine between the the genlm sat down to ecarty it's a game where only plays and where in coarse when there's only one looks on fust they playd crown pints and a pound the

shillings the honrabble mr deuceace having lost l ls after the devvle and the shampang the play was a little higher now it was pound pints and five pound the bet i thought to be sure after hearing the complymints between blewitt and master in the morning that now poor dawkins's time was come not so dawkins won always mr b betting on his play and giving him the very best of advice at the end of the evening which was abowt five o'clock the nex morning they stopt master was counting up the skore on a card blewitt says he i've been unlucky i owe you let me see yes five and forty pounds five and forty says blewitt and no mistake i will give you a cheque says the honrabble genlmn oh don't mention it my dear sir but master got a grate sheet of paper and drew him a check on messeers pump algit and co his bankers now says master i've got to settle with you my dear mr dawkins if you had backd your luck i should have owed you a very handsome sum of money voyons thirteen points at a pound it is easy to calculate and drawin out his puss he clinked over the table goolden suverings which shon till they made my eyes wink so did pore dawkinses as he put out his hand all trembling and drew them in let me say added master let me say and i've had some little experience that you are the very best ecarte player with whom i ever sat down dawkinses eyes glissened as he put the money up and said law deuceace you flatter me flatter him i should think he did it was the very think which master ment but mind you dawkins continyoud he i must have my revenge for i'm ruined positively ruined by your luck well well says mr thomas smith dawkins as pleased as if he had gained a millium shall it be to morrow blewitt what say you mr blewitt agreed in course my master after a little demurring consented too we'll meet says he at your chambers but mind my dear fello not too much wine i can't stand it at any time especially when i have to play ecarte with you pore dawkins left our rooms as happy as a prins here charles says he and flung me a sovring pore fellow pore fellow i knew what was a comin but the best of it was that these sovrings which dawkins won master had borrowed them from mr blewitt i brought 'em with more from that young genlmn's chambers that very morning for since his interview with master blewitt had nothing to refuse him well shall i continue the tail if mr dawkins had been the least bit wiser it would have taken him six months befoar he lost his money as it was he was such a confunded ninny that it took him a very short time to part with it nex day it was thursday and master's acquaintance with mr dawkins had only commenced on tuesday mr dawkins as i said gev his party dinner at mr blewitt and the two mr d's as befoar play begins at this time i knew the bisness was

dawkins his eyes red with remors and sleepliss drunkenniss gave a shudder and a sob as he sunk back in the wehicle and they drove on that day he sold out every hapny he was worth xcept five hundred pounds abowt master had returned and mr dick blewitt came stridin up the stairs with a sollum and important hair is your master at home says he yes sir says i and in he walks i in coars with my ear to

thousand seven hundred i think about that yes that makes my share let me see two thousand three hundred and fifty which i'll thank you to fork out upon my word why mr blewitt says master i don't

lend you twenty sovereigns the other night to pay our losings to dawkins didn't you swear on your honor as a gentleman to give me half of all that might be won in this affair agreed sir says deuceace

giving a dinner to that jackass yonder that you should profit by it get away sir leave the room sir or stop here i will give you four hundred pounds your own note of hand sir for that sum if you will consent to forget all that has passed between us and that you have never known mr algernon deuceace i've seen pipple angery before now but never any like blewitt he stormed groaned belloed swoar at last he fairly began blubbring now cussing and nashing his teeth now praying dear mr deuceace to grant him mercy at last master flung open the door heaven bless us it's well i didn't tumble hed over eels into the room and said charles show the gentleman down stairs my master looked at him quite steddy blewitt slunk down as misrabble as any man i ever see as for dawkins heaven knows where he was charles says my master to me about an hour afterwards i'm going to paris you may come too if you please foring parts it was a singular proof of my master's modesty that though he had won this andsome sum of mr dawkins and was inclined to be as extravygant and osntatious as any man i ever seed yet when he determined on going to paris he didn't let a single frend know of all them winnings of his didn't acquaint my lord crabs his father that he was about to leave his natiff shoars neigh didn't even so much as call together his tradesmin and pay off their little bills befor his departure on the contry chawles said he to me stick a piece of paper on my door which is the way that lawyers do and write 'back at seven' upon it back at seven i wrote and stuck it on our outer oak and so mistearus was deuceace about his continental tour to all except me that when the landriss brought him her account for the last month amountain at the very least to l s master told her to leave it till monday morning when it should be properly settled it's extrodny how ickonomical a man becomes when he's got five thousand lbs in his pockit back at indeed at we were a roalin on the dover road in the reglator coach master inside me out a strange company of people there was too in that wehicle sailors an italyin with his music box and munky a missionary going to convert the heathens in france oppra girls they call 'em figure aunts and the figure aunts' mothers inside frenchmin with gingybred caps and mustashes singing chattering and jesticklating in the most vonderful vay such compliments as passed between them and the figure aunts such a munshin of biskits and sippin of brandy such o mong jews and o sacrrres and kill fay frwaws i didn't understand their languidge at that time so of course can't igsplain much of their conwersation but it pleased me nevertheless for now i felt that i was reely going into foring parts which ever sins i had had any edication at all was always my fondest wish heavin bless us thought i if these are specimeens of all frenchmen what a set they must be the pore italyin's monky sittin mopin and meluncolly on his box was not half so ugly and seamed quite as reasonabble well we arrived at dover ship hotel weal cutlets half a ginny glas of ale a shilling glas of neagush half a crownd a hapnyworth of wax lites four shillings and so on but master paid without grumbling as long as it was for himself he never minded the expens and nex day we embarked in the packit for balong sir mare which means in french the town of balong sityouated on the sea i who had heard of foring wonders expected this to be the fust and greatest phansy then my disapintment when we got there to find this balong not situated on the sea but on the shoar but oh the gettin there was the bisniss how i did wish for pump court agin as we were tawsing abowt in the channel gentle reader av you ever been on the otion the sea the sea the open sea as barry cromwell says as soon as we entered our little wessel and i'd looked to master's luggitch and mine mine was rapt up in a very small hankercher as soon i say as we entered our little wessel as soon as i saw the waives black and frothy like fresh drawn porter a dashin against the ribs of our galliant bark the keal like a wedge splittin the billoes in two the sales a flaffin in the hair the standard of hengland floating at the mask head the steward a getting ready the basins and things the capting proudly tredding the deck and giving orders to the salers the white rox of albany and the bathin masheens disappearing in the distans then then i felt for the first time the mite the madgisty of existence yellowplush my boy said i in a dialogue with myself your life is now about to commens your carear as a man dates from your entrans on board this packit be wise be manly be cautious forgit the follies of your youth you are no longer a boy now but a footman throw down your tops your marbles your boyish games throw off your childish habbits with your inky clerk's jackit throw up your here i recklect i was obleeged to stopp a fealin in the fust place singlar in the next place painful and at last compleatly overpowering had come upon me while i was making the abuff speach and now i found myself in a sityouation which dellixy for bids me to describe suffis to say that now i dixcovered what basins was made for that for many many hours i lay in a hagony of exostion dead to all intense and porpuses the rain pattering in my face the salers tramplink over my body the panes of purgatory going on inside when we'd been about four hours in this sityouation it seam'd to me four ears the steward comes to that part of the deck where we servants were all huddled up together and calls out charles well says i gurgling out a faint yes what's the matter you're wanted where your master's wery ill says he with a grin master be hanged says i turning round more misrable than ever i woodn't have moved that day for twenty thousand masters no not for the empror of russia or the pop of room well to cut this sad subjik short many and many a voyitch have i sins had upon what shakspur calls the wasty dip but never such a retched one as that from dover to balong in the year anna domino steemers were scarce in those days and our journey was made in a smack at last when i was in a stage of despare and exostion as reely to phansy myself at death's doar we got to the end of our journey late in the evening we hailed the gaelic shoars and hankered in the arbor of balong sir mare it was the entrans of parrowdice to me and master and as we entered the calm water and saw the comfrabble lights gleaming in the houses and felt the roal of the vessel degreasing never was two mortials gladder i warrant than we were at length our capting drew up at the key and our journey was down but such a bustle and clatter such jabbering such shrieking and swaring such wollies of oafs and axicrations as saluted us on landing i never knew we were boarded in the fust place by custom house officers in cock hats who seased our luggitch and called for our passpots then a crowd of inn waiters came tumbling and screaming on deck dis way sare cries one hotel meurice says another hotel de bang screeches another chap the tower of babyle was nothink to it the fust thing that struck me on landing was a big fellow with ear rings who very nigh knock me down in wrenching master's carpet bag out of my hand as i was carrying it to the hotell but we got to it safe at last and for the fust time in my life i slep in a foring country i shan't describe this town of balong which as it has been visited by not less on an avaridg than two milliums of english since i fust saw it twenty years ago is tolrabbly well known already it's a dingy melumcolly place to my mind the only thing moving in the streets is the gutter which runs down 'em as for wooden shoes i saw few of 'em and for frogs upon my honor i never see a single frenchman swallow one which i had been led to beleave was their reg'lar though beastly custom one thing which amazed me was the singlar name which they give to this town of balong it's divided as every boddy knows into an upper town sitouate on a mounting and surrounded by a wall or bullyvar and a lower town which is on the level of the sea well will it be believed that they call the upper town the hot veal and the other the base veal which is on the contry genrally good in france though the beaf it must be confest is excrabble it was in the base veal that deuceace took his lodgian at the hotel de bang in a very crooked street called the rue del ascew and if he'd been the archbishop of devonshire or the duke of canterbury he could not have given himself greater hairs i can tell you nothink was too fine for us now we had a sweet of rooms on the first floor which belonged to the prime minister of france at least the landlord said they were the premier's and the hon algernon percy deuceace who had not paid his landriss and came to dover in a coach seamed now to think that goold was too vulgar for him and a carridge and six would break down with a man of his weight shampang flew about like ginger pop besides bordo clarit burgundy burgong and other wines and all the delixes of the balong kitchins we stopped a fortnit at this dull place and did nothing from morning till night excep walk on the bench and watch the ships going in and out of arber with one of them long sliding opra glasses which they call i don't know why tallow scoops our amusements for the fortnit we stopped here were boath numerous and daliteful nothink in fact could be more pickong as they say in the morning before breakfast we boath walked on the peer master in a blue mareen jackit and me in a slap up new livry both provided with long sliding opra glasses called as i said i don't know y but i suppose it's a scientafick term tallow scoops with these we igsamined very attentively the otion the sea weed the pebbles the dead cats the fishwimmin and the waives like little children playing at leap frog which came tumblin over another on to the shoar it seemed to me as if they were scrambling to get there as well they might being sick of the sea and anxious for the blessid peaceable terry firmy after brexfast down we went again that is master on his beat and me on mine for my place in this foring town was a complete shinycure and putting our tally scoops again in our eyes we egsamined a little more the otion pebbils dead cats and so on and this lasted till dinner and dinner till bedtime and bedtime lasted till nex day when came brexfast and dinner and tally scooping as before this is the way with all people of this town of which as i've heard say there is ten thousand happy english who lead this plesnt life from year's end to year's end besides this there's billiards and gambling for the gentlemen a little dancing for the gals and scandle for the dowygers in none of these amusements did we partake we were a little too good to play crown pints at cards and never get paid when we won or to go dangling after the portionless gals or amuse ourselves with slops and penny wist along with the old ladies no no my master was a man of fortn now and behayved himself as sich if ever he condysended to go into the public room of the hotel de bang the french doubtless for reasons best known to themselves call this a sallymanjy he swoar more and lowder than any one there he abyoused the waiters the wittles the wines with his glas in his i he staired at every body he took always the place before the fire he talked about my carridge my currier my servant and he did wright i've always found through life that if you wish to be respected by english people you must be insalent to them especially if you are a sprig of nobiliaty we like being insulted by noblemen it shows they're familiar with us law bless us i've known many and many a genlmn about town who'd rather be kicked by a lord than not be noticed by him they've even had an aw of me because i was a lord's footman while my master was hectoring in the parlor at balong pretious airs i gave myself in the kitching i can tell you and the consequints was that we were better served and moar liked than many pipple with twice our merit deuceace had some particklar plans no doubt which kep him so long at balong and it clearly was his wish to act the man of fortune there for a little time before he tried the character of paris he purchased a carridge he hired a currier he rigged me in a fine new livry blazin with lace and he past through the balong bank a thousand pounds of the money he had won from dawkins to his credit at a paris house showing the balong bankers at the same time that he'd plenty moar in his potfolie this was killin two birds with one stone the bankers' clerks spread the nuse over the town and in a day after master had paid the money every old dowyger in balong had looked out the crabs' family podigree in the peeridge and was quite intimate with the deuceace name and estates if sattn himself were a lord i do beleave there's many vurtuous english mothers would be glad to have him for a son in law now though my master had thought fitt to leave town without excommunicating with his father on the subject of his intended continental tripe as soon as he was settled at balong he roat my lord crabbs a letter of which i happen to have a copy it ran thus boulogne january my dear father i have long in the course of my legal studies found the necessity of a knowledge of french in which language all the early history of our profession is written and have determined to take a little relaxation from chamber reading which has seriously injured my health if my modest finances can bear a two months' journey and a residence at paris i propose to remain there that period will you have the kindness to send me a letter of introduction to lord bobtail our ambassador my name and your old friendship with him i know would secure me a reception at his house but a pressing letter from yourself would at once be more courteous and more effectual may i also ask you for my last quarter's salary i am not an expensive man my dear father as you know but we are no chameleons and fifty pounds with my little earnings in my profession would vastly add to the agremens of my continental excursion present my love to all my brothers and sisters ah how i wish the hard portion of a younger son had not been mine and that i could live without the dire necessity for labor happy among the rural scenes of my childhood and in the society of my dear sisters and you heaven bless you dearest father and all those beloved ones now dwelling under the dear old roof at sizes ever your affectionate son algernon the right hon the earl of crabs c sizes court bucks to this affeckshnat letter his lordship replied by return of poast as follos my dear algernon your letter came safe to hand and i enclose you the letter for lord bobtail as you desire he is a kind man and has one of the best cooks in europe we were all charmed with your warm remembrances of us not having seen you for seven years we cannot but be pleased at the family affection which in spite of time and absence still clings so fondly to home it is a sad selfish world and very few who have entered it can afford to keep those fresh feelings which you have my dear son may you long retain them is a fond father's earnest prayer be sure dear algernon that they will be through life your greatest comfort as well as your best worldly ally consoling you in misfortune cheering you in depression aiding and inspiring you to exertion and success i am sorry truly sorry that my account at coutts's is so low just now as to render a payment of your allowance for the present impossible i see by my book that i owe you now nine quarters or l depend on it my dear boy that they shall be faithfully paid over to you on the first opportunity by the way i have enclosed some extracts from the newspapers which may interest you and have received a very strange letter from a mr blewitt about a play transaction which i suppose is the case alluded to in these prints he says you won l from one dawkins that the lad paid it that he blewitt was to go what he calls 'snacks' in the winning but that you refused to share the booty how can you my dear boy quarrel with these vulgar people or lay yourself in any way open to their attacks i have played myself a good deal and there is no man living who can accuse me of a doubtful act you should either have shot this blewitt or paid him now as the matter stands it is too late to do the former and perhaps it would be quixotic to perform the latter my dearest boy recollect through life that you never can afford to be dishonest with a roque four thousand seven hundred pounds was a great coup to be sure as you are now in such high feather can you dearest algernon lend me five hundred pounds upon my soul and honor i will repay you your brothers and sisters send you their love i need not add that you have always the blessings of your affectionate father crabs ps make it and i will give you my note of hand for a thousand i needn't say that this did not quite enter into deuceace's eyedears lend his father pound indeed he'd as soon have lent him a box on the year in the fust place he hadn seen old crabs for seven years as that nobleman remarked in his epistol in the secknd he hated him and they hated each other and nex if master had loved his father ever so much he loved somebody else better his father's son namely and sooner than deprive that exlent young man of a penny he'd have sean all the fathers in the world hangin at newgat and all the beloved ones as he called his sisters the lady deuceacisses so many convix at bottomy bay the newspaper parrografs showed that however secret we wished to keep the play transaction the public knew it now full well blewitt as i found after was the author of the libels which appeared right and left gambling in high life the honorable mr d c ce again this celebrated whist player has turned his accomplishments to some profit on friday the th january he won five thousand pounds from a very young gentleman th m s sm th d wk ns esq and lost two thousand five hundred to r bl w tt esq of the t mple mr d very honorably paid the sum lost by him to the honorable whist player but we have not heard that before his sudden trip to paris mr d uc ce paid his losings to mr bl w tt nex came a notice to corryspondents fair play asks us if we know of the gambling doings of the notorious deuceace we answer we do and in our very next number propose to make some of them public they didn't appear however but on the contry the very same newspeper which had been before so abusiff of deuceace was now loud in his praise it said a paragraph was inadvertently admitted into our paper of last week most unjustly assailing the character of a gentleman of high birth and talents the son of the exemplary e rl of cr bs we repel with scorn and indignation the dastardly falsehoods of the malignant slanderer who vilified mr de ce ce and beg to offer that gentleman the only reparation in our power for having thus tampered with his unsullied name we disbelieve the ruffian and his story and most sincerely regret that such a tale or such a writer should ever have been brought forward to the readers of this paper this was satisfactory and no mistake and much pleased we were at the denial of this conshentious editor so much pleased that master sent him a ten pound noat and his complymints he'd sent another to the same address before this parrowgraff was printed why i can't think for i woodn't suppose any thing musnary in a littery man well after this bisniss was concluded the currier hired the carridge smartened a little and me set up in my new livries we bade ojew to bulong in the grandest state posbill what a figure we cut and my i what a figger the postillion cut a cock hat a jackit made out of a cow's skin it was in cold weather a pig tale about fit in length and a pair of boots oh sich a pare a bishop might almost have preached out of one or a modrat sized famly slep in it me and mr schwigshhnaps the currier sate behind in the rumbill master aloan in the inside as grand as a turk and rapt up in his fine fir cloak off we sett bowing gracefly to the crowd the harniss bells jinglin the great white hosses snortin kickin and squeelin and the postilium cracking his wip as loud as if he'd been drivin her majesty the quean well i shan't describe our voyitch we passed sefral sitties willitches and metrappolishes sleeping the fust night at amiens witch as everyboddy knows is famous ever since the year for what's called the pease of amiens we had some very good done with sugar and brown sos in the amiens way but after all the boasting about them i think i like our marrowphats better speaking of wedgytables another singler axdent happened here concarning them master who was brexfasting before going away told me to go and get him his fur travling shoes i went and toald the waiter of the inn who stared grinned as these chaps always do said bong which means very well and presently came back i'm blest if he didn't bring master a plate of cabbitch would you bleave it that now in the nineteenth sentry when they say there's schoolmasters abroad these stewpid french jackasses are so extonishingly ignorant as to call a cabbidge a shoo never never let it be said after this that these benighted souperstitious misrabble savidges are equill in any respex to the great brittish people the moor i travvle the moor i see of the world and other natiums i am proud of my own and despise and deplore the retchid ignorance of the rest of yourup my remarks on parris you shall have by an early opportunity me and deuceace played some curious pranx there i can tell you mr deuceace at paris chapter i the two bundles of hay lieutenant general sir george griffin kcb was about seventy five years old when he left this life and the east ingine army of which he was a distinguished ornyment sir george's first appearance in injar was in the character of a cabbingboy to a vessel from which he rose to be clerk to the owners at calcutta from which he became all of a sudden a capting in the company's service and so rose and rose until he rose to be a leftenant general when he stopped rising altogether hopping the twig of this life as drummers generals dustmen and emperors must do sir george did not leave any mal hair to perpetuate the name of griffin a widow of about twenty seven and a daughter avaritching twenty three was left behind to deploar his loss and share his proppaty on old sir george's deth his interesting widdo and orfan who had both been with him in injer returned home tried london for a few months did not like it and resolved on a trip to paris where very small london people become very great ones if they've money as these griffinses had the intelligent reader need not be told that miss griffin was not the daughter of lady griffin for though marritches are made tolrabbly early in injer people are not quite so precoashoos as all that the fact is lady g was sir george's second wife i need scarcely add that miss matilda griffin wos the offspring of his fust marritch miss leonora kicksey a ansum lively islington gal taken out to calcutta and amongst his other goods very comfortably disposed of by her uncle capting kicksey was one and twenty when she married sir george at seventy one and the miss kickseys nine of whom kep a school at islington the other being married variously in the city were not a little envius of my lady's luck and not a little proud of their relationship to her one of 'em miss jemima kicksey the oldest and by no means the least ugly of the sett was staying with her ladyship and gev me all the partecklars of the rest of the famly being of a lo sort i in course no nothink my acquaintance thank my stars don't lie among them or the likes of them well this miss jemima lived with her younger and more fortnat sister in the qualaty of companion or toddy poar thing i'd a soon be a gally slave as lead the life she did every body in the house despised her her ladyship insulted her the very kitching gals scorned and flouted her she roat the notes she kep the bills she made the tea she whipped the chocklate she cleaned the canary birds and gev out the linning for the wash she was my lady's walking pocket or rettycule and fetched and carried her handkercher or her smell bottle like a well bred spaniel all night at her ladyship's swarries she thumped kidrills nobody ever thought of asking her to dance when miss griffing sung she played the piano and was scolded because the singer was out of tune abommanating dogs she never drove out without her ladyship's puddle in her lap and reglarly unwell in a carriage she never got anything but the back seat poar jemima i can see her now in my lady's secknd best old clothes the ladies' maids always got the prime leavings a liloc sattn gown crumpled blotched and greasy a pair of white sattn shoes of the color of inger rubber a faded yellow velvet hat with a wreath of hartifishl flowers run to sead and a bird of parrowdice perched on the top of it melumcolly and moulting with only a couple of feathers left in his unfortunate tail besides this ornyment to their saloon lady and miss griffin kept a number of other servants in the kitching ladies' maids footmin six feet high each crimson coats goold knots and white cassymear pantyloons a coachmin to match a page and a shassure a kind of servant only known among forriners and who looks more like a major general than any other mortial wearing a cock hat a unicorn covered with silver lace mustashos eplets and a sword by his side all these to wait upon two ladies not counting a host of the fair sex such as cooks scullion housekeepers and so forth my lady griffin's lodging was at forty pound a week in a grand sweet of rooms in the plas vandome at paris and having thus described their house and their servants' hall i may give a few words of description concerning the ladies themselves in the fust place and in coarse they hated each other my lady was twenty seven a widdo of two years fat fair and rosy a slow quiet cold looking woman as those fair haired gals generally are it seemed difficult to rouse her either into likes or dislikes to the former at least she never loved any body but one and that was herself she hated in her calm quiet way almost every one else who came near her every one from her neighbor the duke who had slighted her at dinner down to john the footman who had torn a hole in her train i think this woman's heart was like one of them lithograffic stones you can't rub out any thing when once it's drawn or wrote on it nor could you out of her ladyship's stone heart i mean in the shape of an affront a slight or real or phansied injury she boar an exlent irreprotchable character against which the tongue of scandal never wagged she was allowed to be the best wife posbill and so she was but she killed her old husband in two years as dead as ever mr thurtell killed mr william weare she never got into a passion not she she never said a rude word but she'd a genius a genius which many women have of making a hell of a house and tort'ring the poor creatures of her family until they were wellnigh drove mad miss matilda griffin was a good deal uglier and about as amiable as her mother in law she was crooked and squinted my lady to do her justice was straight and looked the same way with her i's she was dark and my lady was fair sentimental as her ladyship was cold my lady was never in a passion miss matilda always and awfille were the scenes which used to pass between these women and the wickid wickid quarls which took place why did they live together there was the mistry not related and hating each other like pison it would surely have been easier to remain seprat and so have detested each other at a distans as for the fortune which old sir george had left that it was clear was very considrabble thousand lb at the least as i have heard say but nobody knew how it was disposed of some said that her ladyship was sole mistriss of it others that it was divided others that she had only a life inkum and that the money was all to go as was natral to miss matilda these are subjix which are not praps very interesting to the british public but were mighty important to my master the honrable algernon percy deuceace esquire barrister at law etsettler etsettler for i've forgot to inform you that my master was very intimat in this house and that we were now comfortably settled at the hotel mirabew pronounced marobo in french in the rew delly pay at paris we had our cab and two riding horses our banker's book and a thousand pound for a balantz at lafitt's our club at the corner of the rew gramong our share in a box at the oppras our apartments spacious and elygant our swarries at court our dinners at his excellency lord bobtail's and elsewhere thanks to poar dawkins's five thousand pound we were as complete gentlemen as any in paris now my master like a wise man as he was seaing himself at the head of a smart sum of money and in a country where his debts could not bother him determined to give up for the present every think like gambling at least high play as for losing or winning a ralow of napoleums at whist or ecarty it did not matter it looks like money to do such things and gives a kind of respectabilaty but as for play he wouldn't oh no not for worlds do such a thing he had played like other young men of fashn and won and lost old fox he didn't say he had paid but he had given up the amusement and was now determined he said to live on his inkum the fact is my master was doing his very best to act the respectable man and a very good game it is too but it requires a precious great roag to play it he made his appearans reglar at church me carrying a handsome large black marocky prayer book and bible with the psalms and lessons marked out with red ribbings and you'd have thought as i graivly laid the volloms down before him and as he berried his head in his nicely brushed hat before service began that such a pious proper morl young nobleman was not to be found in the whole of the peeridge it was a comfort to look at him efry old tabby and dowyger at my lord bobtail's turned up the wights of their i's when they spoke of him and vowed they had never seen such a dear daliteful exlent young man what a good son he must be they said and oh what a good son in law he had the pick of all the english gals at paris before we had been there months but unfortunately most of them were poar and love and a cottidge was not quite in master's way of thinking well about this time my lady griffin and miss g made their appearants at parris and master who was up to snough very soon changed his noat he sate near them at chapple and sung hims with my lady he danced with 'em at the embassy balls he road with them in the boy de balong and the shandeleasies which is the french high park he roat potry in miss griffin's halbim and sang jewets along with her and lady griffin he brought sweet meats for the puddle dog he gave money to the footmin kissis and gloves to the sniggering ladies' maids he was sivvle even to poar miss kicksey there wasn't a single soal at the griffinses that didn't adoar this good young man the ladies if they hated befoar you may be sure detested each other now wuss than ever there had been always a jallowsy between them miss jellows of her mother in law's bewty madam of miss's espree miss taunting my lady about the school at islington and my lady sneering at miss for her squint and her crookid back and now came a stronger caws they both fell in love with mr deuceace my lady that is to say as much as she could with her cold selfish temper she liked deuceace who amused her and made her laff she liked his manners his riding and his good loox and being a pervinew herself had a dubble respect for real aristocratick flesh and blood miss's love on the contry was all flams and fury she'd always been at this work from the time she had been at school where she very nigh run away with a frentch master next with a footman which i may say in confidence is by no means unnatral or unusyouall as i could show if i liked and so had been going on sins fifteen she reglarly flung herself at deuceace's head such sighing crying and ogling i never see often was i ready to bust out laffin as i brought master skoars of rose colored billydoos folded up like cockhats and smellin like barber's shops which this very tender young lady used to address to him now though master was a scoundrill and no mistake he was a gentlemin and a man of good breading and miss came a little too strong pardon the wulgarity of the xpression with her hardor and attachmint for one of his taste besides she had a crookid spine and a squint so that supposing their fortns tolrabbly equal deuceace reely preferred the mother in law now then it was his bisniss to find out which had the most money with an english famly this would have been easy a look at a will at doctor commons'es would settle the matter at once but this india naybob's will was at calcutty or some outlandish place and there was no getting sight of a coppy of it i will do mr algernon deuceace the justass to say that he was so little musnary in his love for lady griffin that he would have married her gladly even if she had ten thousand pounds less than miss matilda in the meantime his plan was to keep 'em both in play until he could strike the best fish of the two not a difficult matter for a man of his genus besides miss was hooked for certain chapter ii honor thy father i said that my master was adoard by every person in my lady griffin's establishmint i should have said by every person excep one a young french gnlmn that is who before our appearants had been mighty partiklar with my lady ockupying by her side exackly the same pasition which the honrable mr deuceace now held it was bewtiffle and headifying to see how coolly that young nobleman kicked the poar shevalliay de l'orge out of his shoes and how gracefully he himself stept into 'em munseer de l'orge was a smart young french jentleman of about my master's age and good looks but not possest of half my master's impidince not that that quallaty is uncommon in france but few very few had it to such a degree as my exlent employer mr deuceace besides de l'orge was reglarly and reely in love with lady griffin and master only pretending he had of coars an advantitch which the poor frentchman never could git he was all smiles and gaty while delorge was ockward and melumcolly my master had said twenty pretty things to lady griffin befor the shevalier had finished smoothing his hat staring at her and sighing fit to bust his weskit o luv luv this isn't the way to win a woman or my name's not fitzroy yellowplush myself when i begun my carear among the fair six i was always sighing and moping like this poar frenchman what was the consquints the foar fust women i adoared lafft at me and left me for something more lively with the rest i have edopted a diffrent game and with tolerable suxess i can tell you but this is eggatism which i aboar well the long and the short of it is that munseer ferdinand hyppolite xavier stanislas shevalier de l'orge was reglar cut out by munseer algernon percy deuceace exquire poar ferdinand did not leave the house he hadn't the heart to do that nor had my lady the desire to dismiss him he was usefle in a thousand different ways gitting oppra boxes and invitations to french swarries bying gloves and o de colong writing french noats and such like always let me recommend an english famly going to paris to have at least one young man of the sort about them never mind how old your ladyship is he will make love to you never mind what errints you send him upon he'll trot off and do them besides he's always quite and well dresst and never drinx moar than a pint of wine at dinner which as i say is a pint to consider such a conveniants of a man was munseer de l'orge the greatest use and comfort to my lady posbill if it was but to laff at his bad pronunciatium of english it was somethink amusink the fun was to pit him against poar miss kicksey she speakin french and he our naytif british tong my master to do him justace was perfickly sivvle to this poar young frenchman and having kicked him out of the place which he occupied sertingly treated his fallen anymy with every respect and consideration poar modist down hearted little ferdinand adoured my lady as a goddice and so he was very polite likewise to my master never venturing once to be jellows of him or to question my lady griffin's right to change her lover if she choase to do so thus then matters stood master had two strinx to his bo and might take either the widdo or the orfn as he preferred com bong lwee somblay as the frentch say his only pint was to discover how the money was disposed off which evidently belonged to one or other or boath at any rate he was sure of one as sure as any mortal man can be in this sublimary spear where nothink is suttin except unsertnty a very unixpected insident here took place which in a good deal changed my master's calkylations one night after conducting the two ladies to the oppra after suppink of white soop sammy deperdrow and shampang glassy which means eyced at their house in the plas vandom me and master droav hoam in the cab as happy as possbill chawls you d d scoundrel says he to me for he was in an exlent humer when i'm married i'll dubbil your wagis this he might do to be sure without injuring himself seeing that he had us yet never paid me any but what then law bless us things would be at a pretty pass if we suvvants only lived on our wagis our puckwisits is the thing and no mistake i ixprest my gratitude as best i could swoar that it wasn't for wagis i served him that i would as leaf weight upon him for nothink and that never never so long as i livd would i of my own accord part from such an exlent master by the time these two spitches had been made my spitch and his we arrived at the hotel mirabeu which us every body knows ain't very distant from the plas vandome up we marched to our apartmince me carrying the light and the cloax master hummink a hair out of the oppra as merry as a lark i opened the door of our salong there was lights already in the room an empty shampang bottle roalin on the floar another on the table near which the sofy was drawn and on it lay a stout old genlmn smoaking seagars as if he'd bean in an inn tap room deuceace who abommunates seagars as i've already shown bust into a furious raige against the genlmn whom he could hardly see for the smoak and with a number of oaves quite unnecessary to repeat asked him what bisniss he'd there the smoaking chap rose and laying down his seagar began a ror of laffin and said what algy my boy don't you know me the reader may praps recklect a very affecting letter which was published in the last chapter of these memoars in which the writer requested a loan of five hundred pound from mr algernon deuceace and which boar the respected signatur of the earl of crabs mr deuceace's own father it was that distinguished arastycrat who was now smokin and laffin in our room my lord crabs was as i preshumed about years old a stowt burly red faced bald headed nobleman whose nose seemed blushing at what his mouth was continually swallowing whose hand praps trembled a little and whose thy and legg was not quite so full or as steddy as they had been in former days but he was a respecktabble fine looking old nobleman and though it must be confest drunk when we fust made our appearance in the salong yet by no means moor so than a reel noblemin ought to be what algy my boy shouts out his lordship advancing and seasing master by the hand doan't you know your own father master seemed anythink but overhappy my lord says he looking very pail and speakin rayther slow i didn't i confess the unexpected pleasure of seeing you in paris the fact is sir said he recovering himself a little the fact is there was such a confounded smoke of tobacco in the room that i really could not see who the stranger was who had paid me such an unexpected visit a bad habit algernon a bad habit said my lord lighting another seagar a disgusting and filthy practice which you my dear child will do well to avoid it is at best dear algernon but a nasty idle pastime unfitting a man as well for mental exertion as for respectable society sacrificing at once the vigor of the intellect and the graces of the person by the by what infernal bad tobacco they have too in this hotel could not you send your servant to get me a few seagars at the cafe de paris give him a five franc piece and let him go at once that's a good fellow here his lordship hiccupt and drank off a fresh tumbler of shampang very sulkily master drew out the coin and sent me on the errint knowing the cafe de paris to be shut at that hour i didn't say a word but quietly establisht myself in the ante room where as it happened by a singler coinstdints i could hear every word of the conversation between this exlent pair of relatifs help yourself and get another bottle says my lord after a sollum paws my poar master the king of all other compnies in which he moved seamed here but to play secknd fiddill and went to the cubbard from which his father had already igstracted two bottils of his prime sillary he put it down before his father coft spit opened the windows stirred the fire yawned clapt his hand to his forehead and suttnly seamed as uneezy as a genlmn could be but it was of no use the old one would not budg help yourself says he again and pass me the bottil you are very good father says master but really i neither drink nor smoke right my boy quite right talk about a good conscience in this life a good stomack is everythink no bad nights no headachs eh quite cool and collected for your law studies in the morning eh and the old nobleman here grinned in a manner which would have done creddit to mr grimoldi master sate pale and wincing as i've seen a pore soldier under the cat he didn't anser a word his exlent pa went on warming as he continued to speak and drinking a fresh glas at evry full stop how you must improve with such talents and such principles why algernon all london talks of your industry and perseverance you're not merely a philosopher man hang it you've got the philosopher's stone fine rooms fine horses champagne and all for a year i presume sir says my master that you mean the two hundred a year which you pay me the very sum my boy the very sum cries my lord laffin as if he would die why that's the wonder i never pay the two hundred a year and you keep all this state up upon nothing give me your secret o you young trismegistus tell your old father how such wonders can be worked and i will yes then upon my word i will pay you your two hundred a year enfin my lord says mr deuceace starting up and losing all patience will you have the goodness to tell me what this visit means you leave me to starve for all you care and you grow mighty facetious because i earn my bread you find me in prosperity and precisely my boy precisely keep your temper and pass that bottle i find you in prosperity and a young gentleman of your genius and acquirements asks me why i seek your society oh algernon algernon this is not worthy of such a profound philosopher why do i seek you why because you are in prosperity o my son else why the devil should i bother my self about you did i your poor mother or your family ever get from you a single affectionate feeling did we or any other of your friends or intimates ever know you to be guilty of a single honest or generous action did we ever pretend any love for you or you for us algernon deuceace you don't want a father to tell you that you are a swindler and a spendthrift i have paid thousands for the debts of yourself and your brothers and if you pay nobody else i am determined you shall repay me you would not do it by fair means when i wrote to you and asked you for a loan of money i knew you would not had i written again to warn you of my coming you would have given me the slip and so i came uninvited to force you to repay me that's why i am here mr algernon and so help yourself and pass the bottle after this speach the old genlmn sunk down on the sofa and puffed as much smoke out of his mouth as if he'd been the chimley of a steam injian i was pleased i confess with the sean and liked to see this venrabble and virtuous old man a nocking his son about the hed just as deuceace had done with mr richard blewitt as i've before shown master's face was fust red hot next chawk white and then sky blew he looked for all the world like mr tippy cooke in the tragady of frankinstang at last he mannidged to speek my lord says he i expected when i saw you that some such scheme was on foot swindler and spendthrift as i am at least it is but a family failing and i am indebted for my virtues to my father's precious example your lordship has i perceive added drunkenness to the list of your accomplishments and i suppose under the influence of that gentlemanly excitement has come to make these preposterous propositions to me when you are sober you will perhaps be wise enough to know that fool as i may be i am not such a fool as you think me and that if i have got money i intend to keep it every farthing of it though you were to be ten times as drunk and ten times as threatening as you are now well well my boy said lord crabs who seemed to have been half asleep during his son's oratium and received all his sneers and surcasms with the most complete good humor well well if you will resist tant pis pour toi i've no desire to ruin you recollect and am not in the slightest degree angry but i must and will have a thousand pounds you had better give me the money at once it will cost you more if you don't sir says mr deuceace i will be equally candid i would not give you a farthing to save you from here i thought proper to open the doar and touching my hat said i have been to the cafe de paris my lord but the house is shut bon there's a good lad you may keep the five francs and now get me a candle and show me down stairs but my master seized the wax taper pardon me my lord says he what a servant do it when your son is in the room ah par exemple my dear father said he laughing you think there is no politeness left among us and he led the way out good night my dear boy said lord crabs god bless you sir says he are you wrapped warm mind the step and so this affeckshnate pair parted chapter iii minewvring master rose the nex morning with a dismal countinants he seamed to think that his pa's visit boded him no good i heard him muttering at his brexfast and fumbling among his hundred pound notes once he had laid a parsle of them aside i knew what he meant to send 'em to his father but no says he at last clutching them all up together again and throwing them into his escritaw what harm can he do me if he is a knave i know another who's full as sharp let's see if we cannot beat him at his own weapons with that mr deuceace drest himself in his best clothes and marched off to the plas vandom to pay his cort to the fair widdo and the intresting orfn it was abowt ten o'clock and he propoased to the ladies on seeing them a number of planns for the day's rackryation riding in the body balong going to the twillaries to see king looy disweet who was then the raining sufferin of the french crownd go to chapple and finely a dinner at o'clock at the caffy de parry whents they were all to adjourn to see a new peace at the theatre of the pot st martin called sussannar and the elders the gals agread to everythink exsep the two last prepositiums we have an engagement my dear mr algernon said my lady look a very kind letter from lady bobtail and she handed over a pafewmd noat from that exolted lady it ran thus fbg st honore thursday feb my dear lady griffin it is an age since we met harassing public duties occupy so much myself and lord bobtail that we have scarce time to see our private friends among whom i hope my dear lady griffin will allow me to rank her will you excuse so unceremonious an invitation and dine with us at the embassy to day we shall be en petite comite and shall have the pleasure of hearing i hope some of your charming daughter's singing in the evening i ought perhaps to have addressed a separate note to dear miss griffin but i hope she will pardon a poor diplomate who has so many letters to write you know farewell till seven when i positively must see you both ever dearest lady griffin your affectionate eliza bobtail such a letter from the ambassdriss brot by the ambasdor's shassure and sealed with his seal of arms would affect anybody in the middling ranx of life it droav lady griffin mad with delight and long before my master's arrivle she'd sent mortimer and fitzclarence her two footmin along with a polite reply in the affummatiff master read the noat with no such fealinx of joy he felt that there was somethink a going on behind the seans and though he could not tell how was sure that some danger was near him that old fox of a father of his had begun his m'inations pretty early deuceace handed back the letter sneared and poohd and hinted that such an invitation was an insult at best what he called a pees ally and the ladies might depend upon it was only sent because lady bobtail wanted to fill up two spare places at her table but lady griffin and miss would not have his insinwations they knew too fu lords ever to refuse an invitatium from any one of them go they would and poor deuceace must dine alone after they had been on their ride and had had their other amusemince master came back with them chatted and laft he was mighty sarkastix with my lady tender and sentrymentle with miss and left them both in high sperrits to perform their twollet before dinner as i came to the door for i was as famillyer as a servnt of the house as i came into the drawing room to announts his cab i saw master very quietly taking his pocket book or pot fool as the french call it and thrusting it under one of the cushinx of the sofa what game is this thinx i why this was the game in abowt two hours when he knew the ladies were gon he pretends to be vastly anxious abowt the loss of his potfolio and back he goes to lady griffinses to seek for it there pray says he on going in ask miss kicksey if i may see her for a single moment and down comes miss kicksey quite smiling and happy to see him law mr deuceace says she trying to blush as hard as ever she could you quite surprise me i don't know whether i ought really being alone to admit a gentleman nay don't say so dear miss kicksey for do you know i came here for a double purpose to ask about a pocket book which i have lost and may perhaps have left here and then to ask you if you will have the great goodness to pity a solitary bachelor and give him a cup of your nice tea nice tea i thot i should have split for i'm blest if master had eaten a morsle of dinner never mind down to tea they sat do you take cream and sugar dear sir says poar kicksey with a voice as tender as a tuttle duff both dearest miss kicksey answers master who stowed in a power of sashong and muffinx which would have done honor to a washawoman i shan't describe the conversation that took place betwigst master and this young lady the reader praps knows y deuceace took the trouble to talk to her for an hour and to swallow all her tea he wanted to find out from her all she knew about the famly money matters and settle at once which of the two griffinses he should marry the poar thing of cors was no match for such a man as my master in a quarter of an hour he had if i may use the igspression turned her inside out he knew everything that she knew and that poar creature was very little there was nine thousand a year she had heard say in money in houses in banks in injar and what not boath the ladies signed papers for selling or buying and the money seemed equilly divided betwigst them nine thousand a year deuceace went away his cheex tingling his heart beating he without a penny could nex morning if he liked be master of five thousand per hannum yes but how which had the money the mother or the daughter all the tea drinking had not taught him this piece of nollidge and deuceace thought it a pity that he could not marry both the ladies came back at night mightaly pleased with their reception at the ambasdor's and stepping out of their carridge bid coachmin drive on with a gentlemin who had handed them out a stout old gentlemin who shook hands most tenderly at parting and promised to call often upon my lady griffin he was so polite that he wanted to mount the stairs with her ladyship but no she would not suffer it edward says she to the coachmin quite loud and pleased that all the people in the hotel should hear her you will take the carriage and drive his lordship home now can you guess who his lordship was the right hon the earl of crabs to be sure the very old genlmn whom i had seen on such charming terms with his son the day before master knew this the nex day and began to think he had been a fool to deny his pa the thousand pound now though the suckmstansies of the dinner at the ambasdor's only came to my years some time after i may as well relate 'em here word for word as they was told me by the very genlmn who waited behind lord crabseses chair there was only a petty comity at dinner as lady bobtail said and my lord crabs was placed betwigst the two griffinses being mighty ellygant and palite to both allow me says he to lady g between the soop and the fish my dear madam to thank you fervently thank you for your goodness to my poor boy your ladyship is too young to experience but i am sure far too tender not to understand the gratitude which must fill a fond parent's heart for kindness shown to his child believe me says my lord looking her full and tenderly in the face that the favors you have done to another have been done equally to myself and awaken in my bosom the same grateful and affectionate feelings with which you have already inspired my son algernon lady griffin blusht and droopt her head till her ringlets fell into her fish plate and she swallowed lord crabs's flumry just as she would so many musharuins my lord whose powers of slack jaw was notoarious nex addrast another spitch to miss griffin he said he'd heard how deuceace was situated miss blusht what a happy dog he was miss blusht crimson and then he sighed deeply and began eating his turbat and lobster sos master was a good un at flumry but law bless you he was no moar equill to the old man than a mole hill is to a mounting before the night was over he had made as much progress as another man would in a ear one almost forgot his red nose and his big stomick and his wicked leering i's in his gentle insiniwating woice his fund of annygoats and above all the bewtific morl religious and honrabble toan of his genral conservation praps you will say that these ladies were for such rich pipple mightaly esaly captivated but recklect my dear sir that they were fresh from injar that they'd not sean many lords that they adoared the peeridge as every honest woman does in england who has proper feelinx and has read the fashnabble novvles and that here at paris was their fust step into fashnabble sosiaty well after dinner while miss matilda was singing die tantie or dip your chair or some of them sellabrated italyian hairs when she began this squall hang me if she'd ever stop my lord gets hold of lady griffin again and gradgaly begins to talk to her in a very different strane what a blessing it is for us all says he that algernon has found a friend so respectable as your ladyship indeed my lord and why i suppose i am not the only respectable friend that mr deuceace has no surely not the only one he has had his birth and permit me to say his relationship to myself have procured him many but here my lord heaved a very affecting and large sigh but what says my lady laffing at the igspression of his dismal face you don't mean that mr deuceace has lost them or is unworthy of them i trust not my dear madam i trust not but he is wild thoughtless extravagant and embarrassed and you know a man under these circumstances is not very particular as to his associates embarrassed good heavens he says he has two thousand a year left him by a god mother and he does not seem even to spend his income a very handsome independence too for a bachelor my lord nodded his head sadly and said will your ladyship give me your word of honor to be secret my son has but a thousand a year which i allow him and is heavily in debt he has played madam i fear and for this reason i am so glad to hear that he is in a respectable domestic circle where he may learn in the presence of far greater and purer attractions to forget the dice box and the low company which has been his bane my lady griffin looked very grave indeed was it true was deuceace sincere in his professions of love or was he only a sharper wooing her for her money could she doubt her informer his own father and what's more a real flesh and blood pear of parlyment she determined she would try him praps she did not know she had liked deuceace so much until she kem to feel how much she should hate him if she found he'd been playing her false the evening was over and back they came as wee've seen my lord driving home in my lady's carridge her ladyship and miss walking up stairs to their own apartmince here for a wonder was poar miss kicksey quite happy and smiling and evidently full of a secret something mighty pleasant to judge from her loox she did not long keep it as she was making tea for the ladies for in that house they took a cup regular before bedtime well my lady says she who do you think has been to drink tea with me poar thing a frendly face was a event in her life a tea party quite a hera why perhaps lenoir my maid says my lady looking grave i wish miss kicksey you would not demean yourself by mixing with my domestics recollect madam that you are sister to lady griffin no my lady it was not lenoir it was a gentleman and a handsome gentleman too oh it was monsieur de l'orge then says miss he promised to bring me some guitar strings no nor yet m de l'orge he came but was not so polite as to ask for me what do you think of your own beau the honorable mr algernon deuceace and so saying poar kicksey clapped her hands together and looked as joyfle as if she'd come in to a fortin mr deuceace here and why pray says my lady who recklected all that his exlent pa had been saying to her why in the first place he had left his pocket book and in the second he wanted he said a dish of my nice tea which he took and stayed with me an hour or moar and pray miss kicksey said miss matilda quite contempshusly what may have been the subject of your conversation with mr algernon did you talk politics or music or fine arts or metaphysics miss m being what was called a blue as most hump backed women in sosiaty are always made a pint to speak on these grand subjects no indeed he talked of no such awful matters if he had you know matilda i should never have understood him first we talked about the weather next about muffins and crumpets crumpets he said he liked best and then we talked here miss kicksey's voice fell about poor dear sir george in heaven what a good husband he was and what a good fortune he left eh miss kicksey says my lady with a hard snearing voice and a diabollicle grin yes dear leonora he spoke so respectfully of your blessed husband and seemed so anxious about you and matilda it was quite charming to hear him dear man and pray miss kicksey what did you tell him oh i told him that you and leonora had nine thousand a year and what then why nothing that is all i know i am sure i wish i had ninety says poor kicksey her eyes turning to heaven ninety fiddlesticks did not mr deuceace ask how the money was left and to which of us yes but i could not tell him i knew it says my lady slapping down her tea cup i knew it well says miss matilda and why not lady griffin there is no reason you should break your tea cup because algernon asks a harmless question he is not mercenary he is all candor innocence generosity he is himself blessed with a sufficient portion of the world's goods to be content and often and often has he told me he hoped the woman of his choice might come to him without a penny that he might show the purity of his affection i've no doubt says my lady perhaps the lady of his choice is miss matilda griffin and she flung out of the room slamming the door and leaving miss matilda to bust into tears as was her reglar custom and pour her loves and woas into the buzzom of miss kicksey chapter iv hitting the nale on the hedd the nex morning down came me and master to lady griffinses i amusing myself with the gals in the antyroom he paying his devours to the ladies in the salong miss was thrumming on her gitter my lady was before a great box of papers busy with accounts bankers' books lawyers' letters and what not law bless us it's a kind of bisniss i should like well enuff especially when my hannual account was seven or eight thousand on the right side like my lady's my lady in this house kep all these matters to herself miss was a vast deal too sentrimentle to mind business miss matilda's eyes sparkled as master came in she pinted gracefully to a place on the sofy beside her which deuceace took my lady only looked up for a moment smiled very kindly and down went her head among the papers agen as busy as a b lady griffin has had letters from london says miss from nasty lawyers and people come here and sit by me you naughty man you and down sat master willingly says he my dear miss griffin why i declare it is quits a tete a tete well says miss after the prillimnary flumries in coarse we met a friend of yours at the embassy mr deuceace my father doubtless he is a great friend of the ambassador and surprised me myself by a visit the night before last what a dear delightful old man how he loves you mr deuceace oh amazingly says master throwing his i's to heaven he spoke of nothing but you and such praises of you master breathed more freely he is very good my dear father but blind as all fathers are he is so partial and attached to me he spoke of you being his favorite child and regretted that you were not his eldest son 'i can but leave him the small portion of a younger brother' he said 'but never mind he has talents a noble name and an independence of his own' an independence yes oh yes i am quite independent of my father two thousand pounds a year left you by your godmother the very same you told us you know neither more nor less says master bobbing his head a sufficiency my dear miss griffin to a man of my moderate habits an ample provision by the by cries out lady griffin interrupting the conversation you who are talking about money matters there i wish you would come to the aid of poor me come naughty boy and help me out with this long long sum didn't he go that's all my i how his i's shone as he skipt across the room and seated himself by my lady look said she my agents write me over that they have received a remittance of rupees at s d a rupee do tell me what the sum is in pounds and shillings which master did with great gravity nine hundred and ninety pounds good i daresay you are right i'm sure i can't go through the fatigue to see and now comes another question whose money is this mine or matilda's you see it is the interest of a sum in india which we have not had occasion to touch and according to the terms of poor sir george's will i really don't know how to dispose of the money except to spend it matilda what shall we do with it la ma'am i wish you would arrange the business yourself well then algernon you tell me and she laid her hand on his and looked him most pathetickly in the face why says he i don't know how sir george left his money you must let me see his will first oh willingly master's chair seemed suddenly to have got springs in the cushns he was obliged to hold himself down look here i have only a copy taken by my hand from sir george's own manuscript soldiers you know do not employ lawyers much and this was written on the night before going into action and she read 'i george griffin' c c you know how these things begin 'being now of sane mind' um um um 'leave to my friends thomas abraham hicks a colonel in the h e i company's service and to john monro mackirkincroft of the house of huffle mackirkincroft and dobbs at calcutta the whole of my property to be realized as speedily as they may consistently with the interests of the property in trust for my wife leonora emilia griffin born l e kicksey and my only legitimate child matilda griffin the interest resulting from such property to be paid to them share and share alike the principal to remain untouched in the names of the said t a hicks and j m mackirkincroft until the death of my wife leonora emilia griffin when it shall be paid to my daughter matilda griffin her heirs executors or assigns' there said my lady we won't read any more all the rest is stuff but now you know the whole business tell us what is to be done with the money why the money unquestionably should be divided between you tant mieux say i i really thought it had been all matilda's there was a paws for a minit or two after the will had been read master left the desk at which he had been seated with her ladyship paced up and down the room for a while and then came round to the place where miss matilda was seated at last he said in a low trembling voice i am almost sorry my dear lady griffin that you have read that will to me for an attachment such as mine must seem i fear mercenary when the object of it is so greatly favored by worldly fortune miss griffin matilda i know i may say the word your dear eyes grant me the permission i need not tell you or you dear mother in law how long how fondly i have adored you my tender my beautiful matilda i will not affect to say i have not read your heart ere this and that i have not known the preference with which you have honored me speak it dear girl from your own sweet lips in the presence of an affectionate parent utter the sentence which is to seal my happiness for life matilda dearest matilda say oh say that you love me miss m shivered turned pail rowled her eyes about and fell on master's neck whispering hodibly i do my lady looked at the pair for a moment with her teeth grinding her i's glaring her busm throbbing and her face chock white for all the world like madam pasty in the oppra of mydear when she's goin to mudder her childring you recklect and out she flounced from the room without a word knocking down poar me who happened to be very near the dor and leaving my master along with his crook back mistress i've repotted the speech he made to her pretty well the fact is i got it in a ruff copy only on the copy it's wrote lady griffin leonora instead of miss griffin matilda as in the abuff and so on master had hit the right nail on the head this time he thought but his adventors an't over yet chapter v the griffin's claws well master had hit the right nail on the head this time thanx to luck the crooked one to be sure but then it had the goold nobb which was the part deuceace most valued as well he should being a connyshure as to the relletiff valyou of pretious metals and much preferring virging goold like this to poor old battered iron like my lady griffin and so in spite of his father at which old noblemin mr deuceace now snapt his fingers in spite of his detts which to do him justas had never stood much in his way and in spite of his povatty idleness extravagans swindling and debotcheries of all kinds which an't generally very favorable to a young man who has to make his way in the world in spite of all there he was i say at the topp of the trea the fewcher master of a perfect fortun the defianced husband of a fool of a wife what can mortial man want more vishns of ambishn now occupied his soal shooting boxes oppra boxes money boxes always full hunters at melton a seat in the house of commins heaven knows what and not a poar footman who only describes what he's seen and can't in cors pennytrate into the idears and the busms of men you may be shore that the three cornered noats came pretty thick now from the griffinses miss was always a writing them befoar and now nite noon and mornink breakfast dinner and sopper in they came till my pantry for master never read 'em and i carried 'em out was puffickly intolrabble from the odor of musk ambygrease bargymot and other sense with which they were impregniated here's the contense of three on 'em which

cramped it up and he cust and swoar applying to the lady who roat the genlmn that brought it and me who introjuiced it to his notice such a collection of epitafs as i seldum hered excep at billinxgit the fact is thiss for a fust letter miss's noat was rather too strong and sentymentle but that was her way she was always reading melancholy stoary books thaduse of wawsaw the sorrows of macwhirter and such like after about of them master never yoused to read them but handid them over to me to see if there was anythink in them which must be answered in order to kip up appearuntses the next letter is no ii beloved to what strange madnesses will passion lead one lady griffin since your avowal yesterday has not spoken a word to your poor matilda has declared that she will admit no one heigho not even you my algernon and has locked herself in her own dressing room i do believe that she is jealous and fancies that you were in love with her ha ha i could have told her another tale n'est ce pas adieu adieu adieu a thousand thousand million kisses m g monday afternoon o'clock there was another letter kem before bedtime for though me and master called at the griffinses we wairnt aloud to enter at no price mortimer and fitzclarence grin'd at me as much as to say we were going to be relations but i don't spose master was very sorry when he was obleached to come back without seeing the fare objict of his affeckshns well on chewsdy there was the same game ditto on wensday only when we called there who should we see but our father lord crabs who was waiving his hand to miss kicksey and saying he should be back to dinner at just as me and master came up the stares there was no admittns for us though bah bah never mind says my lord taking his son affeckshnately by the hand what two strings to your bow ay algernon the dowager a little jealous miss a little lovesick but my lady's fit of anger will vanish and i promise you my boy that you shall see your fair one to morrow and so saying my lord walked master down stares looking at him as tender and affeckshnat and speaking to him as sweet as posbill master did not know what to think of it he never new what game his old father was at only he somehow felt that he had got his head in a net in spite of his suxess on sunday i knew it i knew it quite well as soon as i saw the old genlmn igsammin him by a kind of smile which came over his old face and was somethink betwigst the angellic and the direbollicle but master's dowts were cleared up nex day and every thing was bright again at brexfast in comes a note with inclosier boath of witch i here copy no ix thursday morning victoria victoria mamma has yielded at last not her consent to our union but her consent to receive you as before and has promised to forget the past silly woman how could she ever think of you as anything but the lover of your matilda i am in a whirl of delicious joy and passionate excitement i have been awake all this long night thinking of thee my algernon and longing for the blissful hour of meeting come m g this is the inclosier from my lady i will not tell you that your behavior on sunday did not deeply shock me i had been foolish enough to think of other plans and to fancy your heart if you had any was fixed elsewhere than on one at whose foibles you have often laughed with me and whose person at least cannot have charmed you my step daughter will not i presume marry without at least going through the ceremony of asking my consent i cannot as yet give it have i not reason to doubt whether she will be happy in trusting herself to you but she is of age and has the right to receive in her own house all those who may be agreeable to her certainly you who are likely to be one day so nearly connected with her if i have honest reason to believe that your love for miss griffin is sincere if i find in a few months that you yourself are still desirous to marry her i can of course place no further obstacles in your way you are welcome then to return to our hotel i cannot promise to receive you as i did of old you would despise me if i did i can promise however to think no more of all that has passed between us and yield up my own happiness for that of the daughter of my dear husband l e g well now an't this a manly straitforard letter enough and natral from a woman whom we had to confess the truth treated most scuvvily master thought so and went and made a tender respeckful speach to lady griffin a little flumry costs nothink grave and sorroflle he kist her hand and speakin in a very low adgitayted voice calld hevn to witness how he deplord that his conduct should ever have given rise to such an unfornt ideer but if he might offer her esteem respect the warmest and tenderest admiration he trusted she would accept the same and a deal moar flumry of the kind with dark sollum glansis of the eyes and plenty of white pockit hankercher he thought he'd make all safe poar fool he was in a net sich a net as i never yet see set to ketch a roag in chapter vi the jewel the shevalier de l'orge the young frenchmin whom i wrote of in my last who had been rather shy of his visits while master was coming it so very strong now came back to his old place by the side of lady griffin there was no love now though betwigst him and master although the shevallier had got his lady back agin deuceace being compleatly devoted to his crookid veanus the shevalier was a little pale moddist insinifishnt creature and i shoodn't have thought from his appearants would have the heart to do harm to a fli much less to stand befor such a tremendious tiger and fire eater as my master but i see putty well after a week from his manner of going on of speakin at master and lookin at him and olding his lips tight when deuceace came into the room and glaring at him with his i's that he hated the honrabble algernon percy shall i tell you why because my lady griffin hated him hated him wuss than pison or the devvle or even wuss than her daughter in law praps you phansy that the letter you have juss red was honest praps you amadgin that the sean of the reading of the will came on by mere chans and in the reglar cors of suckmstansies it was all a game i tell you a reglar trap and that extrodnar clever young man my master as neatly put his foot into it as ever a pocher did in fesnt preserve the shevalier had his q from lady griffin when deuceace went off the feald back came de l'orge to her feet not a witt less tender than befor por fellow por fellow he really loved this woman he might as well have foln in love with a bore constructor he was so blinded and beat by the power wich she had got over him that if she told him black was white he'd beleave it or if she ordered him to commit murder he'd do it she wanted something very like it i can tell you i've already said how in the fust part of their acquaintance master used to laff at de l'orge's bad inglish and funny ways the little creature had a thowsnd of these and being small and a frenchman master in cors looked on him with that good humored kind of contemp which a good brittn ot always to show he rayther treated him like an intelligent munky than a man and ordered him about as if he'd bean my lady's footman all this munseer took in very good part until after the quarl betwigst master and lady griffin when that lady took care to turn the tables whenever master and miss were not present as i've heard the servants say she used to laff at shevalliay for his obeajance and sivillatty to master for her part she wondered how a man of his birth could act a servnt how any man could submit to such contemsheous behavior from another and then she told him how deuceace was always snearing at him behind his back how in fact he ought to hate him corjaly and how it was suttaly time to show his sperrit well the poar little man beleaved all this from his hart and was angry or pleased gentle or quarlsum igsactly as my lady liked there got to be frequint rows betwigst him and master sharp words flung at each other across the dinner table dispewts about handing ladies their smeling botls or seeing them to their carridge or going in and out of a roam fust or any such nonsince for hevn's sake i heerd my lady in the midl of one of these tiffs say pail and the tears trembling in her i's do do be calm mr deuceace monsieur de l'orge i beseech you to forgive him you are both of you so esteemed lov'd by members of this family that for its peace as well as your own you should forbear to quarrel it was on the way to the sally mangy that this brangling had begun and it ended jest as they were seating themselves i shall never forgit poar little de l'orge's eyes when my lady said both of you he stair'd at my lady for a momint turned pail red look'd wild and then going round to master shook his hand as if he would have wrung it off mr deuceace only bow'd and grin'd and turned away quite stately miss heaved a loud o from her busm and looked up in his face with an igspreshn jest as if she could have eat him up with love and the little shevalliay sate down to his soop plate and wus so happy that i'm blest if he wasn't crying he thought the widdow had made her declyration and would have him and so thought deuceace who look'd at her for some time mighty bitter and contempshus and then fell a talking with miss now though master didn't choose to marry lady griffin as he might have done he yet thought fit to be very angry at the notion of her marrying anybody else and so consquintly was in a fewry at this confision which she had made regarding her parshaleaty for the french shevaleer and this i've perseaved in the cors of my expearants through life that when you vex him a roag's no longer a roag you find him out at onst when he's in a passion for he shows as it ware his cloven foot the very instnt you tread on it at least this is what young roags do it requires very cool blood and long practis to get over this pint and not to show your pashn when you feel it and snarl when you are angry old crabs wouldn't do it being like another noblemin of whom i heard the duke of wellington say while waiting behind his graci's chair that if you were kicking him from behind no one standing before him would know it from the bewtifle smiling igspreshn of his face young master hadn't got so far in the thief's grammer and when he was angry show'd it and it's also to be remarked a very profownd observatin for a footmin but we have i's though we do wear plush britchis it's to be remarked i say that one of these chaps is much sooner maid angry than another because honest men yield to other people roags never do honest men love other people roags only themselves and the slightest thing which comes in the way of thir beloved objects sets them fewrious master hadn't led a life of gambling swindling and every kind of debotch to be good tempered at the end of it i prommis you he was in a pashun and when he was in a pashn a more insalent insuffrable overbearing broot didn't live this was the very pint to which my lady wished to bring him for i must tell you that though she had been trying all her might to set master and the shevalliay by the years she had suxeaded only so far as to make them hate each profowndly but somehow or other the cox wouldn't fight i doan't think deuceace ever suspected any game on the part of her ladyship for she carried it on so admirally that the quarls which daily took place betwigst him and the frenchman never seemed to come from her on the contry she acted as the reglar pease maker between them as i've just shown in the tiff which took place at the door of the sally mangy besides the young men though reddy enough to snarl were natrally unwilling to come to bloes i'll tell you why being friends and idle they spent their mornins as young fashnabbles genrally do at billiads fensing riding pistle shooting or some such improoving study in billiads master beat the frenchman hollow and had won a pretious sight of money from him but that's neither here nor there or as the french say ontry noo at pistle shooting master could knock down eight immidges out of ten and de l'orge seven and in fensing the frenchman could pink the honorable algernon down evry one of his weskit buttns they'd each of them been out more than onst for every frenchman will fight and master had been obleag'd to do so in the cors of his bisniss and knowing each other's curridg as well as the fact that either could put a hundrid bolls running into a hat at yards they wairnt very willing to try such exparrymence upon their own hats with their own heads in them so you see they kep quiet and only grould at each other but to day deuceace was in one of his thundering black humers and when in this way he wouldn't stop for man or devvle i said that he walked away from the shevalliay who had given him his hand in his sudden bust of joyfle good humor and who i do bleave would have hugd a she bear so very happy was he master walked away from him pale and hotty and taking his seat at table no moor mindid the brandishments of miss griffin but only replied to them with a pshaw or a dam at one of us servnts or abuse of the soop or the wine cussing and swearing like a trooper and not like a well bred son of a noble british peer will your ladyship says he slivering off the wing of a pully ally bashymall allow me to help you i thank you no but i will trouble monsieur de l'orge and towards that gnlmn she turned with a most tender and fasnating smile your ladyship has taken a very sudden admiration for mr de l'orge's carving you used to like mine once you are very skilful but to day if you will allow me i will partake of something a little simpler the frenchman helped and being so happy in cors spilt the gravy a great blob of brown sos spurted on to master's chick and myandrewed down his shert collar and virging white weskit confound you says he m de l'orge you have done this on purpose and down went his knife and fork over went his tumbler of wine a deal of it into poar miss griffinses lap who looked fritened and ready to cry my lady bust into a fit of laffin peel upon peel as if it was the best joak in the world de l'orge giggled and grin'd too pardong says he meal pardong mong share munseer and he looked as if he would have done it again for a penny in the long dialogues we have generally ventured to change the peculiar spelling of our friend mr yellowplush the little frenchman was quite in extasis he found himself all of a suddn at the very top of the trea and the laff for onst turned against his rivle he actialy had the ordassaty to propose to my lady in english to take a glass of wine veal you says he in his jargin take a glas of madere viz me mi ladi and he looked round as if he'd igsackly hit the english manner and pronunciation with the greatest pleasure says lady g most graciously nodding at him and gazing at him as she drank up the wine she'd refused master before and this didn't increase his good humer well they went on master snarling snapping and swearing making himself i must confess as much of a blaggard as any i ever see and my lady employing her time betwigst him and the shevalliay doing every think to irritate master and flatter the frenchmn desert came and by this time miss was stock still with fright the chevaleer half tipsy with pleasure and gratafied vannaty my lady puffickly raygent with smiles and master bloo with rage mr deuceace says my lady in a most winning voice after a little chaffing in which she only worked him up moar and moar may i trouble you for a few of those grapes they look delicious for answer master seas'd hold of the grayp dish and sent it sliding down the table to de l'orge upsetting in his way fruit plates glasses dickanters and heaven knows what monsieur de l'orge says he shouting out at the top of his voice have the goodness to help lady griffin she wanted my grapes long ago and has found out they are sour there was a dead paws of a moment or so ah says my lady vous osez m'insulter devant mes gens dans ma propre maison c'est par trop fort monsieur and up she got and flung out of the room miss followed her screeching out mamma for god's sake lady griffin and here the door slammed on the pair her ladyship did very well to speak french de l'orge would not have understood her else as it was he heard quite enough and as the door clikt too in the presents of me and messeers mortimer and fitzclarence the family footmen he walks round to my master and hits him a slap on the face and says prends ca menteur et lache which means take that you liar and coward rayther strong igspreshns for one genlmn to use to another master staggered back and looked bewildered and then he gave a kind of a scream and then he made a run at the frenchman and then me and mortimer flung ourselves upon him whilst fitzclarence embraced the shevalliay a demain says he clinching his little fist and walking away not very sorry to git off when he was fairly down stares we let go of master who swallowed a goblit of water and then pawsing a little and pullout his pus he presented to messeers mortimer and fitzclarence a luydor each i will give you five more to morrow says he if you will promise to keep this secrit and then he walked in to the ladies if you knew says he going up to lady griffin and speaking very slow in cors we were all at the keyhole the pain i have endured in the last minute in consequence of the rudeness and insolence of which i have been guilty to your ladyship you would think my own remorse was punishment sufficient and would grant me pardon my lady bowed and said she didn't wish for explanations mr deuceace was her daughter's guest and not hers but she certainly would never demean herself by sitting again at table with him and so saying out she boltid again oh algernon algernon says miss in teers what is this dreadful mystery these fearful shocking quarrels tell me has anything happened where where is the chevalier master smiled and said be under no alarm my sweetest matilda de l'orge did not understand a word of the dispute he was too much in love for that he is but gone away for half an hour i believe and will return to coffee i knew what master's game was for if miss had got a hinkling of the quarrel betwigst him and the frenchman we should have had her screeming at the hotel mirabeu and the juice and all to pay he only stopt for a few minnits and cumfitted her and then drove off to his friend captain bullseye of the rifles with whom i spose he talked over this unplesnt bisniss we fownd at our hotel a note from de l'orge saying where his secknd was to be seen two mornings after there was a parrowgraf in gallynanny's messinger which i hear beg leaf to transcribe fearful duel yesterday morning at six o'clock a meeting took place in the bois de boulogne between the hon a p d ce ce a younger son of the earl of cr bs and the chevalier de l'o the chevalier was attended by major de m of the royal guard and the hon mr d by captain b lls ye of the british rifle corps as far as we have been able to learn the particulars of this deplorable affair the dispute originated in the house of a lovely lady one of the most brilliant ornaments of our embassy and the duel took place on the morning ensuing the chevalier the challenged party and the most accomplished amateur swordsman in paris waived his right of choosing the weapons and the combat took place with pistols the combatants were placed at forty paces with directions to advance to a barrier which separated them only eight paces each was furnished with two pistols monsieur de l'o fired almost immediately and the ball took effect in the left wrist of his antagonist who dropped the pistol which he held in that hand he fired however directly with his right and the chevalier fell to the ground we fear mortally wounded a ball has entered above his hip joint and there is very little hope that he can recover we have heard that the cause of this desperate duel was a blow which the chevalier ventured to give to the hon mr d if so there is some reason for the unusual and determined manner in which the duel was fought mr deu a e returned to his hotel whither his excellent father the right hon earl of cr bs immediately hastened on hearing of the sad news and is now bestowing on his son the most affectionate parental attention the news only reached his lordship yesterday at noon while at breakfast with his excellency lord bobtail our ambassador the noble earl fainted on receiving the intelligence but in spite of the shock to his own nerves and health persisted in passing last night by the couch of his son and so he did this is a sad business charles says my lord to me after seeing his son and settling himself down in our salong have you any segars in the house and hark ye send me up a bottle of wine and some luncheon i can certainly not leave the neighborhood of my dear boy chapter vii the consquinsies the shevalliay did not die for the ball came out of its own accord in the midst of a violent fever and inflamayshn which was brot on by the wound he was kept in bed for weeks though and did not recover for a long time after as for master his lot i'm sorry to say was wuss than that of his advisary inflammation came on too and to make an ugly story short they were obliged to take off his hand at the rist he bore it in cors like a trojin and in a month he too was well and his wound heel'd but i never see a man look so like a devvle as he used sometimes when he looked down at the stump to be sure in miss griffinses eyes this only indeerd him the mor she sent twenty noats a day to ask for him calling him her beloved her unfortunat her hero her wictim and i dono what i've kep some of the noats as i tell you and curiously sentimentle they are beating the sorrows of macwhirter all to nothing old crabs used to come offen and consumed a power of wine and seagars at our house i bleave he was at paris because there was an exycution in his own house in england and his son was a sure find as they say during his illness and couldn't deny himself to the old genlmn his eveninx my lord spent reglar at lady griffin's where as master was ill i didn't go any more now and where the shevalier wasn't there to disturb him you see how that woman hates you deuceace says my lord one day in a fit of cander after they had been talking about lady griffin she has not done with you yet i tell you fairly curse her says master in a fury lifting up his maim'd arm curse her but i will be even with her one day i am sure of matilda i took care to put that beyond the reach of a failure the girl must marry me for her own sake for her own sake o ho good good my lord lifted his i's and said gravely i understand my dear boy it is an excellent plan well says master grinning fearcely and knowingly at his exlent old father as the girl is safe what harm can i fear from the fiend of a step mother my lord only gev a long whizzle and soon after taking up his hat walked off i saw him sawnter down the plas vandome and go in quite calmly to the old door of lady griffinses hotel bless his old face such a puffickly good natured kind hearted merry selfish old scoundrel i never shall see again his lordship was quite right in saying to master that lady griffin hadn't done with him no moar she had but she never would have thought of the nex game she was going to play if somebody hadn't put her up to it who did if you red the above passidge and saw how a venrabble old genlmn took his hat and sauntered down the plas vandome looking hard and kind at all the nussary maids buns they call them in france in the way i leave you to guess who was the author of the nex scheam a woman suttnly never would have pitcht on it in the fuss payper which i wrote concerning mr deuceace's adventers and his kind behayvior to messrs dawkins and blewitt i had the honor of laying before the public a skidewl of my master's detts in witch was the following itim bills of xchange and iou's l s d the iouse were trifling say a thowsnd pound the bills amountid to four thowsnd moar now the lor is in france that if a genlmn gives these in england and a french genlmn gits them in any way he can pursew the englishman who has drawn them even though he should be in france master did not know this fact laboring under a very common mistak that when onst out of england he might wissle at all the debts he left behind him my lady griffin sent over to her slissators in london who made arrangemints with the persons who possest the fine collection of ortografs on stampt paper which master had left behind him and they were glad enuff to take any oppertunity of getting back their money one fine morning as i was looking about in the court yard of our hotel talking to the servant gals as was my reglar custom in order to improve myself in the french languidge one of them comes up to me and says tenez monsieur charles down below in the office there is a bailiff with a couple of gendarmes who is asking for your master a t il des dettes par hasard i was struck all of a heap the truth flasht on my mind's hi toinette says i for that was the gal's name toinette says i giving her a kiss keep them for two minits as you valyou my affeckshn and then i gave her another kiss and ran up stares to our chambers master had now pretty well recovered of his wound and was aloud to drive abowt it was lucky for him that he had the strength to move sir sir says i the bailiffs are after you and you must run for your life bailiff says he nonsense i don't thank heaven owe a shilling to any man stuff sir says i forgetting my respeck don't you owe money in england i tell you the bailiffs are here and will be on you in a moment as i spoke cling cling ling ling goes the bell of the antyshamber and there they were sure enough what was to be done quick as litening i throws off my livry coat claps my goold lace hat on master's head and makes him put on my livry then i wraps myself up in his dressing gown and lolling down on the sofa bids him open the dor there they were the bailiff two jondarms with him toinette and an old waiter when toinette sees master she smiles and says dis donc charles ou est donc ton maitre chez lui n'est ce pas c'est le jeune a monsieur says she curtsying to the bailiff the old waiter was just a going to blurt out mais ce n'est pas when toinette stops him and says laissez donc passer ces messieurs vieux bete and in they walk the jon d'arms taking their post in the hall master throws open the salong doar very gravely and touching my hat says have you any orders about the cab sir why no chawls says i i shan't drive out to day the old bailiff grinned for he understood english having had plenty of english customers and says in french as master goes out i think sir you had better let your servant get a coach for i am under the painful necessity of arresting you au nom de la loi for the sum of ninety eight thousand seven hundred francs owed by you to the sieur jacques francois lebrun of paris and he pulls out a number of bills with master's acceptances on them sure enough take a chair sir says i and down he sits and i began to chaff him as well as i could about the weather my illness my sad axdent having lost one of my hands which was stuck into my busum and so on at last after a minnit or two i could contane no longer and bust out in a horse laff the old fellow turned quite pail and began to suspect somethink hola says he gendarmes a moi a moi je suis floue vole which means in english that he was reglar sold the jondarmes jumped into the room and so did toinette and the waiter grasefly rising from my arm chare i took my hand from my dressing gownd and flinging it open stuck up on the chair one of the neatest legs ever seen i then pinted majestickly to what do you think to my plush tites those sellabrated inigspressables which have rendered me famous in yourope taking the hint the jondarmes and the servnts rord out laffing and so did charles yellowplush esquire i can tell you old grippard the bailiff looked as if he would faint in his chare i heard a kab galloping like mad out of the hotel gate and knew then that my master was safe chapter viii the end of mr deuceace's history limbo my tail is droring rabidly to a close my suvvice with mr deuceace didn't continyou very long after the last chapter in which i described my admiral strattyjam and my singlar self devocean there's very few servnts i can tell you who'd have thought of such a contrivance and very few moar would have eggsycuted it when thought of but after all beyond the trifling advantich to myself in selling master's roab de sham which you gentle reader may remember i woar and in dixcovering a fipun note in one of the pockets beyond this i say there was to poar master very little advantich in what had been done it's true he had escaped very good but frans is not like great brittin a man in a livry coat with arm is pretty easily known and caught too as i can tell you such was the case with master he coodn leave paris moarover if he would what was to become in that case of his bride his unchbacked hairis he knew that young lady's temprimong as the parishers say too well to let her long out of his site she had nine thousand a yer she'd been in love a duzn times befor and mite be agin the honrabble algernon deuceace was a little too wide awake to trust much to the constnsy of so very inflammable a young creacher heavn bless us it was a marycle she wasn't earlier married i do bleave from suttn seans that past betwigst us that she'd have married me if she hadn't been sejuiced by the supearor rank and indianuity of the genlmn in whose survace i was well to use a commin igspreshn the beaks were after him how was he to manitch he coodn get away from his debts and he wooden quit the fare objict of his affeckshns he was ableejd then as the french say to lie perdew going out at night like a howl out of a hivy bush and returning in the daytime to his roast for its a maxum in france and i wood it were followed in ingland that after dark no man is lible for his detts and in any of the royal gardens the twillaries the pally roil or the lucksimbug for example a man may wander from sunrise to evening and hear nothing of the ojus dunns they an't admitted into these places of public enjyment and rondyvoo any more than dogs the centuries at the garden gates having orders to shuit all such master then was in this uncomfrable situation neither liking to go nor to stay peeping out at nights to have an interview with his miss ableagd to shuffle off her repeated questions as to the reason of all this disgeise and to talk of his two thowsnd a year jest as if he had it and didn't owe a shilling in the world of course now he began to grow mighty eager for the marritch he roat as many noats as she had done befor swoar against delay and cerymony talked of the pleasures of hyming the ardship that the ardor of two arts should be allowed to igspire the folly of waiting for the consent of lady griffin she was but a step mother and an unkind one miss was he said a major might marry whom she liked and suttnly had paid lady g quite as much attention as she ought by paying her the compliment to ask her at all and so they went on the curious thing was that when master was pressed about his cause for not coming out till night time he was misterus and miss griffin when asked why she wooden marry igsprest or rather didn't igspress a simlar secrasy wasn't it hard the cup seemed to be at the lip of both of 'em and yet somehow they could not manitch to take a drink but one morning in reply to a most desprat epistol wrote by my master over night deuceace delighted gits an answer from his soal's beluffd which ran thus miss griffin to the hon a p deuceace dearest you say you would share a cottage with me there is no need luckily for that you plead the sad sinking of your spirits at our delayed union beloved do you think my heart rejoices at our separation you bid me disregard the refusal of lady griffin and tell me that i owe her no further duty adored algernon i can refuse you no more i was willing not to lose a single chance of reconciliation with this unnatural step mother respect for the memory of my sainted father bid me do all in my power to gain her consent to my union with you nay shall i own it prudence dictated the measure for to whom should she leave the share of money accorded to her by my father's will but to my father's child but there are bounds beyond which no forbearance can go and thank heaven we have no need of looking to lady griffin for sordid wealth we have a competency without her is it not so dearest algernon be it as you wish then dearest bravest and best your poor matilda has yielded to you her heart long ago she has no longer need to keep back her name name the hour and i will delay no more but seek for refuge in your arms from the contumely and insult which meet me ever here matilda ps oh algernon if you did but know what a noble part your dear father has acted throughout in doing his best endeavors to further our plans and to soften lady griffin it is not his fault that she is inexorable as she is i send you a note sent by her to lord crabs we will laugh at it soon n'est ce pas ii my lord in reply to your demand for miss griffin's hand in favor of your son mr algernon deuceace i can only repeat what i before have been under the necessity of stating to you that i do not believe a union with a person of mr deuceace's character would conduce to my stepdaughter's happiness and therefore refuse my consent i will beg you to communicate the contents of this note to mr deuceace and implore you no more to touch upon a subject which you must be aware is deeply painful to me i remain your lordship's most humble servant l e griffin the right hon the earl of crabs hang her ladyship says my master what care i for it as for the old lord who'd been so afishous in his kindness and advice master recknsiled that pretty well with thinking that his lordship knew he was going to marry ten thousand a year and igspected to get some share of it for he roat back the following letter to his father as well as a flaming one to miss thank you my dear father for your kindness in that awkward business you know how painfully i am situated just now and can pretty well guess both the causes of my disquiet a marriage with my beloved matilda will make me the happiest of men the dear girl consents and laughs at the foolish pretensions of her mother in law to tell you the truth i wonder she yielded to them so long carry your kindness a step further and find for us a parson a license and make us two into one we are both major you know so that the ceremony of a guardian's consent is unnecessary your affectionate algernon deuceace how i regret that difference between us some time back matters are changed now and shall be more still after the marriage i knew what my master meant that he would give the old lord the money after he was married and as it was probble that miss would see the letter he roat he made it such as not to let her see two clearly into his present uncomfrable situation i took this letter along with the tender one for miss reading both of 'em in course by the way miss on getting hers gave an inegspressable look with the white of her i's kist the letter and prest it to her busm lord crabs read his quite calm and then they fell a talking together and told me to wait awhile and i should git an anser after a deal of counseltation my lord brought out a card and there was simply written on it to morrow at the ambassador's at twelve carry that back to your master chawls says he and bid him not to fail you may be sure i stept back to him pretty quick and gave him the card and the messinge master looked sattasfied with both but suttnly not over happy no man is the day before his marridge much more his marridge with a hump back harriss though she be well as he was a going to depart this bachelor life he did what every man in such suckmstances ought to do he made his will that is he made a dispasition of his property and wrote letters to his creditors telling them of his lucky chance and that after his marridge he would sutnly pay them every stiver before they must know his povvaty well enough to be sure that paymint was out of the question to do him justas he seam'd to be inclined to do the thing that was right now that it didn't put him to any inkinvenients to do so chawls says he handing me over a tenpun note here's your wagis and thank you for getting me out of the scrape with the bailiffs when you are married you shall be my valet out of liv'ry and i'll treble your salary his vallit praps his butler yes thought i here's a chance a vallit to ten thousand a year nothing to do but to shave him and read his notes and let my whiskers grow to dress in spick and span black and a clean shut per day muffings every night in the housekeeper's room the pick of the gals in the servants' hall a chap to clean my boots for me and my master's opera bone reglar once a week i knew what a vallit was as well as any genlmn in service and this i can tell you he's genrally a hapier idler handsomer mor genlmnly man than his master he has more money to spend for genlmn will leave their silver in their waistcoat pockets more suxess among the gals as good dinners and as good wine that is if he's friends with the butler and friends in corse they will be if they know which way their interest lies but these are only cassels in the air what the french call shutter d'espang it wasn't roat in the book of fate that i was to be mr deuceace's vallit days will pass at last even days befor a wedding the longist and unpleasantist day in the whole of a man's life i can tell you excep may be the day before his hanging and at length aroarer dawned on the suspicious morning which was to unite in the bonds of hyming the honrable algernon percy deuceace exquire and miss matilda griffin my master's wardrobe wasn't so rich as it had been for he'd left the whole of his nicknax and trumpry of dressing cases and rob dy shams his bewtifle museum of varnished boots his curous colleckshn of stulz and staub coats when he had been ableaged to quit so suddnly our pore dear lodginx at the hotel mirabew and being incog at a friend's house ad contentid himself with ordring a coople of shoots of cloves from a common tailor with a suffishnt quantaty of linning well he put on the best of his coats a blue and i thought it my duty to ask him whether he'd want his frock again he was good natured and said take it and be hanged to you half past eleven o'clock came and i was sent to look out at the door if there were any suspicious charicters a precious good nose i have to find a bailiff out i can tell you and an i which will almost see one round a corner and presenly a very modest green glass coach droave up and in master stept i didn't in corse appear on the box because being known my appearints might have compromised master but i took a short cut and walked as quick as posbil down to the rue de foburg st honore where his exlnsy the english ambasdor lives and where marridges are always performed betwigst english folk at paris there is almost nex door to the ambasdor's hotel another hotel of that lo kind which the french call cabbyrays or wine houses and jest as master's green glass coach pulled up another coach drove off out of which came two ladies whom i knew pretty well suffiz that one had a humpback and the ingenious reader will know why she came there the other was poor miss kicksey who came to see her turned off well master's glass coach droav up jest as i got within a few yards of the door our carridge i say droav up and stopt down gits coachmin to open the door and comes i to give mr deuceace an arm when out of the cabaray shoot four fellows and draw up betwigst the coach and embassy doar two other chaps go to the other doar of the carridge and opening it one says rendez vous m deuceace je vous arrete au nom de la loi which means get out of that mr d you are nabbed and no mistake master turned gashly pail and sprung to the other side of the coach as if a serpint had stung him he flung open the door and was for making off that way but he saw the four chaps standing betwigst libbarty and him he slams down the front window and screams out fouettez cocher which means go it coachmm in a despert loud voice but coachmin wooden go it and besides was off his box the long and short of the matter was that jest as i came up to the door two of the bums jumped into the carridge i saw all i knew my duty and so very mornfly i got up behind tiens says one of the chaps in the street c'est ce drole qui nous a floure l'autre jour i knew 'em but was too melumcolly to smile ou irons nous donc says coachmin to the genlmn who had got inside a deep woice from the intearor shouted out in reply to the coachmin a sainte pelagie and now praps i ot to dixcribe to you the humors of the prizn of sainte pelagie which is the french for fleat or queen's bentch but on this subject i'm rather shy of writing partly because the admiral boz has in the history of mr pickwick made such a dixcripshun of a prizn that mine wooden read very amyousingly afterwids and also because to tell you the truth i didn't stay long in it being not in a humer to waist my igsistance by passing away the ears of my youth in such a dull place my fust errint now was as you may phansy to carry a noat from master to his destined bride the poar thing was sadly taken aback as i can tell you when she found after remaining two hours at the embassy that her husband didn't make his appearance and so after staying on and on and yet seeing no husband she was forsed at last to trudge dishconslit home where i was already waiting for her with a letter from my master there was no use now denying the fact of his arrest and so he confest it at onst but he made a cock and bull story of treachery of a friend infimous fodgery and heaven knows what however it didn't matter much if he had told her that he had been betrayed by the man in the moon she would have bleavd him lady griffin never used to appear now at any of my visits she kep one drawing room and miss dined and lived alone in another they quarld so much that praps it was best they should live apart only my lord crabs used to see both comforting each with that winning and innsnt way he had he came in as miss in tears was lisning to my account of master's seazure and hoping that the prisn wasn't a horrid place with a nasty horrid dunjeon and a dreadfle jailer and nasty horrid bread and water law bless us she had borrod her ideers from the novvles she had been reading o my lord my lord says she have you heard this fatal story dearest matilda what for heaven's sake you alarm me what yes no is it no it can't be speak says my lord seizing me by the choler of my coat what has happened to my boy please you my lord says i he's at this moment in prisn no wuss having been incarserated about two hours ago in prison algernon in prison 'tis impossible imprisoned for what sum mention it and i will pay to the utmost farthing in my power i'm sure your lordship is very kind says i recklecting the sean betwixgst him and master whom he wanted to diddil out of a thowsand lb and you'll be happy to hear he's only in for a trifle five thousand pound is i think pretty near the mark five thousand pounds confusion says my lord clasping his hands and looking up to heaven and i have not five hundred dearest matilda how shall we help him alas my lord i have but three guineas and you know how lady griffin has the yes my sweet child i know what you would say but be of good cheer algernon you know has ample funds of his own thinking my lord meant dawkins's five thousand of which to be sure a good lump was left i held my tung but i cooden help wondering at lord crabs's igstream compashn for his son and miss with her l a year having only guineas is her pockit i took home bless us what a home a long and very inflamble letter from miss in which she dixscribed her own sorror at the disappointment swoar she lov'd him only the moar for his misfortns made light of them as a pusson for a paltry sum of five thousand pound ought never to be cast down 'specially as he had a certain independence in view and vowed that nothing nothing should ever injuice her to part from him etsettler etsettler i told master of the conversation which had past betwigst me and my lord and of his handsome offers and his horrow at hearing of his son's being taken and likewise mentioned how strange it was that miss should only have guineas and with such a fortn bless us i should have thot that she would always have carried a hundred thowsnd lb in her pockit at this master only said pshaw but the rest of the story about his father seemed to dixquiet him a good deal and he made me repeat it over agin he walked up and down the room agytated and it seam'd as if a new lite was breaking in upon him chawls says he did you observe did miss did my father seem particularly intimate with miss griffin how do you mean sir says i did lord crabs appear very fond of miss griffin he was suttnly very kind to her come sir speak at once did miss griffin seem very fond of his lordship why to tell the truth sir i must say she seemed very fond of him what did he call her he called her his dearest gal did he take her hand yes and he and he what he kist her and told her not to be so wery down hearted about the misfortn which had hapnd to you i have it now says he clinching his fist and growing gashly pail i have it now the infernal old hoary scoundrel the wicked unnatural wretch he would take her from me and he poured out a volley of oaves which are impossbill to be repeatid here i thot as much long ago and when my lord kem with his vizits so pretious affeckshnt at my lady griffinses i expected some such game was in the wind indeed i'd heard a somethink of it from the griffinses servnts that my lord was mighty tender with the ladies one thing however was evident to a man of his intleckshal capassaties he must either marry the gal at onst or he stood very small chance of having her he must get out of limbo immediantly or his respectid father might be stepping into his vaykint shoes oh he saw it all now the fust attempt at arest the marridge fixt at o'clock and the bayliffs fixt to come and intarup the marridge the jewel praps betwigst him and de l'orge but no it was the woman who did that a man don't deal such fowl blows igspecially a father to his son a woman may poar thing she's no other means of reventch and is used to fight with underhand wepns all her life through well whatever the pint might be this deuceace saw pretty clear that he'd been beat by his father at his own game a trapp set for him onst which had been defitted by my presnts of mind another trap set afterwids in which my lord had been suxesfle now my lord roag as he was was much too good natured to do an unkind ackshn mearly for the sake of doing it he'd got to that pich that he didn't mind injaries they were all fair play to him he gave 'em and reseav'd them without a thought of mallis if he wanted to injer his son it was to benefick himself and how was this to be done by getting the hairiss to himself to be sure the honrabble mr d didn't say so but i knew his feelinx well enough he regretted that he had not given the old genlmn the money he askt for poar fello he thought he had hit it but he was wide of the mark after all well but what was to be done it was clear that he must marry the gal at any rate cootky coot as the french say that is marry her and hang the igspence to do so he must first git out of prisn to get out of prisn he must pay his debts and to pay his debts he must give every shilling he was worth never mind four thousand pound is a small stake to a reglar gambler igspecially when he must play it or rot for life in prisn and when if he plays it well it will give him ten thousand a year so seeing there was no help for it he maid up his mind and accordingly wrote the follying letter to miss griffin my adored matilda your letter has indeed been a comfort to a poor fellow who had hoped that this night would have been the most blessed in his life and now finds himself condemned to spend it within a prison wall you know the accursed conspiracy which has brought these liabilities upon me and the foolish friendship which has cost me so much but what matters we have as you say enough even though i must pay this shameful demand upon me and five thousand pounds are as nothing compared to the happiness which i lose in being separated a night from thee courage however if i make a sacrifice it is for you and i were heartless indeed if i allowed my own losses to balance for a moment against your happiness is it not so beloved one is not your happiness bound up with mine in a union with me i am proud to think so proud too to offer such a humble proof as this of the depth and purity of my affection tell me that you will still be mine tell me that you will be mine tomorrow and to morrow these vile chains shall be removed and i will be free once more or if bound only bound to you my adorable matilda my betrothed bride write to me ere the evening closes for i shall never be able to shut my eyes in slumber upon my prison couch until they have been first blessed by the sight of a few words from thee write to me love write to me i languish for the reply which is to make or mar me for ever your affectionate a p d having polisht off this epistol master intrustid it to me to carry and bade me at the same time to try and give it into miss griffin's hand alone i ran with it to lady griffinses i found miss as i desired in a sollatary condition and i presented her with master's pafewmed billy she read it and the number of size to which she gave vint and the tears which she shed beggar digscription she wep and sighed until i thought she would bust she even claspt my hand in her's and said o charles is he very very miserable he is ma'am says i very miserable indeed nobody upon my honor could be miserablerer on hearing this pethetic remark her mind was made up at onst and sitting down to her eskrewtaw she immediantly ableaged master with an answer here it is in black and white my prisoned bird shall pine no more but fly home to its nest in these arms adored algernon i will meet thee to morrow at the same place at the same hour then then it will be impossible for aught but death to divide us m g this kind of flumry style comes you see of reading novvles and cultivating littery purshuits in a small way how much better is it to be puffickly ignorant of the hart of writing and to trust to the writing of the heart this is my style artyfiz i despise and trust compleatly to natur but revnong a no mootong as our continential friends remark to that nice white sheep algernon percy deuceace exquire that wenrabble old ram my lord crabs his father and that tender and dellygit young lamb miss matilda griffin she had just foalded up into its proper triangular shape the noat transcribed abuff and i was just on the point of saying according to my master's orders miss if you please the honrabble mr deuceace would be very much ableaged to you to keep the seminary which is to take place to morrow a profound se when my master's father entered and i fell back to the door miss without a word rusht into his arms burst into teers agin as was her reglar way it must be confest she was of a very mist constitution and showing to him his son's note cried look my dear lord how nobly your algernon our algernon writes to me who can doubt after this of the purity of his matchless affection my lord took the letter read it seamed a good deal amyoused and returning it to its owner said very much to my surprise my dear miss griffin he certainly does seem in earnest and if you choose to make this match without the consent of your mother in law you know the consequence and are of course your own mistress consequences for shame my lord a little money more or less what matters it to two hearts like ours hearts are very pretty things my sweet young lady but three per cents are better nay have we not an ample income of our own without the aid of lady griffin my lord shrugged his shoulders be it so my love says he i'm sure i can have no other reason to prevent a union which is founded upon such disinterested affection and here the conversation dropt miss retired clasping her hands and making play with the whites of her i's my lord began trotting up and down the room with his fat hands stuck in his britchis pockits his countnince lighted up with igstream joy and singing to my inordnit igstonishment see the conquering hero comes tiddy diddy doll tiddy doll doll doll he began singing this song and tearing up and down the room like mad i stood amazd a new light broke in upon me he wasn't going then to make love to miss griffin master might marry her had she not got the for i say i was just standing stock still my eyes fixt my hands puppindicklar my mouf wide open and these igstrordinary thoughts passing in my mind when my lord having got to the last doll of his song just as i came to the sillible for of my ventriloquism or inward speech we had eatch jest reached the pint digscribed when the meditations of both were sudnly stopt by my lord in the midst of his singin and trottin match coming bolt up aginst poar me sending me up aginst one end of the room himself flying back to the other and it was only after considrabble agitation that we were at length restored to anything like a liquilibrium what you here you infernal rascal says my lord your lordship's very kind to notus me says i i am here and i gave him a look he saw i knew the whole game and after whisling a bit as was his habit when puzzled i bleave he'd have only whisled if he had been told he was to be hanged in five minits after whisling a bit he stops sudnly and coming up to me says hearkye charles this marriage must take place to morrow must it sir says i now for my part i don't think stop my good fellow if it does not take place what do you gain this stagger'd me if it didn't take place i only lost a situation for master had but just enough money to pay his detts and it wooden soot my book to serve him in prisn or starving well says my lord you see the force of my argument now look here and he lugs out a crisp fluttering snowy hundred pun note if my son and miss griffin are married to morrow you shall have this and i will moreover take you into my service and give you double your present wages flesh and blood cooden bear it my lord says i laying my hand upon my busm only give me security and i'm yours for ever the old noblemin grin'd and pattid me on the shoulder right my lad says he right you're a nice promising youth here is the best security and he pulls out his pockit book returns the hundred pun bill and takes out one for fifty here is half to day to morrow you shall have the remainder my fingers trembled a little as i took the pretty fluttering bit of paper about five times as big as any sum of money i had ever had in my life i cast my i upon the amount it was a fifty sure enough a bank poss bill made payable to leonora emilia griffin and indorsed by her the cat was out of the bag now gentle reader i spose you begin to see the game recollect from this day you are in my service my lord you overpoar me with your faviors go to the devil sir says he do your duty and hold your tongue and thus i went from the service of the honorabble algernon deuceace to that of his exlnsy the right honorabble earl of crabs on going back to prisn i found deuceace locked up in that oajus place to which his igstravygansies had deservedly led him and felt for him i must say a great deal of contemp a raskle such as he a swindler who had robbed poar dawkins of the means of igsistance who had cheated his fellow roag mr richard blewitt and who was making a musnary marridge with a disgusting creacher like miss griffin didn merit any compashn on my purt and i determined quite to keep secret the suckmstansies of my privit intervew with his exlnsy my presnt master i gev him miss griffinses trianglar which he read with a satasfied air then turning to me says he you gave this to miss griffin alone yes sir you gave her my message yes sir and you are quite sure lord crabs was not there when you gave either the message or the note not there upon my honor says i hang your honor sir brush my hat and coat and go call a coach do you hear i did as i was ordered and on coming back found master in what's called i think the greffe of the prisn the officer in waiting had out a great register and was talking to master in the french tongue in coarse a number of poar prisners were looking eagerly on let us see my lor says he the debt is francs there are capture expenses interest so much and the whole sum amounts to a hundred thousand francs moins deuceace in a very myjestic way takes out of his pocketbook four thowsnd pun notes this is not french money but i presume that you know it m greffier says he the greffier turned round to old solomon a money changer who had one or two clients in the prisn and hapnd luckily to be there les billets sont bons says he je les prendrai pour cent mille douze cent francs et j'espere my lor de vous revoir good says the greffier i know them to be good and i will give my lor the difference and make out his release which was done the poar debtors gave a feeble cheer as the great dubble iron gates swung open and clang to again and deuceace stept out and me after him to breathe the fresh hair he had been in the place but six hours and was now free again free and to be married to ten thousand a year nex day but for all that he lookt very faint and pale he had put down his great stake and when he came out of sainte pelagie he had but fifty pounds left in the world never mind when onst the money's down make your mind easy and so deuceace did he drove back to the hotel mirabew where he ordered apartmince infinately more splendid than befor and i pretty soon told toinette and the rest of the suvvants how nobly he behayved and how he valyoud four thousnd pound no more than ditch water and such was the consquincies of my praises and the poplarity i got for us boath that the delighted landlady immediantly charged him dubble what she would have done if it hadn been for my stoaries he ordered splendid apartmince then for the nex week a carridge and four for fontainebleau to morrow at precisely and having settled all these things went quietly to the roshy de cancale where he dined as well he might for it was now eight o'clock i didn't spare the shompang neither that night i can tell you for when i carried the note he gave me for miss griffin in the evening informing her of his freedom that young lady remarked my hagitated manner of walking and speaking and said honest charles he is flusht with the events of the day here charles is a napoleon take it and drink to your mistress i pockitid it but i must say i didn't like the money it went against my stomick to take it chapter ix the marriage well the nex day came at the carridge and four was waiting at the ambasdor's doar and miss griffin and the faithfle kicksey were punctial to the apintment i don't wish to

and said i laugh at the threats of lady griffin and she toar the paper in two and walked on leaning on the arm of the faithful and obleaging miss kicksey i picked up the paper for fear of axdents and brot it to my lord not that there was any necessaty for he'd kep a copy and made me and another witniss my lady griffin's solissator read them both before he sent either away good says he and he

my messinge and bowed them palitely in my lord didn't rise but smoaked away as usual praps a little quicker but i can't say my lady sat upright looking handsum and strong deuceace walked in his left arm tied to his breast his wife and hat on the other he looked very pale and frightened his wife poar thing had her head berried in her handkerchief and sobd fit to break her heart miss kicksey who was in the room but i didn't mention her she was less than nothink in our house went up to mrs deuceace at onst and held out her arms she had a heart that old kicksey and i respect her for it the poor hunchback flung herself into miss's arms with a kind of whooping screech and kep there for some time sobbing in quite a historical manner i saw there was going to be a sean and so in cors left the door ajar welcome to saint cloud algy my boy says my lord in a loud hearty voice you thought you would give us the slip eh you rogue but we knew it my dear fellow we knew the whole affair did we not my soul and you see kept our secret better than you did yours i must confess sir says deuceace bowing that i had no idea of the happiness which awaited me in the shape of a mother in law no you dog no no says my lord giggling old birds you know not to be caught with chaff like young ones but here we are all spliced and happy at last sit down algernon let us smoke a segar and talk over the perils and adventures of the last month my love says my lord turning to his lady you have no malice against poor algernon i trust pray shake his hand a grin but my lady rose and said i have told mr deuceace that i never wished to see him or speak to him more i see no reason now to change my opinion and herewith she sailed out of the room by the door through which kicksey had carried poor mrs deuceace well well says my lord as lady crabs swept by i was in hopes she had forgiven you but i know the whole story and i must confess you used her cruelly ill two strings to your bow that was your game was it you rogue do you mean my lord that you know all that past between me and lady grif lady crabs before our quarrel perfectly you made love to her and she was almost in love with you you jilted her for money she got a man to shoot your hand off in revenge no more dice boxes now deuceace no more sauter la coupe i can't think how the deuce you will manage to live without them your lordship is very kind but i have given up play altogether says deuceace looking mighty black and uneasy oh indeed benedick has turned a moral man has he this is better and better are you thinking of going into the church deuceace my lord may i ask you to be a little more serious serious a quoi bon i am serious serious in my surprise that when you might have had either of these women you should have preferred that hideous wife of yours may i ask you in turn how you came to be so little squeamish about a wife as to choose a woman who had just been making love to your own son says deuceace growing fierce how can you ask such a question i owe forty thousand pounds there is an execution at sizes hall every acre i have is in the hands of my creditors and that's why i married her do you think there was any love lady crabs is a dev'lish fine woman but she's not a fool she married me for my coronet and i married her for her money well my lord you need not ask me i think why i married the daughter in law yes but i do my dear boy how the deuce are you to live dawkins's five thousand pounds won't last forever and afterwards you don't mean my lord you don't i mean you can't d says he starting up and losing all patience you don't dare to say that miss griffin had not a fortune of ten thousand a year my lord was rolling up and wetting betwigst his lips another segar he lookt up after he had lighted it and said quietly certainly miss griffin had a fortune of ten thousand a year well sir and has she not got it now has she spent it in a week she has not got a six pence now she married without her mother's consent deuceace sunk down in a chair and i never see such a dreadful picture of despair as there was in the face of that retchid man he writhed and nasht his teeth he tore open his coat and wriggled madly the stump of his left hand until fairly beat he threw it over his livid pale face and sinking backwards fairly wept alowd bah it's a dreddfle thing to hear a man crying his pashn torn up from the very roots of his heart as it must be before it can git such a vent my lord meanwhile rolled his segar lighted it and went on my dear boy the girl has not a shilling i wished to have left you alone in peace with your four thousand pounds you might have lived decently upon it in germany where money is at per cent where your duns would not find you and a couple of hundred a year would have kept you and your wife in comfort but you see lady crabs would not listen to it you had injured her and after she had tried to kill you and failed she determined to ruin you and succeeded i must own to you that i directed the arresting business and put her up to buying your protested bills she got them for a trifle and as you have paid them has made a good two thousand pounds by her bargain it was a painful thing to be sure for a father to get his son arrested but que voulez vous i did not appear in the transaction she would have you ruined and it was absolutely necessary that you should marry before i could so i pleaded your cause with miss griffin and made you the happy man you are you rogue you rogue you thought to match your old father did you but never mind lunch will be ready soon in the meantime have a segar and drink a glass of sauterne deuceace who had been listening to this speech sprung up wildly i'll not believe it he said it's a lie an infernal lie forged by you you hoary villain and by the murderess and strumpet you have married i'll not believe it show me the will matilda matilda shouted he screaming hoarsely and flinging open the door by which she had gone out keep your temper my boy you are vexed and i feel for you but don't use such bad language it is quite needless believe me matilda shouted out deuceace again and the poor crooked thing came trembling in followed by miss kicksey is this true woman says he clutching hold of her hand what dear algernon says she what screams out deuceace what why that you are a beggar for marrying without your mother's consent that you basely lied to me in order to bring about this match that you are a swindler in conspiracy with that old fiend yonder and the she devil his wife it is true sobbed the poor woman that i have nothing but nothing but what why don't you speak you drivelling fool i have nothing but you dearest have two thousand a year is that not enough for us you love me for myself don't you algernon you have told me so a thousand times say so again dear husband and do not do not be so unkind and here she sank on her knees and clung to him and tried to catch his hand and kiss it how much did you say says my lord two thousand a year sir he has told us so a thousand times two thousand two thou ho ho ho haw haw haw roars my lord that is i vow the best thing i ever heard in my life my dear creature he has not a shilling not a single maravedi by all the gods and goddesses and this exlnt noblemin began laffin louder than ever a very kind and feeling genlmn he was as all must confess there was a paws and mrs deuceace didn begin cussing and swearing at her husband as he had done at her she only said o algernon is this true and got up and went to a chair and wep in quiet my lord opened the great box if you or your lawyers would like to examine sir george's will it is quite at your service you will see here the proviso which i mentioned that gives the entire fortune to lady griffin lady crabs that is and here my dear boy you see the danger of hasty conclusions her ladyship only showed you the first page of the will of course she wanted to try you you thought you made a great stroke in at once proposing to miss griffin do not mind it my love he really loves you now very sincerely when in fact you would have done much better to have read the rest of the will you were completely bitten my boy humbugged bamboozled ay and by your old father you dog i told you i would you know when you refused to lend me a portion of your dawkins money i told you i would and i did i had you the very next day let this be a lesson to you percy my boy don't try your luck again against such old hands look deuced well before you leap audi alteram partem my lad which means read both sides of the will i think lunch is ready but i see you don't smoke shall we go in stop my lord says mr deuceace very humble i shall not share your hospitality but but you know my condition i am penniless you know the manner in which my wife has been brought up the honorable mrs deuceace sir shall always find a home here as if nothing had occurred to interrupt the friendship between her dear mother and herself and for me sir says deuceace speaking faint and very slow i hope i trust i think my lord you will not forget me forget you sir certainly not and that you will make some provision algernon deuceace says my lord getting up from the sophy and looking at him with sich a jolly malignity as i never see i declare before heaven that i will not give you a penny hereupon my lord held out his hand to mrs deuceace and said my dear will you join your mother and me we shall always as i said have a home for you my lord said the poar thing dropping a curtsy my home is with him about three months after when the season was beginning at paris and the autumn leafs was on the ground my lord my lady me and mortimer were taking a stroal in the boddy balong the carridge driving on slowly ahead and us as happy as possbill admiring the pleasant woods and the goldn sunset my lord was expayshating to my lady upon the exquizit beauty of the sean and pouring forth a host of butifle and virtuous sentaments sootable to the hour it was dalitefle to hear him ah said he black must be the heart my love which does not feel the influence of a scene like this gathering as it were from those sunlit skies a portion of their celestial gold and gaining somewhat of heaven with each pure draught of this delicious air lady crabs did not speak but prest his arm and looked upwards mortimer and i too felt some of the infliwents of the sean and lent on our goold sticks in silence the carriage drew up close to us and my lord and my lady sauntered slowly tords it jest at the place was a bench and on the bench sate a poorly drest woman and by her leaning against a tree was a man whom i thought i'd sean befor he was drest in a shabby blew coat with white seems and copper buttons a torn hat was on his head and great quantaties of matted hair and whiskers disfiggared his countnints he was not shaved and as pale as stone my lord and lady didn tak the slightest notice of him but past on to the carridge me and mortimer lickwise took our places as we past the man had got a grip of the woman's shoulder who was holding down her head sobbing bitterly no sooner were my lord and lady seated than they both with igstream dellixy and good natur burst into a ror of lafter peal upon peal whooping and screaching enough to frighten the evening silents deuceace turned round i see his face now the face of a devvle of hell fust he lookt towards the carridge and pinted to it with his maimed arm then he raised the other and struck the woman by his side she fell screaming poor thing poor thing mr yellowplush's ajew the end of mr deuceace's history is going to be the end of my corrispondince i wish the public was as sory to part with me as i am with the public becaws i fansy reely that we've become frends and feal for my part a becoming greaf at saying ajew it's imposbill for me to continyow however a writin as i have done violetting the rules of authography and trampling upon the fust princepills of english grammar when i began i knew no better when i'd carrid on these papers a little further and grew accustmd to writin i began to smel out somethink quear in my style within the last sex weaks i have been learning to spell and when all the world was rejoicing at the festivvaties of our youthful quean when all i's were fixed upon her long sweet of ambasdors and princes following the splendid carridge of marshle the duke of damlatiar and blinking at the pearls and dimince of prince oystereasy yellowplush was in his loanly pantry his eyes were fixt upon the spelling book his heart was bent upon mastring the diffickleties of the littery professhn i have been in fact convertid this was written in you shall here how ours you know is a wig house and ever sins his third son has got a place in the treasury his secknd a captingsy in the guards his fust the secretary of embasy at pekin with a prospick of being appinted ambasdor at loo choo ever sins master's sons have reseaved these attentions and master himself has had the promis of a pearitch he has been the most reglar consistnt honrabble libbaral in or out of the house of commins well being a whig it's the fashn as you know to reseave littery pipple and accordingly at dinner tother day whose name do you think i had to hollar out on the fust landing place about a wick ago after several dukes and markises had been enounced a very gentell fly drives up to our doar and out steps two gentlemen one was pail and wor spektickles a wig and a white neckcloth the other was slim with a hook nose a pail fase a small waist a pare of falling shoulders a tight coat and a catarack of black satting tumbling out of his busm and falling into a gilt velvet weskit the little genlmn settled his wigg and pulled out his ribbins the younger one fluffed the dust of his shoes looked at his whiskers in a little pockit glas settled his crevatt and they both mounted upstairs what name sir says i to the old genlmn name a now you thief o' the wurrld says he do you pretind nat to know me say it's the cabinet cyclopa no i mane the litherary chran psha bluthanowns say it's docthor dioclesian larner i think he'll know me now ay nid but the genlmn called nid was at the botm of the stare and pretended to be very busy with his shoo string so the little genlmn went upstares alone doctor diolesius larner says i doctor athanasius lardner says greville fitz roy our secknd footman on the fust landing place doctor ignatius loyola says the groom of the chambers who pretends to be a scholar and in the little genlmn went when safely housed the other chap came and when i asked him his name said in a thick gobbling kind of voice sawedwadgeorgeearllittnbulwig sir what says i quite agast at the name sawedwad no i mean mistawedwad lyttn bulwig my neas trembled under me my i's fild with tiers my voice shook as i past up the venrabble name to the other footman and saw this fust of english writers go up to the drawing room it's needless to mention the names of the rest of the compny or to dixcribe the suckmstansies of the dinner suffiz to say that the two littery genlmn behaved very well and seamed to have good appytights igspecially the little irishman in the whig who et drunk and talked as much as a duzn he told how he'd been presented at cort by his friend mr bulwig and how the quean had received 'em both with a dignity undigscribable and how her blessid majisty asked what was the bony fidy sale of the cabinit cyclopaedy and how be doctor larner told her that on his honner it was under ten thowsnd you may guess that the doctor when he made this speach was pretty far gone the fact is that whether it was the coronation or the goodness of the wine cappitle it is in our house i can tell you or the natral propensaties of the gests assembled which made them so igspecially jolly i don't know but they had kep up the meating pretty late and our poar butler was quite tired with the perpechual baskits of clarrit which he'd been called upon to bring up so that about o'clock if i were to say they were merry i should use a mild term if i wer to say they were intawsicated i should use a nigspresshn more near to the truth but less rispeckful in one of my situashn the cumpany reseaved this annountsmint with mute extonishment pray doctor larnder says a spiteful genlmn willing to keep up the littery conversation what is the cabinet cyclopaedia it's the littherary wontherr of the wurrld says he and sure your lordship must have seen it the latther numbers ispicially cheap as durrt bound in gleezed calico six shillings a vollum the illusthrious neems of walther scott thomas moore docther southey sir james mackintosh docther donovan and meself are to be found in the list of conthributors it's the

scintillations of divine litherature a monumintum in fact are perinnius bound in pink calico six shillings a vollum this wigmawole said mr bulwig who seemed rather disgusted that his friend should take up so much of the convassation this wigmawole is all vewy well but it's cuwious that you don't wemember in chawactewising the litewawy mewits of the vawious magazines cwonicles weviews and encyclopaedias the existence of a cwitical weview and litewary chwonicle which though the aewa of its appeawance is dated only at a vewy few months pwevious to the pwesent pewiod is nevertheless so wemarkable for its intwinsic mewits as to be wead not in the metwopolis alone but in the countwy not in fwance merely but in the west of euwope whewever our pure wenglish is spoken it stwetches its peaceful sceptre pewused in amewica fwom new york to ningawa wepwinted in canada from montweal to towonto and as i am gwatified to hear fwom my fwend the governor of cape coast castle wegularly weceived in afwica and twanslated into the mandingo language by the missionawies and the bushwangers i need not say gentlemen sir that is mr speaker i mean sir john that i allude to the litewary chwonicle of which i have the honor to be pwincipal contwibutor very true my dear mr bullwig says my master you and i being whigs must of course stand by our own friends and i will agree without a moment's hesitation that the literary what d'ye call'em is the prince of periodicals the pwince of pewiodicals says bullwig my dear sir john it's the empewow of the pwess soit let it be the emperor of the press as you poetically call it but between ourselves confess it do not the tory writers beat your whigs hollow you talk about magazines look at look at hwat shouts out larder there's none sir jan compared to ourrs pardon me i think that it is 'bentley's mislany' you mane says ignatius as sharp as a niddle why no but o thin it's co'burn sure and that divvle thayodor a pretty paper sir but light thrashy milk and wathery not sthrong like the litherary chran good luck to it why doctor lander i was going to tell at once the name of the periodical it's fraser's magazine freser says the doctor o thunder and turf fwaser says bullwig o ah hum haw yes no why that is weally no weally upon my weputation i never before heard the name of the pewiodical by the by sir john what wemarkable good clawet this is is it lawose or laff laff indeed he cooden git beyond laff and i'm blest if i could kip it neither for hearing him pretend ignurnts and being behind the skreend settlin somethink for the genlmn i bust into such a raw of laffing as never was igseeded hullo says bullwig turning red have i said anything impwobable aw widiculous for weally i never befaw wecollect to have heard in society such a twemendous peal of cachinnation that which the twagic bard who fought at mawathon has called an anewithmon gelasma why be the holy piper says larder i think you are dthrawing a little on your imagination not read fraser don't believe him my lord duke he reads every word of it the rogue the boys about that magazine baste him as if he was a sack of oatmale my reason for crying out sir jan was because you mintioned fraser at all bullwig has every syllable of it be heart from the pailitix down to the 'yellowplush correspondence' ha ha says bullwig affecting to laff you may be sure my ears prickt up when i heard the name of the yellowplush correspondence ha ha why to tell truth i have wead the cowespondence to which you allude it's a gweat favowite at court i was talking with spwing wice and john wussell about it the other day well and what do you think of it says sir john looking mity waggish for he knew it was me who roat it why weally and twuly there's considewable cleverness about the cweature but it's low disgustingly low it violates pwabability and the orthogwaphy is so carefully inaccuwate that it requires a positive study to compwehend it yes faith says larner the arthagraphy is detestible it's as bad for a man to write bad spillin as it is for 'em to speak wid a brrogue iducation furst and ganius afterwards your health my lord and good luck to you yaw wemark says bullwig is vewy appwopwiate you will wecollect sir john in hewodotus as for you doctor you know more about iwish than about gweek you will wecollect without doubt a stowy nawwated by that cwedulous though fascinating chwonicler of a certain kind of sheep which is known only in a certain distwict of awabia and of which the tail is so enormous that it either dwaggles on the gwound or is bound up by the shepherds of the country into a small wheelbawwow or cart which makes the chwonicler sneewingly wemark that thus 'the sheep of awabia have their own chawiots' i have often thought sir this clawet is weally nectaweous i have often i say thought that the wace of man may be compawed to these awabian sheep genius is our tail education our wheelbawwow without art and education to pwop it this genius dwops on the gwound and is polluted by the mud or injured by the wocks upon the way with the wheelbawwow it is stwengthened incweased and supported a pwide to the owner a blessing to mankind a very appropriate simile says sir john and i am afraid that the genius of our friend yellowplush has need of some such support apropos said bullwig who is yellowplush i was given to understand that the name was only a fictitious one and that the papers were written by the author of the 'diary of a physician' if so the man has wonderfully improved in style and there is some hope of him bah says the duke of doublejowl everybody knows it's barnard the celebrated author of 'sam slick' pardon my dear duke says lord bagwig it's the authoress of 'high life' 'almack's' and other fashionable novels fiddlestick's end says doctor larner don't be blushing and pretinding to ask questions don't we know you bullwig it's you yourself you thief of the world we smoked you from the very beginning bullwig was about indignantly to reply when sir john interrupted them and said i must correct you all gentlemen mr yellowplush is no other than mr yellowplush he gave you my dear bullwig your last glass of champagne at dinner and is now an inmate of my house and an ornament of my kitchen gad says doublejowl let's have him up hear hear says bagwig ah now says larner your grace is not going to call up and talk to a footman sure is it gintale to say the least of it says bullwig the pwactice is iwwegular and indecowous and i weally don't see how the interview can be in any way pwofitable but the vices of the company went against the two littery men and everybody excep them was for having up poor me the bell was wrung butler came send up charles says master and charles who was standing behind the skreand was persnly abliged to come in charles says master i have been telling these gentlemen who is the author of the 'yellowplush correspondence' in fraser's magazine it's the best magazine in europe says the duke and no mistake says my lord hwhat says larner and where's the litherary chran i said myself nothink but made a bough and blusht like pickle cabbitch mr yellowplush says his grace will you in the first place drink a glass of wine i boughed agin and what wine do you prefer sir humble port or imperial burgundy why your grace says i i know my place and ain't above kitchin wines i will take a glass of port and drink it to the health of this honrabble compny when i'd swigged off the bumper which his grace himself did me the honor to pour out for me there was a silints for a minnit when my master said charles yellowplush i have perused your memoirs in fraser's magazine with so much curiosity and have so high an opinion of your talents as a writer that i really cannot keep you as a footman any longer or allow you to discharge duties for which you are now quite unfit with all my admiration for your talents mr yellowplush i still am confident that many of your friends in the servants' hall will clean my boots a great deal better than a gentleman of your genius can ever be expected to do it is for this purpose i employ footmen and not that they may be writing articles in magazines but you need not look so red my good fellow and had better take another glass of port i don't wish to throw you upon the wide world without the means of a livelihood and have made interest for a little place which you will have under government and which will give you an income of eighty pounds per annum which you can double i presume by your literary labors sir says i clasping my hands and busting into tears do not for heaven's sake do not think of any such think or drive me from your suvvice because i have been fool enough to write in magaseens glans but one moment at your honor's plate every spoon is as bright as a mirror condysend to igsamine your shoes your honor may see reflected in them the fases of every one in the company i blacked them shoes i cleaned that there plate if occasionally i've forgot the footman in the litterary man and committed to paper my remindicences of fashnabble life it was from a sincere desire to do good and promote nollitch and i appeal to your honor i lay my hand on my busm and in the fase of this noble company beg you to say when you rung your bell who came to you fust when you stopt out at brooke's till morning who sat up for you when you was ill who forgot the natral dignities of his station and answered the two pair bell oh sir says i i know what's what don't send me away i know them littery chaps and beleave me i'd rather be a footman the work's not so hard the pay is better the vittels incompyrably supearor i have but to clean my things and run my errints and you put clothes on my back and meat in my mouth sir mr bullwig an't i right shall i quit my station and sink that is to say rise to yours bullwig was violently affected a tear stood in his glistening i yellowplush says he seizing my hand you are right quit not your present occupation black boots clean knives wear plush all your life but don't turn literary man look at me i am the first novelist in europe i have ranged with eagle wing over the wide regions of literature and perched on every eminence in its turn i have gazed with eagle eyes on the sun of philosophy and fathomed the mysterious depths of the human mind all languages are familiar to me all thoughts are known to me all men understood by me i have gathered wisdom from the honeyed lips of plato as we wandered in the gardens of acadames wisdom too from the mouth of job johnson as we smoked our 'backy in seven dials such must be the studies and such is the mission in this world of the poet philosopher but the knowledge is only emptiness the initiation is but misery the initiated a man shunned and bann'd by his fellows oh said bullwig clasping his hands and throwing his fine i's up to the chandelier the curse of pwometheus descends upon his wace wath and punishment pursue them from genewation to genewation wo to genius the heaven scaler the fire stealer wo and thrice bitter desolation earth is the wock on which zeus wemorseless stwetches his withing victim men the vultures that feed and fatten on him ai ai it is agony eternal gwoaning and solitawy despair and you yellowplush would penetwate these mystewies you would waise the awful veil and stand in the twemendous pwesence beware as you value your peace beware withdwaw wash neophyte for heaven's sake o for heaven's sake here he looked round with agony give me a glass of bwandy and water for this clawet is beginning to disagwee with me bullwig having concluded this spitch very much to his own sattasfackshn looked round to the compny for aplaws and then swigged off the glass of brandy and water giving a sollum sigh as he took the last gulph and then doctor ignatius who longed for a chans and in order to show his independence began flatly contradicting his friend addressed me and the rest of the genlmn present in the following manner hark ye says he my gossoon doan't be led asthray by the nonsinse of that divil of a bullwig he's jillous of ye my bhoy that's the rale undoubted thruth and it's only to keep you out of litherary life that he's palavering you in this way i'll tell you what plush ye blackguard my honorable frind the mimber there has told me a hunder times by the smallest computation of his intense admiration of your talents and the wonderful sthir they were making in the world he can't bear a rival he's mad with envy hatred oncharatableness look at him plush and look at me my father was not a juke exactly nor aven a markis and see nevertheliss to what a pitch i am come i spare no ixpinse i'm the iditor of a cople of pariodicals i dthrive about in me carridge i dine wid the lords of the land and why in the name of the piper that pleed before mosus hwy because i'm a litherary man because i know how to play me cards because i'm docther larner in fact and mimber of every society in and out of europe i might have remained all my life in thrinity colledge and never made such an incom as that offered you by sir jan but i came to london to london my boy and now see look again at me friend bullwig he is a gentleman to be sure and bad luck to 'im say i and what has been the result of his litherary labor i'll tell you what and i'll tell this gintale society by the shade of saint patrick they're going to make him a barinet a barnet doctor says i you don't mean to say they're going to make him a barnet as sure as i've made meself a docthor says larner what a baronet like sir john the divle a bit else and pray what for what faw says bullwig ask the histowy of litwatuwe what faw ask colburn ask bentley ask saunders and otley ask the gweat bwitish nation what faw the blood in my veins comes puwified thwough ten thousand years of chivalwous ancestwy but that is neither here nor there my political principles the equal wights which i have advocated the gweat cause of fweedom that i have celebwated are known to all but this i confess has nothing to do with the question no the question is this on the thwone of litewature i stand unwivalled pwe eminent and the bwitish government honowing genius in me compliments the bwitish nation by lifting into the bosom of the heweditawy nobility the most gifted member of the democwacy the honrabble genlm here sunk down amidst repeated cheers sir john says i and my lord duke the words of my rivrint frend ignatius and the remarks of the honrabble genlmn who has just sate down have made me change the detummination which i had the honor of igspressing just now i igsept the eighty pound a year knowing that i shall ave plenty of time for pursuing my littery career and hoping some day to set on that same bentch of barranites which is deckarated by the presnts of my honrabble friend why shooden i it's trew i ain't done anythink as yet to deserve such an honor and it's very probable that i never shall but what then quaw dong as our friends say i'd much rayther have a coat of arms than a coat of livry i'd much rayther have my blud red hand spralink in the middle of a shield than underneath a tea tray a barranit i will be and in consiquints must cease to be a footmin as to my politticle princepills these i confess ain't settled they are i know necessary but they ain't necessary until askt for besides i reglar read the sattarist newspaper and so ignirince on this pint would be inigscusable but if one man can git to be a doctor and another a barranit and another a capting in the navy and another a countess and another the wife of a governor of the cape of good hope i begin to perseave that the littery trade ain't such a very bad un igspecially if you're up to snough and know what's o'clock i'll learn to make myself usefle in the fust place then i'll larn to spell and i trust by reading the novvles of the honrabble member and the scientafick treatiseses of the reverend doctor i may find the secrit of suxess and git a litell for my own share i've sevral frends in the press having paid for many of those chaps' drink and given them other treets and so i think i've got all the emilents of suxess therefore i am detummined as i said to igsept your kind offer and beg to withdraw the wuds which i made yous of when i refyoused your hoxpatable offer i must however i wish you'd withdraw yourself said sir john bursting into a most igstrorinary rage and not interrupt the company with your infernal talk go down and get us coffee and hark ye hold your impertinent tongue or i'll break every bone in your body you shall have the place as i said and while you're in my service you shall be my servant but you don't stay in my service after to morrow go down stairs sir and don't stand staring here in this abrupt way my evening ended it's with a melancholy regret that i think what came of it i don't wear plush any more i am an altered a wiser and i trust a better man i'm about a novvle having made great progriss in spelling in the style of my friend bullwig and preparing for publigation in the doctor's cyclopedear the lives of eminent british and foring wosherwomen skimmings from the dairy of george iv charles yellowplush esq to oliver yorke esq dear why takin advantage of the crismiss holydays sir john and me who is a member of parlyment had gone down to our place in yorkshire for six wicks to shoot grows and woodcox and enjoy old english hospitalaty this ugly canady bisniss unluckaly put an end to our sports in the country and brot us up to buckly square as fast as four posterses could gallip when there i found your parcel containing the two vollumes of a new book which as i have been away from the literary world and emplied solely in athlatic exorcises have been laying neglected in my pantry among my knife cloaths and dekanters and blacking bottles and bed room candles and things these memoirs were originally published in fraser's magazine and it may be stated for the benefit of the unlearned in such matters that oliver yorke is the assumed name of the editor of that periodical this will i'm sure account for my delay in notussing the work i see sefral of the papers and magazeens have been befoarhand with me and have given their apinions concerning it specially the quotly revew which has most mussilessly cut to peases the author of this dairy of the times of george iv diary illustrative of the times of george the fourth interspersed with original letters from the late queen caroline and from various other distinguished persons tot ou tard tout se scait maintenon in vols london henry colburn that it's a woman who wrote it is evydent from the style of the writing as well as from certain proofs in the book itself most suttnly a femail wrote this dairy but who this dairy maid may be i in coarse can't conjecter and indeed common galliantry forbids me to ask i can only judge of the book itself which it appears to me is clearly trenching upon my ground and favrite subjicks viz fashnabble life as igsibited in the houses of the nobility gentry and rile fammly but i bare no mallis infamation is infamation and it doesn't matter where the infamy comes from and whether the dairy be from that distinguished pen to which it is ornarily attributed whether i say it comes from a lady of honor to the late quean or a scullion to that diffunct majisty no matter all we ask is nollidge never mind how we have it nollidge as our cook says is like trikel possit it's always good though you was to drink it out of an old shoo well then although this dairy is likely searusly to injur my pussonal intrests by fourstalling a deal of what i had to say in my private memoars though many many guineas is taken from my pockit by cuttin short the tail of my narratif though much that i had to say in souperior languidge greased with all the ellygance of my orytory the benefick of my classcle reading the chawms of my agreble wit is thus abruply brot befor the world by an inferior genus neither knowing nor writing english yet i say that nevertheless i must say what i am puffickly prepaired to say to gainsay which no man can say a word yet i say that i say i consider this publication welkom far from viewing it with enfy i greet it with applaws because it increases that most exlent specious of nollidge i mean fashnabble nollidge compayred to witch all other nollidge is nonsince a bag of goold to a pare of snuffers could lord broom on the canady question say moar or say what he had tu say better we are marters both of us to prinsple and every body who knows eather knows that we would sacrafice anythink rather than that fashion is the goddiss i adoar this delightful work is an offring on her srine and as sich all her wushippers are bound to hail it here is not a question of trumpry lords and honrabbles generals and barronites but the crown itself and the king and queen's actions witch may be considered as the crown jewels here's princes and grand dukes and airsparent and heaven knows what all with blood royal in their veins and their names mentioned in the very fust page of the peeridge in this book you become so intmate with the prince of wales that you may follow him if you please to his marridge bed or if you prefer the princiss charlotte you may have with her an hour's tator tator our estimable correspondent means we presume tete a tete o y now though most of the remarkable extrax from this book have been given already the cream of the dairy as i wittily say i shall trouble you nevertheless with a few partly because they can't be repeated too often and because the toan of obsyvation with which they have been genrally received by the press is not igsackly such as i think they merit how indeed can these common magaseen and newspaper pipple know anythink of fashnabble life let alone ryal conseaving then that the publication of the dairy has done reel good on this scoar and may probly do a deal moor i shall look through it for the porpus of selecting the most ellygant passidges and which i think may be peculiarly adapted to the reader's benefick for you see my dear mr yorke that in the fust place that this is no common catchpny book like that of most authors and authoresses who write for the base looker of gain heaven bless you the dairy maid is above anything musnary she is a woman of rank and no mistake and is as much above doin a common or vulgar action as i am superaor to taking beer after dinner with my cheese she proves that most satisfackarily as we see in the following passidge her royal highness came to me and having spoken a few phrases on different subjects produced all the papers she wishes to have published her whole correspondence with the prince relative to lady j 's dismissal his subsequent neglect of the princess and finally the acquittal of her supposed guilt signed by the duke of portland c at the time of the secret inquiry when if proof could have been brought against her it certainly would have been done and which acquittal to the disgrace of all parties concerned as well as to the justice of the nation in general was not made public at the time a common criminal is publicly condemned or acquitted her royal highness commanded me to have these letters published forthwith saying 'you may sell them for a great sum' at first for she had spoken to me before concerning this business i thought of availing myself of the opportunity but upon second thoughts i turned from this idea with detestation for if i do wrong by obeying her wishes and endeavoring to serve her i will do so at least from good and disinterested motives not from any sordid views the princess commands me and i will obey her whatever may be the issue but not for fare or fee i own i tremble not so much for myself as for the idea that she is not taking the best and most dignified way of having these papers published why make a secret of it at all if wrong it should not be done if right it should be done openly and in the face of her enemies in her royal highness's case as in that of wronged princes in general why do they shrink from straightforward dealings and rather have recourse to crooked policy i wish in this particular instance i could make her royal highness feel thus but she is naturally indignant at being falsely accused and will not condescend to an avowed explanation can anythink be more just and honrabble than this the dairy lady is quite fair and abovebored a clear stage says she and no favior i won't do behind my back what i am ashamed of before my face not i no more she does for you see that though she was offered this manyscrip by the princess for nothink though she knew that she could actially get for it a large sum of money she was above it like an honest noble grateful fashnabble woman as she was she aboars secrecy and never will have recors to disguise or crookid polacy this ought to be an ansure to them radicle sneerers who pretend that they are the equals of fashnabble pepple wheras it's a well known fact that the vulgar roagues have no notion of honor and after this positif declaration which reflex honor on her ladyship long life to her i've often waited behind her chair after this positif declaration that even for the porpus of defending her missis she was so hi minded as to refuse anythink like a peculiarly consideration it is actially asserted in the public prints by a booxeller that he has given her a thousand pound for the dairy a thousand pound nonsince it's a phigment a base lible this woman take a thousand pound in a matter where her dear mistriss friend and benyfactriss was concerned never a thousand baggonits would be more prefrabble to a woman of her xqizzit feelins and fashion but to proseed it's been objected to me when i wrote some of my expearunces in fashnabble life that my languidge was occasionally vulgar and not such as is genrally used in those exqizzit famlies which i frequent now i'll lay a wager that there is in this book wrote as all the world knows by a rele lady and speakin of kings and queens as if they were as common as sand boys there is in this book more wulgarity than ever i displayed more nastiness than ever i would dare to think on and more bad grammar than ever i wrote since i was a boy at school as for authografy evry genlmn has his own never mind spellin i say so long as the sence is right let me here quot a letter from a corryspondent of this charming lady of honor and a very nice corryspondent he is too without any mistake lady o poor lady o knows the rules of prudence i fear me as imperfectly as she doth those of the greek and latin grammars or she hath let her brother who is a sad swine become master of her secrets and then contrived to quarrel with him you would see the outline of the melange in the newspapers but not the report that mr s is about to publish a pamphlet as an addition to the harleian tracts setting forth the amatory adventures of his sister we shall break our necks in haste to buy it of course crying 'shameful' all the while and it is said that lady o is to be cut which i cannot entirely believe let her tell two or three old women about town that they are young and handsome and give some well timed parties and she may still keep the society which she hath been used to the times are not so hard as they once were when a woman could not construe magna charta with anything like impunity people were full as gallant many years ago but the days are gone by wherein my lord protector of the commonwealth of england was wont to go a lovemaking to mrs fleetwood with the bible under his arm and so miss jacky gordon is really clothed with a husband at last and miss laura manners left without a mate she and lord stair should marry and have children in mere revenge as to miss gordon she's a venus well suited for such a vulcan whom nothing but money and a title could have rendered tolerable even to a kitchen wench it is said that the matrimonial correspondence between this couple is to be published full of sad scandalous relations of which you may be sure scarcely a word is true in former times the duchess of st a s made use of these elegant epistles in order to intimidate lady johnstone but that ruse would not avail so in spite they are to be printed what a cargo of amiable creatures yet will some people scarcely believe in the existence of pandemonium tuesday morning you are perfectly right respecting the hot rooms here which we all cry out against and all find very comfortable much more so than the cold sands and bleak neighborhood of the sea which looks vastly well in one of vander velde's pictures hung upon crimson damask but hideous and shocking in reality h and his 'elle' talking of parties were last night at cholmondeley house but seem not to ripen in their love he is certainly good humored and i believe good hearted so deserves a good wife but his cara seems a genuine london miss made up of many affectations will she form a comfortable helpmate for me i like not her origin and deem many strange things to run in blood besides madness and the hanoverian evil thursday i verily do believe that i shall never get to the end of this small sheet of paper so many unheard of interruptions have i had and now i have been to vauxhall and caught the toothache i was of lady e b m and h 's party very dull the lady giving us all a supper after our promenade 'much ado was there god wot she would love but he would not' he ate a great deal of ice although he did not seem to require it and she 'faisoit les yeux doux' enough not only to have melted all the ice which he swallowed but his own hard heart into the bargain the thing will not do in the meantime miss long hath become quite cruel to wellesley pole and divides her favor equally between lords killeen and kilworth two as simple irishmen as ever gave birth to a bull i wish to hymen that she were fairly married for all this pother gives one a disgusting picture of human nature a disgusting pictur of human nature indeed and isn't he who moralizes about it and she to whom he writes a couple of pretty heads in the same piece which mr yorke is the wust the scandle or the scandle mongers see what it is to be a moral man of fashn fust he scrapes togither all the bad stoaries about all the people of his acquentance he goes to a ball and laffs or snears at everybody there he is asked to a dinner and brings away along with meat and wine to his heart's content a sour stomick filled with nasty stories of all the people present there he has such a squeamish appytite that all the world seems to disagree with him and what has he got to say to his delicate female frend why that fust mr s is going to publish indescent stoaries about lady o his sister which everybody's goin to by nex that miss gordon is going to be cloathed with an usband and that all their matrimonial corryspondins is to be published too that lord h is going to be married but there's some thing rong in his wife's blood miss long has cut mr wellesley and is gone after two irish lords wooden you phancy now that the author of such a letter instead of writin about pipple of tip top qualaty was describin vinegar yard would you beleave that the lady he was a ritin to was a chased modist lady of honor and mother of a famly o trumpery o morris as homer says this is a higeous pictur of manners such as i weap to think of as evry morl man must weap the above is one pritty pictur of mearly fashnabble life what follows is about families even higher situated than the most fashnabble here we have the princessregient her daughter the princess sharlot her grandmamma the old quean and her madjisty's daughters the two princesses if this is not high life i don't know where it is to be found and it's pleasing to see what affeckshn and harmny rains in such an exolted spear sunday th yesterday the princess went to meet the princess charlotte at kensington lady told me that when the latter arrived she rushed up to her mother and said 'for god's sake be civil to her' meaning the duchess of leeds who followed her lady said she felt sorry for the latter but when the princess of wales talked to her she soon became so free and easy that one could not have any feeling about her feelings princess charlotte i was told was looking handsome very pale but her head more becomingly dressed that is to say less dressed than usual her figure is of that full round shape which is now in its prime but she disfigures herself by wearing her bodice so short that she literally has no waist her feet are very pretty and so are her hands and arms and her ears and the shape of her head her countenance is expressive when she allows her passions to play upon it and i never saw any face with so little shade express so many powerful and varied emotions lady told me that the princess charlotte talked to her about her situation and said in a very quiet but determined way she would not bear it and that as soon as parliament met she intended to come to warwick house and remain there that she was also determined not to consider the duchess of leeds as her governess but only as her first lady she made many observations on other persons and subjects and appears to be very quick very penetrating but imperious and wilful there is a tone of romance too in her character which will only serve to mislead her she told her mother that there had been a great battle at windsor between the queen and the prince the former refusing to give up miss knight from her own person to attend on princess charlotte as sub governess but the prince regent had gone to windsor himself and insisted on her doing so and the 'old beguin' was forced to submit but has been ill ever since and sir henry halford declared it was a complete breaking up of her constitution to the great delight of the two princesses who were talking about this affair miss knight was the very person they wished to have they think they can do as they like with her it has been ordered that the princess charlotte should not see her mother alone for a single moment but the latter went into her room stuffed a pair of large shoes full of papers and having given them to her daughter she went home lady told me everything was written down and sent to mr brougham next day see what discord will creap even into the best regulated famlies here are six of 'em viz the quean and her two daughters her son and his wife and daughter and the manner in which they hate one another is a compleat puzzle his mother the prince hates his wife his daughter princess charlotte hates her father princess of wales hates her husband the old quean by their squobbles is on the pint of death and her two jewtiful daughters are delighted at the news what a happy fashnabble christian famly o mr yorke mr yorke if this is the way in the drawin rooms i'm quite content to live below in pease and charaty with all men writin as i am now in my pantry or els havin a quiet game at cards in the servants all with us there's no bitter wicked quarling of this sort we don't hate our children or bully our mothers or wish 'em ded when they're sick as this dairywoman says kings and queens do when we're writing to our friends or sweethearts we don't fill our letters with nasty stoaries takin away the carricter of our fellow servants as this maid of honor's amusin' moral frend does but in coarse it's not for us to judge of our betters these great people are a supeerur race and we can't comprehend their ways do you recklect it's twenty years ago now how a bewtiffle princess died in givin buth to a poar baby and how the whole nation of hengland wep as though it was one man over that sweet woman and child in which were sentered the hopes of every one of us and of which each was as proud as of his own wife or infnt do you recklect how pore fellows spent their last shillin to buy a black crape for their hats and clergymen cried in the pulpit and the whole country through was no better than a great dismal funeral do you recklet mr yorke who was the person that we all took on so about we called her the princis sharlot of wales and we valyoud a single drop of her blood more than the whole heartless body of her father well we looked up to her as a kind of saint or angle and blest god such foolish loyal english pipple as we ware in those days who had sent this sweet lady to rule over us but heaven bless you it was only souperstition she was no better than she should be as it turns out or at least the dairy maid says so no better if my daughters or yours was so bad we'd as leaf be dead ourselves and they hanged but listen to this pritty charritable story and a truce to reflexshuns sunday january yesterday according to appointment i went to princess charlotte found at warwick house the harp player dizzi was asked to remain and listen to his performance but was talked to during the whole time which completely prevented all possibility of listening to the music the duchess of leeds and her daughter were in the room but left it soon next arrived miss knight who remained all the time i was there princess charlotte was very gracious showed me all her bonny dyes as b would have called them pictures and cases and jewels c she talked in a very desultory way and it would be difficult to say of what she observed her mother was in very low spirits i asked her how she supposed she could be otherwise this questioning answer saves a great deal of trouble and serves two purposes ie avoids committing oneself or giving offence by silence there was hung in the apartment one portrait amongst others that very much resembled the duke of d i asked miss knight whom it represented she said that was not known it had been supposed a likeness of the pretender when young this answer suited my thoughts so comically i could have laughed if one ever did at courts anything but the contrary of what one was inclined to do princess charlotte has a very great variety of expression in her countenance a play of features and a force of muscle rarely seen in connection with such soft and shadeless coloring her hands and arms are beautiful but i think her figure is already gone and will soon be precisely like her mother's in short it is the very picture of her and not in miniature i could not help analyzing my own sensations during the time i was with her and thought more of them than i did of her why was i at all flattered at all more amused at all more supple to this young princess than to her who is only the same sort of person set in the shade of circumstances and of years it is that youth and the approach of power and the latent views of self interest sway the heart and dazzle the understanding if this is so with a heart not i trust corrupt and a head not particularly formed for interested calculations what effect must not the same causes produce on the generality of mankind in the course of the conversation the princess charlotte contrived to edge in a good deal of tum de dy and would if i had entered into the thing have gone on with it while looking at a little picture of herself which had about thirty or forty different dresses to put over it done on isinglass and which allowed the general coloring of the picture to be seen through its transparency it was i thought a pretty enough conceit though rather like dressing up a doll 'ah' said miss knight 'i am not content though madame for i yet should have liked one more dress that of the favorite sultana' 'no no' said the princess 'i never was a favorite and never can be one' looking at a picture which she said was her father's but which i do not believe was done for the regent any more than for me but represented a young man in a hussar's dress probably a former favorite the princess charlotte seemed much hurt at the little notice that was taken of her birthday after keeping me for two hours and a half she dismissed me and i am sure i could not say what she said except that it was an olio of decousus and heterogeneous things partaking of the characteristics of her mother grafted on a younger scion i dined tete a tete with my dear old aunt hers is always a sweet and soothing society to me there's a pleasing lady like moral extract for you an innocent young thing of fifteen has picturs of two lovers in her room and expex a good number more this dellygate young creature edges in a good deal of tumdedy i can't find it in johnson's dixonary and would have gone on with the thing ellygence of languidge if the dairy lady would have let her now to tell you the truth mr yorke i doan't beleave a single syllible of this story this lady of honner says in the fust place that the princess would have talked a good deal of tumdedy which means i suppose indeasnsy if she the lady of honner would have let her this is a good one why she lets every body else talk tumdedy to their hearts' content she lets her friends write tumdedy and after keeping it for a quarter of a sentry she prints it why then be so squeamish about hearing a little and then there's the stoary of the two portricks this woman has the honner to be received in the frendlyest manner by a british princess and what does the grateful loyal creature do picturs of the princess's relations are hanging in her room and the dairy woman swears away the poor young princess's carrickter by swearing they are picturs of her lovers for shame oh for shame you slanderin backbitin dairy woman you if you told all them things to your dear old aunt on going to dine with her you must have had very sweet and soothing society indeed i had marked out many more extrax which i intended to write about but i think i have said enough about this dairy in fack the butler and the gals in the servants' hall are not well pleased that i should go on reading this naughty book so we'll have no more of it only one passidge about pollytics witch is sertnly quite new no one was so likely to be able to defeat bonaparte as the crown prince from the intimate knowledge he possessed of his character bernadotte was also instigated against bonaparte by one who not only owed him a personal hatred but who possessed a mind equal to his and who gave the crown prince both information and advice how to act this was no less a person than madame de stael it was not as some have asserted that she was in love with bernadotte for at the time of their intimacy madame de stael was in love with rocca but she used her influence which was not small with the crown prince to make him fight against bonaparte and to her wisdom may be attributed much of the success which accompanied his attack upon him bernadotte has raised the flame of liberty which seems fortunately to blaze all around may it liberate europe and from the ashes of the laurel may olive branches spring up and overshadow the earth there's a discuvery that the overthrow of boneypart is owing to madame de stael what nonsince for colonel southey or doctor napier to write histories of the war with that capsican hupstart and murderer when here we have the whole affair explaned by the lady of honor sunday april the incidents which take place every hour are miraculous bonaparte is deposed but alive subdued but allowed to choose his place of residence the island of elba is the spot he has selected for his ignominious retreat france is holding forth repentant arms to her banished sovereign the poissardes who dragged louis xvi to the scaffold are presenting flowers to the emperor of russia the restorer of their legitimate king what a stupendous field for philosophy to expatiate in what an endless material for thought what humiliation to the pride of mere human greatness how are the mighty fallen of all that was great in napoleon what remains despoiled of his usurped power he sinks to insignificance there was no moral greatness in the man the meteor dazzled scorched is put out utterly and for ever but the power which rests in those who have delivered the nations from bondage is a power that is delegated to them from heaven and the manner in which they have used it is a guarantee for its continuance the duke of wellington has gained laurels unstained by any useless flow of blood he has done more than conquer others he has conquered himself and in the midst of the blaze and flush of victory surrounded by the homage of nations he has not been betrayed into the commission of any act of cruelty or wanton offence he was as cool and self possessed under the blaze and dazzle of fame as a common man would be under the shade of his garden tree or by the hearth of his home but the tyrant who kept europe in awe is now a pitiable object for scorn to point the finger of derision at and humanity shudders as it remembers the scourge with which this man's ambition was permitted to devastate every home tie and every heartfelt joy and now after this sublime passidge as full of awfle reflections and pious sentyments as those of mrs cole in the play i shall only quot one little extrak more all goes gloomily with the poor princess lady charlotte campbell told me she regrets not seeing all these curious personages but she says the more the princess is forsaken the more happy she is at having offered to attend her at this time this is very amiable in her and cannot fail to be gratifying to the princess so it is wery amiable wery kind and considerate in her indeed poor princess how lucky you was to find a frend who loved you for your own sake and when all the rest of the wuld turned its back kep steady to you as for believing that lady sharlot had any hand in this book heaven forbid she is all gratitude pure gratitude depend upon it she would not go for to blacken her old frend and patron's carrickter after having been so outrageously faithful to her she wouldn't do it at no price depend upon it how sorry she must be that others an't quite so squemish and show up in this indesent way the follies of her kind genrus foolish bennyfactris the authorized announcement in the john bull newspaper sets this question at rest it is declared that her ladyship is not the writer of the diary o y epistles to the literati ch s

brew and we love our own tap amen but the pint betwigst us is this stewpid absudd way of crying out because the public don't like it too why shood they my dear barnet you may vow that they are fools or that the critix are your enemies or that the wuld should judge your poams by your critticle rules and not their own you may beat your breast and vow you are a marter and you won't mend the matter take heart man you're not so misrabble after all your spirits need not be so very cast down you are not so very badly paid i'd lay a wager that you make with one thing or another plays novvles pamphlicks and little odd jobbs here and there your three thowsnd a year there's many a man dear bullwig that works for less and lives content why shouldn't you three thowsnd a year is no such bad thing let alone the barnetcy it must be a great comfort to have that bloody hand in your skitching but don't you sea that in a wuld naturally envius wickid and fond of a joak this very barnetcy these very cumplaints this ceaseless groning and moning and wining of yours is igsackly the thing which makes people laff and snear more if you were ever at a great school you must recklect who was the boy most bullid and buffited and purshewd he who minded it most he who could take a basting got but few he who rord and wep because the knotty boys called him nicknames was nicknamed wuss and wuss i recklect there was at our school in smithfield a chap of this milksop spoony sort who appeared among the romping ragged fellers in a fine flanning dressing gownd that his mama had given him that pore boy was beaten in a way that his dear ma and aunts didn't know him his fine flanning dressing gownd was torn all to ribbings and he got no pease in the school ever after but was abliged to be taken to some other saminary where i make no doubt he was paid off igsactly in the same way do you take the halligory my dear barnet mutayto nominy you know what i mean you are the boy and your barnetcy is the dressing gownd you dress yourself out finer than other chaps and they all begin to sault and hustle you it's human nature barnet you show weakness think of your dear ma mayhap and begin to cry it's all over with you the whole school is at you upper boys and under big and little the dirtiest little fag in the place will pipe out blaggerd names at you and takes his pewny tug at your tail the only way to avoid such consperracies is to put a pair of stowt shoalders forrards and bust through the crowd of raggymuffins a good bold fellow dubls his fistt and cries wha dares meddle wi' me when scott got his barnetcy for instans did any one of us cry out no by the laws he was our master and wo betide the chap that said neigh to him but there's barnets and barnets do you recklect that fine chapter in squintin durward about the too fellos and cups at the siege of the bishop's castle one of them was a brave warner and kep his cup they strangled the other chap strangled him and laffed at him too with respeck then to the barnetcy pint this is my advice brazen it out us littery men i take to be like a pack of schoolboys childish greedy envius holding by our friends and always ready to fight what must be a man's conduck among such he must either take no notis and pass on myjastick or else turn round and pummle soundly one two right and left ding dong over the face and eyes above all never acknowledge that he is hurt years ago for instans we've no ill blood but only mention this by way of igsample you began a sparring with this magaseen law bless you such a ridicklus gaym i never see a man so belaybord beflustered bewolloped was never known it was the laff of the whole town your intelackshal natur respected barnet is not fizzickly adapted so to speak for encounters of this sort you must not indulge in combats with us course bullies of the press you have not the staminy for a reglar set to what then is your plan in the midst of the mob to pass as quiet as you can you won't be undistubbed who is some stray kix and buffits will fall to you mortial man is subjick to such but if you begin to wins and cry out and set up for a marter wo betide you these remarks pusnal as i confess them to be are yet i assure you written in perfick good natur and have been inspired by your play of the sea capting and prefiz to it which latter is on matters intirely pusnal and will therefore i trust igscuse this kind of ad hominam as they say disk cushion i propose honrabble barnit to cumsider calmly this play and prephiz and to speak of both with that honisty which in the pantry or studdy i've been always phamous for let us in the first place listen to the opening of the preface of the fourth edition no one can be more sensible than i am of the many faults and deficiencies to be found in this play but perhaps when it is considered how very rarely it has happened in the history of our dramatic literature that good acting plays have been produced except by those who have either been actors themselves or formed their habits of literature almost of life behind the scenes i might have looked for a criticism more generous and less exacting and rigorous than that by which the attempts of an author accustomed to another class of composition have been received by a large proportion of the periodical press it is scarcely possible indeed that this play should not contain faults of two kinds first the faults of one who has necessarily much to learn in the mechanism of his art and secondly of one who having written largely in the narrative style of fiction may not unfrequently mistake the effects of a novel for the effects of a drama i may add to these perhaps the deficiencies that arise from uncertain health and broken spirits which render the author more susceptible than he might have been some years since to that spirit of depreciation and hostility which it has been his misfortune to excite amongst the general contributors to the periodical press for the consciousness that every endeavor will be made to cavil to distort to misrepresent and in fine if possible to run down will occasionally haunt even the hours of composition to check the inspiration and damp the ardor having confessed thus much frankly and fairly and with a hope that i may ultimately do better should i continue to write for the stage which nothing but an assurance that with all my defects i may yet bring some little aid to the drama at a time when any aid however humble ought to be welcome to the lovers of the art could induce me to do may i be permitted to say a few words as to some of the objections which have been made against this play now my dear sir look what a pretty number of please you put forrards here why your play shouldn't be good first good plays are almost always written by actors secknd you are a novice to the style of composition third you may be mistaken in your effects being a novelist by trade and not a play writer fourthly your in such bad helth and sperrits fifthly your so afraid of the critix that they damp your arder for shame for shame man what confeshns is these what painful pewling and piping your not a babby i take you to be some seven or eight and thutty years old in the morning of youth as the flosofer says don't let any such nonsince take your reazn prisoner what you an old hand amongst us an old soljer of our sovring quean the press you who have had the best pay have held the topmost rank ay and deserved them too i gif you lef to quot me in sasiaty and say i am a man of genius y ll wpl sh says so you to lose heart and cry pickavy and begin to howl because little boys fling stones at you fie man take courage and bearing the terrows of your blood red hand as the poet says punish us if we've ofended you punish us like a man or bear your own punishment like a man don't try to come off with such misrabble lodgic as that above what do you you give four satisfackary reazns that the play is bad the secknd is naught for your no such chicking at play writing this being the forth you show that the play must be bad and then begin to deal with the critix for finding folt was there ever wuss generalship the play is bad your right a wuss i never see or read but why kneed you say so if it was so very bad why publish it because you wish to serve the drama o fie don't lay that flattering function to your sole as milton observes do you believe that this sea capting can serve the drama did you never intend that it should serve anything or anybody else of cors you did you wrote it for money money from the maniger money from the bookseller for the same reason that i write this sir shakspeare wrote for the very same reasons and i never heard that he bragged about serving the drama away with this canting about great motifs let us not be too prowd my dear barnet and fansy ourselves marters of the truth marters or apostels we are but tradesmen working for bread and not for righteousness' sake let's try and work honestly but don't let us be prayting pompisly about our sacred calling the taylor who makes your coats and very well they are made too with the best of velvit collars i say stulze or nugee might cry out that their motifs were but to assert the eturnle truth of tayloring with just as much reazn and who would believe them well after this acknollitchmint that the play is bad come sefral pages of attack on the critix and the folt those gentry have found with it with these i shan't middle for the presnt you defend all the characters by and conclude your remarks as follows i must be pardoned for this disquisition on my own designs when every means is employed to misrepresent it becomes perhaps allowable to explain and if i do not think that my faults as a dramatic author are to be found in the study and delineation of character it is precisely because that is the point on which all my previous pursuits in literature and actual life would be most likely to preserve me from the errors i own elsewhere whether of misjudgment or inexperience i have now only to add my thanks to the actors for the zeal and talent with which they have embodied the characters entrusted to them the sweetness and grace with which miss faucit embellished the part of violet which though only a sketch is most necessary to the coloring and harmony of the play were perhaps the more pleasing to the audience from the generosity rare with actors which induced her to take a part so far inferior to her powers the applause which attends the performance of mrs warner and mr strickland attests their success in characters of unusual difficulty while the singular beauty and nobleness whether of conception or execution with which the greatest of living actors has elevated the part of norman so totally different from his ordinary range of character is a new proof of his versatility and accomplishment in all that belongs to his art it would be scarcely gracious to conclude these remarks without expressing my acknowledgment of that generous and indulgent sense of justice which forgetting all political differences in a literary arena has enabled me to appeal to approving audiences from hostile critics and it is this which alone encourages me to hope that sooner or later i may add to the dramatic literature of my country something that may find perhaps almost as many friends in the next age as it has been the fate of the author to find enemies in this see now what a good comfrabble vanaty is pepple have quarld with the dramatic characters of your play no says you if i am remarkabble for anythink it's for my study and delineation of character that is presizely the pint to which my littery purshuits have led me have you read jil blaw my dear sir have you pirouzed that exlent tragady the critic there's something so like this in sir fretful plaguy and the archbishop of granadiers that i'm blest if i can't laff till my sides ake think of the critix fixing on the very pint for which you are famus the roags and spose they had said the plot was absudd or the langwitch absudder still don't you think you would have had a word in defens of them too you who hope to find frends for your dramatic wux in the nex age poo i tell thee barnet that the nex age will be wiser and better than this and do you think that it will imply itself a reading of your trajadies this is misantrofy barnet reglar byronism and you ot to have a better apinian of human natur your apinion about the actors i shan't here meddle with they all acted exlently as far as my humbile judgement goes and your write in giving them all possible prays but let's consider the last sentence of the prefiz my dear barnet and see what a pretty set of apiniuns you lay down the critix are your inymies in this age in the nex however you hope to find newmrous frends and it's a satisfackshn to think that in spite of politticle diffrances you have found frendly aujences here now my dear barnet for a man who begins so humbly with what my friend father prout calls an argamantum ad misericorjam who ignowledges that his play is bad that his pore dear helth is bad and those cussid critix have played the juice with him i say for a man who beginns in such a humbill toan it's rather rich to see how you end my dear barnet do you suppose that politticle diffrances prejudice pepple against you what are your politix wig i presume so are mine ontry noo and what if they are wig or raddiccle or cumsuvvative does any mortial man in england care a phig for your politix do you think yourself such a mity man in parlymint that critix are to be angry with you and aujences to be cumsidered magnanamous because they treat you fairly there now was sherridn he who roat the rifles and school for scandle i saw the rifles after your play and o barnet if you knew what a relief it was there i say was sherridn he was a politticle character if you please he could make a spitch or two do you spose that pitt purseyvall castlerag old george the third himself wooden go to see the rivles ay and clap hands too and laff and ror for all sherry's wiggery do you spose the critix wouldn't applaud too for shame barnet what ninnis what hartless raskles you must beleave them to be in the fust plase to fancy that you are a politticle genus in the secknd to let your politix interfear with their notiums about littery merits put that nonsince out of your head as fox said to bonypart wasn't it that great genus dennis that wrote in swiff and poop's time who fansid that the french king wooden make pease unless dennis was delivered up to him upon my wud i doan't think he carrid his diddlusion much further than a serting honrabble barnet of my aquentance and then for the nex age respected sir this is another diddlusion a gross misteak on your part or my name is not y sh these plays immortial ah parrysampe as the french say this is too strong the small beer of the sea capting or of any suxessor of the sea capting to keep sweet for sentries and sentries barnet barnet do you know the natur of bear six weeks is not past and here your last casque is sour the public won't even now drink it and i lay a wager that betwigst this day the thuttieth november and the end of the year the barl will be off the stox altogether never never to return i've notted down a few frazes here and there which you will do well do igsamin norman the eternal flora woos to her odorous haunts the western wind while circling round and upwards from the boughs golden with fruits that lure the joyous birds melody like a happy soul released hangs in the air and from invisible plumes shakes sweetness down norman and these the lips where till this hour the sad and holy kiss of parting linger'd as the fragrance left by angels when they touch the earth and vanish norman hark she has blessed her son i bid ye witness ye listening heavens thou circumambient air the ocean sighs it back and with the murmur rustle the happy leaves all nature breathes aloud aloft to the great parent's ear the blessing of the mother on her child norman i dream of love enduring faith a heart mingled with mine a deathless heritage which i can take unsullied to the stars when the great father calls his children home norman the blue air breathless in the starry peace after long silence hushed as heaven but filled with happy thoughts as heaven with angels norman till one calm night when over earth and wave heaven looked its love from all its numberless stars norman those eyes the guiding stars by which i steered norman that great mother the only parent i have known whose face is bright with gazing ever on the stars the mother sea norman my bark shall be our home the stars that light the angel palaces of air our lamps norman a name that glitters like a star amidst the galaxy of england's loftiest born lady arundel and see him princeliest of the lion tribe whose swords and coronals gleam around the throne the guardian stars of the imperial isle the fust spissymen has been going the round of all the papers as real reglar poatry those wickid critix they must have been laffing in their sleafs when they quoted it malody suckling round and uppards from the bows like a happy soul released hangs in the air and from invizable plumes shakes sweetness down mighty fine truly but let mortial man tell the meannink of the passidge is it musickle sweetniss that malody shakes down from its plumes its wings that is or tail or some pekewliar scent that proceeds from happy souls released and which they shake down from the trees when they are suckling round and uppards is this poatry barnet lay your hand on your busm and speak out boldly is it poatry or sheer windy humbugg that sounds a little melojous and won't bear the commanest test of comman sence in passidge number the same bisniss is going on though in a more comprehensable way the air the leaves the otion are fild with emocean at capting norman's happiness pore nature is dragged in to partisapate in his joys just as she has been befor once in a poem this universle simfithy is very well but once is enuff my dear barnet and that once should be in some great suckmstans surely such as the meeting of adam and eve in paradice lost or jewpeter and jewno in hoamer where there seems as it were a reasn for it but sea captings should not be eternly spowting and invoking gods hevns starrs angels and other silestial influences we can all do it barnet nothing in life is esier i can compare my livry buttons to the stars or the clouds of my backopipe to the dark vollums that ishew from mount hetna or i can say that angels are looking down from them and the tobacco silf like a happy sole released is circling round and upwards and shaking sweetness down all this is as esy as drink but it's not poatry barnet nor natural people when their mothers reckonize them don't howl about the suckumambient air and paws to think of the happy leaves a rustling at least one mistrusts them if they do take another instans out of your own play capting norman with his eternil slack jaw meets the gal of his art look up look up my violet weeping fie and trembling too yet leaning on my breast in truth thou art too soft for such rude shelter look up i come to woo thee to the seas my sailor's bride hast thou no voice but blushes nay from those roses let me like the bee drag forth the secret sweetness violet oh what thoughts were kept for speech when we once more should meet now blotted from the page and all i feel is thou art with me very right miss violet the scentiment is natral affeckshnit pleasing simple it might have been in more grammaticle languidge and no harm done but never mind the feeling is pritty and i can fancy my dear barnet a pritty smiling weeping lass looking up in a man's face and saying it but the capting oh this capting this windy spouting captain with his prittinesses and conseated apollogies for the hardness of his busm and his old stale vapid simalies and his wishes to be a bee pish men don't make love in this finniking way it's the part of a sentymentle poeticle taylor not a galliant gentleman in command of one of her madjisty's vessels of war look at the remaining extrac honored barnet and acknollidge that capting norman is eturnly repeating himself with his endless jabber about stars and angels look at the neat grammaticle twist of lady arundel's spitch too who in the corse of three lines has made her son a prince a lion with a sword and coronal and a star why jumble and sheak up metafors in this way barnet one simily is quite enuff in the best of sentenses and i preshume i kneedn't tell you that it's as well to have it like when you are about it take my advise honrabble sir listen to a humble footmin it's genrally best in poatry to understand puffickly what you mean yourself and to ingspress your meaning clearly afterwoods in the simpler words the better praps you may for instans call a coronet a coronal an ancestral coronal p if you like as you might call a hat a swart sombrero a glossy four and nine a silken helm to storm impermeable and lightsome as the breezy gossamer but in the long run it's as well to call it a hat it is a hat and that name is quite as poetticle as another i think it's playto or els harrystottle who observes that what we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet confess now dear barnet don't you long to call it a polyanthus i never see a play more carelessly written in such a hurry you seem to have bean that you have actially in some sentences forgot to put in the sence what is this for instance this thrice precious one smiled to my eyes drew being from my breast slept in my arms the very tears i shed above my treasures were to men and angels alike such holy sweetness in the name of all the angels that ever you invoked raphael gabriel uriel zadkiel azrael what does this holy sweetness mean we're not spinxes to read such durk conandrums if you knew my state sins i came upon this passidg i've neither slep nor eton i've neglected my pantry i've been wandring from house to house with this riddl in my hand and nobody can understand it all mr frazier's men are wild looking gloomy at one another and asking what this may be all the cumtributors have been spoak to the doctor who knows every languitch has tried and giv'n up we've sent to docteur pettigruel who reads horyglifics a deal ezier than my way of spellin' no anser quick quick with a fifth edition honored barnet and set us at rest while your about it please too to igsplain the two last lines his merry bark with england's flag to crown her see what dellexy of igspreshn a flag to crown her his merry bark with england's flag to crown her fame for my hopes and woman in my cares likewise the following girl beware the love that trifles round the charms it gilds oft ruins while it shines igsplane this men and angels i've tried every way backards forards and in all sorts of

shines all which are as sensable as the fust passidge and with this i'll alow my friend smith who has been silent all this time to say a few words he has not written near so much as me being an infearor genus betwigst ourselves but he says he never had such mortial difficklty with anything as with the dixcripshn of the plott of your pease here his letter to ch rl s f tzr y pl nt g n t y ll wpl sh esq c c th nov my dear and honored sir i have the pleasure of laying before you the following description of the plot and a few remarks upon the style of the piece called the sea captain five and twenty years back a certain lord arundel had a daughter heiress of his estates and property a poor cousin sir maurice beevor being next in succession and a page arthur le mesnil by name the daughter took a fancy for the page and the young persons were married unknown to his lordship three days before her confinement thinking no doubt that period favorable for travelling the young couple had agreed to run away together and had reached a chapel near on the sea coast from which they were to embark when lord arundel abruptly put a stop to their proceedings by causing one gaussen a pirate to murder the page his daughter was carried back to arundel house and in three days gave birth to a son whether his lordship knew of this birth i cannot say the infant however was never acknowledged but carried by sir maurice beevor to a priest onslow by name who educated the lad and kept him for twelve years in profound ignorance of his birth the boy went by the name of norman lady arundel meanwhile married again again became a widow but had a second son who was the acknowledged heir and called lord ashdale old lord arundel died and her ladyship became countess in her own right when norman was about twelve years of age his mother who wished to waft young arthur to a distant land had him sent on board ship who should the captain of the ship be but gaussen who received a smart bribe from sir maurice beevor to kill the lad accordingly gaussen tied him to a plank and pitched him overboard about thirteen years after these circumstances violet an orphan niece of lady arundel's second husband came to pass a few weeks with her ladyship she had just come from a sea voyage and had been saved from a wicked algerine by an english sea captain this sea captain was no other than norman who had been picked up off his plank and fell in love with and was loved by miss violet a short time after violet's arrival at her aunt's the captain came to pay her a visit his ship anchoring off the coast near lady arundel's residence by a singular coincidence that rogue gaussen's ship anchored in the harbor too gaussen at once knew his man for he had tracked him after drowning him and he informed sir maurice beevor that young norman was alive sir maurice beevor informed her ladyship how should she get rid of him in this wise he was in love with violet let him marry her and be off for lord ashdale was in love with his cousin too and of course could not marry a young woman in her station of life you have a chaplain on board says her ladyship to captain norman let him attend to night in the ruined chapel marry violet and away with you to sea by this means she hoped to be quit of him forever but unfortunately the conversation had been overheard by beevor and reported to ashdale ashdale determined to be at the chapel and carry off violet as for beevor he sent gaussen to the chapel to kill both ashdale and norman thus there would only be lady arundel between him and the title norman in the meanwhile who had been walking near the chapel had just seen his worthy old friend the priest most barbarously murdered there sir maurice beevor had set gaussen upon him his reverence was coming with the papers concerning norman's birth which beevor wanted in order to extort money from the countess gaussen was however obliged to run before he got the papers and the clergyman had time before he died to tell norman the story and give him the documents with which norman sped off to the castle to have an interview with his mother he lays his white cloak and hat on the table and begs to be left alone with her ladyship lord ashdale who is in the room surlily quits it but going out cunningly puts on norman's cloak it will be dark says he down at the chapel violet won't know me and egad i'll run off with her norman has his interview her ladyship acknowledges him for she cannot help it but will not embrace him love him or have anything to do with him away he goes to the chapel his chaplain was there waiting to marry him to violet his boat was there to carry him on board his ship and violet was there too norman says she in the dark dear norman i knew you by your white cloak here i am and she and the man in a cloak go off to the inner chapel to be married there waits master gaussen he has seized the chaplain and the boat's crew and is just about to murder the man in the cloak when norman rushes in and cuts him down much to the surprise of miss for she never suspected it was sly ashdale who had come as we have seen disguised and very nearly paid for his masquerading ashdale is very grateful but when norman persists in marrying violet he says no he shan't he shall fight he is a coward if he doesn't fight norman flings down his sword and says he won't fight and lady arundel who has been at prayers all this time rushing in says hold this is your brother percy your elder brother here is some restiveness on ashdale's part but he finishes by embracing his brother norman burns all the papers vows he will never peach reconciles himself with his mother says he will go loser but having ordered his ship to veer round to the chapel orders it to veer back again for he will pass the honeymoon at arundel castle as you have been pleased to ask my opinion it strikes me that there are one or two very good notions in this plot but the author does not fail as he would modestly have us believe from ignorance of stage business he seems to know too much rather than too little about the stage to be too anxious to cram in effects incidents perplexities there is the perplexity concerning ashdale's murder and norman's murder and the priest's murder and the page's murder and gaussen's murder there is the perplexity about the papers and that about the hat and cloak a silly foolish obstacle which only tantalize the spectator and retard the march of the drama's action it is as if the author had said i must have a new incident in every act i must keep tickling the spectator perpetually and never let him off until the fall of the curtain the same disagreeable bustle and petty complication of intrigue you may remark in the author's drama of richelieu the lady of lyons was a much simpler and better wrought plot the incidents following each other either not too swiftly or startlingly in richelieu it always seemed to me as if one heard doors perpetually clapping and banging one was puzzled to follow the train of conversation in the midst of the perpetual small noises that distracted one right and left nor is the list of characters of the sea captain to be despised the outlines of all of them are good a mother for whom one feels a proper tragic mixture of hatred and pity a gallant single hearted son whom she disdains and who conquers her at last by his noble conduct a dashing haughty tybalt of a brother a wicked poor cousin a pretty maid and a fierce buccaneer these people might pass three hours very well on the stage and interest the audience hugely but the author fails in filling up the outlines his language is absurdly stilted frequently careless the reader or spectator hears a number of loud speeches but scarce a dozen lines that seem to belong of nature to the speakers nothing can be more fulsome or loathsome to my mind than the continual sham religious clap traps which the author has put into the mouth of his hero nothing more unsailor like than his namby pamby starlit descriptions which my ingenious colleague has i see alluded to thy faith my anchor and thine eyes my haven cries the gallant captain to his lady see how loosely the sentence is constructed like a thousand others in the book the captain is to cast anchor with the girl's faith in her own eyes either image might pass by itself but together like the quadrupeds of kilkenny they devour each other the captain tells his lieutenant to bid his bark veer round to a point in the harbor was ever such language my lady gives sir maurice a thousand pounds to waft him her son to some distant shore nonsense sheer nonsense and what is worse affected nonsense look at the comedy of the poor cousin there is a great deal of game on the estate partridges hares wild geese snipes and plovers smacking his lips besides a magnificent preserve of sparrows which i can sell to the little blackguards in the streets at a penny a hundred but i am very poor a very poor old knight is this wit or nature it is a kind of sham wit it reads as if it were wit but it is not what poor poor stuff about the little blackguard boys what flimsy ecstasies and silly smacking of lips about the plovers is this the man who writes for the next age o fie here is another joke sir maurice mice zounds how can i keep mice i can't afford it they were starved to death an age ago the last was found come christmas three years stretched beside a bone in that same larder so consumed and worn by pious fast 'twas awful to behold it i canonized its corpse in spirits of wine and set it in the porch a solemn warning to thieves and beggars is not this rare wit zounds how can i keep mice is well enough for a miser not too new or brilliant either but this miserable dilution of a thin joke this wretched hunting down of the poor mouse it is humiliating to think of a man of esprit harping so long on such a mean pitiful string a man who aspires to immortality too i doubt whether it is to be gained thus whether our author's words are not too loosely built to make starry pointing pyramids of horace clipped and squared his blocks more carefully before he laid the monument which imber edax or aquila impotens or fuga temporum might assail in vain even old ovid when he raised his stately shining heathen temple had placed some columns in it and hewn out a statue or two which deserved the immortality that he prophesied somewhat arrogantly for himself but let not all be looking forward to a future and fancying that incerti spatium dum finiat aevi our books are to be immortal alas the way to immortality is not so easy nor will our sea captain be permitted such an unconscionable cruise if all the immortalities were really to have their wish what a work would our descendants have to study them all not yet in my humble opinion has the honorable baronet achieved this deathless consummation there will come a day may it be long distant when the very best of his novels will be forgotten and it is reasonable to suppose that his dramas will pass out of existence some time or other in the lapse of the secula seculorum in the meantime my dear plush if you ask me what the great obstacle is towards the dramatic fame and merit of our friend i would say that it does not lie so much in hostile critics or feeble health as in a careless habit of writing and a peevish vanity which causes him to shut his eyes to his faults the question of original capacity i will not moot one may think very highly of the honorable baronet's talent without rating it quite so high as he seems disposed to do and to conclude as he has chosen to combat the critics in person the critics are surely justified in being allowed to address him directly with best compliments to mrs yellowplush i have the honor to be dear sir your most faithful and obliged humble servant john thomas smith and now smith having finisht his letter i think i can't do better than clothes mine lickwise
