a little dinner at timmins's by william makepeace thackeray i mr and mrs fitzroy timmins live in lilliput street that neat little street which runs at right angles with the park and brobdingnag gardens it is a very genteel neighborhood and i need not say they are of a good family especially mrs timmins as her mamma is always telling mr t they are suffolk people and distantly related to the right honorable the earl of bungay besides his house in lilliput street mr timmins has chambers in fig tree court temple and goes the northern circuit the other day when there was a slight difference about the payment of fees between the great parliamentary counsel and the solicitors stoke and pogers of great george street sent the papers of the lough foyle and lough corrib junction railway to mr fitzroy timmins who was so elated that he instantly purchased a couple of looking glasses for his drawing rooms the front room is by and the back a tight but elegant apartment ft by ft a coral for the baby two new dresses for mrs timmins and a little rosewood desk at the pantechnicon for which rosa had long been sighing with crumpled legs emerald green and gold morocco top and drawers all over mrs timmins is a very pretty poetess her lines to a faded tulip and her plaint of plinlimmon appeared in one of last year's keepsakes and fitzroy as he impressed a kiss on the snowy forehead of his bride pointed out to her in one of the innumerable pockets of the desk an elegant ruby tipped pen and six charming little gilt blank books marked my books which mrs fitzroy might fill he said he is an oxford man and very polite with the delightful productions of her muse besides these books there was pink paper paper with crimson edges lace paper all stamped with r f t rosa fitzroy timmins and the hand and battle axe the crest of the timminses and borne at ascalon by roaldus de timmins a crusader who is now buried in the temple church next to serjeant snooks and yellow pink light blue and other scented sealing waxes at the service of rosa when she chose to correspond with her friends rosa you may be sure jumped with joy at the sight of this sweet present called her charles his first name is samuel but they have sunk that the best of men embraced him a great number of times to the edification of her buttony little page who stood at the landing and as soon as he was gone to chambers took the new pen and a sweet sheet of paper and began to compose a poem what shall it be about was naturally her first thought what should be a young mother's first inspiration her child lay on the sofa asleep before her and she began in her neatest hand lines on my son bungay de bracy gashleigh tymmyns aged ten months tuesday how beautiful how beautiful thou seemest my boy my precious one my rosy babe kind angels hover round thee as thou dreamest soft lashes hide thy beauteous azure eye which gleamest gleamest thine eye which gleamest is that grammar thought rosa who had puzzled her little brains for some time with this absurd question when the baby woke then the cook came up to ask about dinner then mrs fundy slipped over from no they are opposite neighbors and made an acquaintance through mrs fundy's macaw and a thousand things happened finally there was no rhyme to babe except tippoo saib against whom major gashleigh rosa's grandfather had distinguished himself and so she gave up the little poem about her de bracy nevertheless when fitzroy returned from chambers to take a walk with his wife in the park as he peeped through the rich tapestry hanging which divided the two drawing rooms he found his dear girl still seated at the desk and writing writing away with her ruby pen as fast as it could scribble what a genius that child has he said why she is a second mrs norton and advanced smiling to peep over her shoulder and see what pretty thing rosa was composing it was not poetry though that she was writing and fitz read as follows lilliput street tuesday nd may mr and mr fitzroy tymmyns request the pleasure of sir thomas and lady kicklebury's company at dinner on wednesday at o'clock my dear exclaimed the barrister pulling a long face law fitzroy cried the beloved of his bosom how you do startle one give a dinner party with our means said he ain't you making a fortune you miser rosa said fifteen guineas a day is four thousand five hundred a year i've calculated it and so saying she rose and taking hold of his whiskers which are as fine as those of any man of his circuit she put her mouth close up against his and did something to his long face which quite changed the expression of it and which the little page heard outside the door our dining room won't hold ten he said we'll only ask twenty my love ten are sure to refuse in this season when everybody is giving parties look here is the list earl and countess of bungay and lady barbara saint mary's you are dying to get a lord into the house timmins said he had not altered his name in fig tree court yet and therefore i am not so affected as to call him tymmyns law my dear they are our cousins and must be asked rosa said let us put down my sister and tom crowder then blanche crowder is really so very fat fitzroy his wife said and our rooms are so very small fitz laughed you little rogue he said lady bungay weighs two of blanche even when she's not in the f fiddlesticks rose cried out doctor crowder really cannot be admitted he makes such a noise eating his soup that it is really quite disagreeable and she imitated the gurgling noise performed by the doctor while inhausting his soup in such a funny way that fitz saw inviting him was out of the question besides we mustn't have too many relations rosa went on mamma of course is coming she doesn't like to be asked in the evening and she'll bring her silver bread basket and her candlesticks which are very rich and handsome and you complain of blanche for being too stout groaned out timmins well well don't be in a pet said little rosa the girls won't come to dinner but will bring their music afterwards and she went on with the list sir thomas and lady kicklebury no saying no we must ask them charles they are rich people and any room in their house in brobdingnag gardens would swallow up our humble cot but to people in our position in society they will be glad enough to come the city people are glad to mix with the old families very good says fitz with a sad face of assent and mrs timmins went on reading her list mr and mrs topham sawyer belgravine place mrs sawyer hasn't asked you all the season she gives herself the airs of an empress and when one's member you know my dear one must have rosa replied with much dignity as if the presence of the representative of her native place would be a protection to her dinner and a note was written and transported by the page early next morning to the mansion of the sawyers in belgravine place the topham sawyers had just come down to breakfast mrs t in her large dust colored morning dress and madonna front she looks rather scraggy of a morning but i promise you her ringlets and figure will stun you of an evening and having read the note the following dialogue passed mrs topham sawyer well upon my word i don't know where things will end mr sawyer the timminses have asked us to dinner mr topham sawyer ask us to dinner what d impudence mrs topham sawyer the most dangerous and insolent revolutionary principles are abroad mr sawyer and i shall write and hint as much to these persons mr topham sawyer no d it joanna they are my constituents and we must go write a civil note and say we will come to their party he resumes the perusal of 'the times' and mrs topham sawyer writes my dear rosa we shall have great pleasure in joining your little party i do not reply in the third person as we are old friends you know and country neighbors i hope your mamma is well present my kindest remembrances to her and i hope we shall see much more of each other in the summer when we go down to the sawpits for going abroad is out of the question in these dreadful times with a hundred kisses to your dear little pet believe me your attached j t s she said pet because she did not know whether rosa's child was a girl or boy and mrs timmins was very much pleased with the kind and gracious nature of the reply to her invitation ii the next persons whom little mrs timmins was bent upon asking were mr and mrs john rowdy of the firm of stumpy rowdy and co of brobdingnag gardens of the prairie putney and of lombard street city mrs timinins and mrs rowdy had been brought up at the same school together and there was always a little rivalry between them from the day when they contended for the french prize at school to last week when each had a stall at the fancy fair for the benefit of the daughters of decayed muffin men and when mrs timmins danced against mrs rowdy in the scythe mazurka at the polish ball headed by mrs hugh slasher rowdy took twenty three pounds more than timmins in the muffin transaction for she had possession of a kettle holder worked by the hands of r y lty which brought crowds to her stall but in the mazurka rosa conquered she has the prettiest little foot possible which in a red boot and silver heel looked so lovely that even the chinese ambassador remarked it whereas mrs rowdy's foot is no trifle as lord cornbury acknowledged when it came down on his lordship's boot tip as they danced together amongst the scythes these people are ruining themselves said mrs john rowdy to her husband on receiving the pink note it was carried round by that rogue of a buttony page in the evening and he walked to brobdingnag gardens and in the park afterwards with a young lady who is kitchen maid at and who is not more than fourteen years older than little buttons these people are ruining themselves said mrs john to her husband rosa says she has asked the bungays bungays indeed timmins was always a tuft hunter said rowdy who had been at college with the barrister and who for his own part has no more objection to a lord than you or i have and adding hang him what business has he to be giving parties allowed mrs rowdy nevertheless to accept rosa's invitation when i go to business to morrow i will just have a look at mr fitz's account mr rowdy thought and if it is overdrawn as it usually is why the announcement of mrs rowdy's brougham here put an end to this agreeable train of thought and the banker and his lady stepped into it to join a snug little family party of two and twenty given by mr and mrs secondchop at their great house on the other side of the park rowdys bungays ourselves and mamma sawyers calculated little rosa general gulpin rosa continued eats a great deal and is very stupid but he looks well at table with his star and ribbon let us put him down and she noted down sir thomas and lady gulpin lord castlemouldy you will make your party abominably genteel and stupid groaned timmins why don't you ask some of our old friends old mrs portman has asked us twenty times i am sure within the last two years and the last time we went there there was pea soup for dinner mrs timmins said with a look of ineffable scorn nobody can have been kinder than the hodges have always been to us and some sort of return we might make i think return indeed a pretty sound it is on the staircase to hear 'mr and mrs 'odge and miss 'odges' pronounced by billiter who always leaves his h's out no no see attorneys at your chambers my dear but what could the poor creatures do in our society and so one by one timmins's old friends were tried and eliminated by mrs timmins just as if she had been an irish attorney general and they so many catholics on mr mitchel's jury mrs fitzroy insisted that the party should be of her very best company funnyman the great wit was asked because of his jokes and mrs butt on whom he practises and potter who is asked because everybody else asks him and mr ranville ranville of the foreign office who might give some news of the spanish squabble and botherby who has suddenly sprung up into note because he is intimate with the french revolution and visits ledru rollin and lamartine and these with a couple more who are amis de la maison made up the twenty whom mrs timmins thought she might safely invite to her little dinner but the deuce of it was that when the answers to the invitations came back everybody accepted here was a pretty quandary how they were to get twenty into their dining room was a calculation which poor timmins could not solve at all and he paced up and down the little room in dismay pooh said rosa with a laugh your sister blanche looked very well in one of my dresses last year and you know how stout she is we will find some means to accommodate them all depend upon it mrs john rowdy's note to dear rosa accepting the latter's invitation was a very gracious and kind one and mrs fitz showed it to her husband when he came back from chambers but there was another note which had arrived for him by this time from mr rowdy or rather from the firm and to the effect that mr f timmins had overdrawn his account l s d and was requested to pay that sum to his obedient servants stumpy rowdy and co and timmins did not like to tell his wife that the contending parties in the lough foyle and lough corrib railroad had come to a settlement and that the fifteen guineas a day had consequently determined i have had seven days of it though he thought and that will be enough to pay for the desk the dinner and the glasses and make all right with stumpy and rowdy iii the cards for dinner having been issued it became the duty of mrs timmins to make further arrangements respecting the invitations to the tea party which was to follow the more substantial meal these arrangements are difficult as any lady knows who is in the habit of entertaining her friends there are people who are offended if you ask them to tea whilst others have been asked to dinner people who are offended if you ask them to tea at all and cry out furiously good heavens jane my love why do these timminses suppose that i am to leave my dinner table to attend their soiree the dear reader may fill up the to any strength according to his liking or upon my word william my dear it is too much to ask us to pay twelve shillings for a brougham and to spend i don't know how much in gloves just to make our curtsies in mrs timmins's little drawing room mrs moser made the latter remark about the timmins affair while the former was uttered by mr grumpley barrister at law to his lady in gloucester place that there are people who are offended if you don't ask them at all is a point which i suppose nobody will question timmins's earliest friend in life was simmins whose wife and family have taken a cottage at mortlake for the season we can't ask them to come out of the country rosa said to her fitzroy between ourselves she was delighted that mrs simmins was out of the way and was as jealous of her as every well regulated woman should be of her husband's female friends we can't ask them to come so far for the evening why no certainly said fitzroy who has himself no very great opinion of a tea party and so the simminses were cut out of the list and what was the consequence the consequence was that simmins and timmins cut when they met at westminster that mrs simmins sent back all the books which she had borrowed from rosa with a withering note of thanks that rosa goes about saying that mrs simmins squints that mrs s on her side declares that rosa is crooked and behaved shamefully to captain hicks in marrying fitzroy over him though she was forced to do it by her mother and prefers the captain to her husband to this day if in a word these two men could be made to fight i believe their wives would not be displeased and the reason of all this misery rage and dissension lies in a poor little twopenny dinner party in lilliput street well the guests both for before and after meat having been asked old mrs gashleigh rosa's mother and by consequence fitzroy's dear mother in law though i promise you that dear is particularly sarcastic mrs gashleigh of course was sent for and came with miss eliza gashleigh who plays on the guitar and emily who limps a little but plays sweetly on the concertina they live close by trust them for that your mother in law is always within hearing thank our stars for the attention of the dear women the gashleighs i say live close by and came early on the morning after rosa's notes had been issued for the dinner when fitzroy who was in his little study which opens into his little dining room one of those absurd little rooms which ought to be called a gentleman's pantry and is scarcely bigger than a shower bath or a state cabin in a ship when fitzroy heard his mother in law's knock and her well known scuffling and chattering in the passage in which she squeezed up young buttons the page while she put questions to him regarding baby and the cook's health and whether she had taken what mrs gashleigh had sent overnight and the housemaid's health and whether mr timmins had gone to chambers or not and when after this preliminary chatter buttons flung open the door announcing mrs gashleigh and the young ladies fitzroy laid down his times newspaper with an expression that had best not be printed here and took his hat and walked away mrs gashleigh has never liked him since he left off calling her mamma and kissing her but he said he could not stand it any longer he was hanged if he would so he went away to chambers leaving the field clear to rosa mamma and the two dear girls or to one of them rather for before leaving the house he thought he would have a look at little fitzroy up stairs in the nursery and he found the child in the hands of his maternal aunt eliza who was holding him and pinching him as if he had been her guitar i suppose so that the little fellow bawled pitifully and his father finally quitted the premises no sooner was he gone although the party was still a fortnight off than the women pounced upon his little study and began to put it in order some of his papers they pushed up over the bookcase some they put behind the encyclopaedia some they crammed into the drawers where mrs gashleigh found three cigars which she pocketed and some letters over which she cast her eye and by fitz's return they had the room as neat as possible and the best glass and dessert service mustered on the study table it was a very neat and handsome service as you may be sure mrs gashleigh thought whose rich uncle had purchased it for the young couple at spode and copeland's but it was only for twelve persons it was agreed that it would be in all respects cheaper and better to purchase a dozen more dessert plates and with my silver basket in the centre mrs g said she is always bragging about that confounded bread basket we need not have any extra china dishes and the table will look very pretty on making a roll call of the glass it was calculated that at least a dozen or so tumblers four or five dozen wines eight water bottles and a proper quantity of ice plates were requisite and that as they would always be useful it would be best to purchase the articles immediately fitz tumbled over the basket containing them which stood in the hall as he came in from chambers and over the boy who had brought them and the little bill the women had had a long debate and something like a quarrel it must be owned over the bill of fare mrs gashleigh who had lived a great part of her life in devonshire and kept house in great state there was famous for making some dishes without which she thought no dinner could be perfect when she proposed her mock turtle and stewed pigeons and gooseberry cream rosa turned up her nose a pretty little nose it was by the way and with a natural turn in that direction mock turtle in june mamma said she it was good enough for your grandfather rosa the mamma replied it was good enough for the lord high admiral when he was at plymouth it was good enough for the first men in the county and relished by lord fortyskewer and lord rolls sir lawrence porker ate twice of it after exeter races and i think it might be good enough for i will not have it mamma said rosa with a stamp of her foot and mrs gashleigh knew what resolution there was in that once when she had tried to physic the baby there had been a similar fight between them so mrs gashleigh made out a carte in which the soup was left with a dash a melancholy vacuum and in which the pigeons were certainly thrust in among the entrees but rosa determined they never should make an entree at all into her dinner party but that she would have the dinner her own way when fitz returned then and after he had paid the little bill of l s d for the glass rosa flew to him with her sweetest smiles and the baby in her arms and after she had made him remark how the child grew every day more and more like him and after she had treated him to a number of compliments and caresses which it were positively fulsome to exhibit in public and after she had soothed him into good humor by her artless tenderness she began to speak to him about some little points which she had at heart she pointed out with a sigh how shabby the old curtains looked since the dear new glasses which her darling fitz had given her had been put up in the drawing room muslin curtains cost nothing and she must and would have them the muslin curtains were accorded she and fitz went and bought them at shoolbred's when you may be sure she treated herself likewise to a neat sweet pretty half mourning for the court you know is in mourning a neat sweet barege or calimanco or bombazine or tiffany or some such thing but madame camille of regent street made it up and rosa looked like an angel in it on the night of her little dinner and my sweet she continued after the curtains had been accorded mamma and i have been talking about the dinner she wants to make it very expensive which i cannot allow i have been thinking of a delightful and economical plan and you my sweetest fitz must put it into execution i have cooked a mutton chop when i was in chambers fitz said with a laugh am i to put on a cap and an apron no but you are to go to the 'megatherium club' where you wretch you are always going without my leave and you are to beg monsieur mirobolant your famous cook to send you one of his best aides de camp as i know he will and with his aid we can dress the dinner and the confectionery at home for almost nothing and we can show those purse proud topham sawyers and rowdys that the humble cottage can furnish forth an elegant entertainment as well as the gilded halls of wealth fitz agreed to speak to monsieur mirobolant if rosa had had a fancy for the cook of the prime minister i believe the deluded creature of a husband would have asked lord john for the loan of him iv fitzroy timmins whose taste for wine is remarkable for so young a man is a member of the committee of the megatherium club and the great mirobolant good natured as all great men are was only too happy to oblige him a young friend and protege of his of considerable merit m cavalcadour happened to be disengaged through the lamented death of lord hauncher with whom young cavalcadour had made his debut as an artist he had nothing to refuse to his master mirobolant and would impress himself to be useful to a gourmet so distinguished as monsieur timmins fitz went away as pleased as punch with this encomium of the great mirobolant and was one of those who voted against the decreasing of mirobolant's salary when the measure was proposed by mr parings colonel close and the screw party in the committee of the club faithful to the promise of his great master the youthful cavalcadour called in lilliput street the next day a rich crimson velvet waistcoat with buttons of blue glass and gold a variegated blue satin stock over which a graceful mosaic chain hung in glittering folds a white hat worn on one side of his long curling ringlets redolent with the most delightful hair oil one of those white hats which looks as if it had been just skinned and a pair of gloves not exactly of the color of beurre frais but of beurre that has been up the chimney with a natty cane with a gilt knob completed the upper part at any rate of the costume of the young fellow whom the page introduced to mrs timmins her mamma and she had been just having a dispute about the gooseberry cream when cavalcadour arrived his presence silenced mrs gashleigh and rosa in carrying on a conversation with him in the french language which she had acquired perfectly in an elegant finishing establishment in kensington square had a great advantage over her mother who could only pursue the dialogue with very much difficulty eying one or other interlocutor with an alarmed and suspicious look and gasping out we whenever she thought a proper opportunity arose for the use of that affirmative i have two leetl menus weez me said cavalcadour to mrs gashleigh minews yes oh indeed answered the lady two little cartes oh two carts oh we she said coming i suppose and she looked out of the window to see if they were there cavalcadour smiled he produced from a pocket book a pink paper and a blue paper on which he had written two bills of fare the last two which he had composed for the lamented hauncher and he handed these over to mrs fitzroy the poor little woman was dreadfully puzzled with these documents she has them in her possession still and began to read from the pink one as follows diner pour personnes potage clair a la rigodon do a la prince de tombuctou deux poissons saumon de severne rougets gratines a la boadicee a la cleopatre deux releves le chapeau a trois cornes farci a la robespierre le tire botte a l'odalisque six entrees saute de hannetons a l'epingliere cotelettes a la megatherium bourrasque de veau a la palsambleu laitances de carpe en goguette a la reine pomare turban de volaille a l'archeveque de cantorbery and so on with the entremets and hors d'oeuvres and the rotis and the releves madame will see that the dinners are quite simple said m cavalcadour oh quite said rosa dreadfully puzzled which would madame like which would we like mamma rosa asked adding as if after a little thought i think sir we should prefer the blue one at which mrs gashleigh nodded as knowingly as she could though pink or blue i defy anybody to know what these cooks mean by their jargon if you please madame we will go down below and examine the scene of operations monsieur cavalcadour said and so he was marshalled down the stairs to the kitchen which he didn't like to name and appeared before the cook in all his splendor he cast a rapid glance round the premises and a smile of something like contempt lighted up his features will you bring pen and ink if you please and i will write down a few of the articles which will be necessary for us we shall require if you please eight more stew pans a couple of braising pans eight saute pans six bainmarie pans a freezing pot with accessories and a few more articles of which i will inscribe the names and mr cavalcadour did so dashing down with the rapidity of genius a tremendous list of ironmongery goods which he handed over to mrs timmins she and her mamma were quite frightened by the awful catalogue i will call three days hence and superintend the progress of matters and we will make the stock for the soup the day before the dinner don't you think sir here interposed mrs gashleigh that one soup a fine rich mock turtle such as i have seen in the best houses in the west of england and such as the late lord fortyskewer you will get what is wanted for the soups if you please mr cavalcadour continued not heeding this interruption and as bold as a captain on his own quarter deck for the stock of clear soup you will get a leg of beef a leg of veal and a ham we munseer said the cook dropping a terrified curtsy a leg of beef a leg of veal and a ham you can't serve a leg of veal at a party said mrs gashleigh and a leg of beef is not a company dish madame they are to make the stock of the clear soup mr cavalcadour said what cried mrs gashleigh and the cook repeated his former expression never whilst i am in this house cried out mrs gashleigh indignantly never in a christian english household never shall such sinful waste be permitted by me if you wish me to dine rosa you must get a dinner less expensive the right honorable lord fortyskewer could dine sir without these wicked luxuries and i presume my daughter's guests can madame is perfectly at liberty to decide said m cavalcadour i came to oblige madame and my good friend mirobolant not myself thank you sir i think it will be too expensive rosa stammered in a great flutter but i am very much obliged to you il n'y a point d'obligation madame said monsieur alcide camille cavalcadour in his most superb manner and making a splendid bow to the lady of the house was respectfully conducted to the upper regions by little buttons leaving rosa frightened the cook amazed and silent and mrs gashleigh boiling with indignation against the dresser up to that moment mrs blowser the cook who had come out of devonshire with mrs gashleigh of course that lady garrisoned her daughter's house with servants and expected them to give her information of everything which took place there up to that moment i say the cook had been quite contented with that subterraneous station which she occupied in life and had a pride in keeping her kitchen neat bright and clean it was in her opinion the comfortablest room in the house we all thought so when we came down of a night to smoke there and the handsomest kitchen in lilliput street but after the visit of cavalcadour the cook became quite discontented and uneasy in her mind she talked in a melancholy manner over the area railings to the cooks at twenty three and twenty five she stepped over the way and conferred with the cook there she made inquiries at the baker's and at other places about the kitchens in the great houses in brobdingnag gardens and how many spits bangmarry pans and stoo pans they had she thought she could not do with an occasional help but must have a kitchen maid and she was often discovered by a gentleman of the police force who was i believe her cousin and occasionally visited her when mrs gashleigh was not in the house or spying it she was discovered seated with mrs rundell in her lap its leaves bespattered with her tears my pease be gone pelisse she said zins i zaw that ther franchman and it was all the faithful fellow could do to console her the dinner said timmins in a rage at last having it cooked in the house is out of the question the bother of it and the row your mother makes are enough to drive one mad it won't happen again i can promise you rosa order it at fubsby's at once you can have everything from fubsby's from footmen to saltspoons let's go and order it at fubsby's darling if you don't mind the expense and it will be any relief to you let us do as you wish rosa said and she put on her bonnet and they went off to the grand cook and confectioner of the brobdingnag quarter v on the arm of her fitzroy rosa went off to fubsby's that magnificent shop at the corner of parliament place and alicompayne square a shop into which the rogue had often cast a glance of approbation as he passed for there are not only the most wonderful and delicious cakes and confections in the window but at the counter there are almost sure to be three or four of the prettiest women in the whole of this world with little darling caps of the last french make with beautiful wavy hair and the neatest possible waists and aprons yes there they sit and others perhaps besides fitz have cast a sheep's eye through those enormous plate glass windowpanes i suppose it is the fact of perpetually living among such a quantity of good things that makes those young ladies so beautiful they come into the place let us say like ordinary people and gradually grow handsomer and handsomer until they grow out into the perfect angels you see it can't be otherwise if you and i my dear fellow were to have a course of that place we should become beautiful too they live in an atmosphere of the most delicious pine apples blanc manges creams some whipt and some so good that of course they don't want whipping jellies tipsy cakes cherry brandy one hundred thousand sweet and lovely things look at the preserved fruits look at the golden ginger the outspreading ananas the darling little rogues of china oranges ranged in the gleaming crystal cylinders mon dieu look at the strawberries in the leaves each of them is as large nearly as a lady's reticule and looks as if it had been brought up in a nursery to itself one of those strawberries is a meal for those young ladies behind the counter they nibble off a little from the side and if they are very hungry which can scarcely ever happen they are allowed to go to the crystal canisters and take out a rout cake or macaroon in the evening they sit and tell each other little riddles out of the bonbons and when they wish to amuse themselves they read the most delightful remarks in the french language about love and cupid and beauty before they place them inside the crackers they always are writing down good things into mr fubsby's ledgers it must be a perfect feast to read them talk of the garden of eden i believe it was nothing to mr fubsby's house and i have no doubt that after those young ladies have been there a certain time they get to such a pitch of loveliness at last that they become complete angels with wings sprouting out of their lovely shoulders when after giving just a preparatory balance or two they fly up to the counter and perch there for a minute hop down again and affectionately kiss the other young ladies and say good by dears we shall meet again la haut and then with a whir of their deliciously scented wings away they fly for good whisking over the trees of brobdingnag square and up into the sky as the policeman touches his hat it is up there that they invent the legends for the crackers and the wonderful riddles and remarks on the bonbons no mortal i am sure could write them i never saw a man in such a state as fitzroy timmins in the presence of those ravishing houris mrs fitz having explained that they required a dinner for twenty persons the chief young lady asked what mr and mrs fitz would like and named a thousand things each better than the other to all of which fitz instantly said yes the wretch was in such a state of infatuation that i believe if that lady had proposed to him a fricasseed elephant or a boa constrictor in jelly he would have said o yes certainly put it down that peri wrote down in her album a list of things which it would make your mouth water to listen to but she took it all quite calmly heaven bless you they don't care about things that are no delicacies to them but whatever she chose to write down fitzroy let her after the dinner and dessert were ordered at fubsby's they furnish everything dinner and dessert plate and china servants in your own livery and if you please guests of title too the married couple retreated from that shop of wonders rosa delighted that the trouble of the dinner was all off their hands but she was afraid it would be rather expensive nothing can be too expensive which pleases you dear fitz said by the way one of those young women was rather good looking rosa remarked the one in the cap with the blue ribbons and she cast about the shape of the cap in her mind and determined to have exactly such another think so i didn't observe said the miserable hypocrite by her side and when he had seen rosa home he went back like an infamous fiend to order something else which he had forgotten he said at fubsby's get out of that paradise you cowardly creeping vile serpent you until the day of the dinner the infatuated fop was always going to fubsby's he was remarked there he used to go before he went to chambers in the morning and sometimes on his return from the temple but the morning was the time which he preferred and one day when he went on one of his eternal pretexts and was chattering and flirting at the counter a lady who had been reading yesterday's paper and eating a halfpenny bun for an hour in the back shop if that paradise may be called a shop a lady stepped forward laid down the morning herald and confronted him that lady was mrs gashleigh from that day the miserable fitzroy was in her power and she resumed a sway over his house to shake off which had been the object of his life and the result of many battles and for a mere freak for on going into fubsby's a week afterwards he found the peris drinking tea out of blue cups and eating stale bread and butter when his absurd passion instantly vanished i say for a mere freak the most intolerable burden of his life was put on his shoulders again his mother in law on the day before the little dinner took place and i promise you we shall come to it in the very next chapter a tall and elegant middle aged gentleman who might have passed for an earl but that there was a slight incompleteness about his hands and feet the former being uncommonly red and the latter large and irregular was introduced to mrs timmins by the page who announced him as mr truncheon i'm truncheon ma'am he said with a low bow indeed said rosa about the dinner m'm from fubsby's m'm as you have no butler m'm i presume you will wish me to act as sich i shall bring two persons as haids to morrow both answers to the name of john i'd best if you please inspect the premisis and will think you to allow your young man to show me the pantry and kitching truncheon spoke in a low voice and with the deepest and most respectful melancholy there is not much expression in his eyes but from what there is you would fancy that he was oppressed by a secret sorrow rosa trembled as she surveyed this gentleman's size his splendid appearance and gravity i am sure she said i never shall dare to ask him to hand a glass of water even mrs gashleigh when she came on the morning of the actual dinner party to superintend matters was cowed and retreated from the kitchen before the calm majesty of truncheon and yet that great man was like all the truly great affable he put aside his coat and waistcoat both of evening cut and looking prematurely splendid as he walked the streets in noonday and did not disdain to rub the glasses and polish the decanters and to show young buttons the proper mode of preparing these articles for a dinner and while he operated the maids and buttons and cook when she could and what had she but the vegetables to boil crowded round him and listened with wonder as he talked of the great families as he had lived with that man as they saw him there before them had been cab boy to lord tantallan valet to the earl of bareacres and groom of the chambers to the duchess dowager of fitzbattleaxe oh it was delightful to hear mr truncheon vi on the great momentous stupendous day of the dinner my beloved female reader may imagine that fitzroy timmins was sent about his business at an early hour in the morning while the women began to make preparations to receive their guests there will be no need of your going to fubsby's mrs gashleigh said to him with a look that drove him out of doors everything that we require has been ordered there you will please to be back here at six o'clock and not sooner and i presume you will acquiesce in my arrangements about the wine o yes mamma said the prostrate son in law in so large a party a party beyond some folks means expensive wines are absurd the light sherry at s the champagne at s and you are not to go beyond s for the claret and port after dinner mind coffee will be served and you come up stairs after two rounds of the claret of course of course acquiesced the wretch and hurried out of the house to his chambers and to discharge the commissions with which the womankind had intrusted him as for mrs gashleigh you might have heard her bawling over the house the whole day long that admirable woman was everywhere in the kitchen until the arrival of truncheon before whom she would not retreat without a battle on the stairs in fitzroy's dressing room and in fitzroy minor's nursery to whom she gave a dose of her own composition while the nurse was sent out on a pretext to make purchases of garnish for the dishes to be served for the little dinner garnish for the dishes as if the folks at fubsby's could not garnish dishes better than gashleigh with her stupid old world devices of laurel leaves parsley and cut turnips why there was not a dish served that day that was not covered over with skewers on which truffles crayfish mushrooms and forced meat were impaled when old gashleigh went down with her barbarian bunches of holly and greens to stick about the meats even the cook saw their incongruity and at truncheon's orders flung the whole shrubbery into the dust house where while poking about the premises you may be sure mrs g saw it every candle which was to be burned that night including the tallow candle which she said was a good enough bed light for fitzroy she stuck into the candlesticks with her own hands giving her own high shouldered plated candlesticks of the year the place of honor she upset all poor rosa's floral arrangements turning the nosegays from one vase into the other without any pity and was never tired of beating and pushing and patting and whapping the curtain and sofa draperies into shape in the little drawing room in fitz's own apartments she revelled with peculiar pleasure it has been described how she had sacked his study and pushed away his papers some of which including three cigars and the commencement of an article for the law magazine lives of the sheriffs' officers he has never been able to find to this day mamma now went into the little room in the back regions which is fitz's dressing room and was destined to be a cloak room and here she rummaged to her heart's delight in an incredibly short space of time she examined all his outlying pockets drawers and letters she inspected his socks and handkerchiefs in the top drawers and on the dressing table his razors shaving strop and hair oil she carried off his silver topped scent bottle out of his dressing case and a half dozen of his favorite pills which fitz possesses in common with every well regulated man and probably administered them to her own family his boots glossy pumps and slippers she pushed into the shower bath where the poor fellow stepped into them the next morning in the midst of a pool in which they were lying the baby was found sucking his boot hooks the next day in the nursery and as for the bottle of varnish for his shoes which he generally paints upon the trees himself having a pretty taste in that way it could never be found to the present hour but it was remarked that the young master gashleighs when they came home for the holidays always wore lacquered highlows and the reader may draw his conclusions from that fact in the course of the day all the servants gave mrs timmins warning the cook said she coodn't abear it no longer 'aving mrs g always about her kitching with her fingers in all the saucepans mrs g had got her the place but she preferred one as mrs g didn't get for her the nurse said she was come to nuss master fitzroy and knew her duty his grandmamma wasn't his nuss and was always aggrawating her missus must shoot herself elsewhere the housemaid gave utterance to the same sentiments in language more violent little buttons bounced up to his mistress said he was butler of the family mrs g was always poking about his pantry and dam if he'd stand it at every moment rosa grew more and more bewildered the baby howled a great deal during the day his large china christening bowl was cracked by mrs gashleigh altering the flowers in it and pretending to be very cool whilst her hands shook with rage pray go on mamma rosa said with tears in her eyes should you like to break the chandelier ungrateful unnatural child bellowed the other only that i know you couldn't do without me i'd leave the house this minute as you wish said rosa but mrs g didn't wish and in this juncture truncheon arrived that officer surveyed the dining room laid the cloth there with admirable precision and neatness ranged the plate on the sideboard with graceful accuracy but objected to that old thing in the centre as he called mrs gashleigh's silver basket as cumbrous and useless for the table where they would want all the room they could get order was not restored to the house nor indeed any decent progress made until this great man came but where there was a revolt before and a general disposition to strike work and to yell out defiance against mrs gashleigh who was sitting bewildered and furious in the drawing room where there was before commotion at the appearance of the master spirit all was peace and unanimity the cook went back to her pans the housemaid busied herself with the china and glass cleaning some articles and breaking others buttons sprang up and down the stairs obedient to the orders of his chief and all things went well and in their season at six the man with the wine came from binney and latham's at a quarter past six timmins himself arrived at half past six he might have been heard shouting out for his varnished boots but we know where those had been hidden and for his dressing things but mrs gashleigh had put them away as in his vain inquiries for these articles he stood shouting nurse buttons rosa my dear and the most fearful execrations up and down the stairs mr truncheon came out on him egscuse me sir says he but it's impawsable we can't dine twenty at that table not if you set 'em out awinder we can't what's to be done asked fitzroy in an agony they've all said they'd come can't do it said the other with two top and bottom and your table is as narrow as a bench we can't hold more than heighteen and then each person's helbows will be into his neighbor's cheer rosa mrs gashleigh cried out timmins come down and speak to this gentl this truncheon sir said the man the women descended from the drawing room look and see ladies he said inducting them into the dining room there's the room there's the table laid for heighteen and i defy you to squeege in more one person in a party always fails said mrs gashleigh getting alarmed that's nineteen mr truncheon remarked we must knock another hoff ma'm and he looked her hard in the face mrs gashleigh was very red and nervous and paced or rather squeezed round the table it was as much as she could do the chairs could not be put any closer than they were it was impossible unless the convive sat as a centre piece in the middle to put another guest at that table look at that lady movin' round sir you see now the difficklty if my men wasn't thinner they couldn't hoperate at all mr truncheon observed who seemed to have a spite to mrs gashleigh what is to be done she said with purple accents my dearest mamma rosa cried out you must stop at home how sorry i am and she shot one glance at fitzroy who shot another at the great truncheon who held down his eyes we could manage with heighteen he said mildly mrs gashleigh gave a hideous laugh she went away at eight o'clock she was pacing at the corner of the street and actually saw the company arrive first came the topham sawyers in their light blue carriage with the white hammercloth and blue and white ribbons their footmen drove the house down with the knocking then followed the ponderous and snuff colored vehicle with faded gilt wheels and brass earl's coronets all over it the conveyance of the house of bungay the countess of bungay and daughter stepped out of the carriage the fourteenth earl of bungay couldn't come sir thomas and lady gulpin's fly made its appearance from which issued the general with his star and lady gulpin in yellow satin the rowdys' brougham followed next after which mrs butt's handsome equipage drove up the two friends of the house young gentlemen from the temple now arrived in cab no we tossed up in fact which should pay the fare mr ranville ranville walked and was dusting his boots as the templars drove up lord castlemouldy came out of a twopenny omnibus funnyman the wag came last whirling up rapidly in a hansom just as mrs gashleigh with rage in her heart was counting that two people had failed and that there were only seventeen after all mr truncheon passed our names to mr billiter who bawled them out on the stairs rosa was smiling in a pink dress and looking as fresh as an angel and received her company with that grace which has always characterized her the moment of the dinner arrived old lady bungay scuffled off on the arm of fitzroy while the rear was brought up by rosa and lord castlemouldy of ballyshanvanvoght castle co tipperary some fellows who had the luck took down ladies to dinner i was not sorry to be out of the way of mrs rowdy with her dandified airs or of that high and mighty county princess mrs topham sawyer vii of course it does not become the present writer who has partaken of the best entertainment which his friends could supply to make fun of their somewhat ostentatious as it must be confessed hospitality if they gave a dinner beyond their means it is no business of mine i hate a man who goes and eats a friend's meat and then blabs the secrets of the mahogany such a man deserves never to be asked to dinner again and though at the close of a london season that seems no great loss and you sicken of a whitebait as you would of a whale yet we must always remember that there's another season coming and hold our tongues for the present as for describing then the mere victuals on timmins's table that would be absurd everybody i mean of the genteel world of course of which i make no doubt the reader is a polite ornament everybody has the same everything in london you see the same coats the same dinners the same boiled fowls and mutton the same cutlets fish and cucumbers the same lumps of wenham lake ice c the waiters with white neck cloths are as like each other everywhere as the peas which they hand round with the ducks of the second course can't any one invent anything new the only difference between timmins's dinner and his neighbor's was that he had hired as we have said the greater part of the plate and that his cowardly conscience magnified faults and disasters of which no one else probably took heed but rosa thought from the supercilious air with which mrs topham sawyer was eying the plate and other arrangements that she was remarking the difference of the ciphers on the forks and spoons which had in fact been borrowed from every one of fitzroy's friends i know for instance that he had my six among others and only returned five along with a battered old black pronged plated abomination which i have no doubt belongs to mrs gashleigh whom i hereby request to send back mine in exchange their guilty consciences i say made them fancy that every one was spying out their domestic deficiencies whereas it is probable that nobody present thought of their failings at all people never do they never see holes in their neighbors' coats they are too indolent simple and charitable some things however one could not help remarking for instance though fitz is my closest friend yet could i avoid seeing and being amused by his perplexity and his dismal efforts to be facetious his eye wandered all round the little room with quick uneasy glances very different from those frank and jovial looks with which he is accustomed to welcome you to a leg of mutton and rosa from the other end of the table and over the flowers entree dishes and wine coolers telegraphed him with signals of corresponding alarm poor devils why did they ever go beyond that leg of mutton funnyman was not brilliant in conversation scarcely opening his mouth except for the purposes of feasting the fact is our friend tom dawson was at table who knew all his stories and in his presence the greatest wag is always silent and uneasy fitz has a very pretty wit of his own and a good reputation on circuit but he is timid before great people and indeed the presence of that awful lady bungay on his right hand was enough to damp him she was in court mourning for the late prince of schlippenschloppen she had on a large black funereal turban and appurtenances and a vast breastplate of twinkling twiddling black bugles no wonder a man could not be gay in talking to her mrs rowdy and mrs topham sawyer love each other as women do who have the same receiving nights and ask the same society they were only separated by ranville ranville who tries to be well with both and they talked at each other across him topham and rowdy growled out a conversation about rum ireland and the navigation laws quite unfit for print sawyer never speaks three words without mentioning the house and the speaker the irish peer said nothing which was a comfort but he ate and drank of everything which came in his way and cut his usual absurd figure in dyed whiskers and a yellow under waistcoat general gulpin sported his star and looked fat and florid but melancholy his wife ordered away his dinner just like honest sancho's physician at barataria botherby's stories about lamartine are as old as the hills since the barricades of and he could not get in a word or cut the slightest figure and as for tom dawson he was carrying on an undertoned small talk with lady barbara st mary's so that there was not much conversation worth record going on within the dining room outside it was different those houses in lilliput street are so uncommonly compact that you can hear everything which takes place all over the tenement and so in the awful pauses of the banquet and the hall door being furthermore open we had the benefit of hearing the cook and the occasional cook below stairs exchanging rapid phrases regarding the dinner the smash of the soup tureen and swift descent of the kitchen maid and soup ladle down the stairs to the lower regions this accident created a laugh and rather amused fitzroy and the company and caused funnyman to say bowing to rosa that she was mistress of herself though china fall but she did not heed him for at that moment another noise commenced namely that of the baby in the upper rooms who commenced a series of piercing yells which though stopped by the sudden clapping to of the nursery door were only more dreadful to the mother when suppressed she would have given a guinea to go up stairs and have done with the whole entertainment a thundering knock came at the door very early after the dessert and the poor soul took a speedy opportunity of summoning the ladies to depart though you may be sure it was only old mrs gashleigh who had come with her daughters of course the first person to come i saw her red gown whisking up the stairs which were covered with plates and dishes over which she trampled instead of having any quiet after the retreat of the ladies the house was kept in a rattle and the glasses jingled on the table as the flymen and coachmen plied the knocker and the soiree came in from my place i could see everything the guests as they arrived i remarked very few carriages mostly cabs and flies and a little crowd of blackguard boys and children who were formed round the door and gave ironical cheers to the folks as they stepped out of their vehicles as for the evening party if a crowd in the dog days is pleasant poor mrs timmins certainly had a successful soiree you could hardly move on the stair mrs sternhold broke in the banisters and nearly fell through there was such a noise and chatter you could not hear the singing of the miss gashleighs which was no great loss lady bungay could hardly get to her carriage being entangled with colonel wedgewood in the passage an absurd attempt was made to get up a dance of some kind but before mrs crowder had got round the room the hanging lamp in the dining room below was stove in and fell with a crash on the table now prepared for refreshment why in fact did the timminses give that party at all it was quite beyond their means they have offended a score of their old friends and pleased none of their acquaintances so angry were many who were not asked that poor rosa says she must now give a couple more parties and take in those not previously invited and i know for a fact that fubsby's bill is not yet paid nor binney and latham's the wine merchants that the breakage and hire of glass and china cost ever so much money that every true friend of timmins has cried out against his absurd extravagance and that now when every one is going out of town fitz has hardly money to pay his circuit much more to take rosa to a watering place as he wished and promised as for mrs gashleigh the only feasible plan of economy which she can suggest is that she could come and live with her daughter and son in law and that they should keep house together if he agrees to this she has a little sum at the banker's with which she would not mind easing his present difficulties and the poor wretch is so utterly bewildered and crestfallen that it is very likely he will become her victim the topham sawyers when they go down into the country will represent fitz as a ruined man and reckless prodigal his uncle the attorney from whom he has expectations will most likely withdraw his business and adopt some other member of his family blanche crowder for instance whose husband the doctor has had high words with poor fitzroy already of course at the women's instigation and all these accumulated miseries fall upon the unfortunate wretch because he was good natured and his wife would have a little dinner
