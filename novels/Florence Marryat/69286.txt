hampstead mystery chapter i once for all exclaimed mr crampton bringing down his broad fist heavily upon the table once for all i tell you i will not have it at this terrible assertion mrs crampton shivered as if she had been struck and aunt clem silently dissolved into tears henry hindes of all the party alone preserved his composure he leaned back in his chair carefully trimming his filbert nails with a penknife as if the affair under discussion were not of the slightest moment of course you will not have it he said after a pause to mr crampton no man in his senses would mr frederick walcheren has money and good looks but there his claims to admiration end the first you do not require for your daughter and the second would have no weight with anyone but a woman to place against these supposed advantages mr walcheren is a young man of dissolute habits and lavish expenditure you should hear what his cousin philip walcheren says of him i want no ones opinion but my own replied mr crampton vehemently jenny will have all my money byandby and she shall marry no man that will make ducks and drakes of it besides he isnt good enough for her in any way he thinks i suppose because his family have been a set of idle scoundrels for centuries past while my progenitors have been working to support their children that his is the better of the two but i dont see it besides if he were the heir to the crown he shouldnt have my daughter hes a roman thats more than enough for me ill have no papists in my family i hate the whole crew with their cunning underhand ways if jenny wont give this walcheren fellow over ill lock her up on bread and water till she comes to her senses again as neither of the ladies made any answer to this threat mr hindes interfered again surely he said with an incredulous smile miss crampton will not dream of opposing your wishes in this particular when so much depends upon her obedience what can she see in this young man to attract her above others of his kind she who has a crowd of admirers wherever she goes and is the acknowledged beauty of hampstead i believe crampton that you are alarming yourself without cause miss crampton means nothing serious she is merely amusing herself with the sight of young walcherens infatuation for her its more than that returned the older man ive forbidden the girl to dance with him when she meets him out or to receive him here during my absence and now her mother tells me she met them riding together yesterday afternoon and has intercepted a letter from him to jenny in which he writes as though they were promised to each other what am i to do i cant be always at my daughters elbow and her mother cant go galloping all over the country after her it is disgraceful to think that a young lady of twenty cant be trusted to behave herself properly as soon as she is out of her parents sight dont you think you are making rather a mountain out of a molehill inquired henry hindes in the same calm way doubtless miss crampton is young and thoughtless and if i may venture to say soperhaps just a wee bit spoilt but is that any reason that you should suspect her of impropriety and after all is there anything wrong or unusual in a lovely girl being followed and persecuted by her admirers perhaps if the truth were known miss crampton might be as well pleased to get rid of mr walcheren as you would be at this juncture mrs crampton took heart of grace to put in her oar oh thank you dear mr hindes she exclaimed i am sure you are right that is i feel certain that jenny cares no more for mr walcheren than for anyone else she is a trifle wilful and does not brook contradiction welli acknowledge thatand perhaps papa and i have spoilt her a little she is such a darling you know that it is very difficult not to spoil herbut she would never really oppose our wishes papa has only to speak to her nonsense interposed mr crampton gruffly i have spoken to her a dozen times already and she laughs in my face and disobeys me as soon as my back is turned but this business has gone far enough and i mean to put a stop to it where is the girl he continued turning to his wife go and tell her i wish to speak to her at once my dear she has not risen yet i do not suppose she is awake and it is past eleven said her husband yes but remember how late she was up last night i dont think we were home till past two oclock whilst she was dancing with this young jackanapes i conclude and letting him make eyes at her well it is for the last time i can tell miss jenny that if she disobeys me again ill take her right away from hampstead and she shall never see it till the fellows dead or married no papistical grandchildren for me i can tell her that oh mr crampton cried his wife with affected horror yes it is oh mr crampton repeated the old man angrily mimicking her thin tones and itll be oh mrs crampton if you dont take care its more than half your fault you should look better after your daughter and then these unpleasantries wouldnt happen but you let her have her own way in everything she just rules you and miss bostock and then you leave me to rectify your errors it isnt fair on either me or the child mrs crampton and her sister miss bostock familiarly known as aunt clem were now weeping in concert i am sure sobbed the mother ive done everything in my power short of turning mr walcheren out of doors to prevent his calling here so often because i knew you didnt wish it john last time he came i would not order up tea until jenny made such a point of it that i could not refuse and when the dear child rides or drives you know it is impossible for me to supervise her actions you should go with her grumbled her husband oh dear i wouldnt sit behind those cobs of hers for all the world it frightens me to see her drive them and she wont come out in the barouche with aunt clem and me she laughs at the very idea she is so very highspirited you see she must have her own way in everything well go and fetch her here said mr crampton shortly i must speak to her before i go to town but if she is not dressed my dear remonstrated his wife tell her to dress at once and come to me now no nonsense or ill pull her out of bed myself the two women flew from the room to prevent so awful a contingency and the men were left alone they were partners in the wellknown firm of messrs hindes crampton woolstaplers in the city henry hindes although much the younger of the two was head of the business having inherited his share through the death of his father he was a man of about five or seven and thirty smooth and solid looking but much more polished in manners and appearance than his partner his fair thin hair was parted in the middle and combed close to his head he possessed a powerful brain and a good knowledge of business his blue eyes straight thick nose and smiling mouth gave him a benevolent and cordial look which made him a favourite in society he was always perfectly dressed and was proud of his white hands and filbert nails people who wished to do business with the firm always preferred to see the senior partner to the junior because the former was so suave and courteous and the latter so rough and curt but mr crampton was the tendererhearted man of the two though he did not show it so much his private pursestrings were always open to help a disabled workman or to head a subscription for the widows and orphans of those who were removed by death he was a man of strong views however and a somewhat obstinate temperament and this business of his daughter and mr frederick walcheren had disturbed him very much a scotchman by birth and brought up as a nonconformist he had a righteous horror of popery and everything connected with it on this account alone he had from the first discountenanced the acquaintanceship of mr walcheren with his family and to find that his daughter had in express opposition to his wishes made an intimate friend of the young man wounded him in his tenderest point he sat very gloomy and silent after his wife and sisterinlaw had left the room and mr hindes tried his utmost to make him regard the matter in a more hopeful light for years he had been as intimate in the domestic circle of the crampton family as he was with his partner in the city and was regarded as their nearest friend by them all this is a matter that only requires a few words of explanation to set it right crampton he remarked so its no use looking so black about it you must allow that you and your wife have rather given miss jenny her own way and naturally she clings to it but she loves you both too much to wilfully oppose you i hope so i hope so replied the old man but spoilt children are not always the most grateful hindes i trust that jenny may listen as you say to reason but i would rather appeal to the young man himself perhaps if he knew that we will never give our consent to her marrying a papist he might see the advisability of giving up the pursuit i will speak to him if you empower me to do so said hindes eagerly he is sure to be at the bouchers dance tonight i did not intend to go but i believe hannah wishes to do so and the opportunity will be an excellent one particularly if miss crampton is to be there and carries out your prohibition with respect to dancing with him he will sulk and sit out and i shall be able to give him a hint as to your disapproval of his suit do so hindes and i shall be exceedingly obliged to you replied mr crampton and if that fails we must take jenny away for by hook or by crook i am determined to shake that young fellow off hannah is going with the little ones to broadstairs next week what do you say to miss crampton accompanying her you know how fond my wife is of your daughter and she would watch over her like a mother at all events it is worth thinking of it would be a capital plan said mr crampton but why are you going because it is time one of us was at the office my dear fellow and since you are about to speak to your daughter on this subject it is just as well i should be out of the way i shall see you later in the afternoon but dont hurry on my account and i shall not forget to speak to mr walcheren this evening i shall not spare him i promise you but lay it on as thick as i know how and if he doesnt like it he must do the other thing by the way i know the cousin philip walcheren as well as their mutual director father tasker so if the young man wont hear reason i will appeal to them there is one convenience about these papists you can generally wield them through their directors yes the silly fools said crampton contemptuously theyre afraid to say their lives are their own if the priests say theyre not pooh call them men theyre more like a flock of silly sheep who run baaing after their shepherd in that case replied mr hindes smiling im afraid mr frederick walcheren must be one of the lost sheep for from all i hear he does not trouble the church nor the director of his conscience much but ill do my level best to bring him to hear reason in this instance au revoir and with a nod and a smile he was gone hes a true friend thought mr crampton to himself as he took up the times and tried to possess his soul in patience until the appearance of his daughter meanwhile mrs crampton and miss bostock were making their way timidly towards the young ladys bedroom in the antechamber they encountered her maid employed in sewing is miss crampton awake yet ellen demanded her mother oh no maam i havent heard a sound of her and she begged me particularly not to call her till she rung she was terrible tired she said and didnt wish to be disturbed im sorry ellen but im afraid i must wake her now its past eleven and her papa particularly wishes to see her before he leaves for the city replied mrs crampton oh dear im sure i dont know what shell say remarked the maid as she reapplied herself to her work and looked as if she was glad the task had not fallen to her the two ladies entered the adjoining bedroom on tiptoe and as if they feared the result of the least noise it was one of the most perfectlyarranged chambers a young girl could desire and it was preevident that its furnishings had been selected with the greatest care and for someone who was much loved and treasured the walls and chintzes were all of palest pink the woodwork of white enamel and the hangings of lace on the walls were hung a selection of photographs chiefly of dogs and horses for miss cramptons tastes ran in that line and the low walnutwood bookcase was filled with the best authors everywhere were signs of profusion and luxury for the cramptons were rich and spared no expense for this one beloved child who made all the joy of their lives the toilet table was covered with silver and cut glass and on the mantelpiece stood a handsome clock and candelabras of sevres china but the fairest sight in all the room was jenny crampton herself as she lay flushed dishevelled and palpitating on her bed one of the most beautiful specimens of work that ever proceeded from the creators hand it was difficult to believe that the two plain women who stood gazing at her from the foot of the bed could be her nearest blood relations the questions of hereditary resemblances and nonresemblances are amongst the most anomalous in nature whence did jenny crampton inherit her perfect features and colouring her father was a type of the average middleclass englishman he had a broadset muscular figure with legs too short for his size a florid complexion with thick bushy eyebrows a heavy nose and a long upper lip his small grey eyes were shrewd but honest and benevolentlooking and his hands and feet were large and coarse his wife and her sister might have stood with a little caricaturing for the frenchmans notion of an english mees mrs crampton had the shapelier and more matured figure of the two and her soft brown eyes attenuated nose and weak drooping mouth might once have been styled pretty but they both possessed the same tall flat frames with sloping shoulders long hands and feet and limp lustreless hair in what enchanted moment then had such progenitors given life to such a lovely creature as lay asleep upon the bed before them her rounded dimpled arms were thrown restlessly above her head for it was summer weather and were half hidden by the mass of light chestnut hair that strayed over her pillow her tints were those of a maidenblush rose from her neck and shoulders to her flushed cheeks her skin was of one uniform texture of a pale cream just touched with pink her lips were slightly parted as she slept and showed the row of white teeth within the lashes of her eyes lay thick and long upon her cheeks and those eyes when open formed perhaps the very chief of her attractions they were long limpid eyes of a light hazel colour and with the startled expression in them of a deer or a child eyes which made strangers think that jenny crampton was one of the most innocent of gods creatures upon earth but which changed considerably in expression when jennys wishes were in any way crossed or her requests disregarded from the time when she was a lovely little child the only one they had ever kept since its earliest infancy mr and mrs crampton had learned to dread the clouding over of those beautiful orbs and the pouting of those pretty lips it was in their power to gratify every wish of their child and so they gratified themselves at the same time by avoiding anything so distressing to them as her tears everyone had combined to spoil jenny crampton from her babyhood and by this time the young lady was pretty well beyond all control the father acceded to her every request however unreasonable or extravagant and the mother and aunt only lived to worship her even poor aunt clem who was the standing butt for jennys ridicule or the mark for her illhumour considered herself well repaid for all her patience and endurance if the spoilt beauty gave her an occasional hasty kiss or rather peck on her cheek or her cap or wherever it might chance to fall or honoured her by a request to tie her sash or do a commission for her this was the sort of education the poor girl had received to enable her to face the rebuffs of the world but though her bringingup had been very faulty there was no mistake about her beauty far or near all round hampstead and its environs there was not a girl who could vie in good looks with old cramptons daughter and as her father was known to be a very wealthy man jenny had more admirers than she could count on her ten fingers but of them all none had really appealed to her senses but frederick walcheren the cramptons and aunt clem had a tough time before them how lovely she is sighed miss bostock as an intuition of their presence even through her dreams made jenny turn restlessly and throw herself into another becoming attitude on the other side of the bed yes indeed clem but im afraid i must rouse her whispered mrs crampton papa is really vexed about this business and if she doesnt see him at once i fear he may be more so jenny my darling she continued going round to the girls side and laying her hand gently on her shoulder jenny dear love wake up theres a dear papa wants to see you before he goes into the city eh what said the girl drowsily as she turned away its not time to get up yet im so sleepy but jenny love try and rouse yourself repeated her mother rather tremblingly your father wants you dear he wont keep you long you need only put on a teagown and can come back and finish your toilet afterwards come jenny make an effort love for papa wont be denied the girl opened her big hazel eyes then and stared stupidly at her aunt and mother you here mamma she ejaculated and aunt clem what on earth is the matter is the house on fire no no dear of course not but papa wants to speak to you for a minute before he leaves home then he must wait till he comes back replied jenny as she closed her eyes again for im a great deal too sleepy to see anyone go away do mamma and leave me alone its a shame to go waking me in this way when you know i was dancing up to three oclock this morning i know darling i know said mrs crampton almost weeping and i wouldnt have done it for the world only papa insisted on it and you know what he is when hes set on having his way jenny my dear do try and rouse yourself a little for papa says if you dont go down and see him he will come up here and pull you out of bed himself at this intelligence miss crampton did see fit to open her eyes a little wider and sit up in bed perhaps her conscience warned her what this unusual severity on the part of her father might portend but she looked exceedingly cross as she did so i never heard such nonsense in all my life she exclaimed what can he have to say to me that will not keep till dinner time i cant be down for half an hour at anyrate so papa must wait my pleasure wheres ellen she must come and help me dress my goodness me aunt clem she broke off suddenly as she caught sight of that ladys sympathetic features regarding her wistfully from the foot of the bed dont stand there goggling at me like a stork on one leg or youll drive me out of my senses go and call ellen do if im to see papa someone must dress me i dont suppose he wants me to walk downstairs in my nightdress though he is in such a hurry no no love of course not returned her mother hastily clem call ellen and tell her jenny is going to get up now darling what can i do to help you nothing replied her daughter peevishly unless you will give papa a dose of morphia to keep him quiet till i can dress myself what is all this mystery about why cant you say why the old gentleman is so desirous of my company this morning he is not in the habit of dragging me out of bed after a ball at this unearthly hour it is nearly twelve oclock my dear said mrs crampton evasively what of that i ordered my trap to be round at four this afternoon and told ellen particularly that she was not to come near me till i rang you know the bouchers dance is on tonight and a nice figure i shall look at it if i do not have my sleep out first well dear replied her mother soothingly you can come to bed again if you think fit in the afternoon you know i wouldnt have disturbed you for all the world but gentlemen are not always so considerate and your father insisted upon my doing so so what could i say whats the row about repeated jenny as her maid began to brush out and twist up her superabundant hair but mrs crampton was too discreet to say all she knew before a servant oh its nothing particular my love and your father had best tell you himself you neednt be afraid he loves you too dearly ever to scold you whatever you may do or say oh im not afraid of the old man rejoined the young lady only hed better not go too far with me i can guess what all the fuss is about mamma and ive got a will of my own as well as he has if papa is going to lecture me about mr now dear dont mention any names interposed mrs crampton quickly for it may only lead to mischief your papa must tell you his own business and im sure youll do all in your power to fall in with his wishes im not so sure of that replied the young lady with a moue here ellen give me my blue teagown my hair will do very well for i shall most likely be in bed again in half an hour go down whilst im with mr crampton and fetch me some chocolate and a piece of toast and let it be ready when i come back now mamma well go and beard the old lion in his den chapter ii jenny looked if possible lovelier than usual as she tripped downstairs beside her mother and her aunt her face was still flushed from sleep and her hair had been twisted up anyhow whilst the pale blue gown she wore accorded well with her roseleaf complexion mrs crampton and miss bostock accompanied her in trembling dread of the coming encounter but the girl herself was perfectly confident and fearless as they reached the door of the library where her father awaited her she caught sight of aunt clems visage and burst out laughing oh dear she cried aunt clem if you dont put on some other kind of face youll kill me when you assume that lugubrious expression you look so like a cow that i always expect to hear you low dearest child that is not kind remarked her mother with mild reproof oh never mind it doesnt signify i am sure dear jenny doesnt mean it interposed aunt clem who had nevertheless winced under the sarcasm i did mean it though cried jenny boldly one would think i was going to be hanged to see your long faces well papa she continued as they entered the presence of mr crampton and what may you have to say to me this morning youll have to pay for dragging me out of my bed in this outrageous manner you know and i shant be pacified until you buy me that little arab mare of mr winchers is it a bargain she looked so saucy and so pretty as she said this and perched herself on her fathers knee that mr crampton in his pride and affection was very nearly granting her request without further protest but the remembrance of the popish admirer intruded itself just in time to prevent the folly nevertheless he kissed his daughters blooming cheek and said if you will be a good girl and do exactly as i tell you you shall have a dozen arab mares if they will please you jenny all right old gentleman thats a bargain now for the conditions but we must speak seriously my dear for i am quite in earnest in this matter you have been encouraging a young man to come about here jenny of whose acquaintanceship you know i do not approvei mean mr frederick walcheren now i must have a stop put to it at once he never comes here again nor will i allow you to meet him out of the house unless it should be by accident nor to dance with him if you do meet him i hope you understand me plainly i will not permit you to know any of the walcherens from this time forward you must entirely drop them nor shall your mother ask them to my house and i shall never remove this prohibition from younever anything more asked jenny shortly a close observer might have seen and interpreted the change in her countenance as she listened to her fathers mandate into the light hazel eyes had crept a much darker shade and the full lips had pouted till they had become sullen but all she said was anything more i do not know that as your father i am in any way called upon to give you my reasons my dear but since you seem to ask for them i will you appear to me to have shown a marked preference for mr frederick walcherens society and as it would be impossible for you to marry him it is best the affair should be put an end to at once he has plenty of money argued the young lady i am aware of that and the uses he has hitherto put his money to he is a gambler and a loose liver but that is not the chief objection to him in my eyes his vices might be reformed but not his religion young creatures like yourself do not think of such things but the walcherens are all roman catholics and that fact puts an insuperable barrier between them and us i would never under any circumstances give my consent to your marriage with a papist i would rather see you in your grave jenny and i cannot say more than that if you have entertained any such idea you must dismiss it from your mind at once and in order that there may be no fear of such a thingin order to secure your happiness and safety i insist upon your giving up the acquaintanceship of this young man altogether you must not ask him to the house again and if he calls your mother will order the servant to say that she is not at home if you meet him out you have my strict commands not to dance with him or to talk more than the merest politeness necessitates if notwithstanding these precautions i find mr walcheren is obstinately bent on thrusting himself where he is not welcome i shall take the law into my own hands by carrying you away from hampstead to some place where it is impossible you can meet him dont think me harsh jenny for god knows that is the last thing i wish to be towards you but i have spoken to you on this subject several times before and i find you have taken no heed so you force me to speak more plainly do you quite understand me now yes i understand said the girl sullenly and you promise obedience how can i do otherwise than obey she broke out passionately the house is yours and you can do as you choose with it and those who enter it and frederick walcheren is not a man to thrust his company where it is not wanted all these accusations you bring against himwhat authority have you for them he is to be condemned unheard and his religion is brought against him as a crime if that is what you call christian id rather be a jew any day the tone she had adopted made the old man angry he was devotedly fond and proud of her but he had an obstinate temper and would not brook opposition to his wishes now now thats enough he answered my word is law here and i will stand no arguments about the matter i dont approve of the manthat is sufficient neither shall my daughter know him as for condemning him unheard that is all rubbish hindes knows his character as well as i do he says oh then it is to mr hindes i owe this unpleasant interview cried jenny what business has he to poke his nose into my affairs hes always meddling in some way or another mr hindes made you sell my beautiful hunter because he said it was not safe for me to ride and mr hindes prevented my accepting lady makewells invitation to the castle on account of some absurd rumours he had heard of her former life but if mr hindes thinks he is to be the judge of all my actions and the ruler of my destinies he is very much mistaken and so i will let him know before he is many days older i wont have any man interfering with me in this way and turning my own parents against me dont be a fool exclaimed mr crampton roughly hindes is the best friend you havethat any of us haveand it would be a bad day for the firm and the family that saw our interests divided i mentioned him as an authority for the sort of life mr frederick walcheren lives but far from setting me against you he has stood up for your good sense and filial obedience all through the discussion of this unfortunate affair it is i aloneyour fatherwho has come to the conclusion to cut mr walcherens acquaintance and now i demand your obedience to my commands once and for all your implicit obedience do you promise it me i have no alternative said jenny all the same i must have your promise given here before your mother and your aunt very well then i promise replied the girl after a pause that is all i require said the old man and now i suppose i can go about my business but remember if i ever catch you trying to outwit me by any dd subterfuges i will take you away from hampstead and you shall never see it again whilst that man is in it he turned then as if to leave the room but perceiving that both his wife and her sister were in tears he thought he might have spoken too harshly to this child whom he so dearly loved and came back again for a moment kiss me jenny he said im not angry with you my girl though i may have seemed so but its your happiness i have at heart and not my own there there with a sounding kiss on her cheek you wont fret about the matter will you and well ride over together to winchers tomorrow and secure the little mare youve set your heart on god bless you my dear and with another kiss he left them to themselves jenny stood for a minute silent and motionless then walked quickly towards the door as if to return to her own room jenny my darling pleaded her mother you see the force of your dear fathers argument dont you she went towards the girl as she spoke and would have wound her arms about her but jenny pushed her impatiently aside dont bother me mamma she said you know how i hate a fuss all this worry is mostly your fault you might have prevented it if you had chosen oh jenny my dear how why do you suppose i dont know it has come of some repetition of yours or aunt clems how should papa who is all day in the city and never goes with us anywhere in the evenings have heard that i danced more with fred walcheren than any other man unless you had told him and i think it is beastly mean of you too why cant i have my pleasure the same as other girls i conclude you and papa made love enough to each other when you were young and yet you grudge me a choice in the matter im only to dance and talk and be agreeable with such people as you select for me its bitterly unfair oh no darling dont say that your dear father is only desirous of one thing to promote your welfare and mr walcheren is very wild jenny he would not make you a good husband everybody says so and so my happiness is to be sacrificed because everybody chooses to tell lies of the man i like and papa and you choose to believe them well i shant forget it in a hurry i can tell you mamma and now please let me go to my room in peace i suppose i may claim a right to so much indulgence of my own wishes my dear girl when have any of your wishes been ungratified unless they were likely to prove hurtful to yourself we should take a knife away from a baby my darling however much it cried for it for fear it should cut itself thank you for comparing me to a baby mamma but i think you will find i am not quite such a child as you imagine anyway i am woman enough to wish to be left alone to think over this matter by myself and without waiting for an answer jenny ran up the staircase and locked herself into her bedroom the two ladies downstairs were left in a very uncomfortable condition i hope remarked mrs crampton to her sister i hope dear papa did not go too far in what he said jenny is so highspirited and quicktempered that she might be tempted to do something wilful just because she was crossed and if she dances with mr walcheren at the bouchers tonight i dont know what her papa will say oh she would never dare to do so surely replied aunt clem she would never fly in johns face in that manner she is a little fond of her own way sometimes i admit but she has a good heart poor darling and says far more than she means and john is right emma mr walcheren is a very wild young man and it would never do for our jenny to marry him of course john is right acquiesced the wife but i wish jenny could see it in the same light however i will take care not to let her out of my sight this evening and then it will be impossible for mr walcheren to get speech of her without my overhearing what he may say meanwhile jenny having reached the sanctuary of her own room drank off her chocolate hastily and dismissed her maid who was in attendance is my bath ready ellen she inquired that is right well you can go now and i will ring when i am ready to dress tell brunell that i will have the ralli cart at one before luncheon miss said the maid at one oclock sharp and dont go out of the way i shall want you in ten minutes she turned the key of her door on the inside as the maid disappeared and sitting down before her writingtable drew out pen and paper and commenced to write a letter which ran as follows darlingthere has been a row here this morning and papa has forbidden me ever to speak to you again what are we to do i shall be at the bouchers tonight without fail i must not dance with you but if you will be in the picture gallery after the fourth dance i will contrive to speak to you oh fred where is all this going to end they shall never make me give you up if you remain of the same mind but open communication with you seems almost impossible i cant write any more my head and my heart are both in a whirl ever your loving jenny she sealed this letter and directed it to frederick walcheren esq nevern mansions earls court london and placed it on one side her next concern was to see in what condition this unpleasant excitement had left her but she found no reason to complain the exercise of her temper had made her cheeks rosier and lent an extra brightness to her eyes she was glad of thisglad that she had not given way to the weakness of tears and swelled up her eyelids and made her face look puffy she might meet frederick during her drive he spent most of his spare time in wandering about hampstead in the hopes of meeting her but she seldom drove out until the afternoon still there was just the chance of a rencontre with her lover and for that chance jenny would have taken more trouble than this when she came downstairs again an hour later dressed in a tailormade suit of light fawn tweed with her jaunty little felt hat on her head and her hands in white doeskin drivinggloves holding a handsome ivoryhandled whip few people would have guessed the state of excitement she was still in she looked so fresh and lovely and smiling in the hall she encountered her mother who had heard the wheels of the ralli cart draw up to the door out so early my darling mrs crampton said kindly where are you going to for a drive answered the girl curtly but doesnt it look a little like rain continued her mother timidly for she was half afraid of her idol particularly when the idol was put out i dont care if it does replied jenny in the same tone im not made of sugar but take an umbrella darling said her mother anxiously and let brunell hold it over you if it should be wet but miss crampton rejected all her suggestions with scorn if it thunders and lightens and i get wet through and go into a consumption so much the better she exclaimed impatiently you and papa between you have contrived to make me so supremely miserable that i dont care what happens to me in fact the sooner im dead the better and ive a good mind to take a dose of prussic acid and end it at once this is a very usual threat of selfish and illtempered people particularly if they have loving and anxious hearts to deal with to mrs crampton to whom the girl was everything in the world jennys words seem full of bitter portent oh my darling my darling she exclaimed in a voice of the deepest concern dont say such terrible things even in jest for heavens sake you will break my heart jenny and your poor father would go mad if he heard you speak in such an awful way why we would cut off our right hands to save you a moments trouble yes it looks like it doesnt it said the young lady sarcastically my dearest dont discuss the subject again wait a little and you will see it perhaps in a different light my head aches so jenny i am not fit to argue it with you and you have been upset as well go for a nice drive and the fresh air will make your head clearer but be careful my love and dont do anything rash im half afraid of those cobs jenny theyre so fresh and spirited oh youre afraid of everything replied her daughter in a tone of contempt and as for aunt clem shes alarmed at her own shadow i was never brought up to horses and dogs as you have been dear said miss bostock who was standing near no nor to anything i should think replied her niece as she prepared to get into her ralli cart i often think you and mamma must have been born and reared on a desert island you seem so utterly ignorant of the things most people do with which miss crampton gently touched her steeds with the lash of her whip and they went prancing down the drive as if they intended to bolt whilst her mother and aunt held their breath with anxiety lest the wilful driver should come to any harm jenny drove at a smart pace through the principal ways of hampstead whilst the pedestrians whom she passed said to each other there goes the beautiful miss crampton and she overheard some of their remarks and flushed with pleasure at the notice she excited for this young ladys besetting sin was an inordinate vanity of her personal attractions which she had cultivated to the exclusion of all the christian graces she was a specimen of that most odious of all modern innovations the fast girl of the nineteenth century and she was vulgar in consequence for all fast women are vulgar and obnoxious in the eyes of everybody but their male admirers for when will men be ever sensible enough to separate the value of personal beauty and mental charm not while they have eyes to see once touch their senses and for the time their infatuation lasts you cannot convince them but that the mind and soul of their goddess equal her body in charm frederick walcheren was infatuated with the beauty of this girl and he believed her disposition to be all that was good and lovable as well it appeared so to him for whenever they met jenny was in her best temper and ready to be pleased with everything had he even seen her as she had been on the present occasion rude and impertinent to her parents cruelly sarcastic to her meek and unoffending aunt and obstinately resolved upon having her own way he would still have taken her part declared her to be a suffering angel and her father and mother most unjust and tyrannical towards her shakespeare never wrote a greater truism than when he made rosalind declare that love is a madness a madness that blinds our vision distorts our judgment and makes all things not only apparently but actually different from what they are when the rosecoloured spectacles have been torn by circumstance from our eyes and we wonder we could ever have been such egregious fools as to think that they were otherwise miss crampton then with her heart on fire and her soul up in arms stopped at the first pillarbox she passed and bade brunell post the letter which she gave him the letter she had written in her bedroom and which she knew would reach town before mr walcheren left it to meet her at the house of their mutual friends the bouchers and as she flew over the highway one sentence kept revolving itself over and over in her mind and the burden of it was i will never give him up i will never give him up chapter iii when miss cramptons letter reached the hands of mr frederick walcheren it was by the four oclock post and that gentleman was lying on a couch in his apartments in nevern mansions he was a handsome man of about thirty with dark eyes and hair and classical features set in a pale clear complexion he was clean shorn except for a small soft moustache and the possessor of a tall lithe figure he had an ample fortune having inherited about two thousand a year from an old catholic godfather who died when frederick was quite an infant and who had expressed a wish in his will that his godson and heir should enter the church or at all events benefit the church by founding some religious institution at his own death with the fortune he left in his charge but the old gentleman could hardly have chosen a worse guardian of his property no embargo had been laid on the young man spending his money as he chose and his choice was to spend it on himself and the companions whom he delighted to honour his little flat in earls court was only a pied terre his home may have been said to exist at epsom goodwood newmarket or any one of the other racecourses in england he was also to be met periodically at monte carlo or paris occasionally he would take a fancy to run over to new york or san francisco but wherever he pitched his tent one might be sure there were plenty of opportunities for gambling and speculation not but what frederick walcheren was a perfectly honourable man but he could not live or he thought he could not live without excitement of some sort and he loved the uncertainty and risk of betting and play his money and his good looks had rendered him an easy prey to the harpies of the other sex and had landed him into one or two scrapes with more respectable women his cousin philip had often had to be the gobetween and peacemaker with sundry fair damsels who were violently bent on a breach of promise case or a horsewhipping through means of their next friend mr philip walcheren was quite a different sort of character from his cousin married and the father of a family a staunch catholic steady and prosperous in his business as a solicitor he was almost a pattern man and fredericks goingson were a marvel and a misery to him he and his director father tasker were constantly talking over the other man and wondering by what means they could dissuade him from his follies and induce him to lead a more sober life but as yet their exhortations and entreaties had been of no avail frederick laughed at their cautions and poohpoohed their predictions of a repentant future he meant to live his life he told them and asked for no ones pity or advice he was in reality what mr crampton and henry hindes had called him a dissolute and irreclaimable spendthrift and not fit to be the husband of any girl still he was pleasant and fascinating and the beau sexe spoilt him to a woman as he lay indolently on his couch this afternoon turning jennys letter over and over in his hands his thoughts were much the same as hers had been for of all the femininities he had ever met and trifled with she was the only one who had seriously touched his heart women as handsome as jenny and far more amiable had been ready before now to throw themselves at his feet but they had had no power to move him but for this petulant spoilt and rather underbred girl he would have laid down his life who can account for anomalies is lovesuch love as has its origin in admirationa spiritual passion or is it the force of two magnetisms that attract each to each beyond the power of the individual to oppose from the strange choices we see made in this world it would seem so anyway this is how frederick walcheren felt for jenny cramptonthat he would die sooner than give her up she seemed in the short time they had known each other to have grown into his lifeto have become part of it indeedso that he could no longer imagine living without her he kept saying to himself all the while just as she had donei will not give her up for any man or woman upon earth what do i care about the old woolstapler raving let him rave i will carry her off before his very eyes but she shall be mine in fact she is mine in heart and soul and i defy the whole world to separate us and just at that moment there sounded a double knock on his outer door and his man appeared to usher in his cousin philip walcheren and father tasker frederick sprung to his feet the instincts of a born catholic were still strong in him and though he never went to confession or mass he always showed a proper deference for the clergy added to which father tasker was an old friend of his family how are you father he said im glad to see you pray take the armchair well philip all right at home quite right thank you frederick replied his cousin i was on my way to have a talk with you when i met father tasker so we came together im delighted to see you both said frederick what can i give you i know that it is no use my offering the father a brandyandsoda but if you will not take one philip my man shall get some tea ready in half a minute i dont think we have time for either replied philip walcheren i have only about ten minutes to spare and the father honours me with his company at dinner tonight so i think marion will be disappointed if i deprive her of her fiveoclock tea gossip with him she is doubtless anxiously awaiting us now but i felt i could not pass another night without asking you frederick if a rumour which i have heard concerning you is true whats up now demanded his cousin i met young fellows in the city this afternoon mrs bouchers brother you know and he told me that it is commonly said in hampstead that you are engaged or about to be engaged to miss crampton what of it said frederick carelessly surely it is not true surely with your antecedents frederick you are not thinking of marrying any respectable woman would you prefer my marrying a disreputable one then philip most certainly not what i mean is that under the circumstances you have no right to marry at all how can you go up to gods holy altar with any woman whilst that unfortunate girl down at luton is even now expiating the awful sin you led her into of course it is quite impossible that it was she who led me instead of the other way said frederick interrogatively whosoever fault it may have been in the first instance you know that you are responsible now and i am quite ready to meet my responsibilities do you want me to marry the strawplaiter down at luton no no i want you to do nothing but alter your mode of living frederick and try and be a decent member of society it is terrible to think how you go on without care for yourself or others without a thought of god or the future that lies before you if poor sir frederick ascher had only foreseen the uses his money would have been put to he would have thought twice before he left it to you yes but luckily for me he didnt foresee so i can do as i like about it has father tasker a lecture in store for me as well inquired frederick turning to the priest no my son we are not in the confessional where i could wish we met oftener but i would like to remind you that although your late godfather made no actual conditions regarding the expenditure of the fortune he left you yet his wishes that it should be devoted to the church were so strongly expressed as almost to amount to a demand and i cannot believe that any blessing will follow a different disposition of it i have confessed to no intention of marrying remember but should i ever do so my wife will be my church and i shall settle my money upon her but this was a blasphemy that neither philip walcheren nor the priest could pass over in silence be careful my son be careful cried the one lest the curse of heaven and the church you despise are both provoked against you i cannot believe frederick that you seriously mean what you say exclaimed his cousin the money is only yours for your lifetime and if you do not dedicate it to the holy church at your death some fearful calamity will surely overtake you or those to whom you wrongfully give it nonsense replied frederick i suppose you both mean well but i would rather you understood me at once as matters stand at present i have not the slightest intention of leaving my money to the church my godfatherpeace to his ashesleft it to me and i recognise but one authority in the matter and that is the law which is on my side i wonder by the way philip that you stick up so badly for the stability of the profession by which you live every consideration must give way to the claims of the church frederick well i dont agree with you i think mother church has feathered her own nest pretty well considering her claims to humility and poverty in my idea my own nest will have the prior claim on my indulgence so you are really contemplating matrimony frederick said philip i wonder you can dare to enter a church under the circumstances lest the walls and roof should fall in upon you perhaps i shall be married in a registrars office responded frederick lightly but the jest was so illtimed that neither of his hearers commented upon it with the fact of that misguided female down at luton you are about to commit a great sacrilege my son in taking the sacrament of matrimony on yourself remarked father tasker well really father i must say you and philip are both rather hard on me you have been reproaching me for my loose style of living for years past and begging me to reform and now when you hear a rumourmerely a rumour rememberthat im about to forsake the devil and all his ways and become a steady married man like my good cousin here you attack me as if i had just formed a fresh liaison instead why shouldnt i marry like a good boy as well as philip who is i know a pattern of propriety why shouldnt i walk to mass every sunday morning with a little boy by one hand and a little girl by the other it doesnt seem as if i could please you anyway you mistake both me and your cousin my son replied the priest it is not that we are not most anxious to see you turn over a new leaf and lead a pure life but marriage is assuredly a condition of great temptation for a man situated as you are it will bring cares and expenses with it and your mind will be filled with the thought of providing for the future of your family you have been brought up to no profession for your sainted mother had no idea that you would be anything but a priest and that your godfathers fortune would go as he wished it should do to our holy church but since you elected otherwise there is but one honest course for you to pursue and that is to remain single and preserve your money intact for the purpose for which your godfather left it to you marriage will interfere with this therefore marriage is not for you at this juncture fredericks temper got the better of his judgment then im dd if the church shall have the money he exclaimed loudly all your advice and precepts and exhortations to a purer life count for nothing they are only made so you may hear yourselves talk and plume yourselves with the idea of how much better men you are than myself but this matter is in my own jurisdiction thank goodness and i shall do exactly as i choose about it i shall marry or remain single as pleases me but whatever i may do the church doesnt get my money so you may put that thought out of your heads at once ill leave it to the salvation army or the home for lost dogs first he had thrown himself into a passion by this time and he walked quickly up and down his little room in order to cool his temper philip walcheren looked as if he expected the heavens to open and strike his cousin dead for the utterance of such blasphemy and the priest rose and prepared to shake the dust of those apartments off his feet mark my words he said solemnly as he turned to leave the room god will not be mocked frederick walcheren he knows all our hearts and he will avenge himself goodmorning and with that father tasker disappeared for shame cried philip as he prepared to follow him for shame frederick you may have law on your side but you have neither right nor conscience you have not told me whether the rumour i mentioned is true or false but if it is true and you have any such intention in your head pause i beseech you before you carry it into effect or some fearful calamity will follow it you have defied our holy church and god will defend her rights i shall not come again until you send for me and in another moment the room was clear here watson called frederick to his man bring me a whiskyandsoda i declare he continued to himself if their twaddle has not made me quite uncomfortable what on earth did that old fool my godfather mean by not making his will decisive one way or the other i a priest indeed no i mean to live a rather jollier life than that comes to and there is only one other decent alternative to marry the girl i love and rear a family for the benefit of the state and how can i do that without money it is ridiculous to think of still with the superstitious ideas which the catholic religion infuses in all her followers with the childish inbred fear of the priestly power to save or damn with the fear of purgatory and a fiery hell and becoming an outcast from salvation for ever frederick walcheren did not feel quite comfortable though he tried to laugh the feeling off and was as resolute as before that no power in heaven or earth should separate him from jenny crampton they are against us on every side he thought but that fact will only make me the more determined to have her my beautiful darling the most beautiful woman in my eyes that i have ever met why father tasker himself couldnt resist her if she stood on one side and hell on the other what time is it watson sixthirty by jove if i dont hurry up i shall get no dinner before i start for the bouchers going to hampstead again tonight sir asked watson as he laid out his masters dress clothes upon the bed how well our servants know where we go and who we go to see and what we do it for yes replied frederick to mrs bouchers dance you neednt sit up for me watson for i shall be very late order the brougham to call for me at simpsons at nine oclock i shall go on straight from there he hurried into his dress clothes for he was determined that nothing should make him late that night for fear he should miss the interview in the picture gallery after the fourth dance the picture gallery at the bouchers was very seldom entered by any of their dancing guests being some way removed from the ballroom but both jenny and mr walcheren being intimate friends at the house knew it well frederick thought rightly that since a prohibition had gone forth against his dancing with the girl of his heart it would be more prudent if he did not put in an appearance to the ballroom till after he had held the interview with jenny so when he presented himself at the house between nine and ten oclock and had divested himself of his crush hat and overcoat he peeped into the dancing room to see how far the evening had advanced the number two had just been placed above the bandstand so he concluded he had at least half an hour to wait before jenny could join him and turned away again to seek the solitude of the picture gallery until the time of meeting had arrived but he reckoned without his host henry hindes who had been one of the earliest arrivals and on the express lookout for walcheren spied him as soon as he looked into the room and rising quietly followed him out so as soon as frederick had reached the picture gallery he heard a step in his rear and turning with annoyance to see who had discovered the retreat besides himself met the outstretched hand and smiling glance of mr hindes mr walcheren could not fail to return his civilities but he was infinitely vexed of all the people he knew he would rather have encountered anyone than mr hindes not only because he was so intimately connected with the cramptons and undoubtedly knew most of the family secrets but also because frederick had conceived an unaccountable aversion for him he did not know why himself henry hindes had always been courteous and polite to him far more so indeed than mr crampton who invariably treated a roman catholic as if his religion were his own fault and he was sinning every day that he didnt change it hindes on the contrary had no scruples on the score of difference of faith and no right to object to the young man because he courted jenny crampton he had always spoken and behaved to him as one gentleman should to another and yet walcheren hated him now as he accepted his hand and asked after his welldoing he would have liked to strike him across his smooth smiling face instead mr hindes having no idea that the young man was waiting to see miss crampton had thought this would be an excellent opportunity for him to fulfil the promise made to his partner and let mr walcheren know how utterly hopeless his suit was how are you walcheren he said cordially as he came up with him you dont mean to tell me you are going to eschew dancing tonight when there are so many pretty girls doing wallflowers i saw you look into the ballroom and disappear again and wondered if you had found your way to a buffet and a whiskyandsoda i shouldnt mind following you if you have for the night is very warm and i am very thirsty no i had no such intention answered walcheren in a tone of annoyance i fancy it is rather too early for that game i came in here because i have a slight headache and thought the cool and quiet might charm it away before i encountered the heat and glare of the ballroom to be sure and i daresay it will this is a charming place though one cannot see much of the pictures by night it is in semidarkness i do not suppose the bouchers intend their guests to use it on such an occasion as this or they would have it better lighted perhaps not replied walcheren but i am an old friend of the family and consider myself privileged to do as i like oh i am not finding fault with your decision my dear fellow on the contrary i am very glad of the opportunity of a few words in private with you it is not often that my wife can drag me out to a dance and to tell you the honest truth i came here this evening expressly to see you to see me echoed walcheren in astonishment why what on earth can you have to say to me nothing on my account my dear friend unless it were to tell you what i hope you know that i have always been pleased to welcome you to my house and always shall be but i am as i think you are aware a very intimate friend of mr and mrs crampton who were indeed the intimate friends also of my father before me and who have known me almost from a child i know it replied frederick what of it mr crampton sent for me before ten oclock this morning and i found him in the greatest distress his wife had intercepted a letter from you to miss crampton and the contents had terribly upset him passing over the fact that i consider it a breach of honour to pry into the private correspondence of anybody i am not aware that there was anything in the letter alluded to that was calculated to upset mr crampton said frederick i dont sanction the proceeding my dear walcheren i am only telling you the facts the old gentleman was more than upset he was terribly angry and he made his daughter give him a solemn promise not to see of her own free will or speak or write to you again and pray may i ask cried frederick walcheren in a sudden fury what business it is of yours mr hindes to mention the subject to me none at all but i owe it to the entreaty of my friends both mr and mrs crampton have begged me to convey their wishes to you they have derived so much pleasure from your society as an acquaintance and think so highly of your intentions with regard to their daughter that they dreaded the task of telling you personally that they can never give their sanction to a marriage between you perhaps as they told you so much they were good enough to add their reasons for so extraordinary a decision exclaimed walcheren in a tone of sarcasm certainly they did and it is one with which you cannot find serious fault the objection is your religion mr crampton will never allow his daughter to intermarry with a catholic and his decision is irrevocable since your feelings for miss crampton cannot have gone beyond admiration considering the short time you have known her he thought it best you should hear his decision at once before any mischief is done on either side and miss cramptons feelings are they not to be taken into consideration also most certainly there is nothing on earth mr crampton cares for so much as his only child she is his heiress as doubtless you know but he will leave her nothing if she marries against his wishes he is very obstinate when thwarted and very unrelenting and miss crampton would hardly be so foolish as to give up her fortune as well as her parents at one blow under these circumstances i hope you will not take offence my dear walcheren if i ask you in his name to relinquish your acquaintanceship with miss crampton and to leave off visiting at the house it is an unpleasant task my friends have set me but i have done it for their sakes and without any ulterior feeling against yourself i have not a daughter old enough to aspire to your hand said henry hindes smiling but if i had i am not sure that i should deliver such a message to you on my own account but frederick walcheren took no notice of this little sop for cerberus have the cramptons any other objection to me besides that of my religion he asked presently well my dear fellow replied henry hindes dubiously rumours have been conveyed to them of your life having been a little fast not more than that of other men of the world i daresay but these old people do not regard such matters with the same eyes that you and i should do they have only mixed in a certain society you see and know little of the sayings and doings of fashionable men and women they have very strict notions concerning propriety and you cannot shake their opinions on the subject but the real objection is to your religion that is insurmountable they will never overlook it it is most unfair exclaimed frederick how is a man to help what his parents chose to make him besides i have no religion at all i believe in nothing not a god nor a hereafter nor a heaven nor a hell will that suit them better mr hindes laughed heartily at the idea pray dont hint at such a thing walcheren he said or they would think you were the old gentleman himself but we must really talk seriously about this matter mr crampton is obdurate and will remain so he declares that unless you will give your promise not to interfere with his daughter for the future he will take her away from hampstead and out of your reach and keep her there until one of you is married i am sure you are too much a gentleman and man of honour to upset a whole family in that way in order to gratify your spite against them for it will not lead to your being readmitted to the house and miss crampton will be strictly watched for the future frederick walcheren was thinking very deeply on the matter and his thoughts ran thus i must overcome these people by diplomacy if i refuse to give this promise i shall be watched so closely that i shall never get speech of jenny again whereas if i pretend to give in to their demands i shall throw them off their guard and the first thing i must do is to get rid of this fellow aloud he said i am deeply grieved to hear of mr cramptons decision but i see the wisdom of it naturally i admire miss crampton very much i wonder who doesnt but to tell truth i anticipated a great deal of opposition from my own family if it ever came to anything serious they are as staunch for the old faith as ever mr crampton can be for his mixed marriages are after all a mistake i am glad therefore that you have spoken so frankly and openly to me and i thank you for it will you tell mr crampton that i acquiesce in his decision and willingly give my promise not to intrude upon his daughter or himself again you have been a true friend to both of us hindes accept my hand on it and now i think i will just go home without running the risk of encountering la belle jenny it will please mr crampton if he hears that i have done so and my headache really unfits me for any violent exercise goodnight are you going back to the ballroom if so we will walk to the front of the house together yes i must go back to wait for my wife who is enjoying herself just like a girl i shall not say a word to miss crampton of having seen you it will be better to let her think you have been prevented attending the party most certainly and assure mr crampton that he has nothing to fear from me goodnight again and the two men parted at the hall door with a shake of the hand frederick walcheren went forth into the darkness whilst henry hindes congratulating himself on the diplomatic manner in which he had executed his embassage and the easy victory he had gained over the enemy reentered the ballroom and took his seat there with the most perfect assurance that all danger was over chapter iv but he did not quite know frederick walcheren perhaps also he did not how know cunning love makes a man the younger man had assumed his overcoat and hat and gone forth at the hall door as if he had but one intentionto seek the railway station since his brougham had returned to town but once clear of the scrutiny of the servants he skirted the house on the left side and passed from the front garden to the back which is easily done in most suburban houses this brought him on to a large lawn from which the interior of the lighted ballroom might be easily seen through the open windows also by turning the other corner of the mansion he could by pressing his face against the glass see if the picture gallery was occupied or not though he remained himself unseen the windows of this room were also thrown open and frederick waited at one of them until he saw the whiterobed figure of jenny crampton steal in and glance furtively around as if in search of him jenny jenny he called softly lest she should be followed by the friend of the family jenny my love come here to this window what is this cried the girl as she perceived him why are you here is anything wrong nothing is wrong whilst you love me said frederick but we are watched darling so i have pretended to go home again have you the pluck to join me in the garden there are any number of arbours here where we can talk undisturbed pluck cried jenny jumping on the window sill of course i have pluck enough to follow you over a precipice if you wish me to do so you angel i will ask you to take no more dangerous leap than into my arms but were you seen did anyone follow you we must not have an open row no no one even saw me leave the ballroom for i was at the buffet with captain rawson when number five dance struck up so i told him to go and find his partner and leave mine to seek me out and as soon as his back was turned i slipped out here you dear girl give me your hand then and jump out there is a lovely seat under that acacia treebut what will you say if your mother asks where you have been that i have been strolling in the garden with my partner she will think it was captain rawson but she will not ask she is used to my vagaries and lets me do just as i choose but darling they wont let you do that any longer im afraid ive had a lecture as well as you jenny mr hindes followed me to the picture gallery just now by your fathers request and made me promise i would give up all pretensions to your hand and leave off visiting at your house and do you mean to keep your promise inquired the girl pouting not unless you tell me to do so jenny i love you too much for that i only did it to prevent a row for if mr crampton carried his threat of taking you away from hampstead into execution i might find it very difficult to have any communication with you again but what is the good of my staying here if i am never to see you fred asked jenny that depends upon yourself my darling you cant do it from your fathers house thats certain whos from then said jenny from mine sweetheart dont think me very bold but if you love me as you say you will marry me whether your parents give their consent or not so i will if you will only tell me how fred we must elope together dearest heaps of husbands and wives have done it before us and been none the worse your father says that if you marry without his consent he will leave you none of his money that is a thing you must take into serious consideration before you give me your answer i have enough for both of us still you would be a richer woman if you remained your fathers heiress his fortune cannot be less than ten thousand a year whilst mine is only two thousand what do i care for money in comparison with you fred whispered jenny thats my own true girl he answered folding her closely to him and once you have made up your mind to marry me without your fathers consent the rest is easy enough tell me to get a licence and to give notice at the nearest registrars office to my place and you have only to arrange how you can join me so as to give us a few hours start of mr crampton and i will have you out of his reach and power before the day is over to join you dearest is easily managed replied the girl i must take a few things with me you know fred to run away in the clothes i stand up in would be altogether too romantic for the nineteenth century but i can send a box to my dressmakers under pretence of wanting some dresses alteredno one interferes with my dress at homeand then when you let me know which day i am to be in town i will drive myself over as if to go shopping tell brunell to put the cobs up for a few hours and call for me at madame costellos at oclock and apres a le deluge a deluge of love my darlinga life of happiness during which i shall have but one thoughtone aspirationhow i can best repay my darling angel for the sacrifice she has made for me and perhaps after a time your parents will come round i cannot believe but that they will forgive our temerity in the end and all will be merry as a marriage bell oh poor mamma has nothing to do with it fred i honestly believe she would let me marry a crossingsweeper if i had set my heart upon it i never remember her saying no to me since i was a baby it is papa who is making all the fuss and he is as obstinate as a pig he thinks it is a sign of his own religion to kick up such a dust about your being a catholic but i say he only proves he is no christian by it what can it signify if one is a protestant or a catholic i am sure for my own part i would as soon be one as the other and preferably neither if you wish me to become a catholic fred i will to please you but i hope you wont expect me to go to church and hear sermons for if there is one thing beyond another for which i long to get married it is to have my liberty in such matters papa and mamma have sickened me of churchgoing aunt clem too who is so very pious has a face long enough to turn the milk sour it is not encouraging to a girl to go and do likewise frederick walcheren laughed as he kissed the speaker my darling he answered i daresay your people have warned you that i am not a particularly good young man but i can boast of one meriti have never pretended to be better than i am my cousin philip and his great friend father tasker consider me a lost soul but they cannot say that i am a dishonest one they have heard some rumourhow heaven only knowsthat i am very pris in a certain quarter and put in an appearance at my rooms this afternoon to learn if it was true that i contemplated matrimony you may take your oath that i did not gratify their curiosity they want to get me into the church so that they may grab my money theyve been trying it on for years but this fish wont bite but fred darling would anything on earth ever make you go into the church inquired jenny rather anxiously nothing on earth he replied quickly but after a slight pause he added at least only one thing and that is too dreadful to contemplate if you were taken from me my treasureif anything happened to you and i were left alonei should be mad enough for anythingeven to go into a monastery and sacrifice every farthing i possess what good would money be to me without my love he pressed her closely to him as he spoke and the two young faces were laid against each other and the two young forms seemed to melt for a moment into one but in another moment jenny had sprung up to a standing position i must go dear fred she exclaimed or they will miss me and mr hindes may be sent to find out where i am goodbye goodbye my darling how soon do you think i shall have your letter the day after tomorrow love tomorrow morning i shall be in doctors commons for the licence and will wire you simply all right costello then should the telegram fall into other hands it will be thought to come from the dressmaker on receipt of this you must drive over on the following day to madame costellos and leave your box there and as soon as you have dismissed brunell and the trap i will take you to the registrars office and when the knot is securely tied we will pick up the box and be off to dover will that suit your ladyship brunell will call for you at costellos at five oclock and after waiting about for a considerable time will return to hampstead and give the alarm by which time my wife and i will be enjoying our dinner at the castle warden and laughing over the adventures of our weddingday oh fred it seems too good to come true said the girl with a slight shiver nonsense my dearest it will come true sure enough but you are cold my pretty jenny i have been a selfish brute to keep you out here so long let me take you back to the picture gallery or is it wiser you should go alone goodnight then and god bless you give me one kiss and dont forget to meet me the day after you receive that wire as if i could forget replied the girl reproachfully as she raised her face for her lovers embrace and with his assistance reentered the picture gallery and walked slowly back to the ballroom to tell her mother she had such a terrible fit of neuralgia she would rather return home at once mr and mrs hindes who were seated near mrs crampton were all solicitude for her assumed indisposition and mr hindes suggested taking her for a turn in the fresh air to see if the change from the heated ballroom would relieve her mrs hindes a tall slight woman with dark eyes and hair and a graceful figure who was really attached to jenny inquired with whom she had been dancing the last set as she had looked for her in vain i have not been dancing at all replied jenny boldly i have been sitting in the picture gallery with lord craven but my head gets worse instead of better come along mother the carriage must be waiting for us by this time and i am tired to death i want to get to bed certainly my love replied mrs crampton with her usual lamblike acquiescence to all her daughters demands perhaps mr hindes will be good enough to see us to the carriage and henry hindes who was convinced that miss cramptons neuralgia was due to mr walcherens defalcation smiled inwardly and conducted the ladies to their barouche with much satisfaction that he had conducted the business he had taken on himself so successfully when jenny crampton reached home and found herself in the seclusion of her bedroom she did not give way to any access of nervous agitation or feel any trepidation at the thoughts of the important step which she had taken on herself that might be all very well for a damsel of romance of a hundred years ago but it is not the way the young women of the present day manage their affairs they are too strongminded to cry and shake and faint over the deeds they have put their sign and seal to jenny had made an appeal to become the wife of mr walcheren in a fair way and her request had been denied her for what she considered a frivolous objection she knew there was no chance of altering her fathers decision and having always been given her own way since a child she determined to take it now she regretted having to be married privately but she saw no wrong in it her parents might be sorry when they heard of it but they had brought it on themselves she was not going to keep frederick waiting for an indefinite period and perhaps lose him altogether because her father did not like roman catholics as well as he did protestants she didnt object to his religion and she was the principal party concerned so the young lady looked out the dresses she wished to take with her and made her maid ellen pack them in the box to take to the dressmakers and when the key was in her own hands she unlocked it again and added the articles of linen and jewellery that she needed and managed the whole affair as coolly as if she had been preparing for elopements all her life on the fridayit was on a thursday that she received the wire to tell her all was right and it was on a friday that her illregulated marriage took placeshe dressed herself in her most becoming tailormade costume and drove gaily off to town with a wave of her hand and a crack of her whip as a last adieu to the mother and aunt who loved her devotedly she had promised them privately that she would be back to luncheon unless her cousins the burtons were at home again which she did not anticipate and pressed her to stay the afternoon but jenny love expostulated her mother dont stay later than two even if they do pray be home before papa comes back from the city remember how very particular he is about your driving in town by yourself and im afraid he may blame me if he finds i have let you go with only brunell my dear mother as if brunell were not a better protection for me than fifty fat old men like papa now dont worry theres a good creature for i shall be back long before dinner time but you know what costello is and how difficult it is to get away from her and perhaps i shant go to the burtons at all so keep up your pecker and dont expect me till you see me goodbye and with a flourish she was off she drove rapidly to kensington and on arrival directed her groom to put up the cobs and get himself some dinner and call for her at mrs burtons house in cromwell road at five oclock the man touched his hat the box was lifted out and miss jenny entered the dressmakers abode madame costello she commenced this is a box of things belonging to my cousin miss burton which i am just going to take to her in cromwell road i have brought it here first that you may take out the canvas dress you made for me and which is just a trifle tight under the arms no i have no time to have it fitted on thank you tell the dressmaker to let it out half an inch under both sleeves that will be quite sufficient and unlocking the box the little diplomatist took out an old dress which she had laid at the top and locked the rest of its contents up again frederick walcheren was waiting for her round the corner she had spied him as she drove up to the door my cousin is waiting to take me on to cromwell road she said to madame costello as she beckoned him to advance ah fred she continued you must call a cab for me for i have been obliged to send the trap on to pick up papa who wishes to join us have you one ready thats right goodmorning madame costello you neednt hurry with the alterations for i shall not want that dress again just yet and with that miss crampton entered the cab and was soon whirling away to the registrars office i never saw anything more neatly managed in my life was her first remark mamma has reason not to expect me home till five or six i told brunell not to call for me at cromwell road till five so he cant be back in hampstead till six or seven and by that time by that time you will be mrs frederick walcheren past all recall said her lover joyfully but at that the girl seemed suddenly to lose her selfpossession for the first time oh fred she cried what am i doing oh do stop and let me out before it is too late i was mad to come it is too wicked my people will never forgive me and she struggled to loose herself from his detaining clasp jenny my dearest he exclaimed be reasonable for my sake do it is too late to go back now i have made every arrangement for our staying at the castle warden hotel besides would you disappoint me in so terrible a manner after having passed your plighted word to be my wife i am sure you wont what should i do without you jenny what would you do without me if we part now it must be for ever dont make both our lives unhappy for a little want of courage no no i must go on i feel it i cannot live without you fred i love you too dearly do just as you will with me i had a little difficulty with the licence business yesterday he whispered as they travelled onwards they wanted to have the written consent of your guardians or my assurance that you were of age so i swore you were it was the only way out of it my darling and quite justifiable in my eyes under the circumstances but i thought i would put you on your guard in case the registrar put any awkward questions to you concerning it it doesnt signify replied the girl in a dejected tone now that the goal of her desires was so nearly reached her high spirits seemed all to have evaporated and she was trembling and nervous i have had to tell so many lies to manage the business that one more or less cannot make much difference jenny my own girl what has come over you asked walcheren in some alarm are you not well do you not love me as much as you thought you did your mood is not complimentary dearest to the coming ceremony if you really repent the step you have taken say so and at all costs if it breaks my heart i will get out of the cab and you shall return to madame costellos jenny do you no longer wish to be my wife but at that awful alternative jennys sudden weakness evaporated and she clung to her lover as if all her hopes in this world and the next centred in him yes yes yes she exclaimed eagerly you are my lifemy all i cannot live without you or away from you it is only a sudden fear of the consequences of this step we are taking which terrified me it is gone now dear frederick indeed it has what fear could i have in becoming your wife you whom i love beyond all other things only my poor parents my poor good mother fred how i wish she had said god bless you jenny as we parted she has been such a kind mother to me and she will miss me so she will have nothing to occupy her thoughts or her hands poor mother now i am gone do you think i shall ever see them again fredmy parents and poor old aunt clem do you think my father will keep them from me all my life she spoke so rapidly and excitedly and she clung to him so tightly that frederick walcheren feared she was what the lower orders call going off her head and said all he could think of to soothe her no no my darling girl what can you be thinking of to ask me such a silly question of course your father will come round in time the old gentleman is too fond and proud of you himself to hold out very long it is i on whom he will pour out the vials of his wrath come let me dry those tears we are almost at the registrars office now and he will think i am inveigling you into a marriage against your will if he sees you crying perhaps he will take it for a case of abduction and order me to be locked up until he has found out where you come from and if i have carried you off by force and then there will be the old gentleman to pay and no pitch hot jenny laughed at the expression and let frederick kiss away her tears and in another half hour they walked out of the registrars office together man and wife chapter v henry hindes house was the most remarkable in hampstead it was called the old hall and was supposed to have been built more than two hundred years before it was situated within ten minutes walk of mr cramptons place the cedars but the two mansions belonged to different eras of the worlds history the cedars was fitted in the most luxurious style everything that money could possibly buy or build up had been added to it to increase its convenience and comfort it revelled in glass houses expensive outbuildings swimming and other baths and all the luxuries of the prevailing season but everything about it was painfully new mr crampton had purchased a freehold of the ground and built the cedars for himself or rather for the daughter who was to come after him often had he said to his wife that when their jenny married they would find a smaller place for themselves and make the cedars part of her marriage portion consequently he had lavished money upon it letting the builders and upholsterers have their own way in everything because it was only so much more for jenny when she came like a young queen into the property her fathers love had prepared for her but the old hall was a very different sort of dwellingplace henry hindes was a man of refined tastes and culture a man who before he had come into his fathers business had travelled much and seen the world of art and science and cultivated his mind and raised his ideas of beauty and workmanship he hated business and all its details and had it not been for his childrens sake and the loss it would prove to them would have sold his share of it for whatever it might fetch and given up his life to the pursuit of his fancy as it was he refreshed himself in the intervals of less congenial work by making his home as beautiful as he could but in a very different fashion from that of the cramptons the old hall had lowroofed rooms wainscotted with black oak into which he would not permit the innovation of gas and ghostly corridors that ran the whole length of the building and stained glass windows which let in very little light and made the house dark and gloomy in the eyes of such philistines as could not appreciate medieval customs and the relics of barbarism which made the delight of its owners heart he was the possessor too of an admirable collection of paintings mostly of grim and melancholy subjects but valuable in their way and well in accordance with the mummies sarcophag curious gems and stones and other curiosities which he had gathered on his travels and stored up in remembrance of them his was a charming household and his collection of odds and ends were the only gloomy things in it his wife hannah hindes was a cultured and intelligent gentlewoman eminently fond of him and regarding his powerful brain and capacity for business with an admiration which bordered on reverence and he was the father of three handsome and healthy children all of whom he loved and one of whom he idolisedto wit master walter hindes his only son an infant of some two years old to see henry hindes with this child in his fine old garden was to see him at his besthe was so partial to floriculture and such a student of botany though in this as in other things he would not allow fashion to trample sweetness and commonsense under foot in the large shady garden of the old hall were to be found all sorts of flowers growing together in the same bed no ribbon borders or collections of prize begonias or pelargoniums of giant blossoms or dwarfed bushes transformed it into the semblance of a nurserymans plot of ground but sweetsmelling herbs grew amongst the choicer plants and high and low bloomed side by side as they used to do in the long ago in the summer weather henry hindes spent almost all his spare time in his garden with his children and was apparently quite happy with his own thoughts and them hannah hindes was a woman who never grated on her husbands finer sensibilities she was loving tender and conscientious but she seldom obtruded herself or her opinions on him and never in opposition to his own she was always there when needed calm and intelligent ready to give advice but not eager to thrust it down ones throat a restful sort of woman for a man to come home to after a hard and perhaps harassing days work and she had in her turn an admirable husband for mr hindes was mildtempered and indulgent never found fault with anything his wife did or wished to do and was always quick to think of her comfort and that of her children a few mornings after the dance at the bouchers they were strolling together under the shade of an avenue of elm trees which formed the approach to the house and he was telling her of his interview with frederick walcheren one of the little girls elsie was holding her mother by the hand whilst the other laura was wandering in front of them and the son and heir was perched on his fathers shoulder enjoying a ride in the length and breadth of england you could hardly have found a more united or happier family i did not much relish the task hannah he was saying to his wife when mr crampton entrusted it to me for i anticipated a tough battle with the young gentleman a man does not particularly care to have a stranger intermeddle with his love affairs oh but mr walcheren could never look on you as a stranger interposed mrs hindes he must know how very intimate you are with the family and that you have known dear jenny almost since she was born not quite that hannah said her husband wincing for he did not like to be reminded that he was getting on but long enough at all events to act as her fathers ambassador anyhow i thought he would resent my speaking to him and perhaps cause a bit of a scandal but to my surprise he took it so quietly and so much as a matter of course that i begin to think he was never in earnest and was rather glad than otherwise of an opportunity to withdraw without dishonour then he must be a scoundrel replied mrs hindes with unusual vehemence for her gentle nature for i am witness that he behaved to dear jenny just as if he were in earnest i have been with them often you know henry when there has been no one else by and if ever a man pretended to be in love with a woman mr walcheren did anyone would spoon a little with such a pretty girl if she gave him the opportunity my dear replied mr hindes and our dear jenny is a bit of a flirt you must allow that i wouldnt trust her with a grandfather if i valued his peace of mind i dont know what you mean by spoon said mrs hindes who professed to understand no modern slang but he looked at her and spoke to her as if he loved her and wished her to love him and if he meant nothing by it all i can say is that he deserves a much worse reprimand than a mere hint to cease his visits at the house why he might have broken darling jennys heart what do you mean exclaimed her husband she doesnt care for the fellow who can say if she cares for him or not henry women dont run about as a rule telling everyone they meet of their predilections for gentlemen who have not yet proposed for them but good god do you mean to insinuate that the girls happiness is likely to be affected by this business you must be mistaken jenny would never be such a fool as to risk losing all her fathers money for the sake of the first young jackanapes who says he loves her she may like the jackanapes better than the money henry i dont think women stick at much where their hearts are concerned besides has not mr walcheren a fortune of his own perhapsi dont knowunless he has already made ducks and drakes of it replied henry hindes wiping the perspiration from his forehead but jenny has never thought of him seriously i am sure of it her father was telling me only yesterday that her demeanour has not changed in the least since he told her she must give him up but is as cheerful and lively as usual that doesnt look as if she was very miserable over the loss eh hannah perhaps she does not believe she shall lose him observed his wife what do you mean by that nothing particular only jenny may derive comfort from looking forward to the time when she will be of age and able to please herself it seems unnatural to me that they should give each other up so cheerfully and it is not jennys disposition either you seem to forget what a selfwilled little mortal she is and mr walcheren is so goodlooking too i am sure jenny has positively raved to me about his beauty and where will he find such another girl i thought she looked more like an angel than a woman at the bouchers on wednesday so pure and sweet and fresh in that white dress and with those lovely eyes of hers shining like two stars dont you think she has the very loveliest eyes in the world hal yes yes very pretty certainly but handsome is as handsome does hannah and i should be dreadfully grieved if i thought jenny could be capable of wilfully deceiving her parents it would break their hearts if you fancy she may be and you women know best about each other as a rule tell me so and i will warn the cramptons it will be my duty to do so for they are the oldest friends i possess mrs hindes was just about to answer her husbands query when they were both startled by the appearance of mr crampton coming up the drive towards them there was evidently something unusual about his visit in the first place the old man was walking a most unheard of exertion on his part and in the second he would in the ordinary course of events have met his partner in a few minutes in the train as this was saturday when they made a point of going to the city together in order to pay the workmens wages and set things generally right for the ensuing week my dear crampton what on earth is the matter cried henry hindes putting down his child and hastening to his partner mr cramptons face which was always of a fine roseate hue was now positively purple and from fast walking and agitation he found it impossible to articulate hannah feared he was going to have a fit and urged her husband to get him to the house before he attempted to tell them what was amiss even when he was placed in a library chair it was some minutes before he could find breath to speak and meanwhile the distress pictured on his features was unmistakable my dear friend said mr hindes with the greatest concern are you ill is anything wrong at home for gods sake speak and put us out of this terrible suspense shes gone hindes shes gone gasped mr crampton at last gone who not jenny cried mrs hindes the old man nodded his head not dead said hindes turning as white as a sheet no no gone off with that scoundrel walcheren replied mr crampton who had somewhat recovered himself didnt you tell me that he promised to give up all pretensions to her hand and to leave off visiting her or writing to her he did most emphatically said hindes i was just telling my wife about it and so did sheso did jenny continued the father in a broken voice and they were both lying to us sirboth lying she has left us for him she writes she is married to himthat it is of no use our attempting any opposition and we may keep our worthless money for ourselvesand our broken hearts too i suppose he added in a lower tone but it is impossiblethere must be some mistakehow did it happen cried henry hindes excitedly well they must have managed to have some communication with each other since wednesday for the girl joined him yesterday my wife is such a foolgod forgive me for calling her by such a namethat she never exercised the least supervision over the child and yesterday morning it seems that jenny said she was going to her dressmakers and they let her set off alone with brunell she told him on reaching townthis is the mans story rememberto put up the horses and call for her at the burtons in cromwell road at five oclock he was there to his time and waited outside for an hour when a caretaker came to the door and asked him what he was waiting for on his telling her she said that no young lady had been there that daythat the family was still out of town and she didnt know when they were likely to be home again on hearing that brunell drove to madame costellos but learned there that jenny had left directly he drove off in the morning and had not returned since a gentleman her cousin the woman said had fetched her away in a cab the man came back with this story and you may imagine the night we have had my wife was sure it was all right but i knew the end from the beginning dont despair sir until you are quite sure said hannah with ready sympathy i am sure mrs hindes we sat up all night and the first post this morning brought us that he threw down a scribbled note on the table as he spoke and hannah picked it up for her husband seemed too paralysed at the calamity that had overtaken his friends to be able to do anything the note ran thus dear father and motheri could not give frederick up as you desired me to do because we love each other too much so we were married this morning at the earls court registrar office where you can see the entry if you doubt my word dont be too angry with me remember i am your only childyours affectionately jenny walcheren thats a nice letter for a man to receive who has idolised his child for twenty years isnt it mrs hindes asked mr crampton sarcastically remember she is my only child indeed im not likely to forget it i can tell miss jenny that and ill never see her again not if i live another fifty years oh dont say that you dont know what may happen to alter your mind said hannah as she took the old mans hand in hers and pressed it warmly you love her dearly and she loves you things will not look so black when you are more used to them after all mr walcheren comes of a good family and and is a papist interrupted mr crampton angrily a member of the faith which i despise and abhor and contemnthe faith which will bring my wretched daughter down to hell with himself no mrs hindes my dear you mean kindly but dont talk to me of ever seeing this matter in a better light but she is under age said henry hindes speaking for the first time how could he marry her without the written consent of her guardians by a lie of course he must have sworn she was of age it came natural to a papist no doubt theyre made of lies religion and all its a proper beginning for a life of deception and ingratitude but if the licence has been obtained under false pretences crampton said mr hindes eagerly it may not yet be too late to set it aside it may be possible to force him to return your daughter to you at all events until she is of age i dont know the law accurately on this point but i can go to town at once and inquire and if there is a chanceif she could be returned to you mr hindes urbanity seemed to have forsaken him at this juncture for he trembled so violently that his very teeth chattered and do you suppose that i would take her back cried mr crampton vehemently what take the casket without the jewel receive my daughterno longer only my daughter but that mans playthingin her dishonoured home never i will see her dead first i will stand by thankfully and watch her coffin lowered into the ground sooner than acknowledge her again as my child i have no child now my jenny in whom i took such pride for whom i have made money and treasured and garnered it up is gone from me she is no longer mine she is walcherens wife i have lost her more effectually than if she had been taken from me by death as her brothers and sisters were and never so help me god will i see her of my own free will in this world again he was fuming and raging in his despair and hannah hindes motioned to her husband to do or say something to calm the old man but henry hindes remained as silent and motionless as if he had been carved in stone then she attempted the task herself dear mr crampton she whispered laying her gentle hand on his knotted one surely you are going too far this terrible disappointment has come upon you too suddenly but try to look at it in a more reasonable light jenny has done very very wrong no one could think otherwise but you must not speak of her as if she were abandoned to sin she is honourably married remember and she is so young that perhaps she did not view the fault of rebelling against your authority from so serious a point of view as we do mr walcheren doubtless persuaded her that it was only a venial error which you would soon forgive for i cannot believe that she could ever forget your great love for her nor hers for you she smoothed the old mans palm with a motherly touch as she spoke and her soft voice and manner served in a measure to soothe his extreme agitation you are a good woman mrs hindes my dear he replied more calmly but my daughter must abide by the step she has taken however this fellow cajoled her into it she knew well enough that i would never give my consent to her marriage with a dd papist she gave me her solemn promise too to give up all communication with him she lied to me mrs hindes as the man lied to your husband and i renounce them bothi renounce them both henceforth i have no child heaven took five from me and the devils got the last and with that mr crampton drew forth a red silk handkerchief and buried his face in it but what is to be done inquired henry hindes what is to be done hannah glanced round at him in astonishment his full deep voice seemed all of a sudden to have become thin and squeaky mr crampton seems to think that we can do nothing dearest she answered but some sort of reply must be sent to her letter he continued or she may present herself at any moment in hampstead she is very impetuous you know crampton and will not easily believe that you can be seriously angry with her we must prevent a scandal if possible you had better write to her or see her once just to come to an understanding that you may know what to expect and she also i will never see her nor write to her again said mr crampton henry could you not do so asked his wife pleadingly if mr crampton consents to it could you not first verify the marriage and then see poor jenny and tell her her fathers decision someone ought surely to do it where does she write from asked mr hindes from the castle warden hotel at dover whence they will probably cross over to paris if you follow them it should be at once will you go shall i get your portmanteau ready she loved the girl and cherished a secret hope that through her husbands intervention a reconciliation might be effected between the daughter and her parents i am at mr cramptons service said mr hindes what do you expect to issue from the proceeding asked the old man in a muffled voice i will never receive her back at the cedars it is of no use giving her any false hopes for my decision is irrevocable she is dead to me from this time forward will her mother consent to that sir if she does not she must join her daughter for i will have no one who associates with papists in my house i would as soon cherish a brood of vipers but i do not anticipate my wife being so ungrateful as to desert me in this extremity but if jennyif your daughter on hearing your decision and learning that it is unalterable should elect to give up her husband and return to the protection of her parentswhat then sir there is no chance of it said the old man i am not so sure of that our childhoods affections are generally the strongest she may be repenting the step she has taken even now if i see her and find she wishes to come home againwhat then i do not say that in such a case i should absolutely refuse to receive her but it would be only on the very strictest conditions and you would let me know first you would not bring me face to face with her without any preparation for by the lord hindes i would not trust myself to say what i might do in such a case no replied hindes i promise you i will not act in any way without your consent but i will go down to dover and see if it is possible to have an interview with her alone if mr walcheren is present i have no hopes of success dont mention the fellows name exclaimed mr crampton the very sound of it makes me feel like a murderer i can conceive at this moment nothing that would give me greater pleasure than to squeeze the last breath out of his vile body he rose to leave then tottering as if the fatal intelligence had added twenty years to his existence dont walk home let me order the carriage it wont be ten minutes and then it can take henry to the station said hannah kindly thank you my dear replied mr crampton reseating himself i do not really think i am equal to the exertion to think that a rebellious girl has the power to sap a mans strength in this manner the news has been a shock to all of us returned hannah my husband looks almost as bad as you do henry you must take something before you start ring the bell and tell simmonds to bring some brandy and soda your face is positively ghastly what shall i put up for you shall you stay the night no i think not but perhaps i may just a shirt and a brush and comb please nothing more i am so grieved for the cramptons said her husband to her in a lower tone so deeply deeply grieved this will break their hearts i shouldnt wonder if it were the death of both of them yes yes poor dear old people they loved her so rejoined hannah with the tears in her eyes and we shall feel it terribly too henry when we have time to realise that it is true oh thats all nonsense said her husband roughly it is of them we have to think what can it matter to us sooner or later she must have married someone and we have no especial antipathy to papists but there is no time to discuss the matter now do as i tell you and let me be off and in another five minutes the two partners in the firm of hindes crampton were driving down the elmtree road together chapter vi honeymoons are not always the blissful periods anticipated by those who enter on them but fredericks and jennys promised to be an exception to the rule the girl was so lively and merry so easily pleased with all that surrounded her and disposed to make so light of any little dsagremens that she formed a delightful companion and then she was so desperately in love with her husband and he with her that they both thought and perhaps rightly that they had never known what happiness was till then frederick especially who had frittered away his time and his affections on more girls than he could remember the names of could not understand how he could have been such a fool as to waste his life in so frivolous a manner when so much pleasure had been within his grasp the day after his marriage when he was ready to consider himself quite a benedict of experience he decided that there was but one source of happiness worth calling by the name in this world and that was the whole and undivided love of a wife whose heart you felt to be entirely your own it was a lovely day and the two young people were sitting in a room that looked upon the sea watching the bright waves that were dashing up against the harbour bar and filling the air with their sweet salt flavour jenny looking the very quintessence of youth and beauty attired in a flowing gown of white muslin and lace with a knot of blue ribbon in her sunny hair was seated on her husbands knee playing with his dark locks and ever and anon pressing her ripe lips upon his forehead my darling my darling he said in a fervour of admiration how happy we are did you ever think we should be so exquisitely happy jenny no fred i have never dreamed there could be such bliss in my life before it is like heaven to be here all alone with you and to feel that we shall never never part again that we are all in all to one another and that no one can ever come between us or separate us i have only one little regret fred darling and that is a very little one what is it sweetheart that father and mother are angry with me if they had been kind about you i should be the very happiest girl alive i think i am that now but if everything were right with the old people i should be the happiest in heaven or earth my dear little wife i dont think you need trouble your sweet self about that they are sure to come round before long why you know they couldnt live without you naturally they are angry at present we have been very naughty but we mean to be ever so good for the future so that they shall be quite proud of us by the way jenny did you write that letter to your father certainly and posted it yesterday oh what a time it seems since we were married i can hardly believe it is only a day it seems like a year thats very complimentary to me my darling but you might have had an answer to your letter by telegram this morning so i might but i daresay dear old papa is awfully enraged with me and is keeping me in suspense on purpose but mamma is sure to write in a day or two i shall be glad to hear from them fred id rather know the worst at once why what do you suppose the worst will be you little silly who can do you any real harm now that you have me to protect you who could wound you through the circle of my arms exclaimed frederick as he cast them around her i defy the world to take my angel from my clasp and so long as she has me and i have her we shall be happy the girl was silent for a few moments whilst her husband was devouring her with kisses but when he released her she said thoughtfully do you know who i doubt fred though he has been our friend for years and papa thinks there is no one like himmr hindes he has always been awfully good to me and his wife is one of my dearest friends but still somehow he always seems to come between me and anything i like he is always advising papa about me as if i belonged to him as well he made him exchange my dogcart for a ralli because he declared it was too dangerous for me to drive about in and he makes mamma take me home from parties before twelve oclock for fear i should be overtired i suppose he means it kindly but i think it is very officious of him and i have told him so and now i fancy he will be advising my parents not to give in and forgive me too soonperhaps tell them not to forgive me at all added jenny with drooping head officious indeed i should call it dd impertinence on his part acquiesced her husband and he wouldnt try that game on twice with me to tell you the truth little woman i dont like your mr hindes any more than you do he interfered in my affairs sufficiently by informing me i was to make myself scarce but i expect by this time that he has found out his mistake there is certainly something curious about the fellow one cannot find fault with his manner which is most courteous and he seems wellinformed into the bargain and yet he has a knack of saying the most unpleasant things in a pleasant way that i ever came across however he will never worry you again my jenny nor cross your path if you dont wish him to do so oh i have no wish to cut him only i fancy he will influence papa to hold out against us as long as possible for the funny part about him is that although he has always been so kind to me personally whenever he advises papa on my account it is always something to give me annoyance instead of pleasure i really quite hated him at one time for so constantly opposing my wishes i was always doing something unladylike or dangerous or foolish according to mr hindes account well thats over at all events replied frederick neither mr hindes nor mr anybody else shall ever interfere with my wifes pursuits if i think she is endangering her precious safety i shall kiss her till she promises me to leave it off and be a good girl but nothing else shall come between us i shall go on being bad so that you may go on kissing me said jenny as she nestled closer to him but what are we going to decide about tomorrow little wife asked the young man after an eloquent pause is it to be paris or not do the boats run tomorrow asked jenny dubiously i fancy so but that is soon ascertained they are sure to know all about it in the hotel the question is do you prefer to cross tomorrow or monday we are very happy here said the girl thoughtfully happy my sweet happy is not the word for it we are in paradise at least i know i am but what made you make that remark because if it is all the same to you fred i would rather stay here till monday then if my father writes to me or wishes to see me i shall have time to receive his letter or to receive him before we leave england very well dear have your own way in everything you will never find me oppose your wishes i am not so sanguine as you are about the old people coming round so quicklyi fancy your dear papa has a will of his ownstill it will be as well perhaps to stay a day or two in england to give them a chance of behaving like christians but what do you feel like now doing now eh kissing you replied jenny suiting the action to the word but weve been at that game for twentyfour mortal hours my darling he cried laughing and before long there will be nothing of us left will you come for a walk dearest im too tired well if your ladyship will give me a little leave of absence i will go for a swim it is just the day for it i shant be long back for luncheon at all events oh love be careful exclaimed jenny with startled eyes dont do anything rash think how precious you are to me you dear goose replied her husband why swimming is one of the things i do best however i will be careful i promise you now and always that i have such a dear wife to care if i live or die i suppose you will not want luncheon till three said jenny for the remains of breakfast were still on the table no three will do nicely and then we will have a carriage and go for a jolly drive over the cliffs i wish i had my dear cobs here and could drive you myself said jenny with a slight sigh i wonder if father will let me have my cobs they are my very own for he gave them to me on my birthday if he doesnt your husband will give you a pair that you will like just as well he came back as he spoke and embraced her fondly dont regret anything you may have left behind you my sweet he murmured remember you cannot have them and me as well i regret nothing and nobody she answered clinging to him you are my world dearest in having you i have everything the young mans face glowed with delight as he tore himself away from his enchantress and left the hotel to have his swim for a little time after he had quitted her jenny tried to interest herself with the newspapers and magazines which they had purchased the day before but she was naturally restless and could not chain her thoughts to anything she read one or two short stories without knowing what they were about for her mind would keep wandering back to hampstead and all that was happening there every time a footfall sounded near her room she fancied it was the waiter bringing a telegram from her father or a message perhaps that he waited below to speak to her at last her nervous dread lest he should arrive and interview her without the protection of her husband grew to such a height that she felt as if she could not remain in the hotel without frederick and put on her walking attire with the idea of going to the beach and waiting for him there but dover was a strange place to jenny and she had no idea which direction frederick might have taken nor where the gentlemen bathed nor if it would be proper for her to go there if she did besides did she not remember her husband saying something about bathing from a boat in which case he might be miles away from the land the green downs stretched out invitingly before her looking so much cooler and less glaring than the sandy beach sprinkled over with nursemaids and children so she turned her steps in that direction she carried a magazine in her hand and she would go and sit on the cliffs she thought till three oclock had struck and frederick had returned home again a little chill feeling ran over jenny as she took her seat on the sward close to the edge of the cliffs whence she could see and hear the sparkling waves as they dashed over the shingly beach and she moved further inland with a shudder what an awful thing it would be she inwardly said if i were to fall over those cliffs nownow in the very heyday of my youth and happiness to leave my frederick just as i know what it is to love him just as i have taken the bold step to unite myself with him forever yet others have done it others i suppose with hopes as high as mine and with feelings as strong oh it must have been terrible terrible the very idea makes my flesh creep i must be overexcited and nervous today to think of such a silly thing and she drew herself further and further away from the edge of the cliff and tried to interest herself in her book it was about this time that henry hindes pale and anxious as to the issue of his errand walked into the vestibule of the castle warden hotel and asked if mrs walcheren were at home the porter having referred to halfadozen waiters in turn at first said yes but on mr hindes sending up his name for admittance the man returned to say he had been mistaken and neither mr nor mrs walcheren were indoors is it only an excuse or is the lady really not in demanded mr hindes she is really not at home sir was the reply but i did not see her go out i suppose she went through the garden mr walcheren went out better than an hour ago for i saw him pass through the hall myself do you know when they are likely to be in next asked the visitor i cant say for certain sir but their lunch is ordered for three oclock very well i will return at three what name shall i say sir you need say no name i will send it up on my return said henry hindes as he walked away he was disappointed that he had not found jenny at home and alone yet it was hardly natural that a young husband and wife should separate on the very morning after their weddingday but we are all apt to be unreasonable when our wishes are thwarted however he made up his mind to call again at three oclock whether alone or together he could not return to hampstead without seeing jenny and delivering to her the message with which her father had entrusted him so he must wile away the intervening hours as best he could he stopped at the bar to have a brandyandsoda not the first by several that he had taken that morning to build up his courage for the coming interview and sustain him under the shock which the news of her marriage had been to him and then he wandered forth into the town and took his way idly up the very path to the cliffs that jenny had trodden before him he had not walked slowly and clumsily for more than half an hour when he came upon her seated on the closecropped herbage with her eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the water and her book lying unheeded in her lap henry hindes heart gave a great leap and throb as he recognised the lovely features shaded by a broad chip hat trimmed with field flowers and the graceful figure of the beauty of hampstead here was an opportunity for which he had never hopedto find her thus alone and unoccupied amidst the glories of nature with her attention free to listen to his pleadings on her parents behalf his involuntary exclamation as he encountered her caused jenny to look round and the hot blush of shame that flooded her face at seeing him proved that she was not dead to the knowledge that she had done something to blush for mr hindes she said with a little gasp as if of fear what has induced you to follow me nothing but the heartiest interest in your welfare jenny you may be sure of that did you think that we could hear the news of your marriage at hampstead without emotion it paralysed us jenny we could not believe it without further proofwithout your assurance that it was undertaken of your own free will my father is the proper person to put such questions to me replied jenny proudly if he wished them answered why did he not come to dover himself instead of sending you your father could not come if he wished it your letter has made him so ill that he is not fit to leave home i dread what the effects of the shock may be on him remember he is no longer a young man sixtytwo on his last birthday and you have robbed him of all he had in life i dont see that replied jenny with her old pertness i must have married some day i dont suppose my father meant to keep me single all my life and in such a matter people are generally left to choose for themselves not when their choice is in direct opposition to their parents wishes however you have elected to fly in their faces and whats done cant be undone i visited the earls court registrars office this morning and found the ill news was indeed too true it therefore now only remains to be seen what remedy there is for so sad a state of affairs and if you are prepared to hear the proposal your father has sent you by me he had made as though he were about to throw himself on the grass beside her and in order to avoid his doing so jenny rose and moved a few paces forward henry hindes had therefore no alternative but to walk slowly by her side and as she had turned her face from the town each step took them further from it if you have anything unpleasant to tell me she said with a slight laugh for goodness sake dont make it public property let us go further up the cliffs where our voices will not reach any loiterers on the beach below you can hardly expect my message to be a very pleasant one jenny commenced henry hindes as composedly as he knew how but it is soon told mr crampton refuses either to write to or see you unless you agree to his conditions when he received your terrible news this morning i was afraid he would have a fit it affected him so dreadfully as for your poor mother and aunt they are i hear in utter despair you have changed a happy home jenny into a house of mourning well they should have been more considerate of my feelings said the girl in a low voice but mr hindes could detect signs of softening in it they were considerate of them they intended to be considerate of them exclaimed henry hindes they only told you the truth when they said that walcheren was not a fit man for you to marry that he was a gambler and an evil liverthat mr hindes you forget yourself cried the girl with newly acquired dignity when you said those things the other day you were speaking of an acquaintance today you are maligning my husband i cannot help it were he twenty times your husband i must say what is in my mind concerning him you have had your own way too long jenny and now you have taken it to your ruin but your father is willing to receive you back as his daughter on one condition and that is that you leave this man who has led you into so grievous an error and return to the protection of your parents jenny gazed at him as if he had been a lunatic do i hear you rightly she said or are you mad leave my husband whom i have just married leave the man whom i love above all the world father and mother included leave him all alone and go back to hampstead to live a widowed life with my people why papa must have been tipsy to propose such a thing what had you been giving the old gentleman to make him talk such nonsense surely you are dreaming and have fancied it all dreaming echoed hindes indignantly is it dreaming to see your fathers agony to hear of your mothers tears no these things may be play to you jenny but they are death to them i have repeated your fathers words just as he told them to me i will never see her nor speak nor write to her so long as life lasts he said and i will never under any circumstances receive that man into my house but if jenny will give him up and come back to our protection i will try and forgive the past jenny think of what you are resigning before you finally decide mr crampton is much richer than you imagine you will inherit nothing short of fifteen to twenty thousand a year at his death and you were married illegally mr walcheren took a false oath about your age and this may be set aside if you will only give your consent to it why jenny you have not been half clever enough with your beauty and prospective wealth you should have married into the aristocracy think twice about it give up this man who is not worthy of you and you will make twice as brilliant a marriage byandby chapter vii the girl turned round upon him like a fury how dare you she cried make such an infamous proposal to me i dont believe papa ever told you to say so i dont believe he would have thought of such a thing if you had not put it into his head you are not telling me the truth mr hindes what spite have you against me that you are always trying to put a spoke in my wheel in this way you never propose anything for my pleasure it is always something for my pain i believe you have taken a hatred to me you go against me so persistently ii hate you jenny stammered hindes yes i feel sure you do else why should you be forever urging papa to do something to displease me i have seen it for years past every obstacle that has been thrown in my way has been by your advice what am i to you why cant you let me and my affairs alone why cant i let you alone why am i for ever interesting myself in your affairs he repeated after her cannot you guess jenny has no glimmer of the truth reached your heart during all these years well then i will tell you it is because i love you a nice way of loving interposed the girl sarcastically yes you may laugh but it will not unmake the fact i love you jenny as no one of your admirers has ever loved you yet love you with the fire and fervour of a disappointed man of one who knows and has known for years past that his love is of no avail that it lives without hope but still lives burning onloving onbecause it can never die even if it would because it would not die even if it could oh my darling i have loved you for years just give me one look of pity at last but jenny recoiled from him with a shudder of disgust how dare you how dare you she panted and you pretend to be my friend you a married man oh you have made me feel that i have sunk low indeed her look of horror and her tone of contempt stung hindes more than a dozen lashes from her hand would have done married he exclaimed what has that to do with a mans feelings am i blind deaf insensible because i am married and what about your fine scoundrel over there you imagine he loves you yet what is he a married man and worse than a married man a thousand times over for he has left a poor girl who is to all intents and purposes his wife and a child who has the right to call him father to break their hearts and perhaps to starve down at luton whilst he is philandering after you ah that has touched you has it he continued almost savagely as he saw jennys cheeks flush well it is the solemn truth as i can prove to you and she is not the only one either ask philip walcheren you are one of many jenny though you may wear the weddingring upon your finger you lie cried the girl vehemently i am sure you lie and i will tell my husband every word you say and he shall punish you for them you want to frighten me that is allyou are jealous of my great happiness i have always suspected you were doublefaced and now i know it and i hate youi hate you and i love my husband as much as i hate you and nothing shall ever separate us try as hard as you may we will be together and together and together until death she turned in all her beauty with a mocking smile upon her lovely face towards him as she spoke and stepped backwards towards the edge of the cliff henry hindes first impulse was to catch her by the wrist to prevent her falling over but she wrenched it from his grasp dont dare to touch me you brute she cried excitedly you want to push me over the cliff now i suppose god why did she say the word why did she put the idea into his excited brain it had never entered his head before he had never thought of her but in kindness for years past he had secretly cherished her image suffering himself to indulge in beatific daydreams of what his life might have been had jenny been destined to spend it by his sidehad permitted himself to enjoy her presence to bask in her beauty to be miserable when the thought crossed his mind that some day he would be assuredly called upon to relinquish her to another man but never had he done less than love her but now as he held her in his power and she laughed derisively into his face whilst those words i hate you still rung on the air something entered into henry hindes that had never been there before a wild fury that she should spurn him her friend of years and love frederick walcherena mad despair that he would never possess her beauty and that another had the legal right to gloat over it night and day for all timewhilst he stood apart baffled and disappointed and then a desperate resolve to save her from further contamination and himself from a lifelonging and the devil which is in all of us glared out of his eyes as with a single effort hardly calculating what the effects would be acting more on the impulse of what he would do than of what he was doing he pushed the girl violently from him and sent her light body hurling over the stupendous abyss which separated them from the beach below it was done in a second beyond power of recall this moment jenny was standing before him in her mocking lovelinessand the next there was only a void and not even the impress of her footprints on the short herbage where she had stood henry hindes remained motionless for the space of half a minute then sunk down into a sitting position and trembled as if he were taken with an ague he did not look over the cliff to see what had become of his victim he knew but too well he had glanced over it before he met her and saw that it consisted of an unbroken line of chalk cliffs leading precipitately to the shingly shore he knew what he should see if he looked over and he dared not look he only sat there and shook like an aspen leaf the clammy perspiration rose upon his face and stood in great beads upon his brow but he did not raise his hand to wipe it away he only remained dumb and motionless and trembled byandby some instinct warned him that he ought to move to go back to the town and that it would not do for him to be found sitting so close by upon this he tried to stand but found he could not so turned round and crawled away for some distance on his hands and knees a fresh breeze had sprung up from the sea and it revived him sufficiently to enable him to stand upon his feet and to commence with a tottering step to find his way back again as he did so he hardly believed that what had happened was real he must have drunk more than was good for him he thought and it was a bad dream that had overtaken him but a backward glance made the horrid truth too plain there was the barren cliff deserted for the time being whilst all the world of dover was occupied on the beach with bathing or flirting or play there was the very spot where they had stood together on the close grass besprinkled with pink thrift and stunted daisiesthe same irregular edge where she had mocked him whence he would have saved her if she had let him but where i must pull myself together thought henry hindes with a violent shudder this is not the time or place for me to think about it it was an awful accident but nothing morei would not have injured her for all the world but it is an awkward time for it to have occurred and in my presence tooand i must take measures not to have my name implicated in the affair he looked around with dimmed eyes as he argued with himself but far or near he could perceive no one and no thing except a few sheep grazing on the stunted herbage then he ventured near the cliffnot with his eyes towards that point where she had fallen but turned the other way and he saw it was quite deserted the bathing population being at the further end of the town not a soul was on the beach only a few boats were drawn up high and dry whilst several more were dancing on the blue waters laden with fishing nets or pleasureseekers the complete seclusion of the place imparted a temporary confidence to him for the childrens sake he muttered to himself as he took his way downwards for walters sake and the others and hannah i must be brave and calm and not betray myself let me see what time is it three oclock and i said i would return to the hotel about three well i mustnt hurry it will look bad i will go into a restaurant first and have my dinner the thought of eating sickened him but he persevered and entering the principal restaurant in the town ordered an expensive meal but when it was served he could not eat it the food would have choked him something seemed to have closed in his throat and prevented his swallowing presently an idea struck him calling the waiter he said i have some business to talk over with a friend in this town and as my time is short i think it will facilitate matters if we dine together lay another plate and tell them to keep the dinner back till i return i am going round to the hotel to fetch my friend keep the champagne in ice i shall not be absent more than a few minutes he left the restaurant as he spoke and reentered the vestibule of the castle warden hotel has mrs walcheren returned yet he inquired in an unconcerned voice no sir she has not mr walcheren he came home about half an hour ago but he went out again i really cant say when theyll be back sir hindes took out his card and wrote on it in a very shaky hand i have called twice today to see you with a message from home and hoped to have persuaded you to lunch with me at the tivoli restaurant but my time is up and i must return to town will write in a day or two h h give this to mrs walcheren on her return please he said to the waiter and took his way as best he could back to the tivoli there he forced himself to eat a little and drink a good deal and calling for the bill gave the waiter a liberal tip and departed in a cab to the station he had done all he could he should tell the cramptons he had called twice to interview mrs walcheren and been unsuccessful each time and he had waited about dover till four oclock it was saturday and he could not spend sunday away from his wife and children they would surely say that he had done all that was necessary and more than they had required from him he had tried to see her twice and he had failed they must wait now until jenny wrote to them herself until jenny wrote to them herself as the thought crossed his mind henry hindes sunk back into the corner of the railway carriage in the same comatose state in which he had been on the downs the train flew screeching through the evening air on its way to london but time and place were alike unheeded by him had it been a dreaman unholy lurid nightmareor was it reality when he reached the old hall it was nine oclock he told his wife he had stayed to dine in town but in truth he had been wandering about the streets hardly conscious of what he was doing until the time warned him that each hour he delayed would make it more difficult to account for his prolonged absence so he dragged himself home and the effort he made to look like a man who was rather disgusted for having been foolish enough to take a lot of trouble for nothing sat upon him much as a clowns paint would sit upon a corpse hannah was naturally all sympathy for his disappointment and failure and hindes was compelled to take refuge in gruffness to elude her searching inquiries my dearest how ill you look and how tired you seem this has been a trying day for you i am sure so fond as you are of dear jenny too and did you really not see her i have told you already halfadozen times hannah that i called twice at the castle warden hotel to see her but she was out each time so was he so there was nothing to be done but to return home i did not relish the idea of wasting a sunday in hanging about dover perhaps with the same result when i might be at home with you and the chicks dear henry said his wife you are always so considerate of us still for jennys sakeif it were to lead to a reconciliation between her and her parents i would give you up for even a longer time than that you might have written her a letter henry though i did write just a scribble on my card to say i had hoped to get her to lunch with me at the tivoli restaurant when we could have talked the unhappy matter over together indeed i had ordered lunch for two but she was not in and they couldnt say when she would be in so i was obliged reluctantly to come back without seeing her but i dont suppose it would have been of any use what girl would give up her lover the day after her wedding it was a mad scheme and quixotic in me to set out on such an errand no dont say that dear for i am sure the old people will be glad hereafter to think that you did all you could to bring them together henry hindes started hereafter he echoed what do you mean by hereafter nothing my dearest only you surely do not think the cramptons will hold out for ever do you and when they are reconciled to jenny and we are all happy again i am sure they will be pleased to remember and so will she that you were the first to try and bring them together oh yes yes i see replied her husband as he passed his handkerchief over his brow poor mrs crampton and miss bostock were over here this afternoon continued mrs hindes they said they should go mad if they had no one to talk to about it i dont think they are half so angry with jenny as her father is of course they say she has been very naughty and her papa is quite right not to forgive her in a hurry but they evidently think in the long run he will find he cannot live without her it would be ridiculous mrs crampton said and most wicked if they cast off their only child however wrong she might be she is afraid it will be a long time before mr crampton forgives mr walcheren or consents to receive him at the cedars because of his being a papist but as for their darling she declared if papa did not ask her up next week she should go down to dover to see her herself i believe there is a great deal more in the old lady than we have given her credit for henry and that she will have her own way in this matter whatever her husband may say but you are not feeling well dear surely i never remember to have seen you look so white before are you sure that you made a good dinner in town or will you have a brandyandsoda you must have something your looks quite frighten me mr hindes pulled himself together and sat straight up on the sofa dont be a fool he began but seeing the consternation which his rudeness evoked he added dont worry me hannah this has been a very fatiguing day and i may say a very distressing one into the bargain i cannot look on this matter in the same bright light as you do mrs crampton may be very brave and determined but she has her match in her husband and i never knew him to go from his word yet and the girl inherits her determination from him i do not believe she was from home when i called today i believe i was denied on purpose they anticipated my errand naturally and declined to have a scene which there undoubtedly would have been if mr walcheren and i had been brought in contact i believe the young man to be a regular scoundrel and i should have told him so after which i suppose i should never have spoken to either of them again oh i dont believe jenny would really quarrel with you whatever you said henry she is too fond of you for that she is an impetuous little creature and says a great deal more than she means but she has often told me how highly she thinks of your friendship and how she felt sure that whatever happened you would always stick by her and help her out of all her scrapes there there hold your tongue that will do exclaimed her husband as he rose and walked slowly towards the door i want to see my boy before i sleep tonight and he took his way closely followed by his wife to the nursery the two little girls were very pretty creatures who combined the best points in both father and mother but the boy by one of these freaks of nature which have been mentioned before was like neither of them but rejoiced in a particularly ugly mug of his own invention he lay asleep in a magnificent cot which his father had had carved for him on the occasion of his birth covered with a finely embroidered quilt his black eyes were closed but his little snub nose swarthy complexion and wide mouth formed a sorry contrast to the lace and linen which enveloped them no prince of the realm could have been more luxuriously surrounded than was master walter hindes his sisters were lying in their beds close by their fair hair straying over their pillows but their father hardly glanced at them as he crossed the room and bent over the carved cot at the further end as he gazed at his sleeping son and heir all the stolid feelings of despair which had occupied his mind during the day seemed to fade away and leave a wealth of passionate love behind them he stooped down closely and laid his face against that of the slumbering child my son my son he murmured but as the words left his lips though heard by no one but himself a vision of jennys face rose before himof jennys mocking face as she stood on the edge of the precipice and defied himand with a sudden impulse he drew forth his silk handkerchief and wiped his kiss off his childs brow what is that for my dear asked mrs hindes with a low laugh a flya gnat he stammered it might disturb wally in his sleep and he withdrew at the same moment from the childs bed wont you look at elsie and laurie whispered the mother as she passed her arm through his and pulled him gently towards the girls bed they have been such good maids all day i took them with me for a drive to call on old miss buckstone this afternoon and she was delighted with them she wants us to let them go and spend a whole day with her and not wally said henry hindes quickly well she did not ask master wally and she would regret it i fancy if she did he is rather a handful away from home dearest you know and too much used to have his own way we really must not spoil him so much or he may come to the same sad end as poor jenny what sad end what do you mean by saying that demanded henry hindes for the second time that evening why marry without our consent to be sure henry what else could i mean though i hope her marriage may have a happy ending after all i shall always believe in it and pray for it until it comes to pass yes yes pray for it hannah replied her husband i dont believe much in prayer myself but if anybody should ever be heard it is you you have been a good wife to me my dear i seem to see it more plainly tonight than i have ever done before ah thats because of this trouble about poor jenny it has regularly upset us all shall you go over and see the cramptons tonight harry no no i couldnt i have had enough bother already replied hindes shrinking from the idea of course and perhaps they will not expect it but you must write to them for they will be anxiously expecting to hear some news of your journey so they will he answered as if the idea had only just struck him well i will not write i will go and he rose to get his hat and stick then suddenly turning to hannah he addedits a fine night will you go with me she looked surprised at the request but answered readily with pleasure dear if you will wait whilst i put on my hat and mantle the brief walk to the cedars was accomplished in silence but as they reached the house hindes said to his wife dont repeat anything i told you leave me to tell my own story i want to save them as much pain as possible they found the three old people sitting together and looking very forlorn mr crampton had recovered his temper of the morning and was seated in an armchair huddled up behind his newspaper and professed to take no interest in the conversation that ensued the two women flew at henry hindes as soon as he appeared oh dear mr hindes did you see her what news do you bring us do not keep us in suspense we implore you is she well what did she say my dear friends he answered with assumed jocularity one at a time if you please and you must prepare yourselves for a disappointment i havent seen her at all i called twice at the hotel and they were out each time what else could we expect im afraid i went down on a wild goose chase such a lovely day where should a bride and bridegroom be but out of doors i am afraid we must have patience till next week then if mr crampton wishes it i will go down again and make a second attempt to interview them oh dear dear i am disappointed sighed mrs crampton for i feel sure if you had seen darling jenny that all would have been right dont talk nonsense interposed her husband how can anything be right again since she has elected to marry that scoundrel the jade has made her own bed and she may lie on it and i hope itll be a deuced hard one too dont say that replied henry hindes quickly if it should be hard it is not you that will make it so i scribbled a line to her on my card to say i had brought her a message from home so if i am not very much mistaken you will receive another letter from her before long dear mr hindes how can we ever thank you enough for the trouble you have taken on our behalf said mrs crampton as she slid her slender hand in his you are the truest and best friend we have god bless you but he could not stand the gentle pressure of her hand nor the grateful intonation of her voice dont speak about it please he answered pulling his hand out of hers almost roughly i wishi wish i could have done more butbutcome hannah he exclaimed interrupting himself we must go home it is late and my two journeys have tired me goodnight mrs crampton goodnight to everybody we must leave the further discussion of the matter to another time and with a hasty nod all round he left the room he did appear very tired when they reached their home very exhausted and overdone but his condition did not tend to give him a good nights rest on the contrary long after hannah had sunk into the dreamless sleep which waits on a good conscience joined to a good digestion her unhappy husband lay wide awake staring into the darkness and starting at every shadow that lurked in the corners of the room chapter viii amongst frederick walcherens varied accomplishments swimming held a prominent position from a child he had exercised this most useful of all practices until he was as much at home in the water as on land and on that fatal saturday there was every inducement for him to spend a long time in his favourite occupation the day was transcendently beautiful the sea was sparkling with electricity and warm as a tepid bath and the beach was crowded with spectators eager to watch and applaud the various feats of natation which he performed he was in good temper with himself and the world poor fellow and anxious to give them all the pleasure in his power so he remained in the warm exhilarating water as long as possible performing all sorts of extraordinary dives and plunges and strange modes of swimming whilst the people on the shore were full of admiration for his skill at last he felt he had had about enough of it for the present and dressed to return to the hotel as he descended the steps of his machine a young man of ordinary appearance who was apparently waiting for him came forward i beg your pardon sir he began but from witnessing your feats of skill in the water i presume you are a swimming master and should like to know your terms for a course of lessons frederick laughed heartily at the idea but he was not snob enough to be offended by the young mans mistake indeed i wish i were anything half so useful he replied but i am only an amateur like yourself swimming is not at all difficult it only requires pluck and practice anyone could attain my proficiency if he cared to take the trouble youll forgive me for mentioning it sir said the stranger who feared he might have offended him with all my heart there was no harm in asking replied frederick as he heard the town clock strike three and hastened towards the hotel he reached it almost running and going breathlessly upstairs threw open the door of their sittingroom but jenny was not there a waiter was employed putting the last touches to the luncheontable which was evidently only waiting their return to be spread with the noonday meal where is mrs walcheren inquired frederick i dont know sir replied the stolid waiter as he continued putting out cruets and water bottles frederick ran up to their bedroom which was on an upper floor and finding that also empty put on his straw hat again and descended to the vestibule has my wifemrs walcheren gone out he asked of the porter well sir i really cant say theres been a gentleman asking that question here already but i couldnt give him no satisfaction i suppose the lady must be out because we cant find her nowhere but none of us see her pass through the hall and ill take my oath she hasnt come in for ive never left my post one minute perhaps she went to the beach to you sir oh doubtless but about the gentleman who called to see her what was his name he didnt leave no name sir but said he would call again what was he like short and stout and middleaged with rather a red complexion eh he concluded at once that it must have been mr crampton who had followed his daughter on the receipt of her letter that morning well not very red in the face sir but stoutish certainly and not over tall i know him replied frederick thinking he did if he comes again during my absence ask him to walk upstairs and wait until we return all right sir of course it was mr crampton he thought it could be no one else and he must be by jennys side when their encounter took place if old crampton thought that by right of his paternity he would bully jenny he was very much mistaken he would have to answer to her husband first he went back to the beach thinking he should find her amongst all the nursemaids children serenaders and fruitsellers and was prepared to meet her with a little scolding for exposing herself to the heat of the day and the vulgarities of the dover sands but she was not there the beach was almost deserted now for the babies and their attendants had gone back to their lodgings to early dinner and the serenaders were performing in front of the pubs in hopes of earning a meal there would have been no difficulty in discerning jennys distinguished little figure on the long line of sand and shingle but it was evident she was not there where could the minx have hidden herself frederick was a little inclined to feel cross although it was the first day of their married life because jenny had so decidedly said she would rather not go out that morning and if she had not done so he should not have left her to herself could she have ventured into the town she had come away so hurriedly that she might have found herself in want of some trifling article that she had forgotten and gone to the shops to procure it he turned his steps therefore in that direction but saw her nowhere in the streets he even asked one or two pedestrians if they had met a young lady in a broadbrimmed hat trimmed with poppies and grasses but they all shook their heads frederick wandered about the streets for some time and then resolved to go back to the hotel after all jenny was not a baby she had been well used to look after herself and had a watch to tell her the proper time to return it was more than likely she was already at the castle warden his first inquiry on reentering was naturally for her no sir the lady aint been in yet was the disappointing reply but the gentleman as i spoke of he came again and left his card where is it said frederick eagerly and was handed the one which henry hindes had left behind him did you ask him to wait and see us he inquired well sir to tell you the truth i had gone for my dinner and didnt see the gentleman this time but william tells me he seemed in a great hurry like and didnt ask to wait but said he had no time to come again today as he had to catch a train for london oh very well it is of no consequence replied frederick walcheren rather testily tell them not to serve luncheon until mrs walcheren returns she cannot be many minutes now but it was many many minutes before she came back to the hotel frederick went upstairs to their sittingroom and tried to occupy his mind with newspapers and persuade himself that he was not particularly anxious for his wifes return but there is nothing more irritating than to be kept in suspense especially for a trifle he could not help wondering where jenny had gone to and why she had gone and why the dickens she hadnt come back again if the stranger who had inquired for her had not left a proof that he was mr henry hindes instead of mr crampton he should have almost fancied that she had been silly enough to have been lured away again by her father but that was folly jenny was his wife by love and by law no one could ever take her from him again unless that quibble about her age would be considered sufficient to annul the marriage but the next moment he laughed at the idea mr crampton would surely never be such a fool as to take advantage of a loophole that would bring disgrace upon his daughters name how foolish he was to let so absurd an idea worry him but why the deuce didnt jenny come back it was now four oclock this was carrying a joke too far she couldnt possibly have lost her way in such a place as dover besides she wasnt the sort of girl to lose her way even if she had broken her leg or done any unlikely thing of that sort she would have had the nous to call assistance or send him a message to say what was the matter the only solution of the mystery that he could think of was that she had gone for a walk and wandered so far away that she was too tired to walk home quicker but why in that case had she not procured some vehicle to convey her back again the more frederick thought of it the more puzzled he became when five oclock struck he went out of doors for the second time and ran all over the place making inquiries of everybody he met one girl said she had seen a very pretty young lady at about one oclock that afternoon walking towards the cliffs she particularly noticed that she wore a large chip hat with scarlet poppies in it and a white dress she had a book in her hand and she went up that way continued his informant pointing in the direction of the grassy downs frederick thanked her and commenced running off in the direction she had intimated of course he said to himself the cool breezy downs would be far more likely to attract jenny than the hot beach how foolish it was of him not to have thought of that before he walked rapidly straight ahead of him for three or four miles and then stopped to consider what he was doing jenny was not there he could see from end to end of the broad wide expanse and a sheep would have been visible to the naked eye what was the use of his rushing about in that aimless manner after a fullgrown woman jenny was such a spoilt child the lord only knew whether she might not be playing a practical joke on him all this time and hiding away for her own pleasure to see how much she could frighten him he had been far wiser to eat his luncheon in comfort and let the young lady see that that sort of trick would not do with him he was beginning to feel a little angry and hurt by this time it was not good manners to say the least of itit showed a lack of good feeling and good taste to make him look like a fool in the eyes of the hotel servants so soon after their weddingday he should give up the search as a bad job and return to the castle warden and rest without doubt she would come in for her dinner he gained the hotel again but still no news had been heard of the missing lady by this time every menial in the house knew that the bride for when can people ever hide the glaring fact that they were married yesterday had played truant designedly or otherwise and many were the conjectures as to her reason for making herself so conspicuous meanwhile frederick walcheren sat in his own apartments by turns angry impatient anxious and despairing he hardly took heed how the time went on every moment he expected to hear the sound of jennys footstep running up the staircaseto hear her merry voice telling him the reason of her extraordinary absenceto feel her arms round his neck and her lips pleading for forgiveness but the hours went on till seven and eight oclock had struck and still she was not there as the last hour sounded frederick heard a low tap on his door he was not in the mood to see strangers or talk with them but he cried come in the door opened and the landlord of the castle warden entered and closed it securely behind him i beg your pardon sir he commenced but i am told that your lady has not come home and that you are rather uneasy about her well i am naturally replied frederick in fact i dont know what the devil to think about her absence it is most extraordinary i went out to bathe this morning leaving mrs walcheren here and when i returned she was gone no one saw her go out nor can i hear any news of her except from a little girl who says she met her walking in the direction of the cliffs about one oclock this afternoon i have been all over the cliffs and the town and the beach but can neither see nor hear anything more what should you advise me to do mr cameron i am nearly distracted with anxiety the lady was seen going towards the cliffs said the landlord musingly our cliffs are not very safe for strangers i hope there has not been an accident at this frederick leapt from his seat as if he had been shot my god man he cried what do you mean you cannot think it possible thatthat he tried to finish the sentence but failed indeed sir i meant nothing but that we must look at all possible contingencies if we are to find the young lady it is a long time for her to be away and if i mistake not though i hope you will excuse my mentioning it the day after her wedding yes yes i dont care who knows it replied frederick in a voice of pain we were only married yesterday that makes this all the more mysterious and extraordinary but how are we to ascertain the truth what am i to do if you will allow me sir i will send some of the boatmen who know the cliffs to search for mrs walcheren and they will soon relieve your suspense for if she is there they will find her safe enough by all means i ought to have thought of it myself thank you mr cameron pray send for the boatmen as soon as possible and i will accompany them mr cameron looked dubious if you will permit me sir to advise you i should say stay here in case of your being wanted or other news arriving but frederick was not to be persuaded stay here he echoed what on earth should i do that for my place is with the men who are going to find her she has lost her way probably and is wandering about in the dark of course i shall accompany them but the landlord kept his back firmly against the door and prevented the young man passing out you will forgive me sir but you must not gonot just yetnot till i have said something i have been trying to break it to you mr walcheren but i am afraid i have done it badly they have found her sir she was found hours ago and i came to tell you so frederick walcheren stared at him as if he thought he was mad found he ejaculated and hours ago what do you mean why has she not come home then is she injuredhurt has any accident happened to her yes sir there has indeed and you must try and bear it like a man the lady has been hurtbadlyand she was found on the beach by two boatmen at five oclock or thereabouts hurt my darling oh my god this is hard exclaimed frederick in a voice of anguish but where is she why have they not brought her here why did they not send for me well sir they did not know where the lady belonged at first nor who she was so they carried her to the nearest publichouse the bottle and spurs which is halfway down the cliffs to the town a publichouse cried walcheren indignantly how dared they take a lady there what was mrs walcheren about to consent to it order a carriage at once if you please mr cameron and i will go and fetch her home the landlord fidgeted with the handle of the door well you see sir i am not sure if the authorities will allow of her removal its the usual thing under the circumstances you see and sorry as i should be to disoblige you im afraid my customers might object to her being brought here the bottle and spurs is a very respectable house sir and everything will be done i feel sure as can be done to make things as little unpleasant for you as possible but the authorities still the unhappy man did not understand the extent of his calamity he sat down again and passed his hand wearily through his hair what does it all mean he muttered in a dazed manner at all events order the carriage and send for the best doctor in the town to accompany me the doctor is here sir replied the landlord quickly ready to speak to you dr mcoll one of our most skilful practitioners then he opened the door and called out will you step up doctor please the gentleman is ready to see you and in another minute a middleaged kindlylooking man entered the room and went up to walcherens side doctor said frederick faintly what is all this about i dont understand it have you seen my wife is she much hurt she is not suffering now my dear sir replied the doctor thank god for that but why did you not bring her home i have been in such awful suspense all the afternoon i am sure you must have been but now i am going to take you to see her here mr cameron a glass of brandy for mr walcheren no no soda thanks i want him to take it as it is he held the liquor to fredericks lips who drank it at a draught and put down the wineglass with a deep sigh you must nerve yourself to hear what i have to tell you said dr mcoll firmly i told you your wife no longer suffered it is because she has gone beyond the reach of suffering she had been dead for hours before the boatmen found her the young man sprung from his seat with the one word on his lipsdead he stared at his informant for a moment wildly and then sinking down on his chair again threw his arms over his stricken face and burst into a storm of tears leave him alone whispered the doctor to the landlord they will save his brain but the next minute frederick leapt up and seizing dr mcoll by the arm exclaimed take me to her dont let us lose a moment oh my god my darling my darling he tore down the staircase as he spoke closely followed by the landlord and the doctor the waiters and chambermaids who were hanging about the passages discussing the awful event that had occurred made way respectfully for him as he appeared and looked after the bereaved bridegroom with melancholy interest but frederick might have passed through the ranks of a regiment at that moment without perceiving them there was but one idea in his brainto get as quickly as he could to the side of his beloved he had heard distinctly what the doctor said but he did not realise that jenny was deadthat she would never speak to him nor smile at him nor kiss him any more the drive to the publichouse was performed in mournful silence and when they reached it they were at once taken through the bar to a back room where on a table was placed just as she had been found all that was left of sweet jenny walcheren her chip hat so fresh and pretty in the morning was still attached to her hair by a long pin with a butterfly at the end of it but it was crushed and forced back upon her head by the awful fall she had sustained her white dress had been decently composed about her young limbs she might have almost have deceived one into the belief that she was sleeping except for the purple lips which were drawn off the white teeth and a dark blue bruise over the right eye where her temple had struck the cruel rocks but frederick saw nothing but that he had regained his wife and falling on her body covered it with kisses imploring her by every fond entreaty he could frame to open her eyes once more and look at him and to unclose her bruised and livid lips and speak his name at last his madness calmed down a little leaving a dull despair behind it when he turned to the doctor and said tell me for mercys sake how did it happen we are as much in the dark as you are my dear young friend replied dr mcoll all we know is that two deal boatmen jackson and barnes by name went to the lower beach after their boats which are drawn up there at five this afternoon and found the poor lady lying under the cliffs over which there is no doubt she must have fallen but how there is nothing to tell they did not know her name so carried her here and sent for me but i could do nothing she must have been dead for two or three hours before i saw her when i was convinced of that i set inquiries on foot to find out who she was and they soon led me to the castle warden hotel it wasnt easy to mistake her interposed mr cameron whose own eyes were suspiciously red the prettiest bride as everyone says we have had in the hotel for the last twelve month dont dont said frederick in a voice of the keenest pain doctor how shall we take her back she shall not lie here i must take her to the hotel at once my dear mr walcheren even if that were admissible it would not be permitted the body must not be touched until after the inquest which unfortunately cannot be held till monday she must lie here on this rough table within sound of those rough voices for fortyeight hours oh impossible i will not allow it my dear sir you must allow it it is the law this poor young lady has met her death in a mysterious manner and until the police have evidence that it was an accident they will not in the cause of justice permit the body to be tampered with an accident but how could it be anything but an accident said frederick staring at the doctor i have no doubt myself whatever in the matter but the law must be satisfied meanwhile let me persuade you mr walcheren to return to the hotel and try and calm yourself you can do no good by remaining here and i will engage that every respect shall be paid to her remains i go away said frederick in a broken voice and leave her lying here oh no you mistake me it is impossible if i may not take her away yet i shall stay by her till i can nothing shall persuade me to leave her my darling little wife and he took one of her dead hands and kissed it fondly as he spoke if you are determined began dr mcoll i am determined and nothing will shake my determination here i remain till they take my angel from me but is an inquest imperative i cannot bear to think of it it is such an indignitysuch a public insult a body of strangers men too whom i would not have allowed in her presence whilst living to be admitted to view her remains i am rich doctor can no payment of money avert this outrage nothing can avert it mr walcheren but i will take care it is conducted as quietly as possible remember it is in the cause of justice and now what can i do for you can i wire the sad news to any of her relatives or yours you should have your own friends near you in this trial frederick turned and seized the doctors hands as if he were a child clinging to him in his trouble advise me tell me what to do he said i am unfit to think for the best my head is all in a maze doctor i must tell you the truth this was a runaway marriage she was an only child and her parents doated on her i dare not think what they will say how am i to break it to them ought i to go myself i dont think they would let you leave dover until after the inquest mr walcheren but your late wifes relations should certainly be told at once if you wish it tomorrow being a free day with me i will go and break the sad intelligence to them it will greatly relieve me if you will and every expense you know doctor yes yes we need not mention that at present when you have strength to write down the names and addresses i will make my arrangements and what about the gentleman who called twice to see mrs walcheren today inquired the landlord is he a relation of hers no curse him said frederick unthinkingly the doctor and the landlord glanced at one another i have his name and address on his card whispered mr cameron significantly to his companion i fancy he will be subpnaed he may have seen the poor lady after she left the hotel what are you whispering about said frederick irritably nothing sir i will speak to the people of the house i know them well and they will see you have everything you may want and i will communicate with you directly i return to dover added the doctor and so they left him to his vigil with his hand clasping the hand of his dead wife and his face bowed down till it was lost in the folds of her dress chapter ix the next morning henry hindes received a scrawl in a hand which he could not recognise as that of mr cramptons containing but three words come to me he guessed at once what they meant he had just returned from church with his wife and elder children he had not dared to refuse to go for he was a regular attendant there and the omission would have looked peculiar so he had stood and knelt and sat through a service of two mortal hours whilst his eyes gazed into space and his mind was a blank and he only followed mechanically what the others said or did he walked home with hannah on his arm and elsie and laurie trotting before them for the hindes were far too strict a family to have out their horses on a sunday but all the while that acquaintances were bowing and smiling and exchanging civilities with himself and his wife he was wondering how soon the news would reach hampstead and if it would come by telegraph or post or if walcheren would send a special messenger to break it to the old people at the cedars and as soon as he reentered his own house the note was handed to him with the fatal words come to me he knew then that the worst was knownthat the poor parents had been told of their bereavement and that it was his mission to fly to comfort them what can be the matter questioned hannah can they have already heard from jenny or do you think it possible she can be in hampstead oh henry if they meet surely mr crampton cannot refuse to speak to her i know no more than you do he answered but i suppose i must go the old man may have been taken ill he looked bad enough for anything yesterday evening oh certainly henry dear you must go at once and you can take your luncheon with them but i shall be impatient to hear what he wants you for if jenny should be thereoh henry you will let me know wont you for i should love to give the dear girl a kiss and assure her of my faithful friendship you will send someone over to tell me in that case wont you dearest yes yes of course i will he answered quickly but there is no likelihood of such a thing goodbye i had better be off at once and so he left her the scene he encountered at the cedars is easier imagined than described mr crampton received him in his library in the presence of his wife and sisterinlaw and dr mcoll the old man looked as if he had suddenly crumpled up his features were drawn and shrivelled and his complexion the colour of parchment his wife was laid face downwards on a couch at the further end of the room stupefied with the shock of the news they had just heard whilst miss bostock sat by her silent and motionless with her hands hanging passively on her lap no one stirred except the doctor as henry hindes white and trembling but with the assumption of being at his ease entered the room well my dear friend he commenced cheerily what is it mr crampton turned to the doctor and muttered in a croaking voice tell him i have the misfortune to be the bearer of very bad news to mr and mrs crampton sir said dr mcoll in obedience to his instructions their daughter mrs walcheren met with a terrible accident on the dover cliffs yesterday afternoon and is in facthas not recovered the injuries inflictedis lying at this momentdead henry hindes face went crimson instead of pale dead sir he ejaculated slowly as if he were choosing his words are you sure she is dead an accident how can you tell it was an accident might not someone have done it on purposehave pushed her over then he paused as if he thought he had been talking too fast and repeated his first question but are you sure that she will not recover she is very young you know after which perceiving the grief of all around him he broke down exclaiming oh jenny dead impossible impossible why i went to see her only yesterday she cant be dead my dear dear friend seizing old cramptons hand dont give way it is impossible you are only buoying this gentleman up with false hopes sir said dr mcoll there is no doubt of the truth of the news distressing as it may be and i am commissioned by mr walcheren to break it to all whom it may concern as to your suggestion that it may be due to foul play there is nothing whatever to point to it but it will cause the subject of the inquiry at the inquest tomorrow your presence will of course be necessary also mr cramptons i understand as you say yourself that you went down to dover yesterday to see the unfortunate lady so that your testimony may be valuable to the coroner and the marriage having been i am told a little irregular there is the more necessity that everything should be made perfectly clear an inquest stammered hindes but surely there is no need of our undergoing such a painful ordeal why it will nearly kill mr crampton my dear friend you must not think of attending it not go cried the old man suddenly rousing himself from the lethargy into which he had temporarily fallen what are you saying hindes of course we must go dont you see how this has come about that villain has murdered her he stole her from me first and then he killed her who else would have pushed her over the cliff my poor butchered lamb my pretty jenny my beautiful innocent daughter oh but we will be avenged on him never fear well see him brought to justice and give a hand to set him swinging my poor child my murdered darling i can see how the whole damnable trick was done you must not heed what he says whispered the doctor to henry hindes the shock has been too much for him though i broke it as gently as i could you must get him to bed and give him a sleeping draught but dont listen to any nonsense he may talk there never was a clearer case of misadventure the poor girl went out on the cliffs alone and fell over them the coroner can bring in no other verdict but why then need we attend asked hindes with quivering lips it will be a fearful trial for all of us what do we need more than your assurance of the calamity that has befallen you may need nothing more mr hindes but the law needs your deposition as to what you know of the matter i know nothingnothing repeated hindes then you can say so answered dr mcoll shortly no we know nothing as yet exclaimed mr crampton eagerly but we will know it we will not rest till we have got at the bottom of this infamy if ever a poor child was murdered my girl has been papa papa wailed mrs crampton from the sofa dont speak like that or you will break my heart ay my poor woman said her husband youve plenty of cause to greet theyve taken your ewe lamb from you you had but one left and the lord let her be done to death without stretching forth his hand to save and yet they say he cares for us but the murderer shall be brought to justice never fear ill see to that oh if he goes on like this hell kill me sobbed the tortured mother mr crampton interposed the doctor we all feel deeply for you in this sore affliction but you must not bring unmeaning accusations against anyone there is no question of how your poor daughter came by her death it was an unfortunate accident nothing more i know better sir i know better replied mr crampton you cant deceive me my lamb was murdered and may gods deepest curse rest oh stop stop cried henry hindes holding up his hand it is terrible to hear you blaspheming in this manner without the least authority to do so it will not ease your own pain crampton and may add to it hereafter for your wifes sake and your own let me take you to your room where you can think over this terrible news in quiet trust in god crampton trust in god there is nothing else to be done in a time like the present but the old man usually so acquiescent in all that his partner said turned round on him on this occasion in a fury dont preach to me hindes he exclaimed angrily its all very well for you to talk of trusting in god whilst your own kids are safe at home but lose five my boy lose fivethree boys and two girlsand set all your hopes and chances of happiness on the remaining one and have her murdered before your eyes and then talk of trusting in god youre a hypocrite sir a dd hypocrite mr crampton said henry hindes deeply wounded i never thought to hear you speak to me like this for shame john for shame exclaimed his wife rousing herself for a moment what are you thinking of mr hindes too who loved our darling almost as if she had been his own child and who has always been so kind to her and us all ah well well said the old man in a tired voice i suppose i was wrong and i ask your pardon for it hindes but i dont seem to quite know what i am saying my head keeps going round so i suppose you are right and i should be better by myself for a few hours give me your arm and take me to my own room i leave this gentleman in your hands hindes see that he is attended to and arrange everything for our going down to dover goodmorning sir and with that mr crampton rose and leaning on the arm of his friend quitted the apartment there was a less difficult task with the women whose sorrow was too deep for words then dr mcoll agreed with mr hindes that they had better travel down to dover by an early train on the morrow as every endeavour was being made to have the inquest on that day on account of the hot weather rendering it desirable to get the burial over as quickly as possible hindes shuddered at the thought but showed no emotion beyond that which was evinced by his white face and silent demeanour luncheon was then served for the doctor and he departed to interview mr philip walcheren on the matter when henry hindes was free to return home here as may be imagined he had a difficult task before him but he felt freer for in the presence of his wife who had loved jenny crampton so dearly he was not ashamed to break down himself and give some relief to his overcharged feelings hannahs grief was extreme but she tried to curb it for the sake of her husband who only rose in her estimation for the tears and moans which he felt he might indulge in at last both husband and wife had quite exhausted themselves with their emotion when a servant entered to announce that a constable desired to speak to his master hannah could not help observing how vividly white henry became at this intimation she could not understand it unless the sad events of the day had so undermined his usual intrepidity as to make him start at shadows only a constable henry dear she repeated seeing how he trembled it is probably something to do with this unhappy business will you see him here no no replied her husband as he wiped the sweat from his forehead not here let him wait johnson i will be with him presentlypresently could anything have been discovered he thought to himself as he leant against the form of his wife for support and she passed her cambric handkerchief across his wet hair was it possible he had dropped any article belonging to him on the spot where he and jenny had stood together had this man come to tell him that he was suspected and must consider himself under arrest until the inquest had been held on the morrow he pushed hannahs kindly ministrations away and stood upright i cannot see him in this condition he said alluding to his swollen eyelids and stained cheeks i must go to my room first and smooth my hair he escaped by a back way as he spoke and gaining his dressingroom arranged his toilet a little then he searched in a drawer for a bottle of morphia which he had been occasionally in the habit of taking to induce sleep for the condition of his mind regarding jenny crampton had not been conducive to sound and restful repose if i am taken away from here he thought i will not reach dover they shall see i know a trick worth two of that he thrust the vial in his breast and descended to the hall to interview the constable but he had come on a very simple errand he had received information from the dover police that the inquiry on the death of mrs walcheren had been fixed for the morrow and that mr hindes presence would be necessary you see sir said the man fumbling with his papers were sorry to trouble you but as you went down to dover to see the lady it is necessary the coroner should hear the why and the wherefore of everything to come to a right understanding of the case its a sad thing aint it sir a poor young creature done to death in a moment as you may say and only married on the friday a frightful thing indeed constable replied hindes the poor gentleman they say is almost out of his senses as he well may be continued the policeman they cant get him away from the corpse and he turns round like a madman on any one who proposes of it perhaps so be youre a relation sir no no only a friend said hindes quickly well he ought to have some friend by him now if all they tell me is true for the shock seems to have unsettled his mind the inquiry wont be till three oclock tomorrow afternoon sir at the bottle and spurs publichouse where the poor lady lies if youre there sir theyll get it over at once but if so be as youre not there the jury will have to be called to attend another day i shall be there replied henry hindes and then he went upstairs again and replaced the vial in the drawer before he rejoined his wife only a notice to attend this miserable inquest my dear he said in explanation as he threw himself on a couch and buried his face in his hands oh henry how much i wish it were not necessary for you to go i know how bitterly you will feel it to have to be questioned by a man who cares nothing for our poor dear darling and who will rake up all sorts of things to wound you and make the remembrance still more bitter than it is but it is your duty and you must go shall you see her harry she added in a whisper her husband shuddered i suppose so that is if i must but you wouldnt like our sweet jenny to go to her grave without a last look dear i am sure and may i send some flowers to put over her will you take them from me no no for gods sake no cried hindes covering his face again i cannot enter into all these harrowing details like women can i shall go down and come away again as quickly as possible the sight of the poor child would kill me i have no morbid inclination for gazing at corpses hannah but our poor jenny said his wife regretfully it would seem to me like refusing to look at elsie or laurie if they were taken from us thank god they are not oh poor mrs crampton continued hannah breaking down again what must she be feeling at this moment how i pity her with my whole whole heart meanwhile philip walcheren having heard the news of jennys death from dr mcoll had hastened to the presence of father tasker a judgment a judgment my dear father he exclaimed i have just heard the most terrible piece of news poor misguided fredericks young wife was killed yesterday by a fall over the cliffs at dover heaven rest her soul said the priest crossing himself who told you of it a medical man called mcoll who came from dover at fredericks request to break the news to me there is to be an inquest held on the remains of the poor young creature tomorrow and frederick would like me to support him on the occasion can you manage to accompany me father your presence might have a great effect on my cousin no my son i think not you had better go alone this is not a time for exhortation or reproof it is the time for affection and kindness your poor cousin will as you say feel very desolate and as if heaven had forsaken him let him find if he has lost a wife he has found a brother if ever we are to succeed in our plans for himif ever our hopes of persuading him to enter the church are to be realised it is nownow when he will feel as if the world had given way beneath him go down tonight by all means and comfort him as best you can this marriage was entered into you tell me without the consent of the ladys parents possibly they may be the more set against him in consequence of this event though it happened from no fault of his own let him see that his misfortunes bind us more nearly to himmake us more anxious that he should seek comfort where it is only to be obtainedin the exercise of his religion heavens workings are very mysterious my son i see already in this sad dispensation a glimmer of hope for your cousins future perhaps this and nothing else would have made him regard your exhortations and my entreaties in a proper light god grant you may be right father answered philip if i could see frederick fulfilling my good aunt alicias wishes and his godfathers intentions by entering our holy church and dedicating his money to her use i should feel my life had not been wasted by devoting it to such a purpose chapter x frederick was still bending over the dead body of his wife when philip walcheren entered the little back parlour of the bottle and spurs that evening the landlady told him that he had not left the room since the preceding night nor has bit nor sup passed his lips sir except a cup of coffee which i made expressly and took to him this morning nor havent his clothes been off neither im sure i dont know what is to become of the poor gentleman at this rate he seems just eat up with grief i will go to him said philip as he turned the handle of the door and entered his cousins presence frederick was much in the same position he had at first assumed he occupied a chair by the side of the table on which the body of poor jenny layhis hand clasped hers and his head was bowed down on the deal boards frederickmy dear frederick said philip gently at the sound of his voice the bereaved husband roused himself and made a slight deprecatory gesture with his hand dont speak to medont reproach me he answered bitterly for i cannot bear it far be it from me to reproach you frederick replied his cousin as he laid his hand on his on the contrary i have come to comfort you as far as lies in my power under the terrible calamity that has befallen you no one can comfort me philip no one but our heavenly father frederick and our blessed mother who is watching your sufferings even now with eyes of divine compassion and love i dont believe it said the other brusquely if she pitied me why didnt she prevent it she could stand by and see the whole of my life ruined at a blow what pity is there in that what good can her pity do me after my love has been taken from me look at her philip he continued uncovering the pretty bruised face of the dead over which the livid hues of decomposition were already beginning to steal see how lovely she was how young how innocent and she loved meshe loved me and now it is all over we are torn asunder for evermore oh god it is too hard for mortal man to bear they might have let me enjoy a few months a few weeks of happiness in her affection but to call her mine one day and to lose her the nexti shall kill myself i cannot live without her hush my dear frederick hush replied philip gods hand is very heavy upon you but you must not blaspheme was not this beautiful creature his as well as yours may he not do as he wills with his own no one denies the awful grief you are called upon to bear but you cannot lessen it by raving against the justice of the almighty rather bend with submission to his decree my dear cousin and live your future life so as you may meet your wife again you can think of nothing now but your exceeding loss but when you have time to consider you will realise that she is not really gone only hidden from your natural sight for a little while and that if you choose it you are bound to meet her again and to dwell with her for ever this thought broke down the unhappy man oh my jenny my jenny he sobbed is it possible you are looking on your wretched husband now that you pity and love him and will wait for him at the eternal gates philip philip is this a judgment on me i have been thinking ever since it happened of that unfortunate girl rhoda berry at luton i cannot get her out of my head all last night i fancied i saw her grinning and rejoicing at my misfortune has god done this out of anger for my sin has he made my sweet innocent wife the scapegoat for my iniquity was it the blood of the other woman crying up from the eternal depths for vengeance that caused my angel to take a false step and meet with her death over those dreadful cliffs the idea has nearly driven me mad tell me it is not true my dear cousinmy dear brother for such you are in affection to mei cannot say that this loss has not been sent by the almighty father to wake you to a sense of the sinful life you have been leading i should be false to my trust and to my belief were i to say so but for whatever reason it has been permitted it has come in love frederick from a father who cannot see you ruin your hopes of everlasting happiness but would have the soul of your beloved wife and your own soul as well in his keeping my dear fred you must know that you were wrong not only to marry this poor child under the existing circumstances but to marry her without the consent of her parents think of the trouble you have brought upon them those poor old people who had no one to solace their age but this young creature who lies before us frederick my dear cousin i know you dont believe in prayer but let me pray for you and for her that she may be received into the ranks of those who shall be saved hereafter even though as by fire do you mean to say she is not happy now that she has not already entered into the joys of heaven asked frederick anxiously my dear cousin you have surely not so far forgotten the precepts of our holy church as to imagine that heaven is obtained without purgatorybliss without selfsacrifice this poor girl however innocent and blameless she may have seemed will have her expiation to pass through as well as all of us but we can pray for her that she may find relief we can yield up our own wishes our own pleasures that she may the sooner pass from purgatory to paradise much will rest with you your future life will make or mar her progress to the gates of heaven it shall not mar it replied frederick brokenly my life is worth nothing to me now and i will give it into your hands and father taskers to do with as you think fit philip walcheren smiled inwardly not sardonically for he was in earnest if man ever was but with sublime satisfaction that the almighty had seen fit to deliver the soul of this bruised reed into the power of the church he had no doubt now but that his hopes for his cousins future were assured and the poisoned barb had gone home so deeply that whilst the sting lasted he would be able to wield frederick as he chose but he was too prudent to press the subject home at the present moment he contented himself with consoling his cousin to the best of his ability always keeping before him the power and influence of the blessed mother of god and her interest in the souls of young girls like the poor dead child before them until the miserable husband was almost supplicating the virgin of his boyhood then and there to save his darling from the pit his misdeeds had drawn her intohe who had not breathed a prayer for years past philip walcheren stayed by him all through that night and until the coroners jury assembled on the following afternoon at the appointed hour a noise as of the trampling of many feet sounded in the public bar of the house and philip touched frederick gently on the shoulder fred dear old man rouse yourself here are the coroner and jury coming to view the body and mr crampton and mr hindes wish to come in first be brave my dear cousin it is a painful but necessary ordeal stand apart a little and let your wifes father have access to the body it is his right you know the young man stood up mechanically and taking philips arm staggered to the other side of the room mr crampton entered leaning on henry hindes the latter was suffering the tortures of the damned his eyes were not still for a moment and his whole frame shook and quivered the sight of the crushed and pallid corpse struck both men like a heavy blow old crampton gazed at it for a minute muttering my god my god can that be my jenny but hindes said nothing and kept his eyes turned on frederick walcheren presently mr cramptons followed suit and the sight appeared to rouse him into fury yes he exclaimed brandishing his stick there lies my murdered child and there stands her murderer crampton crampton think what you are saying cried hindes shaking his friends arm whilst philip walcheren said angrily if the effect of this sad sight which should draw two men in misfortune together is only to cause you to make malevolent and unjustifiable accusations sir i shall be compelled as my cousins friend to request you to leave the room this lady may have been your daughter but she was his wife and as such no one has a right to intrude upon his grief ay ay a wife he stole from me sirthat he stole from me and murdered repeated the old man shaking with rage gentlemen i must beg you to clear the room said the landlord at this juncture the coroner and jury are coming in to view the body his wife entering at the same time hustled them all into another apartment where they sat glaring at each other until their time came to be called to appear and give evidence the coroner a mr procter rather prided himself on his astuteness he was for ever finding a mountain in a molehill for he hoped to mount the magisterial chair some day and his aim was to impress the public with his cleverness and ingenuity the first witnesses called were the two boatmen jackson and barnes who had found jennys body lying at the bottom of the cliffs it was five oclock or nigh upon it please yer honour commenced the spokesman as i and my mate here went to the lower beach to haul up our boats what do you call the lower beach snapped mr procter who was a sandyhaired man with a pimply face and redrimmed eyes all the beach is lower than the cliffs yes yer honour but we calls the beach below dragons foot the lower beach because so be when the tide runs out you are not here to tell us when the tide runs out but to say how you discovered the body of the deceased jane emily walcheren said the coroner consulting his papers yes yer worship well as i and my mate here was ahaulin up the boats i says to him i says bob i says what be that ere bundle of white i says under the cliff blowed if i know he says it looks like a sheet as has blowed over in drying he says you are not here to tell the jury what your mate thought the body looked like you are to tell us how you found it yes sir well sir we thought it was a sheet you see but when we went to pick it up we see it was a young woman so we lifted her atween us and carries her to this ere ouse and then my mate he fetches dr mcoll and thats all sir very good now tell us please when you found the body was there no one about not a soul as we see my lordi mean yer worshipthe beach was empty from hend to hend and the cliffs didnt see a soul on the cliffs neither yer worship you met no one on your way here you are sure quite sure your honour twould be all over the town if we had very well you can sit down call dr mcoll the doctor having been sworn deposed that he had been called to the bottle and spurs at about six oclock on saturday night to see the deceased she was then quite deadhad been dead for two or three hours there was a large bruise on the temple caused by her striking against the rocks in her fall that was of itself sufficient to have caused death but the spine was broken and the neck the body was also much bruised there was no question but that the deceased had met her death by falling over the cliffs now dr mcoll i should like to put a few questions to you if you please said mr procter looking his very sharpest is it your opinion that the deceased must inevitably have fallen over the cliffs of her own accord might she not have been blown over or pushed over or thrown herself over by design certainly she might it is impossible to say how she came to fall over but she did fall overthat is beyond a question ah said the coroner with selfsatisfaction as if he had discovered a very knotty point then you consider death was due to dislocation of the spine from a fall over the cliffs thats your opinion is it remarked the coroner dubiously yes sir thats my opinion replied mcoll shortly as he retired the next witness was crampton he came tottering into the room and stood supporting himself on his silvermounted cane you are i believe the father of the deceased mr crampton began the coroner scrutinising the old man through his eyeglasses i am sir she was my only childthe only one i had left and she was married on the friday preceding her death she was worse luck was her marriage undertaken with your consent mr crampton at this question the old man became violently agitated it was not sir she was stolen from me by a villain who came to my house under the disguise of friendship and some one in the jury remarked that this was quite irrelevant to the evidence on hand but mr procter ordered him to be silent this poor gentleman has sustained a double injury he said let him tell his story in his own words i have not much more to say gentlemen resumed mr crampton this man frederick walcheren stole my daughter from me and the next thing i hear is that she is dead it is not a long story but it is a very bitter one and you have the full sympathy of the jury for it mr crampton i believe your daughter was your heiress did you threaten to make any alteration in your will if she went against your wishes i did i said that if she married this walcheren who is a papist she shouldnt have a halfpenny did you make the same intimation to mr walcheren i think not at least personally but i suppose she did for they ran away together two days afterwards and this is the end of itthis is the end you have recognised the deceased as your daughter the father broke down oh yes sir i have recognised her only too well my poor pretty darling she was called the beauty of hampstead sir the beauty of hampstead thank you mr crampton that will do i am sorry to have troubled you so far but it was necessary you can retire sir call mr henry hindes the witness entered the room with a pallid face compressed lips as if resolved that nothing should make him betray himself and a stolid demeanour which was wholly put on the stakes were too high he could not afford to think or fear all he had to do was to believe things were not so and to act accordingly you look ill mr hindes do you wish for a chair certainly not but i am an old friend of the family i have known the deceased from a child ah we will detain you as short a time as possible you were in dover mr hindes on saturday last i believe will you tell the jury why you came here i came at the instigation and with the knowledge of my old friends mr and mrs crampton to bring a message to their daughter and to see if i could effect a reconciliation between them between them and the young couple no not with mr walcherenthey steadfastly refused to see or speak with mr walcherenbut with his wife their daughter how could a reconciliation be effected with one and not with the other because miss cramptonthe deceasedhad married without the consent of her people and her father had cut her out of his will but as the marriage was somewhat irregular how was it irregular miss crampton was not of age and mr walcheren swore when he procured the licence that she was oh he did said the coroner making a note of the fact on his papers and mr crampton cut the deceased out of his will in consequence he did so or meant to do so but he sent me here with a message to the effect that if she would return home and permit the marriage to be annulled he would receive her back but on no other terms and may i ask what the lady said when you delivered that message to her i never delivered it i did not see her i called twice at the castle warden hotel but each time was told that she was out so i returned to town without seeing her and you did not see mr walcheren either i did not see mr walcheren either upon which you returned to town yes i went up by the fivethirty train one moment mr hindes can you tell me if mr walcheren was aware of mr cramptons intention to cut his daughter out of his will before this marriage took place i do not know i was deputed once to make mr cramptons wishes relative to his daughter known to mr walcheren and the risk may have been mentioned but he would not take it as a definite decision from me the chief objection always brought forward was to his religion mr crampton would not hear of his daughter marrying a roman catholic of course not very natural observed mr procter who like most of the middle classes in england was an ultraprotestant and only connected catholicism with monasteries nunneries fasting confession and the grand inquisition that will do mr hindes you can stand down said the coroner with a smile the next witnesses examined were mr cameron the landlord of the castle warden and the waiters and chambermaids who had or had not seen poor jenny walcheren leave the hotel on that fatal day then came a call for the last witnessthe witness whom mr procter had purposely reserved to the last tell mr frederick walcheren he is required but philip walcheren stepped forward instead are you the husband of the deceased sir no i am his cousin i have come to ask you if his presence and testimony on this the most trying occasion of his life cannot be dispensed with he is half beside himself with grief picture to yourself gentlemen a young husband bereft the very day after his wedding of all that made his life happy he is not in a fit state to answer any questions nor to have his inmost feelings submitted to scrutiny besides he knows no more than you do he parted with his poor wife in radiant health and spirits on saturday morning and never saw her again until she lay on that table as you have seen her the doctor has given you his testimony that her death was the result of a pure accident is it necessary then that my poor cousin should be tortured by recalling in public the memories that are nearly driving him out of his mind it is absolutely necessary mr walcheren replied the coroner the husbands testimony may prove the most important of all i cannot in the pursuit of my duty excuse the presence of your cousin call mr frederick walcheren and all eyes were turned eagerly towards the door to watch the advent of the greatest sufferer of all by this most hapless adventure end of vol i colston and company
