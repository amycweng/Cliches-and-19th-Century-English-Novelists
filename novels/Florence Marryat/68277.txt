so was the strip of loose yellow sand which skirted its base and all the tables dhtes were filling fast henri the youngest waiter of the htel lion dor was standing on the steps between the two great gilded lions which stood rampant on either side the portals vigorously ringing a loud and discordant bell to summons the stragglers whilst the ladies who were waiting the commencement of dinner in the little salon to the side stopped their ears to dull its clamour philippe and jules were busy laying white cloths and glasses etc on the marble tables in the open balcony outside the salle manger where strangers to the hotel might dine la carte if they chose inside the long narrow tables were decorated with dusty geraniums and fuchsias whilst each cruet stand had a small bunch of dirty artificial flowers tied to its handle but the visitors to the lion dor who were mostly english were too eager for their evening meal to cavil at their surroundings the baroness gobelli with her husband on one side and her son on the other was the first to seat herself at table the baroness always appeared with the soup for she had observed that the first comers received a more generous helping than those who came in last no such anxiety occupied the minds of mrs pullen and her friend miss leyton who sat opposite to the baroness and her family they did not care sufficiently for the potage aux croutons which usually formed the beginning of the table dhte dinner the long tables were soon filled with a motley crew of english germans and belgians all chattering especially the foreigners as fast as their tongues could travel amongst them was a sprinkling of children mostly unruly and ill behaved who had to be called to order every now and then which made miss leytons lip curl with disgust just opposite to her and next to mr bobby bates the baronesss son by her first marriage and whom she always treated as if he had been a boy of ten years old was an unoccupied chair turned up against the table to signify that it was engaged i wonder if that is for the german princess of whom madame lamont is so fond of talking whispered elinor leyton to mrs pullen she said this morning that she expected her this afternoon o surely not replied her friend i do not know much about royalties but i should think a princess would hardly dine at a public table dhte o a german princess what is that said miss leyton with a curled lip again for she was a daughter of lord walthamstowe and thought very little of any aristocracy except that of her own country as she spoke however the chair opposite was sharply pulled into place and a young lady seated herself on it and looked boldly though not brazenly up and down the tables and at her neighbours on each side of her she was a remarkable looking girl more remarkable perhaps than beautiful for her beauty did not strike one at first sight her figure was tall but slight and lissom it looked almost boneless as she swayed easily from side to side of her chair her skin was colourless but clear her eyes were long shaped dark and narrow with heavy lids and thick black lashes which lay upon her cheeks her brows were arched and delicately pencilled and her nose was straight and small not so her mouth however which was large with lips of a deep blood colour displaying small white teeth to crown all her head was covered with a mass of soft dull blue black hair which was twisted in careless masses about the nape of her neck and looked as if it was unaccustomed to comb or hairpin she was dressed very simply in a white cambric frock but there was not a woman present who had not discovered in five minutes that the lace with which it was profusely trimmed was costly valenciennes and that it was clasped at her throat with brilliants the new comer did not seem in the least abashed by the numbers of eyes which were turned upon her but bore the scrutiny very calmly smiling in a sort of furtive way at everybody until the entres were handed round when she rivetted all her attention upon the contents of her plate miss leyton thought she had never seen any young person devour her food with so much avidity and enjoyment she could not help watching her the baroness gobelli who was a very coarse feeder scattering her food over her plate and not infrequently over the table cloth as well was nothing compared to the young stranger it was not so much that she ate rapidly and with evident appetite but that she kept her eyes fixed upon her food as if she feared someone might deprive her of it as soon as her plate was empty she called sharply to the waiter in french and ordered him to get her some more thats right my dear exclaimed the baroness nodding her huge head and smiling broadly at the new comer make em bring you more its an excellent dish that ill ave some more myself as philippe deposited the last helping of the entre on the young ladys plate the baroness thrust hers beneath his nose ere she said bring three more elpings for the baron and bobby and me the man shook his head to intimate that the dish was finished but the baroness was not to be put off with a flimsy excuse she commenced to make a row few meals passed without a squabble of some sort between the hotel servants and this terrible woman now we are in for it again murmured miss leyton into mrs pullens ear the waiter brought a different entre but the baroness insisted upon having a second helping of tte de veau aux champignons il ny a plus madame asseverated philippe with a gesture of deprecation what does e say demanded the baroness who was not good at french there is no more mein tear replied her husband with a strong german accent confound their impudence exclaimed his wife with a heated countenance ere send monsieur ere at once ill soon see if were not to ave enough to eat in is beastly hotel all the ladies who understood what she said looked horrified at such language but that was of no consequence to madame gobelli who continued to call out at intervals for monsieur until she found the dinner was coming to an end without her and thought it would be more politic to attend to business and postpone her feud till a more convenient occasion the baroness gobelli was a mystery to most people in the hotel she was an enormous woman of the elephant build with a large flat face and clumsy hands and feet her skin was coarse so was her hair so were her features the only things which redeemed an otherwise repulsive face were a pair of good humoured though cunning blue eyes and a set of firm white teeth who the baroness had originally been no one could quite make out it was evident that she must have sprung from some low origin from her lack of education and breeding yet she spoke familiarly of aristocratic names even of royal ones and appeared to be acquainted with their families and homes there was a floating rumour that she had been old mr batess cook before he married her and when he left her a widow with an only child and a considerable fortune the little german baron had thought that her money was a fair equivalent for her personality she was exceedingly vulgar and when roused exceedingly vituperative but she possessed a rough good humour when pleased and a large amount of natural shrewdness which stood her instead of cleverness but she was an unscrupulous liar and rather boasted of the fact than otherwise having plenty of money at her command she was used to take violent fancies to people taking them up suddenly loading them with presents and favours for as long as it pleased her and then dropping them as suddenly without why or wherefore even insulting them if she could not shake them off without doing so the baron was completely under her thumb more than that he was servile in her presence which astonished those people who did not know that amongst her other arrogant insistences the baroness laid claim to holding intercourse with certain supernatural and invisible beings who had the power to wreak vengeance on all those who offended her this fear it was combined with the fact that she had all the money and kept the strings of the bag pretty close where he was concerned that made the baron wait upon his wifes wishes as if he were her slave perhaps the softest spot in the baronesss heart was kept for her sickly and uninteresting son bobby bates whom she treated nevertheless with the roughness of a tigress for her cub she kept him still more under her surveillance than she did her husband and bobby though he had attained his nineteenth year dared not say boo to a goose in presence of his mamma as the cheese was handed round elinor leyton rose from her seat with an impatient gesture do let us get out of this atmosphere margaret she said in a low tone i really cannot stand it any longer the two ladies left the table and went out beyond the balcony to where a number of painted iron chairs and tables were placed on the digue for the accommodation of passing wayfarers who might wish to rest awhile and quench their thirst with limonade or lager beer i wonder who that girl is remarked mrs pullen as soon as they were out of hearing i dont know whether i like her or not but there is something rather distinguished looking about her do you think so said miss leyton i thought she only distinguished herself by eating like a cormorant i never saw anyone in society gobble her food in such a manner she made me positively sick was it as bad as that replied the more quiet mrs pullen in an indifferent manner her eyes were attracted just then by the perambulator which contained her baby and she rose to meet it how is she nurse she asked as anxiously as if she had not parted from the infant an hour before has she been awake all the time yes maam and looking about her like anything but she seems inclined to sleep now i thought it was about time to take her in o no not on such a warm lovely evening if she does go to sleep in the open air it will do her no harm leave her with me i want you to go indoors and find out the name of the young lady who sat opposite to me at dinner to day philippe understands english he will tell you why on earth do you want to know demanded miss leyton as the servant disappeared o i dont know i feel a little curious that is all she seems so young to be by herself elinor leyton answered nothing but walked across the digue and stood looking out over the sea she was anticipating the arrival of her fianc captain ralph pullen of the limerick rangers but he had delayed his coming to join them and she began to find heyst rather dull the visitors of the lion dor had finished their meal by this time and were beginning to reassemble on the digue preparatory to taking a stroll before they turned into one of the many cafs chantants which were situated at stated intervals in front of the sea amongst them came the baroness gobelli leaning heavily on a thick stick with one hand and her husbands shoulder with the other the couple presented an extraordinary appearance as they perambulated slowly up and down the digue she with her great height and bulk towering a head above her companion whilst he with a full sized torso and short legs a large hat crammed down upon his forehead and no neck to speak of so that the brim appeared to rest upon his shoulders was a ludicrous figure as he walked beside his wife bending under the weight of her support but yet she was actually proud of him notwithstanding his ill shaped figure the baron possessed one of those mild german faces with pale watery blue eyes a long nose and hair and beard of a reddish golden colour which entitled him in the estimation of some people to be called a handsome man and the baroness was never tired of informing the public that his head and face had once been drawn for that of some celebrated saint her own appearance was really comical for though she had plenty of means her want of taste or indifference to dress made everyone stare at her as she passed on the present occasion she wore a silk gown which had cost seventeen shillings a yard with a costly velvet cloak a bonnet which might have been rescued from the dustbin and cotton gloves with all her fingers out she shook her thick walking stick in miss leytons face as she passed by her and called out loud enough for everyone to hear and when is the handsome captain coming to join you miss leyton eh take care he aint running after some other gal when pensive i thought on my love ha ha ha elinor flushed a delicate pink but did not turn her head nor take any notice of her tormentor she detested the baroness with a perfectly bitter hatred and her proud cold nature revolted from her coarseness and familiarity tied to your brat again cried the baroness as she passed margaret pullen who was moving the perambulator gently to and fro by the handle so as to keep her infant asleep why didnt you put it in the tub as soon as it was born it would ave saved you a heap of trouble i often wish i had done so by that devil bobby ere where are you bobby im close behind you mamma replied the simple looking youth well dont you get running away from your father and me and winking at the gals theres time enough for that aint there gustave she concluded addressing the baron come along robert and mind what your mother tells you said the herr baron with his guttural german accent as the extraordinary trio pursued their way down the digue the baroness making audible remarks on everybody she met as they went margaret pullen sat where they had left her moving about the perambulator whilst her eyes like elinors were fixed upon the tranquil water the august sun had now quite disappeared and the indescribably faint and unpleasant odour which is associated with the dunes of heyst had begun to make itself apparent a still languor had crept over everything and there were indications of a thunderstorm in the air she was thinking of her husband colonel arthur pullen the elder brother of miss leytons fianc who was toiling out in india for baby and herself it had been a terrible blow to margaret to let him go out alone after only one year of happy wedded life but the expected advent of her little daughter at the time had prohibited her undertaking so long a journey and she had been compelled to remain behind and now baby was six months old and colonel pullen hoped to be home by christmas so had advised her to wait for his return but her thoughts were sad sometimes notwithstanding events happen so unexpectedly in this world who could say for certain that she and her husband would ever meet again that arthur would ever see his little girl or that she should live to place her in her fathers arms but such a state of feeling was morbid she knew and she generally made an effort to shake it off the nurse returning with the information she had sent her to acquire roused her from her reverie if you please maam the young ladys name is brandt and philippe says she came from london english i should never have guessed it observed mrs pullen she speaks french so well shall i take the baby now maam yes wheel her along the digue i shall come and meet you by and by as the servant obeyed her orders she called to miss leyton elinor come here what is it asked miss leyton seating herself beside her the new girls name is brandt and she comes from england would you have believed it i did not take sufficient interest in her to make any speculations on the subject i only observed that she had a mouth from ear to ear and ate like a pig what does it concern us where she comes from at that moment a mrs montague who with her husband was conveying a family of nine children over to brussels under the mistaken impression that they would be able to live cheaper there than in england came down the hotel steps with half a dozen of them clinging to her skirts and went straight up to margaret pullen o mrs pullen what is that young ladys name who sat opposite to you at dinner everybody is asking i hear she is enormously rich and travelling alone did you see the lace on her dress real valenciennes and the diamond rings she wore frederick says they must be worth a lot of money she must be someone of consequence i should imagine on the contrary my nurse tells me she is english and her name is brandt has she no friends here madame lamont says she arrived in company with another girl but they are located at different parts of the hotel it seems very strange does it not and it sounds very improper interposed elinor leyton i should say the less we have to say to her the better you never know what acquaintances you may make in a place like this when i look up and down the table dhte menagerie sometimes it makes me quite ill does it rejoined mrs montague i think its so amusing that baroness gobelli for instance dont mention her before me cried miss leyton in a tone of disgust the woman is not fit for civilised society she is rather common certainly and strange in her behaviour said mrs montague but she is very good natured she gave my little edward a louis yesterday i felt quite ashamed to let him take it that just proves her vulgarity exclaimed elinor leyton who had not a sixpence to give away herself it shows that she thinks her money will atone for all her other shortcomings she gave that miss taylor who left last week a valuable brooch off her own throat and poor payment too for all the dirty things she made her do and the ridicule she poured upon her i daresay this nouveau riche will try to curry favour with us by the same means at that moment the girl under discussion miss brandt appeared on the balcony which was only raised a few feet above where they sat she wore the same dress she had at dinner with the addition of a little fleecy shawl about her shoulders she stood smiling and looking at the ladies who had naturally dropped all discussion about her for a few moments and then she ventured to descend the steps between the rampant gilded lions and almost timidly as it seemed took up a position near them mrs pullen felt that she could not be so discourteous as to take no notice whatever of the new comer and so greatly to miss leytons disgust she uttered quietly good evening it was quite enough for miss brandt she drew nearer with smiles mantling over her face good evening isnt it lovely here so soft and warm something like the island but so much fresher she looked up and down the digue now crowded with a multitude of visitors and drew in her breath with a long sigh of content how gay and happy they all seem and how happy i am too do you know if i had my will what i should like to do she said addressing mrs pullen no indeed i should like to tear up and down this road as hard as ever i could throwing my arms over my head and screaming aloud the ladies exchanged glances of astonishment but margaret pullen could not forbear smiling as she asked their new acquaintance the reason why o because i am free free at last after ten long years of imprisonment i am telling you the truth i am indeed and you would feel just the same if you had been shut up in a horrid convent ever since you were eleven years old at the word convent the national protestant horror immediately spread itself over the faces of the three other ladies mrs montague gathered her flock about her and took them out of the way of possible contamination though she would have much preferred to hear the rest of miss brandts story and elinor leyton moved her chair further away but margaret pullen was interested and encouraged the girl to proceed in a convent i suppose then you are a roman catholic harriet brandt suddenly opened her slumbrous eyes i dont think so im not quite sure what i am of course ive had any amount of religion crammed down my throat in the convent and i had to follow their prayers whilst there but i dont believe my parents were catholics but it does not signify i am my own mistress now i can be what i like you have been so unfortunate then as to lose your parents o yes years ago that is why my guardian mr trawler placed me in the convent for my education and ive been there for ten years is it not a shame im twenty one now thats why im free you see the girl went on confidentially my parents left me everything and as soon as i came of age i entered into possession of it my guardian mr trawler who lives in jamaica did i tell you that ive come from jamaica thought i should live with him and his wife when i left the convent and pay them for my keep but i refused they had kept me too tight i wanted to see the world and life it was what i had been looking forward to so as soon as my affairs were settled i left the west indies and came over here they said you came from england in the hotel so i did the steamer came to london and i stayed there a week before i came on here but you are too young to travel about by yourself miss brandt english young ladies never do so said mrs pullen im not by myself exactly olga brimont who was in the convent with me came too but she is ill so shes upstairs she has come to her brother who is in brussels and we travelled together we had the same cabin on board the steamer and olga was very ill one night the doctor thought she was going to die i stayed with her all the time i used to sit up with her at night but it did her no good we stopped in london because we wanted to buy some dresses and things but she was not able to go out and i had to go alone her brother is away from brussels at present so he wrote her to stay in heyst till he could fetch her and as i had nowhere particular to go i came with her and she is better already she has been fast asleep all the afternoon and what will you do when your friend leaves you asked mrs pullen o i dont know travel about i suppose i shall go wherever it may please me are you not going to take a walk this evening demanded elinor leyton in a low voice of her friend wishing to put a stop to the conversation certainly i told nurse i would join her and baby by and by shall i fetch your hat then enquired miss leyton as she rose to go up to their apartments yes if you will dear please and my velvet cape in case it should turn chilly i will fetch mine too cried miss brandt jumping up with alacrity i may go with you maynt i ill just tell olga that im going out and be down again in five minutes and without waiting for an answer she was gone see what you have brought upon us remarked elinor in a vexed tone well it was not my fault replied margaret and after all what does it signify it is only a little act of courtesy to an unprotected girl i dont dislike her elinor she is very familiar and communicative but fancy what it must be like to find herself her own mistress and with money at her command after ten years seclusion within the four walls of a convent it is enough to turn the head of any girl i think it would be very churlish to refuse to be friendly with her well i hope it may turn out all right but you must remember how ralph cautioned us against making any acquaintances in a foreign hotel but i am not under ralphs orders though you may be and i should not care to go entirely by the advice of so very fastidious and exclusive a gentleman as he is my arthur would never find fault with me i am sure for being friendly with a young unmarried girl anyway margaret let me entreat you not to discuss my private affairs with this new protge of yours i dont want to see her saucer eyes goggling over the news of my engagement to your brother in law certainly i will not since you ask it but you hardly expect to keep it a secret when ralph comes down here do you why not why need anyone know more than that he is your husbands brother i expect they know a good deal more now said margaret laughing the news that you are the honourable elinor leyton and that your father is baron walthamstowe was known all over heyst the second day we were here and i have no doubt it has been succeeded by the interesting intelligence that you are engaged to marry captain pullen you cannot keep servants tongues from wagging you know i suppose not replied elinor with a moue of contempt however they will learn no more through me or ralph we are not arry and arriet to sit on the digue with our arms round each others waists still there are signs and symptoms said margaret laughing there will be none with us rejoined miss leyton indignantly as harriet brandt with a black lace hat on trimmed with yellow roses and a little fichu tied carelessly across her bosom ran lightly down the steps to join them chapter ii the digue was crowded by that time all heyst had turned out to enjoy the evening air and to partake in the gaiety of the place a band was playing on the movable orchestra which was towed by three skinny little donkeys day after day from one end of the digue to the other to night it was its turn to be in the middle where a large company of people was sitting on green painted chairs that cost ten centimes for hire each whilst children danced or ran madly round and round its base everyone had changed his or her seaside garb for more fashionable array even the children were robed in white frocks and gala hats and the whole scene was gay and festive harriet brandt ran from one side to the other of the digue as though she also had been a child everything she saw seemed to astonish and delight her first she was gazing out over the calm and placid water and next she was exclaiming at the bits of rubbish in the shape of embroidered baskets or painted shells exhibited in the shop windows which were side by side with the private houses and hotels forming a long line of buildings fronting the water she kept on declaring that she wanted to buy that or this and lamenting she had not brought more money with her you will have plenty of opportunities to select and purchase what you want to morrow said mrs pullen and you will be better able to judge what they are like they look better under the gas than they do by daylight i can assure you miss brandt o but they are lovely delightful replied the girl enthusiastically i never saw anything so pretty before do look at that little doll in a bathing costume with her cap in one hand her sponge in the other she is charming unique tout ce quil y a de plus beau she spoke french perfectly and when she spoke english it was with a slightly foreign accent that greatly enhanced its charm it made mrs pullen observe you are more used to speaking french than english miss brandt yes we always spoke french in the convent and it is in general use in the island but i thought i hoped that i spoke english like an englishwoman i am an englishwoman you know are you i was not quite sure brandt sounds rather german no my father was english his name was henry brandt and my mother was a miss carey daughter of one of the justices of barbadoes o indeed replied mrs pullen she did not know what else to say the subject was of no interest to her at that moment they encountered the nurse and perambulator and she naturally stopped to speak to her baby the sight of the infant seemed to drive miss brandt wild o is that your baby mrs pullen is that really your baby she exclaimed excitedly you never told me you had one o the darling the sweet dear little angel i love little white babies i adore them they are so sweet and fresh and clean so different from the little niggers who smell so nasty you cant touch them we never saw a baby in the convent and so few english children live to grow up in jamaica o let me hold her let me carry her i must she was about to seize the infant in her arms when the mother interposed no miss brandt please not this evening she is but half awake and has arrived at that age when she is frightened of strangers another time perhaps when she has become used to you but not now but i will be so careful of her pretty dear persisted the girl i will nurse her so gently that she will fall to sleep again in my arms come my little love come she continued to the baby who pouted her lips and looked as if she were going to cry leave her alone exclaimed elinor leyton in a sharp voice do you not hear what mrs pullen says that you are not to touch her she spoke so acridly that gentle margaret pullen felt grieved for the look of dismay that darted into harriet brandts face on hearing it o i am sorry i didnt mean she stammered with a side glance at margaret of course you did not mean anything but what was kind said mrs pullen miss leyton perfectly understands that and when baby is used to you i daresay she will be very grateful for your attentions but to night she is sleepy and tired and perhaps a little cross take her home nurse she went on and put her to bed good night my sweet and the perambulator passed them and was gone an awkward silence ensued between the three women after this little incident elinor leyton walked somewhat apart from her companions as if she wished to avoid all further controversy whilst margaret pullen sought some way by which to atone for her friends rudeness to the young stranger presently they came across one of the cafs chantants which are attached to the seaside hotels and which was brilliantly lighted up a large awning was spread outside to shelter some dozens of chairs and tables most of which were already occupied the windows of the hotel salon had been thrown wide open to accommodate some singers and musicians who advanced in turn and stood on the threshold to amuse the audience as they approached the scene a tenor in evening dress was singing a love song whilst the musicians accompanied his voice from the salon and the occupants of the chairs were listening with rapt attention how charming how delightful cried harriet brandt as they reached the spot i never saw anything like this in the island you appear never to have seen anything remarked miss leyton with a sneer miss brandt glanced apologetically at mrs pullen how could i see anything when i was in the convent she said i know there are places of entertainment in the island but i was never allowed to go to any and in london there was no one for me to go with i should so much like to go in there indicating the caf will you come with me both of you i mean and i will pay for everything i have plenty of money you know there is nothing to pay my dear unless you call for refreshment was margarets reply yes i will go with you certainly if you so much wish it elinor you wont mind will you but miss leyton was engaged talking to a monsieur and mademoiselle vieuxtemps an old brother and sister resident in the lion dor who had stopped to wish her good evening they were dear good old people but rather monotonous and dull and elinor had more than once ridiculed their manner of talking and voted them the most terrible bores mrs pullen concluded therefore that she would get rid of them as soon as courtesy permitted her to do so and follow her with a smile and a bow therefore to the vieuxtemps she pushed her way through the crowd with harriet brandt to where she perceived that three seats were vacant and took possession of them they were not good seats for hearing or seeing being to one side of the salon and quite in the shadow but the place was so full that she saw no chance of getting any others as soon as they were seated the waiter came round for orders and it was with difficulty that mrs pullen prevented her companion purchasing sufficient liqueurs and cakes to serve double the number of their company you must allow me to pay for myself miss brandt she said gravely or i will never accompany you anywhere again but i have lots of money pleaded the girl much more than i know what to do with it would be a pleasure to me it would indeed but mrs pullen was resolute and three limonades only were placed upon their table elinor leyton had not yet made her appearance and mrs pullen kept craning her neck over the other seats to see where she might be without success she cannot have missed us she observed i wonder if she can have continued her walk with the vieuxtemps o what does it signify said harriet drawing her chair closer to that of mrs pullen we can do very well without her i dont think shes very nice do you you must not speak of miss leyton like that to me miss brandt remonstrated margaret gently because she is a great friend of our family she had been going to say because she will be my sister in law before long but remembered elinors request in time and substituted the other sentence i dont think shes very kind though persisted the other it is only her manner miss brandt she does not mean anything by it but you are so different said the girl as she crept still closer i could see it when you smiled at me at dinner i knew i should like you at once and i want you to like me too so much it has been the dream of my life to have some friends that is why i would not stay in jamaica i dont like the people there i want friends real friends but you must have had plenty of friends of your own age in the convent that shows you dont know anything about a convent its the very last place where they will let you make a friend theyre afraid lest you should tell each other too much the convent i was in was an ursuline order and even the nuns were obliged to walk three and three never two together lest they should have secrets between them as for us girls we were never left alone for a single minute there was always a sister with us even at night walking up and down between the rows of beds pretending to read her prayers but with her eyes on us the whole time and her ears open to catch what we said i suppose they were afraid we should talk about lovers i think girls do talk about them when they can more in convents than in other places though they have never had any it would be so dreadful to be like the poor nuns and never have a lover to the end of ones days wouldnt it you would not fancy being a nun then miss brandt i oh dear no i would rather be dead twenty times over but they didnt like my coming out at all they did try so hard to persuade me to remain with them for ever one of them sister fodore told me i must never talk even with gentlemen if i could avoid it that they were all wicked and nothing they said was true and if i trusted them they would only laugh at me afterwards for my pains but i dont believe that do you certainly not replied margaret warmly the sister who told you so knew nothing about men my dear husband is more like an angel than a man and there are many like him you mustnt believe such nonsense miss brandt i am sure you never heard your parents say such a silly thing o my father and mother i never remember hearing them say anything replied miss brandt she had crept closer and closer to mrs pullen as she spoke and now encircled her waist with her arm and leaned her head upon her shoulder it was not a position that margaret liked nor one she would have expected from a woman on so short an acquaintance but she did not wish to appear unkind by telling miss brandt to move further away the poor girl was evidently quite unused to the ways and customs of society she seemed moreover very friendless and dependent so margaret laid her solecism down to ignorance and let her head rest where she had placed it resolving inwardly meanwhile that she would not subject herself to be treated in so familiar a manner again dont you remember your parents then she asked her presently hardly i saw so little of them said miss brandt my father was a great doctor and scientist i believe and i am not quite sure if he knew that he had a daughter o my dear what nonsense but it is true mrs pullen he was always shut up in his laboratory and i was not allowed to go near that part of the house i suppose he was very clever and all that but he was too much engaged in making experiments to take any notice of me and i am sure i never wanted to see him how very sad but you had your mother to turn to for consolation and company whilst she lived surely o my mother echoed harriet carelessly yes my mother well i dont think i knew much more of her either the ladies in jamaica get very lazy you know and keep a good deal to their own rooms the person there i loved best of all was old pete the overseer the overseer of the estate and niggers you know we had plenty of niggers on the coffee plantation regular african fellows with woolly heads and blubber lips and yellow whites to their eyes when i was a little thing of four years old pete used to let me whip the little niggers for a treat when they had done anything wrong it used to make me laugh to see them wriggle their legs under the whip and cry o dont miss brandt exclaimed margaret pullen in a voice of pain its true but they deserved it you know the little wretches always thieving or lying or something ive seen a woman whipped to death because she wouldnt work we think nothing of that sort of thing over there still you cant wonder that i was glad to get out of the island but i loved old pete and if he had been alive when i left i would have brought him to england with me he used to carry me for miles through the jungle on his back out in the fresh mornings and the cool dewy eves i had a pony to ride but i never went anywhere without his hand upon my bridle rein he was always so afraid lest i should come to any harm i dont think anybody else cared pete was the only creature who ever loved me and when i think of jamaica i remember my old nigger servant as the one friend i had there it is very very sad was all that mrs pullen could say she had become fainter and fainter as the girl leaned against her with her head upon her breast some sensation which she could not define nor account for some feeling which she had never experienced before had come over her and made her head reel she felt as if something or someone were drawing all her life away she tried to disengage herself from the girls clasp but harriet brandt seemed to come after her like a coiling snake till she could stand it no longer and faintly exclaiming miss brandt let go of me please i feel ill she rose and tried to make her way between the crowded tables towards the open air as she stumbled along she came against to her great relief her friend elinor leyton o elinor she gasped i dont know what is the matter with me i feel so strange so light headed do take me home miss leyton dragged her through the audience and made her sit down on a bench facing the sea why whats the matter demanded harriet brandt who had made her way after them is mrs pullen ill so it appears replied miss leyton coldly but how it happened you should know better than myself i suppose it is very warm in there no no i do not think so said margaret with a bewildered air we had chairs close to the side and miss brandt was telling me of her life in jamaica when such an extraordinary sensation came over me i cant describe it it was just as if i had been scooped hollow at this description harriet brandt burst into a loud laugh but elinor frowned her down it may seem a laughing matter to you miss brandt she said in the same cold tone but it is none to me mrs pullen is far from strong and her health is not to be trifled with however i shall not let her out of my sight again dont make a fuss about it elinor pleaded her friend it was my own fault if anyones i think there must be a thunderstorm in the air i have felt so oppressed all the evening or is the smell from the dunes worse than usual perhaps i ate something at dinner that disagreed with me i cannot understand it at all replied miss leyton you are not used to fainting or being suddenly attacked in any way however if you feel able to walk let us go back to the hotel miss brandt will doubtless find someone to finish the evening with harriet was just about to reply that she knew no one but themselves and to offer to take mrs pullens arm on the other side when elinor leyton cut her short no thank you miss brandt mrs pullen would i am sure prefer to return to the hotel alone with me you can easily join the vieuxtemps or any other of the visitors to the lion dor there is not much ceremony observed amongst the english at these foreign places it would be better perhaps if there were a little more come margaret take my arm and we will walk as slowly as you like but i shall not be comfortable until i see you safe in your own room so the two ladies moved off together leaving harriet brandt standing disconsolately on the digue watching their departure mrs pullen had uttered a faint good night to her but had made no suggestion that she should walk back with them and it seemed to the girl as if they both in some measure blamed her for the illness of her companion what had she done she asked herself as she reviewed what had passed between them that could in any way account for mrs pullens illness she liked her so much so very much she had so hoped she was going to be her friend she would have done anything and given anything sooner than put her to inconvenience in any way as the two ladies moved slowly out of sight harriet turned sadly and walked the other way she felt lonely and disappointed she knew no one to speak to and there was a cold empty feeling in her breast as though in losing her hold on margaret pullen she had lost something on which she had depended something of her feeling must have communicated itself to margaret pullen for after a minute or two she stopped and said i dont half like leaving miss brandt by herself elinor she is very young to be wandering about a town by night and alone nonsense returned miss leyton shortly a young lady who can make the voyage from jamaica to heyst on her own account knocking about in london for a week on the way is surely competent to walk back to the hotel without your assistance i should say that miss brandt was a very independent young woman perhaps by nature but she has been shut up in a convent for the best part of her life and that is not considered to be a good preparation for fighting ones way through the world shell be able to fight her own battles never fear was elinors reply just then they encountered bobby bates who lifted his cap as he hurried past them where are you going so fast mr bates said elinor leyton i am going back to the hotel to fetch mammas fur boa he answered they were passing a lighted lamp at the time and she noticed that the lads eyes were red and his features bore traces of distress are you ill she enquired quickly or in any trouble he halted for a minute in his stride no no not exactly he said in a low voice and then as if the words came from him against his will he went on but o i do wish someone would speak to mamma about the way she treats me its cruel to strike me with her stick before all those people as if i were a baby and to call me such names even the servant william laughs at me do all mothers do the same miss leyton ought a man to stand it quietly decidedly not cried elinor without hesitation o elinor remember she is his mother remonstrated margaret dont say anything to set him against her but i was nineteen last birthday continued the lad and sometimes she treats me in such a manner that i cant bear it the baron dare not say a word to her she swears at him so sometimes i think i will run away and go to sea no no you mustnt do that called miss leyton after him as he quickened his footsteps in the direction of the lion dor what an awful woman sighed mrs pullen fancy striking her own son in public and with that thick stick too i believe he had been crying i am sure he had replied her friend you can see the poor fellow is half witted and very weakly into the bargain i suppose she has beaten his brains to a pap what a terrible misfortune to have such a mother you should hear some of the stories madame lamont has to tell of her but how does she hear them through the barons servant william i suppose he says the baroness has often taken her stick to him and the other servants and thinks no more of swearing at them than a trooper they all hate her one day she took up a kitchen cleaver and advanced upon her coachman with it but he seized her by both arms and sat her down upon the fire whence she was only rescued after being somewhat severely burned it served her right exclaimed margaret laughing at the ludicrous idea but what a picture she must have presented seated on the kitchen range where can the woman have been raised what sort of a person can she be not what she pretends margaret you may be sure of that all her fine talk of lords and ladies is so much bunkum but i pity the poor little baron who is at all events inoffensive how can he put up with such a wife he must feel very much ashamed of her sometimes and yet he seems devoted to her he never leaves her side for a moment he is her walking stick her fetcher and carrier and her scribe i dont believe she can write a letter and yet she was talking at the table dhte yesterday of the duke of this and the earl of that and hinting at her having stayed at osborne and windsor of course they are falsehoods she has never seen the inside of a palace unless it was in the capacity of a char woman have you observed her hair it is as coarse as a horse tail and her hands bobby informed me the other day that his mamma took nines in gloves shes not a woman my dear shes a female elephant margaret was laughing still when they reached the steps of the lion dor you are very naughty and very scandalous elinor she said but you have done me a world of good my unpleasant feelings have quite gone i am quite capable of continuing our walk if you would like to do so no such thing madam replied miss leyton i am responsible for your well doing in arthurs absence upstairs and into bed you go unless you would like a cup of coffee and a chasse first that is the only indulgence i can grant you but mrs pullen declined the proffered refreshment and the two ladies sought their rooms in company chapter iii the next morning dawned upon a perfect august day the sun streamed brightly over every part of heyst turning the loose dry yellow sand from end to end of which not a stone or boulder was to be seen into a veritable cloth of gold the patient asses carrying their white covered saddles and tied to stakes were waiting in a row for hire whilst some dozen rosinantes called by courtesy horses were also of the company the sands were already strewn with children their short petticoats crammed into a pair of bathing drawers and their heads protected by linen hats or bonnets digging away at the dry sand as if their lives depended on their efforts the bathing machines painted in gay stripes of green red blue or orange were hauled down ready for action and the wooden tents which can be hired for the season at any foreign watering place were being swept out and arranged for the days use some of the more pretentious ones belonging to private families were surmounted by a gilt coronet the proud possession of the comte darblaye or the herr baron grumplestein sported flags moreover of france or germany and were screened from the eyes of the vulgar by lace or muslin curtains tied up with blue ribbons on the balcony of the lion dor where the visitors always took their breakfast were arranged tables piled with dishes of crevettes fresh from the sea pistolets and beautiful butter as white and tasteless as cream it was a delight to breakfast on the open balcony with the sea breeze blowing in ones face and in the intervals of eating prawns and bread and butter or perusing the morning papers to watch the cheerful scene below the baroness was there early of course she and her husband and the ill used bobby occupied a table to themselves whence she addressed her remarks to whomever she chose whether they wished to listen or not and the baron shelled her crevettes and buttered her pistolets for her margaret and elinor were rather later than usual for mrs pullen had not passed a good night and miss leyton would not have her disturbed harriet brandt was there as they appeared and beside her a pale unhealthy looking young woman whom she introduced as her friend and travelling companion olga brimont olga did not wish to come down she thought she would lie another day in bed but i made her get up and dress and i was right wasnt i mrs pullen i think the fresh air will do mademoiselle brimont more good than the close bedroom if she is strong enough to stand it replied margaret with a smile i am afraid you are still feeling weak she continued to the new comer i feel better than i did on board the steamer or in london said mademoiselle brimont she was an under sized girl with plain features and did not shew off to advantage beside her travelling companion did you suffer so much from sea sickness i can sympathise with you as i am a very bad sailor myself o no madame it was not the mal de mer i can hardly tell you what it was miss brandt and i occupied a small cabin together and perhaps it was because it was so small but i did not feel as if i could breathe there such a terrible oppression as though some one were sitting on my chest and such a general feeling of emptiness it was the same in london though miss brandt did all she could for me indeed she sat up with me all night till i feared she would be ill herself but i feel better now last night i slept for the first time since leaving jamaica that is right you will soon get well in this lovely air they all sat down at the same table and commenced to discuss their rolls and coffee margaret pullen glancing up once was struck by the look with which harriet brandt was regarding her it was so full of yearning affection almost of longing to approach her nearer to hear her speak to touch her hand it amused her to observe it she had heard of cases in which young unsophisticated girls had taken unaccountable affections for members of their own sex and trusted she was not going to form the subject for some such experience on miss brandts part the idea made her address her conversation more to mademoiselle brimont than to her companion of the evening before i suppose you and miss brandt were great friends in the convent she said o no madame we hardly ever saw each other whilst there except in chapel there is so much difference in our ages i am only seventeen and was in the lower school whilst miss brandt did hardly any lessons during the two last years she spent there but i was very glad to have her company across to england my brother would have sent for me last year if he could have heard of a lady to travel with me are you going on to join your brother soon he says he will fetch me madame as soon as he can be spared from his business he is my only relation my parents died like miss brandts in the west indies well you must be sure and get your looks back before he arrives said margaret kindly the head waiter now appeared with the letters from england amongst which was one for miss leyton in a firm manly handwriting with a regimental crest in blue and gold upon the envelope her face did not change in the least as she broke the seal although it came from her fianc captain ralph pullen elinor leytons was an exceptionally cold face and it matched her disposition she had attractive features a delicate nose carved as if in ivory brown eyes a fair rose tinted complexion and a small mouth with thin firmly closed lips her hair was bronze coloured and it was always dressed to perfection she had a good figure too with small hands and feet and she was robed in excellent taste she was pre eminently a woman for a man to be proud of as the mistress of his house and the head of his table she might be trusted never to say or do an unladylike thing before all she was cognisant of the obligations which devolved upon her as the daughter of lord walthamstowe and a member of the british aristocracy but in disposition she was undoubtedly cold and her fianc had already begun to find it out their engagement had come about neither of them quite knew how but he liked the idea of being connected with an aristocratic family and she was proud of having won a man for whom many caps had been pulled in vain he was considered to be one of the handsomest men of his generation and she was what people called an unexceptional match for him she was fond of him in her way but her way was a strange one she called the attitude she assumed towards him a proper and ladylike reserve but impartial spectators with stronger feelings would have deemed it indifference however like the proverbial dog in the manger whether she valued her rights in captain pullen or not miss leyton had no intention of permitting them to be interfered with she would have died sooner than admit that he was necessary to her happiness at the same time she considered it due to her dignity as a woman never to give in to his wishes when they opposed her own and often when they did not she displayed no particular enthusiasm when they met nor distress when they parted neither was she ever troubled by any qualms lest during their frequent separations he should meet some woman whom he might perchance prefer to herself they were engaged and when the proper time came they would marry meanwhile their private affairs concerned no one but themselves in short elinor leyton was not what is termed a mans woman all her friends if she had any were of her own sex having perused her letter she refolded and replaced it in its envelope without a glance in the direction of mrs pullen margaret thought she had a right to be informed of her brother in laws movements she had invited miss leyton to accompany her to heyst at his request and any preparations which might be requisite before he joined them would have to be made by herself is that from ralph what does he say she enquired in a low voice nothing in particular but when may we expect him at heyst next week he says in time for the bataille des fleurs are you not pleased of course i am replied elinor but without a sparkle or blush o if it were only my arthur that were coming exclaimed margaret fervently i should go mad with joy then it is just as well perhaps that it is not your arthur rejoined her companion as she put the letter into her pocket now bobby announced the strident tones of the baroness gobelli from the other side of the balcony leave off picking the shrimps youve ad more than enough aint bread and butter good enough for you whatll you want next but mamma pleaded the youth ive only had a few ive been shelling papas all this time put em down at once i say reiterated the baroness ere william take bobbys plate away hes ad plenty for this morning but i havent begun yet im hungry remonstrated bobby take is plate away roared the baroness ang it all cant you ear what i say mein tear mein tear ejaculated the herr baron in a subdued voice leave me alone gustave do you suppose i cant manage my own son he aint yours ed make imself ill if i didnt look after him take is plate away at once the man servant william lifted the plate of peeled shrimps and bread and butter from the table whilst bobby with a very red face rose from his seat and rushed down the steps to the beach he he he cackled the baroness thatll teach im not to fiddle with is food another time bobby dont care for an empty belly what a shame murmured margaret who was nothing if she was not a mother now the poor boy will go without his breakfast presently william was to be seen sneaking past the hotel with a parcel in his hands the baroness pounced upon him like a cat upon a mouse william she cried from the balcony what ave you got in your and summat of my own my lady bring it ere the man mounted the steps and stood before his mistress he held a parcel in his hands wrapped up in a table napkin open that parcel said the baroness indeed my lady its only the shrimps as master robert left behind him and i thought they would make me a little relish on the sands my lady open that parcel william obeyed and disclosed the rolls and butter and peeled shrimps just as bobby had left them you were going to take em down to bobby on the beach no indeed my lady confound you sir dont you lie to me exclaimed the baroness shaking her stick in his face ive ways and means of finding out things that you know nothing of throw that stuff into the road but my lady throw it into the road at once or you may take your months warning ang it all are you the mistress or am i the servant threw a glance of enquiry in the direction of the herr baron but the herr baron kept his face well down in his plate so after a pause he walked to the side and shook the contents of the napkin upon the digue and now dont you try any more of your tricks upon me or ill thrash you till your own mother wont know you you leave bobby alone for the future or itll be the worst days work you ever did remember that very good my lady replied william but as he left the balcony he gave a look at the other occupants which well conveyed his feelings on the subject i should not be surprised to hear that that woman had been murdered by her servants some day said margaret to elinor leyton no and i should not be sorry i feel rather like murdering her myself but let us go down to the sands margaret and try to find the disconsolate bobby im not afraid of his mother if william is and if he wants something to eat i shall give it him they fetched their hats and parasols and having left the hotel by a side entrance found their way down to the sands it was a pretty sight there and in some cases a comical one the bathing machines were placed some sixty or more feet from the water according to the tide and their occupants clad in bathing costumes had to run the gauntlet of all the eyes upon the beach as they traversed that distance in order to reach the sea to some visitors especially the english ones this ordeal was rather trying to watch them open a crevice of the machine door and regard the expectant crowd with horror then after some hesitation goaded on by the cries of the bathing women that the time was passing to see them emerge with reluctant feet sadly conscious of their unclothed condition and of the unsightly corns and bunions which disfigured their feet to say nothing of the red and blue tint which their skin had suddenly assumed was to find it almost impossible to refrain from laughter the very skinny and knuckle kneed ones the very fat and bulging ones the little fair men who looked like bobbys peeled shrimps and the muscular black and hairy ones who looked like bears escaped from a menagerie these types and many others our ladies could not help being amused at though they told each other it was very improper all the time but everybody had to pass through the same ordeal and everybody submitted to it and tried to laugh off their own humiliation by ridiculing the appearance of their neighbours margaret and elinor were never tired of watching the antics of the belgians and germans whilst they were what they called bathing the fuss they made over entering two feet of water the way in which they gasped and puffed as they caught it up in their hands and rubbed their backs and chests with it the reluctance with which the ladies were dragged by their masculine partners into the briny as if they expected to be overwhelmed and drowned by the tiny waves which rippled over their toes and made them catch their breath and lastly when they were convinced there was no danger to see them men and women fat and thin take hands and dance round in a ring as if they were playing at mulberry bush was too delightful but if one bather generally an englishman more daring than his fellows went in for a good swim the coast guardsmen ran along the breakwater shouting gare gare until he came out again they are funnier than ever to day remarked margaret after a while i wonder what they will say when they see ralph swimming out next week they will be frightened to death all the pullens are wonderful swimmers i have seen anthony pennell perform feats in the water that made my blood run cold and ralph is famous for his diving the topic did not appear to interest elinor she reverted to the subject of anthony is that the literary man the cousin yes have you not met him never i am sure you would like him he is such a fine fellow not such a beauty man as ralph perhaps but quite as tall and stalwart his last book was a tremendous success ralph has never mentioned him to me though i knew he had a cousin of that name well if you wont be offended at my saying so ralph has always been a little jealous of anthony at least so arthur says he outstripped him at school and college and the feeling had its foundation there and anyone might be jealous of him now he has shewn himself to be a genius i dont like geniuses as a rule replied elinor they are so conceited i believe that is bobby bates sitting out there on the breakwater i will go and see if he is still hungry give the poor boy a couple of francs to get himself a breakfast in one of the restaurants said margaret he will enjoy having a little secret from his terrible mamma she had not been alone long before the nurse came up to her with the perambulator piled up with toys but no baby margarets fears were excited at once nurse nurse what is the matter where is the baby she exclaimed in tones of alarm nothings the matter maam pray dont frighten yourself replied the servant its only that the young ladies have got baby and theyve bought her all these toys and sent me on to tell you that they would be here directly the perambulator was filled with expensive playthings useless for an infant of six months old dolls woolly sheep fur cats and gaily coloured balls with a huge box of chocolates and caramels were piled one on the top of the other but mrs pullens face expressed nothing but annoyance you had no right to let them take her nurse you had no right to let the child out of your sight go back at once and bring her here to me i am exceedingly annoyed about it here are the young ladies maam and you had better lay your orders on them yourself for they wouldnt mind me said the nurse somewhat sullenly in another minute harriet brandt and olga brimont had reached her side the former panting under the weight of the heavy infant but with her face scarlet with the excitement of having captured her o miss brandt cried margaret you have given me such a fright you must never take baby away from her nurse again please as i told you last night she is afraid of strangers and generally cries when they try to take her come to me my little one she continued holding out her arms to the child come to mother and tell her all about it but the baby seemed to take no notice of the fond appeal it had its big eyes fixed upon miss brandts face with a half awed half interested expression o no dont take her away said harriet eagerly she is so good with me i assure you she is not frightened in the least bit are you my little love she added addressing the infant and nurse tells me her name is ethel so i have ordered them to make her a little gold bangle with ethel on it and she must wear it for my sake darling little creature but miss brandt you must not buy such expensive things for her indeed she is too young to appreciate them besides i do not like you to spend so much money on her but why shouldnt i what am i to do with my money if i may not spend it on others but such a quantity of toys surely you have not bought all these for my baby of course i have i would have bought the whole shop if it would have pleased her she likes the colours little darling look how earnestly she gazes at me with her lovely grey eyes as if she knew what a little beauty i think her o you pretty dear you sweet pink and white baby mrs pullen felt somewhat annoyed as she saw the dolls and furry animals which were strewn upon the sands at the same time she was flattered by the admiration exhibited of her little daughter and the endearments lavished upon her she considered them all well deserved as what mother would not and it struck her that harriet brandt must be a kindhearted as well as a generous girl to spend so much money on a strangers child she certainly does seem wonderfully good with you she observed presently i never knew her so quiet with anybody but her nurse or me before isnt it marvellous nurse it is maam baby do seem to take surprisingly to the young lady and perhaps i might go into the town as she is so quiet and get the darning wool for your stockings o no no we must not let miss brandt get tired of holding her she is too heavy to be nursed for long indeed indeed she is not cried harriet do let me keep her mrs pullen whilst nurse goes on her errand it is the greatest pleasure to me to hold her i should like never to give her up again margaret smiled very well nurse since miss brandt is so kind you can go as the servant disappeared she said to harriet mind you give her to me directly she makes your arm ache i am more used to the little torment than you are how can you call her by such a name even in fun what would i not give to have a baby of my very own to do what i liked with i would never part with it night nor day i would teach it to love me so much that it should never be happy out of my sight but that would be cruel my dear your baby might have to part with you as you have had to part with your mother at the mention of her mother something came into miss brandts eyes which margaret could not define it was not anger nor sorrow nor remorse it was a kind of sullen contempt it was something that made mrs pullen resolve not to allude to the subject again the incident made her examine harriets eyes more closely than she had done before they were beautiful in shape and colour but they did not look like the eyes of a young girl they were deeply impenetrably black with large pellucid pupils but there was no sparkle nor brightness in them though they were underlaid by smouldering fires which might burst forth into flame at any moment and which seemed to stir and kindle and then go out again when she spoke of anything that interested her there was an attraction about the girl which mrs pullen acknowledged without wishing to give in to she could not keep her eyes off her she seemed to hypnotise her as the snake is said to hypnotise the bird but it was an unpleasant feeling as if the next moment the smouldering fire would burst forth into flame and overwhelm her but watching her play with and hearing her talk to her baby margaret put the idea away from her and only thought how kindly natured she must be to take so much trouble for another womans child it was not long before miss leyton found her way back to them and as her glance fell upon harriet brandt and the baby she elevated her eyebrows where is the nurse she demanded curtly she has gone to the shops to see if she can get some darning wool and miss brandt was kind enough to offer to keep baby for her till she returns and o elinor look what beautiful toys miss brandt has bought her isnt she too kind altogether too kind responded elinor by the way margaret i found our friend and transacted the little business we spoke of but he says his mamma has ordered him to remain here till she comes down to see him bathe and dry him i suppose with her own hands and do i not descry her fairy feet indenting the sands at this very moment and bearing down in our direction you could hardly mistake her for anything else replied mrs pullen in another minute the baroness was upon them hullo she called out youre just in time to see gustave bathe he looks lovely in his bathing costume his legs are as white as your babys mrs pullen and twice as well worth looking at mein tear mein tear remonstrated the baron dont be a fool gustave you know its the truth and the loveliest feet miss leyton smaller than yours i bet wheres that devil bobby im going to give im a dousing for his villainy this morning i can tell you once i get is ead under water it wont come up again in a hurry i expect es pretty ungry by this time but e dont get a centime out of me for cakes to day ill teach im not to stuff imself like a pig again come gustave eres a machine for you get me a chair that i may sit outside it now well ave some fun she added with a wink at mrs pullen let us move on to the breakwater said margaret to elinor leyton and the whole party got up and walked some little distance off ah you dont hoodwink me screamed the baroness after them youve got glasses with you and youre going to ave a good squint at gustaves legs through em i know youd better ave stayed ere like honest women and said you enjoyed the sight o margaret said miss leyton with a look of horror if it had not been for the bataille de fleurs and the other thing i should have said for goodness sake let us move on to ostende or blankenburghe with the least possible delay that woman will be the death of me yet im sure she will notwithstanding which they could not help laughing in concert a little later on to see the unwilling bobby dragged down by william to bathe and as he emerged from his machine helpless and half naked to watch his elephantine mother chase him with her stout stick in hand and failing to catch him in time slip on the wet sand and flounder in the waves herself from which plight it looked very much as though her servant instead of rescuing her did his best to push her further in before he dragged her drenched and disordered on dry land again chapter iv the baroness gobellis temperament was as inconsistent as her dress under the garb of jocose good humour which often degenerated to horse play she concealed a jealous and vindictive disposition which would go any lengths when offended to revenge itself she was wont to say that she never forgot nor forgave an injury and that when she had her knife as she termed it in a man she knew how to bide her time but that when the time came she turned it these bloodthirsty sentiments coupled with an asseveration which was constantly on her lips that when she willed the death of anyone he died and that she had powers at her command of which no one was aware but herself frightened many timid and ignorant people into trying to propitiate so apparently potent a mortal and generally kow towing before her to such votaries so long as they pleased her madame gobelli was used to shew her favour by various gifts of dresses jewelry or money according to their circumstances for in some cases she was lavishly generous but she soon tired of her acquaintances and replaced them by fresh favourites the hints that she gave forth regarding herself and her antecedents were too extraordinary to gain credence except from the most ignorant of her auditors but the baroness always spoke in parables and left no proof of what she meant to be brought up against her this proved that if she were clever she was still more cunning the hints she occasionally gave of being descended from royal blood though on the wrong side of the blanket and of the connection being acknowledged privately if not publicly by the existing members of the reigning family were received with open mouths by people of her own class but rejected with scorn by such as were acquainted with those whom she affected to know it was remarkable also and only another proof that whatever her real birth and antecedents the baroness gobelli was unique that notwithstanding her desire to be considered noble by birth if not by law she never shirked the fact that the baron was in trade on the contrary she rather made a boast of it and used to relate stories bringing it into ridicule with the greatest gusto the fact being that baron gobelli was the head of a large firm of export bootmakers trading in london under the name of fantaisie et cie the boots and shoes of which though professedly french were all manufactured in germany where the firm maintained an enormous factory the baroness could seldom be in the company of anyone for more than five minutes without asking them where they bought their boots and shoes and recommending them to fantaisie et cie as the best makers in london she wanted to be first in everything in popularity in notice and in conversation if she could not attract attention by her personality she startled people by her vulgarity if she could not reign supreme by reason of her supposed birth she would do so by boots and shoes if nothing else and if anybody slighted her or appeared to discredit her statements he or she was immediately marked down for retaliation harriet brandt had not been many days in heyst before the baroness had become jealous of the attention which she paid mrs pullen and her child she saw that the girl was attractive she heard that she was rich and she liked to have pretty and pleasant young people about her when at home they drew men to the house and reflected a sort of credit upon herself and she determined to get harriet away from margaret pullen and chain her to her own side instead the baroness hated miss leyton quite as much as elinor hated her she was quick of hearing and very intuitive she had caught more than one of the young ladys uncomplimentary remarks upon herself and had divined still more than she had heard she had observed her sympathy with bobby also and that she encouraged him in his boyish rebellion for all these reasons she had her knife into miss leyton and was waiting her opportunity to turn it and she foresaw with the assistance perhaps of the powers of darkness of whose acquaintance she was so proud that she would be enabled to take her revenge on elinor leyton through harriet brandt but her first advances to the latter were suavity itself she was not going to frighten the girl by shewing her claws until she had stroked her down the right way with her pattes de velours she came upon her one morning as she sat upon the sands with little ethel in her arms the nurse was within speaking distance busy with her needlework and the infant seemed so quiet with miss brandt and she took such evident pleasure in nursing it that mrs pullen no longer minded leaving them together and had gone for a stroll with miss leyton along the digue so the baroness found harriet comparatively speaking alone so youre playing at nursemaid again she commenced in her abrupt manner you seem to have taken a wonderful fancy to that child she is such a good little creature replied harriet she is no trouble whatever she sleeps half the day miss brandt had a large box of chocolates beside her into which she continually dipped her hand her mouth too was stained with the delicate sweetmeat she was always eating either fruit or bonbons she handed the box now with a timid air to the baroness do you care for chocolate madame she asked the baroness did not like to be called madame according to the french fashion she thought it derogated from her dignity she wished everyone to address her as my lady and considered she was cheated out of her rights when it was omitted but she liked chocolate almost as well as harriet did thank you ill ave a few she said grabbing about a dozen in her huge hand at the first venture what a liking for candies the amurricans seem to ave introduced into england i can remember the time when you never saw such a thing as sweets in the palace i dont think they were allowed and now theyre all over the place i shouldnt wonder if her majesty hasnt a box or two in her private apartments and as for the princesses well the palace her majesty echoed miss brandt opening her dark eyes very wide as i tell em continued the baroness they wont ave a tooth left amongst the lot of em soon what are you staring at but but do you go to the queens palace demanded harriet incredulously as well she might not unless im sent for you may take your oath i aint fond enough of em for all that besides windsors orribly damp and dont suit me at all but you mustnt go and repeat what i tell you in the hotel it might give offence in high places if i was known to talk of it you see theres some of em has never seen me since i married the baron being in trade they thought e wasnt good enough for me ive eard that when lady morton the dowager countess you know was asked if she ad seen me lately she called out loud enough for the whole room to ear do you mean the woman that married the boot man no i avent seen er and i dont mean to either ha ha ha but i can afford to laugh at all that my dear but i dont quite understand said harriet brandt with a bewildered look why the baron deals in shoe leather avent you eard it i suppose weve got the largest manufactory in germany covers four acres of ground i give you my word shoe leather again ejaculated harriet brandt not knowing what to say why yes of course all the aristocracy go in for trade now a days its the fashion theres the viscountess gormsby keeps a bonnet shop and lord charles snowe as a bakery and lady harrison as an old curiosity shop and stands about it dusting tables and chairs all day but how can you know anything about it just coming from the west indies and all those orrid blacks aint you glad to find yourself amongst christians again this is the first time i ever left jamaica said miss brandt i was born there but you wont die there or im much mistaken youre too good to be wasted on jamaica when are you going back to england oh i dont know ive hardly thought about it yet not while mrs pullen stays here though why youre not tied to er apron string surely whats she to you she is very kind and i have no friends replied miss brandt the baroness burst into a coarse laugh you wont want for friends once you shew your face in england i can tell you id like to ave you at our ouse the red ouse we call it princess but there i mustnt tell you er name or itll go through the hotel and she says things to me that she never means to go further but she said the other day that she preferred the red ouse to windsor and for comfort and cheerfulness so she may i suppose it is very beautiful then observed harriet you must judge for yourself replied the baroness with a broad smile when you come to london youll be your own mistress there i suppose and not so tied as you are here i call it a shame to keep you dancing attendance on that brat when theres a nurse whose business it is to look after er o but indeed it is my own wish said the girl as she cuddled the sleeping baby to her bosom and laid her lips in a long kiss upon its little mouth i asked leave to nurse her she loves me and even nurse cannot get her off to sleep as i can and it is so beautiful to have something to love you madame gobelli in the convent i felt so cold so lonely if ever i took a liking to a girl we were placed in separate rooms it is what i have longed for to come out into the world and find someone to be a friend and to love me only me and all for myself madame gobelli laughed again well youve only got to shew those eyes of yours to get plenty of people to love you and let you love them in return that is if the men count in your estimation of whats beautiful harriet raised her eyes and looked at the woman who addressed her there was the innocence of ignorance in them as yet but the slumbering fire in their depths proved of what her nature would be capable when it was given the opportunity to shew itself hers was a passionate temperament yearning to express itself panting for the love which it had never known and ready to burst forth like a tree into blossom directly the sun of desire and reciprocity shone upon it the elder woman who had not been without her little experiences in her day recognised the feeling at once and thought that she would not give a fig for the virtue of any man who was subjected to its influence i dont think that youll confine your attentions to babies long quoth the baroness as she encountered that glance how do you know said her young companion ah its enough that i do know my dear i ave ways and means of knowing things that i keep to myself i ave friends about me too who can tell me everything who can elp me if i choose to give life and fortune to one person and trouble and death to another and woe to them that offend me thats all but if the baroness expected to impress miss brandt with her hints of terror she was mistaken harriet did not seem in the least astonished she had been brought up by old pete and the servants on her fathers plantation to believe in witches and the evil eye and obeah and the whole cult of devil worship i know all about that she remarked presently but you cant do me either good or harm i want nothing from you and i never shall dont you be too sure of that replied madame gobelli nodding her head ive brought young women more luck than enough with their lovers before now yes and married women into the bargain if it adnt been for me lady there it nearly slipped out didnt it but theres a certain countess who would never ave been a widow and married for the second time to the man of er eart if i adnt elped er and she knows it too by the way ow do you like miss leyton not at all replied harriet quickly she is not a bit like mrs pullen so cold and stiff and disagreeable she hardly ever speaks to me is it true that shes the daughter of a lord as madame lamont says and is it that makes her so proud shes the daughter of lord walthamstowe but thats nothing theyve got no money er people live down in the country quite in a beggarly manner a gal with a fortune of er own would rank eads and eads above er in society theres not much thought of beside money nowadays i can tell you why does she stay with mrs pullen then are they any relation to each other demanded harriet relation no i expect shes just brought er ere out of charity and because she couldnt afford to go to the seaside by erself she had been about to announce the projected relationship between the two ladies when a sudden thought struck her captain ralph pullen was expected to arrive in heyst in a few days thus much she had ascertained through the landlady of the lion dor she knew by repute that he was considered to be one of the handsomest and most conceited men in the limerick rangers a corps which was noted for its good looking officers it might be better for the furtherance of her plans against the peace of miss leytons mind she thought to keep her engagement to captain pullen a secret at all events no one could say it was her business to make it public she looked in harriet brandts yearning passionate eyes and decided that it would be strange if any impressionable young man could be thrown within their influence without having his fidelity a little shaken especially if affianced to such a cold uninteresting bit of goods as elinor leyton like the parrot in the story though she said nothing she thought a deal and inwardly rumbled with half suppressed laughter as she pictured the discomfiture of the latter young lady if by any chance she should find her fiancs attentions transferred from herself to the little west indian you seem amused madame said harriet presently i was thinking of you and all the young men who are doomed to be slaughtered by those eyes of yours said the baroness youd make mischief enough amongst my friends i bet if i ad you at the red ouse harriet felt flattered and consciously pleased she had never received a compliment in the convent no one had ever hinted that she was pretty and she had had no opportunity of hearing it since do you think i am handsome then she enquired with a heightened colour i think youre a deal worse i think youre dangerous replied her new friend and i wouldnt trust you with the baron any further than i could see you o how can you say so exclaimed the girl though she was pleased all the same to hear it said i wouldnt and thats the truth gustaves an awful fellow after the gals i ave to keep a tight old on im i can tell you and the more you keep out of is way the better i shall be pleased youll make a grand match some day if youre only sharp and keep your eyes open what do you call a grand match asked harriet as she let the nurse take the sleeping child from her arms without remonstrance why a lord or an honourable at the very least since you ave money of your own its money theyre all after in these times you know why we ave dooks and markisses marrying all sorts of gals from amurrica gals whose fathers made their money in oil or medicine or electricity or any other dodge so long as they made it and why shouldnt you do the same as the amurrican gals you have money i know and a goodish lot i fancy added the baroness with her cunning eyes fixed upon the girl as if to read her thoughts o yes replied harriet mr trawler my trustee said it was too much for a young woman to have under her own control but i dont know anything about the value of money never having had it to spend before i am to have fifteen hundred pounds every year is that a good deal quite enough to settle you in life my dear exclaimed the baroness who immediately thought what a good thing it would be if miss brandt could be persuaded to sink her capital in the boot trade and all under your own control too you are a lucky young woman i know alf a dozen lords not to say princes who would jump at you princes cried harriet unable to believe her ears certainly not english ones of course but german which are quite as good after all for a prince is a prince any day theres prince adalbert of waxsquiemer and prince harold of muddlesheim and prince loris of taxelmein and ever so many more and theyre in and out of the red ouse twenty times a day but dont you be in an urry dont take the first that offers miss brandt pick and choose flirt with whom you like and ave your fun but wait and look about you a bit before you decide the prospect was too dazzling harriet brandts magnificent eyes were opened to their widest extent her cheeks flushed with expectation both life and light had flashed into her countenance her soul was expanding her nature was awakening it shone through every feature the baroness had had no idea she was so beautiful and the hungry yearning look was more accentuated than before it seemed as if she were on the alert watching for something like a panther awaiting the advent of its prey it was a look that women would have shrunk from and men welcomed and eagerly responded to i should like to go and see you when i go to england very much she articulated slowly and so you shall my dear the baron and me will be very glad to ave you on a visit and you mustnt let that capital of yours lie idle you know if its in your own ands you must make it yield double to what it does now you consult gustave es a regular business man and knows ow many beans make five ell tell you whats best to be done with it ell be a good friend to you and you can trust im with everything thank you replied the girl but she still seemed to be lost in a kind of reverie her gaze was fixed her full crimson lips were slightly parted her slender hands kept nervously clasping and unclasping each other well you are andsome and no mistake exclaimed the baroness you remind me a little of the duchess of bewlay before she was married the first wife i mean the second is a poor pale faced sandy aired creature ow the dook can stomach er after the other i cant make out the first duchesss mother was a great flame of my grandfather the dook of however i mustnt tell you that its a state secret and i might get into trouble at court youd better not say i mentioned it but harriet brandt was not in a condition to remember or repeat anything she was lost in a dream of the possibilities of the future the bell for djeuner roused them at last and brought them to their feet they resembled each other in one particular they were equally fond of the pleasures of the table the little baron appeared dutifully to afford his clumsy spouse the benefit of his support in climbing the hillocks of shifting sand which lay between them and the hotel and miss brandt sped swiftly on her way alone ive been aving a talk with that gal brandt chuckled the baroness to her husband shes a regular green orn and swallows everything you tell er ive been stuffing er up that she ought to marry a prince with er looks and money and she quite believes it but she aint bad looking when she colours up and i expect shes rather a warm customer and if she takes a fancy to a man e wont well know ow to get out of it and if he tries to shell make the fur fly ha ha ha better leave it alone better leave it alone said the stolid german who had had more than one battle to fight already on account of his wifes match making propensities and considered her quite too clumsy an artificer to engage in so delicate a game chapter v there was a marked difference observable in the manner of harriet brandt after her conversation with the baroness hitherto she had been shy and somewhat diffident the seclusion of her conventual life and its religious teachings had cast a veil as it were between her and the outer world and she had not known how to behave nor how much she might venture to do on being first cast upon it but madame gobellis revelations concerning her beauty and her prospects had torn the veil aside and placed a talisman in her hands against her secret fear she was beautiful and dangerous she might become a princess if she played her cards well the knowledge changed the whole face of nature for her she became assured confident and anticipatory she began to frequent the company of the baroness and without neglecting her first acquaintances mrs pullen and her baby spent more time in the gobellis private sitting room than in the balcony or public salon a fact for which margaret did not hesitate to declare herself grateful i do not know how it is she confided to elinor leyton i rather like the girl and i would not be unkind to her for all the world but there is something about her that oppresses me i seem never to have quite lost the sensation she gave me the first evening that she came here her company enervates me i get neuralgia whenever we have been a short time together and she leaves me in low spirits and more disposed to cry than laugh and no wonder said her friend considering that she has that detestable school girl habit of hanging upon ones arm and dragging one down almost to the earth how you have stood it so long beats me such a delicate woman as you are too it proves how selfish miss brandt must be not to have seen that she was distressing you well it will take a large amount of expended force to drag madame gobelli to the ground said margaret laughing so i hope miss brandt will direct that portion of her attention to her and leave me only the residue poor girl she seems to have had so few people to love or to love her during her lifetime that she is glad to practise on anyone who will reciprocate her affection did you see the baroness kissing her this morning i saw the baroness scrubbing her beard against miss brandts cheek if you call that kissing replied elinor the baroness never kisses i have noticed her salute poor bobby in the morning exactly in the same manner i have a curiosity to know if it hurts why dont you try it said margaret no thank you i am not so curious as all that but the gobellis and miss brandt have evidently struck up a great friendship she will be the recipient of the baronesss cast off trinkets and laces next she is too well off for that elinor madame lamont told me she has a fortune in her own right of fifteen hundred a year she will want it all to gild herself with said elinor margaret pullen looked at miss leyton thoughtfully did she really mean what she said or did her jealousy of the west indian heiress render her capable of uttering untruths surely she must see that harriet brandt was handsome growing handsomer indeed every day with the pure sea air tinting her cheeks with a delicate flush like the inside of a shell and that her beauty joined to her money would render her a tempting morsel for the men and a formidable rival for the women i do not think you would find many people to agree with your opinion elinor she said after a pause in answer to miss leytons last remark well i think shes altogether odious replied her friend with a toss of her head i thought it the first time i saw her and i shall think it to the last it was the day that captain ralph pullen was expected to arrive in heyst and the two ladies were preparing to go to the station to meet him the baroness has at all events done you one good turn continued miss leyton she has delivered you for a few hours from your old man of the sea what have you been doing with yourself all the morning i expected you to meet me on the sands after i had done bathing i have not stirred out elinor i am uneasy about baby she does not seem at all well i have been waiting your return to ask you whether i had not better send for a doctor to see her but i am not sure if there is such a thing in heyst sure to be but dont send unless it is absolutely necessary what is the matter with her the nurse was sitting by the open window with little ethel on her lap the infant looked much the same as usual a little paler perhaps but in a sound sleep and apparently enjoying it she does not seem ill to me continued elinor is she in any pain not at all miss said the nurse and begging the mistresss pardon i am sure she is frightening herself without cause baby is cutting two more teeth and she feels the heat thats all why are you frightened margaret asked miss leyton because her sleep is unnatural i am sure of it replied mrs pullen she slept all yesterday and has hardly opened her eyes to day it is more like torpor than sleep we can hardly rouse her to take her bottle and you know what a lively restless little creature she has always been but her teeth argued elinor leyton surely her teeth account for everything i know my sister lady armisdale says that nothing varies so quickly as teething children that theyre at the point of death one hour and quite well the next and she has five so she ought to know thats quite right miss interposed the nurse respectfully and you can hardly expect the dear child to be lively when shes in pain she has a little fever on her too if she were awake she would only be fretful i am sure that the best medicine for her is sleep you hear what nurse says margaret but if you are nervous why not send for a doctor to see her we can ask madame lamont as we go downstairs who is the best here and call on him as we go to the station or we can telegraph to bruges for one if you think it would be better o no no i will not be foolish i will try and believe that you and nurse know better than myself i will wait at all events until to morrow where has baby been this morning she was with miss brandt on the sands miss replied the nurse since you are so anxious about ethel margaret i really wonder that you should trust her with a stranger like miss brandt perhaps she let the sun beat on her head o no elinor nurse was with them all the time i would not let miss brandt or anyone take baby away alone but she is so good natured and so anxious to have her that i dont quite know how to refuse perhaps she has been stuffing the child with some of her horrid chocolates or caramels she is gorging them all day long herself i know my duty too well for that miss said the nurse resentfully i wouldnt have allowed it the dear baby did not have anything to eat at all well youre both on her side evidently so i will say no more concluded miss leyton at the same time if i had a child id sooner trust it to a wild beast than the tender mercies of miss brandt but its past four oclock margaret if we are to reach the entrept in time we must be going mrs pullen hastily assumed her hat and mantle and prepared to accompany her friend they had opened the door and were about to leave the room when a flood of melody suddenly poured into the apartment it proceeded from a room at the other end of the corridor and was produced by a mandoline most skilfully played the silvery notes in rills and trills and chords such as might have been evolved from a fairy harp arrested the attention of both miss leyton and mrs pullen they had scarcely expressed their wonder and admiration to each other at the skilful manipulation of the instrument which evinced such art as they had never heard before except in public when the strings of the mandoline were accompanied by a young fresh contralto voice o hush hush cried elinor with her finger on her lip as the rich mellow strains floated through the corridor i dont think i ever heard such a lovely voice before whose on earth can it be the words of the song were in spanish and the only one they could recognise was the refrain of seralie seralie but the melody was wild pathetic and passionate and the singers voice was touching beyond description some professional must have arrived at the hotel said margaret i am sure that is not the singing of an amateur but i hope she will not practise at night and keep baby awake elinor laughed o you mother she said i thought you were lamenting just now that your ewe lamb slept too much for my part i should like to be lulled to sleep each night by just such strains as those listen margaret she has commenced another song ah gounods delicious ave maria how beautiful i dont profess to know much about music said margaret but it strikes me that the charm of that singing lies more in the voice than the actual delivery whoever it is must be very young whoever it proceeds from it is charming repeated elinor how ralph would revel in it nothing affects him like music it is the only thing which makes me regret my inability to play or sing but i am most curious to learn who the new arrival is ah here is mademoiselle brimont she continued as she caught sight of olga brimont slowly mounting the steep staircase mademoiselle do you happen to know who it is who owns that lovely voice mrs pullen and i are perfectly enchanted with it olga brimont coloured a little she had never got over her shyness of the english ladies particularly of the one who spoke so sharply but she answered at once it is harriet brandt didnt you know that she sang miss leyton took a step backward her face expressed the intensest surprise not to say incredulity harriet brandt impossible she ejaculated indeed it is she repeated olga she always sang the solos in the convent choir they used to say she had the finest voice in the island o yes it is harriet really and she passed on to her own apartment do you believe it said elinor leyton turning almost fiercely upon mrs pullen how can i do otherwise replied margaret in the face of mademoiselle brimonts assertion but it is strange that we have heard nothing of miss brandts talent before has she ever mentioned the fact to you that she could sing never but there has been no opportunity there is no instrument here and we have never talked of such a thing only fancy her possessing so magnificent a voice what a gift she might make her fortune by it if she needed to do so well she ought to be able to sing with that mouth of hers remarked miss leyton almost bitterly as she walked into the corridor she was unwilling to accord harriet brandt the possession of a single good attribute as the ladies traversed the corridor they perceived that others had been attracted by the singing as well as themselves and most of the bedroom doors were open mrs montague caught margaret by the sleeve as she passed o mrs pullen what a heavenly voice whose is it fred is just mad to know its only that girl brandt replied elinor roughly as she tried to escape further questioning miss brandt what the little west indian mrs pullen is miss leyton jesting no indeed mrs montague mademoiselle brimont was our informant said margaret but at that moment their attention was diverted by the appearance of harriet brandt herself she looked brilliant in one hand she carried her mandoline a lovely little instrument of sandal wood inlaid with mother of pearl her face was flushed with the exertion she had gone through and her abundant hair was somewhat in disorder mrs montague pounced on her at once o miss brandt you are a sly puss we have all been delighted enchanted what do you mean by hiding your light under a bushel in this way do come in here for a minute and sing us another song major montague is in ecstasies over your voice i cant stop i cant indeed replied miss brandt evidently pleased with the effect she had produced because i am on my way down to dear madame gobelli i promised to sing for her this afternoon i was only trying my voice to see if it was fit for anything she smiled at mrs pullen as she spoke and added i hope i have not disturbed the darling baby i thought she would be out this lovely afternoon o no you did not disturb her we have all been much pleased and surprised to think that you have never told us that you could sing how could i tell that anyone would care about it replied harriet indifferently with a shrug of her shoulders but the baron is very musical he has a charming tenor voice i have promised to accompany him i mustnt delay any longer good afternoon and she flew down the stairs with her mandoline it is all the dear baroness and the dear baron now you perceive remarked elinor to mrs pullen as they walked together to the railway station you and the baby are at a discount miss brandt is the sort of young lady i fancy who will follow her own interests wherever they may lead her you should be the last to complain of her for that elinor since you have tried to get rid of her at any cost replied her friend captain ralph pullen arrived punctually by the train which he had appointed and greeted his sister in law and fiance with marked cordiality he was certainly a man to be proud of as far as outward appearance went he was acknowledged by general consent to be one of the handsomest men in the british army and he was fully aware of the fact he was tall and well built with good features almost golden hair womanish blue eyes and a long drooping moustache which he was always caressing with his left hand he regarded all women with the same languishing tired to death glance as if the attentions shewn him by the beau sexe had been altogether too much for him and the most he could do now was to regard them with an indolent worn out favour which had had all the excitement and freshness and flavour taken out of it long before most women would have considered his method of treatment as savouring little short of insult but elinor leytons nature did not make extravagant demands upon her lover and so long as he dressed and looked well and paid her the courtesies due from a gentleman to a gentlewoman she was quite satisfied margaret on the other hand had seen through her brother in laws affectations from the first and despised him for them she thought him foolish vain and uncompanionable but she bore with him for arthurs sake she would have welcomed his cousin anthony pennell though with twice the fervour ralph was looking remarkably well his light grey suit of tweed was fresh and youthful looking and the yellow rose in his buttonhole was as dainty as if he had just walked out of his piccadilly club he was quite animated for him at the idea of spending a short time in heyst and actually went the length of informing elinor that she looked very fit and that if it was not so public a place he should kiss her miss leyton coloured faintly at the remark but she turned her head away and would not let him see that she was sorry the place was so public heyst seems to have done you both a lot of good captain pullen went on presently i am sure you are fatter margaret than when you were in town and by the way how is the daughter not very well i am sorry to say ralph she is cutting more teeth elinor and i were consulting whether we should send for a doctor to see her only this afternoon by the way i have good news for you or you will consider it so old phillips is coming over to join us next week doctor phillips my dear old godfather exclaimed margaret o i am glad to hear it he will set baby to rights at once but who told you so ralph the old gentleman himself i met him coming out of his club the other day and told him i was coming over here and he said he should follow suit as soon as ever he could get away and i was to tell you to get a room for him by next monday i shall feel quite happy about my baby now said mrs pullen i have not much faith in belgian doctors their pharmacopia is quite different from ours but doctor phillips will see if there is anything wrong with her at once i hope you will not be disappointed with the hotel visitors ralph said elinor but they are a terrible set of riff raff it is impossible to make friends with any one of them they are such dreadful people o you mustnt class them all together elinor interposed margaret i am sure the montagues and the vieuxtemps are nice enough and du reste there is no occasion for ralph even to speak to them of course not said captain pullen i have come over for the sake of your company and margarets and have no intention of making the acquaintance of any strangers when is the bataille de fleurs next week thats jolly old phillips will be here by that time and he and margaret can flirt together whilst you and i are billing and cooing eh elinor dont be vulgar ralph she answered you know how i dislike that sort of thing and we have had so much of it here what billing and cooing he questioned but elinor disdained to make any further remark on the subject the appearance of ralph pullen at the table dhte dinner naturally excited a good deal of speculation the english knew that mrs pullen expected her brother in law to stay with her but the foreigners were all curious to ascertain who the handsome well groomed military looking stranger might be who was so familiar with mrs pullen and her friend the baroness was not behind the rest in curiosity and admiration she was much before them in her determination to gratify her curiosity and make the acquaintance of the new comer whose name she guessed though no introduction had passed between them she waited through two courses to see if margaret pullen would take the initiative but finding that she addressed all her conversation to captain pullen keeping her face meanwhile pertinaciously turned from the party sitting opposite to her she determined to force her hand mrs pullen she cried in her coarse voice when are you going to introduce me to your handsome friend margaret coloured uneasily and murmured my brother in law captain pullen madame gobelli very glad to see you captain said the baroness as ralph bowed to her in his most approved fashion your sister thought shed keep you all to erself i suppose but the young ladies of heyst would soon make mincemeat of mrs pullen if she tried that little game on them we avent got too many good looking young men ereabouts i can tell you are you going to stay long captain pullen murmured something about uncertain and not being quite sure whilst the baroness regarded him full in the face with a broad smile on her own she always had a keen eye for a handsome young man ah youll stay as long as it suits your purpose wont you i expect you ave your own little game to play same as most of us and its a pretty little game too isnt it especially when a fellows young and good looking and as the chink a chink eh i fancy i know some of your brother officers mr naggett and lord menzies they belong to the rangers dont they continued madame gobelli prince adalbert of waxsquiemer used to bring em to the red ouse by the way i avent introduced you to my usband baron gobelli gustave this is captain ralph pullen the colonels brother you know you must ave a talk with im after dinner you two would it it off first rate together gustaves in the boot trade you know captain pullen we trade under the name of fantaisie et cie the best boots and shoes in london and the largest manufactory i give you my word you should get your boots from us i know you dandy officers are awfully particular about your tootsies if youll come and see me in london ill take you over the manufactory and give you a pair youll never buy any others once youve tried em ralph pullen bowed again and said he felt certain that madame was right and he looked forward to the fulfilment of her promise with the keenest anticipation harriet brandt meanwhile sitting almost opposite to the stranger was regarding him from under the thick lashes of her slumbrous eyes like a lynx watching its prey she had never seen so good looking and aristocratic a young man before his crisp golden hair and drooping moustaches his fair complexion blue eyes and chiselled features were a revelation to her would the princes whom madame gobelli had promised she should meet at her house be anything like him she wondered could they be as handsome as perfectly dressed as fashionable as completely at their ease as the man before her every other moment she was stealing a veiled glance at him and captain pullen was quite aware of the fact what young man or woman is not aware when they are being furtively admired ralph pullen was one of the most conceited of his sex which is not saying a little he was accombl with female attentions wherever he went yet he was not blas with them so long as he was not called upon to reciprocate in kind each time that harriets magnetic gaze sought his face his eyes by some mystical chance were lifted to meet it and though all four lids were modestly dropped again their owners did not forget the effect their encounter had left behind it ave you been round heyst yet captain pullen vociferated madame gobelli and met the procession i never saw such rubbish in my life i laughed fit to burst myself a lot of children rigged out in blue and white carrying a doll on a stick and a crowd of fools following and singing ymns call that religion its all tommy rot dont you agree with me mrs pullen i cannot say that i do madame i have been taught to respect every religion that is followed with sincerity whether i agree with its doctrine or not besides i thought the procession you allude to a very pretty sight some of the children with their fair hair and wreaths of flowers looked like little angels o youre an umbug exclaimed the baroness you say that just to please these papists not that i wouldnt just as soon be a papist as a protestant but i ate cant i wouldnt ave bobby ere brought up in any religion let im choose for imself when es a man i said but no cant no umbug i ad a governess for im once a dirty little sneak who thought shed get the better of me so she made the boy kneel down each night and say god bless father and mother and all kind friends and god bless my enemies i came on em one evening and i ad im up on his legs in a moment i wont ave it bobby i said i wont ave you telling lies for anyone and i made im repeat after me god bless father and mother and all kind friends and d n my enemies the governess was so angry with me that she gave warning he he he but i ad my way and bobby asnt said a prayer since ave you bobby sometimes mamma replied the lad in a low voice margaret pullens kind eyes sought his at once with an encouraging smile well youd better not let me ear you or ill give you what for i ate umbug dont you captain pullen unreservedly madame replied ralph in a stifled voice and with an inflamed countenance he had been trying to conceal his amusement for some time past greatly to the disgust of miss leyton who would have had him pass by his opposite neighbours remarks in silent contempt and the effort had been rather trying as he spoke his eyes sought those of harriet brandt again and discovered the sympathy with his distress lurking in them coupled with a very evident look of admiration for himself he looked at her back again only one look but it spoke volumes captain pullen had never given such a glance at his fiance nor received one from her it is problematical if elinor leyton could make a telegraph of her calm brown eyes if her soul if indeed she had in that sense a soul at all ever pierced the bounds of its dwelling place to look through its windows as the dessert appeared margaret whispered to her brother in law if we do not make our escape now we may not get rid of her all the evening at which hint he rose from table and the trio left the salle manger together as margaret descended again equipped for their evening stroll she perceived harriet brandt in the corridor also ready and waiting apparently for her she took her aside at once i cannot ask you to join us in our walk this evening miss brandt she said because as it is the first day of my brothers arrival we shall naturally have many family topics to discuss together for the first time since their acquaintance she observed a sullen look creep over harriet brandts features i am going to walk with the baron and baroness thank you all the same she replied to margarets remark and turning on her heel she re entered her room margaret did not believe her statement but she was glad she had had the courage to warn her she knew it would have greatly annoyed elinor if the girl she detested had accompanied them on that first evening the walk proved after all to be a very ordinary one they paraded up and down the digue until they were tired and then they sat down on green chairs and listened to the orchestra whilst ralph smoked his cigarettes elinor was looking her best she was pleased and mildly excited her costume became her and she was presumably enjoying herself but as far as her joy in captain pullen went she might have been walking with her father or her brother the conscious looks that had passed between him and harriet brandt were utterly wanting they began by talking of home of elinors family and the last news that margaret had received from arthur and then went on to discuss the visitors to the hotel miss leyton waxed loud in her denunciation of the baroness and her familiar vulgarity she deplored the ill fate that had placed them in such close proximity at the table dhte and hoped that ralph would not hesitate to change his seat if the annoyance became too great she had warned him she said of what he might expect by joining them at heyst my dear girl he replied pray dont distress yourself in the first place i know a great deal more about foreign hotels than you do and knew exactly what i might expect to encounter and in the second i dont mind it in the least in fact i like it it amuses me i think the baroness is quite a character and look forward to cultivating her acquaintance with the keenest anticipations o dont ralph pray dont exclaimed miss leyton fastidiously the woman is beneath contempt i should be exceedingly annoyed if you permitted her to get at all intimate with you why not if it amuses him demanded margaret laughing for my part i agree with ralph that her very vulgarity makes her most amusing as a change and it is not as if we were likely to be thrown in her way when we return to england she is a rara avis cried captain pullen enthusiastically she certainly must know some good people if men like naggett and menzies have been at her house and yet the way she advertises her boots and shoes is too delicious o dear yes i cannot consent to cut the baroness gobelli i am half in love with her already elinor leyton made a gesture of disgust and you who are considered to be one of the most select and fastidious men in town she said i wonder at you then he made a bad matter worse by saying by the way margaret who was that beautiful girl who sat on the opposite side of the table the what exclaimed elinor leyton ungrammatically as she turned round upon the digue and confronted him he means miss brandt interposed margaret hastily many people think that she is handsome no one could think otherwise responded ralph is she spanish o no her parents were english she comes from jamaica ah a drop of creole blood in her then i daresay you never see such eyes in an english face whats the matter with her eyes asked elinor sharply theyre very large and dark you know elinor said mrs pullen observing the cloud which was settling down upon the girls face but it is not everybody who admires dark eyes or you and i would come off badly well with all due deference to you my fair sister in law replied ralph with the stupidity of a selfish man who never knows when he is wounding his hearers most people give the preference to dark eyes in women anyway miss brandt if that is her name is a beauty and no mistake i cant say that i admire your taste said elinor and i sincerely hope that miss brandt will not force her company upon us whilst you are here margaret and i have suffered more than enough already in that respect she is only half educated and knows nothing of the world and is altogether a most uninteresting companion i dislike her exceedingly ah dont forget her singing cried margaret unwittingly does she sing demanded the captain yes and wonderfully well for an amateur she plays the mandoline also i think elinor is a little hard on her of course she is very young and unformed but she has only just come out of a convent where she has been educated for the last ten years what can you expect of a girl who has never been out in society i know that she is very good natured and has waited on baby as if she had been her servant dont you think we have had about enough of miss harriet brandt said elinor i want to hear what ralph thinks of heyst or if he advises our going on to ostende i believe ostende is much gayer and brighter than heyst but we must wait now till doctor phillips joins us interposed margaret he could come after us if ralph preferred ostende or blankenburghe said elinor eagerly my dear ladies exclaimed captain pullen allow me to form an opinion of heyst first and then we will talk about other places this seems pleasant enough in all conscience to me now o you two are bound to think any place pleasant laughed margaret but i think i must go in to my baby i do not feel easy to be away from her too long now that she is ailing but there is no need for you to come in elinor it is only just nine oclock i would rather accompany you replied miss leyton primly no no elinor stay with me if you are tired we can sit in the balcony i have seen nothing of you yet remonstrated her lover she consented to sit in the balcony with him for a few minutes but she would not permit his chair to be placed too close to hers the waiters pass backward and forward she said and what would they think the deuce take what they think replied captain pullen i havent seen you for two months and you keep me at arms length as if i should poison you what do you suppose a man is made of my dear ralph you know it is nothing of the kind but it is quite impossible that we can sit side by side like a pair of turtle doves in a public hotel like this let us go up to your room then to my bedroom she ejaculated with horror to margarets room then she wont be so prudish im sure anywhere where i can speak to you alone the nurse will be in margarets room with little ethel hang it all then come for another walk let us go away from the town out on those sand hills im sure no one will see us there dear ralph you must be reasonable if i were seen walking about heyst alone with you at night it would be all over the town to morrow let it be wheres the harm but i have kept our engagement most scrupulously secret no one knows anything but that you are margarets brother in law you dont know how they gossip and chatter in a place like this i could never consent to appear at the public table dhte again if i thought that all those vulgarians had been discussing my most private affairs o well just as you choose replied ralph pullen discontentedly but i suppose you will not object to my taking another turn along the digue before i go to bed here garon bring me a chasse good night then if you will not stay it is not that i will not it is that i cannot ralph said miss leyton as she gave him her hand good night i hope you will find your room comfortable and if it is fine to morrow we will have a nice walk in whichever direction you prefer and much good that will be grumbled the young man as he lighted his cigarette and strolled out again upon the digue as he stood for a moment looking out upon the sea which was one mass of silvery ripples he heard himself called by name he looked up the gobellis had a private sitting room facing the digue on the ground floor and the baroness was leaning out of the open window and beckoning to him wont you come in and ave a whiskey and soda she asked the baron as is own whiskey ere real scotch none of your nasty belgian stuff alf spirits of wine and alf varnish come along weve got a jolly little parlour and my little friend arriet brandt shall sing to you unless youre off on some lark of your own eh no indeed replied ralph i was only wondering what i should do with myself for the next hour thank you so much ill come with pleasure and in another minute he was seated in the company of the baron and baroness and harriet brandt chapter vi the day had heralded in the bataille de fleurs and all heyst was en fte the little furnished villas hired for the season were all built alike with a balcony on the ground floor which was transformed into a veritable bower for the occasion villa imperatrice vied with villa mentone and villa sebastien as to which decoration should be the most beautiful and effective and the result was a long line of arbours garlanded with every sort of blossom from early morning the occupants were busy entwining their pillars with evergreens interspersed with flags and knots of ribbon whilst the balustrades were laden with growing flowers and the tables inside bore vases of severed blooms one balcony was decorated with corn poppies and bluets whilst the next would display pink roses mixed with the delicate blue of the sea nettle and the third would be all yellow silk and white marguerites the procession of charrettes and the bataille itself was not to commence till the afternoon so the visitors crowded the sands as usual in the morning leaving the temporary owners of the various villas to toil for their gratification during their absence margaret pullen felt sad as she sat in the hotel balcony watching the proceedings on each side of her she had intended her babys perambulator to take part in the procession of charrettes and had ordered a quantity of white field lilies with which to decorate it it was to be a veritable triumph so she and miss leyton had decided between themselves and she had fondly pictured how lovely little ethel would look with her fluffy yellow hair lying amongst the blossoms but now baby was too languid and ill to be taken out of doors and margaret had given all the flowers to the little montagues who were trimming their mail cart with them in their own fashion as she sat there with a pensive thoughtful look upon her face harriet brandt dressed in a costume of grass cloth with a broad brimmed hat nodding with poppies and green leaves that wonderfully became her on her head entered the balcony with an eager excited appearance o mrs pullen have you seen the baroness she exclaimed we are going to bathe this morning arent you coming down to the sands no miss brandt not to day i am unhappy about my dear baby i am sure you will be sorry to hear that she has been quite ill all night so restless and feverish o shell be all right directly her teeth come through replied harriet indifferently as her eyes scanned the scene before them theres the baroness shes beckoning to me good bye and without a word of sympathy or comfort she rushed away to join her friends like the way of the world thought margaret as she watched the girl skimming over the sands but somehow i didnt think she would be so heartless miss leyton and her fianc had strolled off after breakfast to take a walk and mrs pullen went back to her own room and sat down quietly to needlework she was becoming very anxious for doctor phillips arrival had even written to england to ask him to hurry it if possible for her infant though not positively ill rejected her food so often that she was palpably thinner and weaker after she had sat there for some time she took up her field glasses to survey the bathers on the beach she had often done so before when confined to the hotel it afforded her amusement to watch their faces and antics on the present occasion she had no difficulty in distinguishing the form of the baroness gobelli looking enormous as clad in a most conspicuous bathing costume she waddled from her machine into the water loudly calling attention to her appearance from all assembled on the sands as she went the baron looking little less comical advanced to conduct his spouse down to the water whilst after them flew a slight boyish figure in yellow with a mane of dark hair hanging down her back which margaret immediately recognised as that of harriet brandt she was dancing about in the shallow water shrieking whenever she made a false step and clinging hold of the barons hand when margaret saw another gentleman come up to them and join in the ring she turned the glasses upon him and saw to her amazement that it was her brother in law her first feeling was that of annoyance there was nothing extraordinary or improper in his joining the baronesss party men and women bathed promiscuously in heyst and no one thought anything of it but that ralph should voluntarily mix himself up with the gobellis after elinors particular request that he should keep aloof from them was a much more serious matter and by the way that reminded her where was elinor the while margaret could not discern her anywhere upon the sands and wondered if she had also been persuaded to bathe she watched captain pullen evidently trying to induce miss brandt to venture further into the water holding out both hands for her protection she also saw her yield to his persuasion and leaving go of her hold on the herr baron trust herself entirely to the strangers care mrs pullen turned from the window with a sigh she hoped there were not going to be any ructions between ralph and elinor but she would not have liked her to see him at that moment she bestowed a silent benediction not loud but deep on the foreign fashion of promiscuous bathing and walked across the corridor to her friends room to see if she had returned to the hotel to her surprise she found miss leyton dismantled of her walking attire soberly seated at her table writing letters why elinor she said i thought you were out with ralph the young lady was quite composed so i was she answered until half an hour ago but as he then expressed his determination to bathe i left him to his own devices and came back to write my letters would he not have preferred your waiting on the sands till he could join you again i did not ask him i should think he would hardly care for me to watch him whilst bathing and i am sure i should not consent to do so but everybody does it here elinor and if you did not care to go down to the beach you might have waited for him on the digue my dear margaret i am not in the habit of dancing attendance upon men it is their business to come after me if ralph is eager for another walk after his dip he can easily call for me here true and he can as easily go for his walk with any stray acquaintance he may pick up on the sands o if he should prefer it he is welcome to do so replied elinor resuming her scribbling my dear elinor i dont think you quite understand ralph he has been terribly spoilt you know and when men have been accustomed to attention they will take it wherever they can get it he has come over here expressly to be with you so i think you should give him every minute of your time men are fickle creatures my dear it will take some time yet to despoil them of the idea that women were made for their convenience i am afraid the man is not born yet for whose convenience i was made well you know the old saying most women can catch a man but it takes a clever woman to keep him i dont mean to insinuate that you are in any danger of losing ralph but i think hes quite worth keeping and i believe you think so too and i mean to keep him replied miss leyton as she went on writing margaret did not venture to give her any further hints but returned to her own room and took another look through her spyglass the bathers in whom she was interested had returned to their machines by this time and presently emerged clothed and in their right minds miss brandt looking more attractive than before with her long hair hanging down her back to dry and then that occurred which she had been anticipating captain pullen having taken a survey of the beach and seeing none of his own party there climbed with harriet brandt to where they were high and dry above the tide and threw himself down on the hot loose sand by her side whilst the baron and baroness with a laughing injunction to the two young people to take care of themselves toiled up to the digue and walked off in another direction when they all met at djeuner she attacked her brother in law on the subject have you been bathing all this while she said to him you must have stayed very long in the water o dear no he replied i wasnt in above a quarter of an hour and what have you been doing since strolling about looking for you and elinor said captain pullen why the dickens didnt you come out this lovely morning i could not leave baby cried margaret shortly and i was writing chimed in elinor very well ladies if you prefer your own company to mine of course i have nothing to say against it but i suppose you are not going to shut yourselves up this afternoon o no it is a public duty to attend the bataille de fleurs have you bought any confetti ralph i have miss brandt was good enough to show me where to get them and we are well provided there is to be a race between lady jockeys at the end of the digue too i perceive what with horses i conclude so i see they have railed in a portion of ground for the purpose replied captain pullen ow could they race without orses called out the baroness harriet brandt did not join in the conversation but she was gazing all the while at ralph pullen not furtively as she had done the day before but openly and unabashedly as though she held a proprietary right in him margaret noticed her manner at once and interpreted it aright but miss leyton true to her principles never raised her eyes in her direction and ignored everything that came from that side of the table mrs pullen was annoyed she knew how angry elinor would be if she intercepted any telegraphic communication between her lover and miss brandt and she rose from the table as soon as possible in order to avert such a catastrophe she had never considered her brother in law a very warm wooer and she fancied that his manner towards miss leyton was more indifferent than usual she took one turn with them along the digue to admire the flower bedecked villas which were in full beauty and then returned to her nursery glad of an excuse to leave them together and give elinor a chance of becoming more cordial and affectionate to ralph than she had yet appeared to be the lovers had not been alone long however before they were waylaid to the intense disgust of elinor by harriet brandt and her friend olga brimont still further to her annoyance captain pullen seemed almost to welcome the impertinent interference of the two girls who could scarcely have had the audacity to join their company unless he had invited them to do so the charrettes are just about to start exclaimed harriet o they are lovely and such dear little children i am so glad that the bataille de fleurs takes place to day because my friends brother alfred brimont is coming to take her to brussels the day after to morrow brussels is a jolly place mademoiselle brimont will enjoy herself there said ralph there are theatres and balls and picture galleries and every pleasure that a young ladys heart can desire have you been to brussels asked harriet yes when i was a nasty little boy in jacket and trousers i was placed at mr jacksons english school there in order that i might learn french but im afraid that was the last thing i acquired the jackson boys were known all over the town for the greatest nuisances in it what did you do what did we not do we tore up and down the rue montagne de la cour at all hours of the day shouting and screaming and getting into scrapes we ran up bills at the shops which we had no money to pay we appeared at every place of amusement and we made love to all the school girls till we had become a terror to the school mistresses what naughty boys remarked miss brandt with a side glance at miss leyton she did not like to say all she thought before this very stiff and proper young english lady but captain pullen she continued where are the confetti have you forgotten them shall i go and buy some more no no my pockets are stuffed with them he said producing two bags of which he handed harriet one her thanks were conveyed by throwing a large handful of tiny pieces of blue and white and pink paper which do duty for the more dangerous chalk sugar plums at him and which covered his tweed suit and sprinkled his fair hair and moustaches he returned the compliment by flying after her retreating figure and liberally showering confetti upon her o ralph i do hope you are not going to engage in this horse play exclaimed elinor leyton because if so i would rather return to the hotel surely we may leave such vulgarities to the common people and miss harriet brandt what nonsense he replied its evident youve never been in rome during the carnival why everyone does it its the national custom if you imagine im going to stand by like a british tourist and stare at everything without joining in the fun youre very much mistaken but is it fun questioned miss leyton to me it is here goes he cried as he threw a handful of paper into the face of a passing stranger who gave him as good as she had got in return i call it low positively vulgar said miss leyton to behave so familiarly with people one has never seen before of whose antecedents one knows nothing i should be very much surprised if the mob behaved in such a manner towards me oh the exclamation was induced by the action of some young picier or hotel garon who threw a mass of confetti into her face with such violence as almost for the moment to blind her ha ha ha roared ralph pullen with his healthy british lungs as he saw her outraged feelings depicted in her countenance i thought youd get it before long he said as she attempted to brush the offending paper off her mantle it has not altered my opinion of the indecency of the custom she replied never mind he returned soothingly here come the charrettes they were really a charming sight on one cart was drawn a boat with little children dressed as fishermen and fisherwomen another represented a harvest field with the tiny haymakers and reapers whilst a third was piled with wool to represent snow on the top of which were seated three little girls attired as esquimaux the mail carts and perambulators belonging to the visitors to heyst were also well represented and beautifully trimmed with flowers the first prize was embowered in lilies and white roses whilst its tiny inmate was seated in state as the goddess flora with a wreath twined in her golden curls the second was taken by a gallant neapolitan fisherman of about four years old who wheeled a mail cart of pink roses in which sat his little sisters dressed as angels with large white wings the third was a wheel barrow hidden in moss and narcissi on which reposed a sleeping beauty robed in white tissue with a coronal of forget me nots harriet brandt fell into ecstasies over everything she saw when pleased and surprised she expressed herself more like a child than a young woman and became extravagant and ungovernable she tried to kiss each baby that took part in the procession and thrust coins into their chubby hands to buy bonbons and confetti with captain pullen thought her conduct most natural and unaffected but miss leyton insisted that it was all put on for effect olga brimont tried to put in a good word for her friend harriet is very fond of children she said but she has never seen any there were no children at the convent under ten years of age so she does not know how to make enough of them when she meets them she wants to kiss every one sometimes i tell her i think she would like to eat them but she only means to be kind i am sure of that said captain pullen but she should be told interposed elinor that it is not the custom in civilised countries for strangers to kiss every child they meet any more than it is to speak before being introduced or to bestow their company where it is not desired miss brandt has a great deal to learn in that respect before she can enter english society as is often the case when a woman becomes unjust in abusing another miss leyton made captain pullen say more to cover her discourtesy than in other circumstances he would have done miss brandt he said slowly is so beautiful that she will have a great deal forgiven her that would not be overlooked in a plainer woman that may be your opinion but it is not mine replied miss leyton her tone was so acid that it sent him flying from her side to battle with his confetti against the tribe of montagues who fortunately for the peace of all parties joined their forces to theirs and after some time spent on the digue they returned a large party to the hotel it was not until they had sat down to dinner that they remembered they had never been to see the lady jockey race he he he laughed madame gobelli but i did and you lost something i can tell you we ad great difficulty to get seats but when we did it was worth it wasnt it gustave you said so mein tear replied the baron gravely and you thought so you old rascal dont you tell me i saw your wicked eyes glozing at the gals in their breeches and boots there werent any orses after all captain pullen but sixteen gals with different coloured jackets on and top boots and tight white breeches such a sight you never saw gustave ere did ave a treat as for bobby when i found we couldnt get out again because of the crowd i tied my andkerchief over is eyes and made him put is ead in my lap dear dear cried ralph laughing was it as bad as that madame bad my dear boy it was as bad as it could be its a mercy you werent there or we shouldnt ave seen you ome again so soon there were the sixteen gals with their tight breeches and their short racing jackets and a fat fellow dressed like a huntsman whipping em round and round the ring as if they were so much cattle you should ave seen them op when he touched em up with the lash of is whip i expect theyve never ad such a tingling since the time their mothers smacked em there was a little fat one there i wish you could ave seen er when e whipped er to make er urry it was comical she opped like a kangaroo and what was the upshot of it all who won asked ralph o i dont know i got gustave out as soon as i could i wasnt going to let im spend the whole afternoon watching those gals opping there were is eyes goggling out of is ead and his lips licking each other as if e was sucking a sugar stick mein tear mein tear interposed the unfortunate baron you go on with your dinner gustave and leave me alone i saw you and no more lady jockey races do you attend whilst were in this popish country they aint good for you im very thankful that i have been saved such a dangerous experiment said captain pullen though if i thought that you would tie your handkerchief over my eyes and put my head in your lap madame i should feel tempted to try it as soon as dinner is over go along with you you bad boy chuckled the baroness theres something else to see this evening they are going to ave a procession of lanterns as soon as its dark and it is to stop in front of every hotel added harriet and the landlords are going to distribute bonbons and gteaux amongst the lantern bearers o we must not miss that on any account replied captain pullen addressing himself to her in reply margaret and elinor thought when the time came that they should be able to see the procession of lanterns just as well from the balcony as when mingled with the crowd so they brought their work and books down there and sat with ralph drinking coffee and conversing of all that had occurred the baroness had disappeared and harriet brandt had apparently gone with her a fact for which both ladies were inwardly thankful presently as the dusk fell the procession of lanterns could be seen wending its way from the further end of the digue it was a very pretty and fantastical sight the bearers were not only children many grown men and women took part in it and the devices into which the chinese lanterns had been formed were quaint and clever some held a ring around them as milkmaids carry their pails others held crosses and banners designed in tiny lanterns far above their heads one which could be seen topping all the rest was poised like a skipping rope over the bearers shoulders whilst the coloured lanterns swung inside it like a row of bells the members of the procession shouted or sang or danced or walked steadily as suited their temperaments and came along a merry crowd up and down the digue stopping at the various hotels for largesse in the shape of cakes and sugar plums ralph pullen found his eyes wandering more than once in the direction of the baronesss sitting room to see if he could catch a glimpse of her or her protge as harriet brandt seemed to be now universally acknowledged to be but he heard no sound nor caught a glimpse of them and concluded in consequence that they had left the hotel again whoever is carrying that skipping rope of lanterns seems to be in a merry mood observed margaret after a while for it is jumping up and down in the most extravagant manner she must be dancing do look elinor i see i suppose this sort of childish performance amuses a childish people but for my own part i think once of it is quite enough and am thankful that we are not called upon to admire it in england o i think it is rather interesting remarked margaret i only wish my dear baby had been well enough to enjoy it how she would have screamed and cooed at those bright coloured lanterns but when i tried to attract her attention to them just now she only whined to be put into her cot again how thankful i shall be to see dear doctor phillips to morrow the procession had reached the front of the hotel by this time and halted there for refreshment the waiters jules and phillippe and henri appeared with plates of dessert and cakes and threw them indiscriminately amongst the people one of the foremost to jump and scramble to catch the falling sweetmeats was the girl who carried the lantern skipping rope above her head and in whom ralph pullen to his astonishment recognised harriet brandt there she was fantastically dressed in a white frock and a broad yellow sash with her magnificent hair loose and wreathed with scarlet flowers she looked amazingly handsome like a bacchante and her appearance and air of abandon sent the young mans blood into his face and up to the roots of his fair hair surely exclaimed margaret that is never miss brandt yes it is cried harriet im having the most awful fun why dont you come too ive danced the whole way up the digue and it is so warm i wish the waiters would give us something to drink ive eaten so many bonbons i feel quite sick what will you take miss brandt asked captain pullen eagerly limonade or soda water a limonade please you are good she replied as he handed her the tumbler over the balcony balustrades come along and dance with me i cannot i am with my sister and miss leyton he replied o pray do not let us prevent you said elinor in her coldest voice margaret was just going upstairs and i am quite ready to accompany her no no elinor whispered mrs pullen with a shake of her head stay here and keep ralph company but it is nearly ten oclock replied miss leyton consulting her watch and i have been on my feet all day and feel quite ready for bed good night ralph she continued offering him her hand well if you two are really going to bed i shall go too said captain pullen rising for there will be nothing for me to do here after youre gone not even to follow the procession suggested miss leyton with a smile dont talk nonsense he rejoined crossly am i the sort of man to go bobbing up and down the digue amongst a parcel of children he shook hands with them both and walked away rather sulkily to his own quarter of the hotel but he did not go to bed he waited until some fifteen minutes had elapsed and then telling himself that it was impossible to sleep at that hour and that if elinor chose to behave like a bear it was not his fault he came downstairs again and sauntered out on the sea front it was very lonely there at that moment the procession had turned and gone down to the other end again where its lights and banners could be seen waving about in the still summer air why shouldnt the girl jump about and enjoy herself if she chooses thought ralph pullen elinor makes no allowances for condition or age but would have everyone as prim and old maidish as herself i declare she gets worse each time i see her a nice sort of wife she will make if this kind of thing goes on but by jingo if we are ever married ill take her prudery out of her and make her what the woman who commences by pursing her mouth up at everything ends by opening it wider than anybody else theres twice as much harm in a prude as in one of these frank open hearted girls whose eyes tell you what theyre thinking of the first time you see them he had been strolling down the digue as he pondered thus and now found himself meeting the procession again come and dance with me cried harriet brandt who apparently as fresh as ever was still waving her branch of lanterns to the measure of her steps he took her hand and tried to stop her havent you had about enough of this he said im sure you must be tired heres a little boy without a lantern give him yours to hold and come for a little walk with me the touch of his cool hand upon her heated palm seemed to rouse all the animal in harriet brandts blood her hand very slight and lissom clung to his with a force of which he had not thought it capable and he felt it trembling in his clasp come he repeated coaxingly you mustnt dance any more or you will overtire yourself come with me and get cool and rest she threw her branch of lanterns to the boy beside her impetuously here she cried take them i dont want them any more and take me away she continued to ralph but without letting go of his hand you are right i want i want rest her slight figure swayed towards him as he led her out of the crowd and across a narrow street to where the road ran behind all the houses and hotels and was dark and empty and void the din of the voices and the trampling of feet and the echo of the songs still reached them but they could see nothing the world was on the digue and they were in the dusk and quietude together and alone ralph felt the slight form beside him lean upon his shoulder till their faces almost touched he threw his arm about her waist her hot breath fanned his cheek kiss me she murmured in a dreamy voice captain pullen was not slow to accept the invitation so confidingly extended what englishman would be he turned his face to harriet brandts and her full red lips met his own in a long drawn kiss that seemed to sap his vitality as he raised his head again he felt faint and sick but quickly recovering himself he gave her a second kiss more passionate if possible than the first then the following whispered conversation ensued between them do you know he commenced with his head close to hers that you are the very jolliest little girl that i have ever met and you you are the man i have dreamt of but never seen till now how is that am i so different from the rest of my sex very very different so strong and brave and beautiful dear little girl and so you really like me i love you said harriet feverishly i loved you the first minute we met and i love you youre awfully sweet and pretty you know do you really think so what would mrs pullen say if she heard you mrs pullen is not the keeper of my conscience but she must not hear it o no nor miss leyton either most certainly not miss leyton she is a terrible prude she would be awfully shocked it must be a secret just between you and me murmured the girl just so a sweet little secret all our own and nobody elses and then the fair head and the dark one came again in juxtaposition and the rest was lost in silence chapter vii doctor phillips had not been in the htel lion dor five minutes before margaret pullen took him upstairs to see her baby she was becoming terribly anxious about her they encountered captain ralph pullen on the staircase hullo young man and what have you been doing to yourself exclaimed the doctor he was certainly looking ill his face was chalky white and his eyes seemed to have lost their brightness and colour been up racketing late at night continued doctor phillips what is miss leyton about not to look after you better no indeed doctor replied the young man with a smile i am sure my sister in law will testify to the good hours i have kept since here but i have a headache this morning a rather bad one he added with his hand to the nape of his neck perhaps this place doesnt agree with you it was always rather famous for its smells if i remember aright however i am going to see miss ethel pullen now and when i have finished with her i will look after you no thank you doctor said ralph laughing as he descended the stairs none of your nostrums for me keep them for the baby he is not looking well observed doctor phillips to margaret as they walked on together i dont think he is now you point it out to me but i have not noticed it before replied margaret i am sure he has been living quietly enough whilst here the infant was lying as she had now done for several days past quite tranquil and free from pain but inert and half asleep the doctor raised her eyelids and examined her eyeballs felt her pulse and listened to her heart but he did not seem to be satisfied what has this child been having he asked abruptly having doctor why nothing of course but her milk and i have always that from the same cow no opium no soothing syrup nor quackeries of any kind certainly not you know how often you have warned me against anything of the sort and no one has had the charge of her except you and the nurse here you can both swear she has never been tampered with o i think so certainly yes baby has never been from under the eye of one or the other of us a young lady resident in the hotel a miss brandt has often nursed her and played with her but one of us has always been there at the time a miss what did you say demanded the doctor sharply a miss brandt a very good natured girl who is fond of children very well then i will go at once to the pharmaciens and get a prescription made up for your baby and i hope that your anxiety may soon be relieved o thank you doctor so much exclaimed margaret i knew you would do her good as soon as you saw her but the doctor was not so sure of himself he turned the case over and over in his mind as he walked to the chemists shop wondering how such a state of exhaustion and collapse could have been brought about the baby had her first dose and the doctor had just time to wash and change his travelling suit before they all met at the dinner table here they found the party opposite augmented by the arrival of monsieur alfred brimont a young brussels tradesman who had come over to heyst to conduct his sister home he was trying to persuade harriet brandt to accompany olga and stay a few days with them but the girl with a long look in the direction of captain pullen shook her head determinedly o you might come harriet just for a few days argued olga now that the bataille de fleurs is over there is nothing left to stay for in heyst and alfred says that brussels is such a beautiful place there are the theatres and the parc and the quinonce and wauxhall said young brimont persuasively mademoiselle would enjoy herself i have no doubt but harriet still negatived the proposal why shouldnt we make up a party and all go together suggested the baroness me and the baron and bobby and arriet you would like it then my dear wouldnt you she said to the girl and you really should see brussels before we go ome what do you say gustave wed go to the htel de saxe and see everything it wouldnt take us more than a week or ten days do as you like mein tear acquiesced the baron and why shouldnt you come with us captain continued madame gobelli to ralph you dont look quite the thing to me a little change would do you good all work and no play makes jack a dull boy ave you been to brussels i lived there for years madame and know every part of it he replied come and renew your acquaintance then and take me and arriet about the baron isnt much good when it comes to sight seeing are you gustave e likes is pipe and is slippers too well but youre young and spry well is it a bargain i really could not decide in such a hurry said ralph with a glance at margaret and elinor but we might all go on to brussels perhaps a little later on i dont think you must buoy up the hopes of the baroness and miss brandt with that idea remarked miss leyton coldly because i am sure that mrs pullen has no intention of doing anything of the sort if you wish to accompany madame gobellis party you had better make your arrangements without any reference to us all right if you prefer it i will he answered in the same indifferent tone who is that young lady sitting opposite with the dark eyes demanded doctor phillips of mrs pullen the same i spoke to you of upstairs as having been kind to baby miss harriet brandt i knew a brandt once he answered has she anything to do with the west indies o yes she comes from jamaica she is an orphan the daughter of doctor henry brandt and has been educated in the ursuline convent there she is a young lady with an independent fortune and considered to be quite a catch in heyst and you and miss leyton are intimate with her she has attached herself very much to us since coming here she has few friends poor girl will you introduce me miss brandt my friend doctor phillips wishes for an introduction to you the usual courtesies passed between them and then the doctor said i fancy i knew your father miss brandt when i was quartered in jamaica with the thirteenth lances did he not live on the top of the hill on a plantation called helvetia that was the name of our place replied harriet but i left it when i was only eleven my trustee mr trawler lives there now ah trawler the attorney i have no doubt he made as much out of the property as he could squeeze do you mean that he cheated me asked harriet navely god forbid my dear young lady but he was a great crony of your fathers and a d d sharp lawyer and those sort of gentry generally feather their own nest pretty well in payment of their friendship he cant do me any harm now said harriet for i have my property in my own hands quite right quite right that is if youre a business woman rejoined the doctor and are you travelling all by yourself harriet was about to answer in the affirmative when the baroness took the words out of her mouth no sir she aint she came over with her friend mademoiselle brimont and now shes under my chaperonage shes a deal too andsome aint she to be travelling about the world alone with her money bags under her arm my names the baroness gobelli this is my usband baron gustave gobelli and this is my little boy bobby bates by my first usband youll understand and when you return to london if you like to come and see miss brandt at our ouse the red ouse olloway we shall be very pleased to see you i am sure madame you are infinitely kind replied doctor phillips gravely not at all youll meet no end of swells there prince loris of taxelmein and prince adalbert of waxsquiemer and eaps of others but all the same were in trade the baron and i and were not ashamed of it either we make boots and shoes our firm is fantaisie et cie of oxford street and though i say it you wont find better boots and shoes in all london than ours no brown paper soles and rotten uppers not a bit of it its all genuine stuff with us you can take any boot out of the shop and rip it to pieces and prove what i say the best materials and the best workmen thats our principle and it answers we cant make em fast enough i have no doubt of it again gravely responded the old doctor ah you might send some of your patients to us doctor and well pay back by recommending you to our friends are you a gout man prince adalbert as the gout awfully ive rubbed is feet with ellimans embrocation by the hour together but nothing gives im relief now if you could cure im your fortune would be made e says its all the english climate but i say its over eating and ed attend more to a medical man if e told im to diet than e will to me doubtless doubtless said the doctor in a dreamy manner he seemed to be lost in a reverie and margaret had to touch his arm to remind him that the meal was concluded she wanted him to join the others in a promenade and see the beauties of heyst but he was strangely eager in declining it no no let the youngsters go and enjoy themselves but i want to speak to you alone my dear doctor you frighten me nothing about baby i hope not at all dont be foolish but i want to talk to you where we cannot be overheard i think we had better wait till the rest have dispersed then and go down upon the sands it is almost impossible to be private in a hotel like this all right get your hat and we will stroll off together as soon as they were out of earshot he commenced abruptly it is about that miss brandt you seem pretty intimate with her you must stop it at once you must have nothing more to do with her margarets eyes opened wide with distress but doctor phillips for what reason i dont see how we could give her up now unless we leave the place then leave the place you mustnt know her neither must miss leyton she comes of a terrible parentage no good can ever ensue of association with her you must tell me more than this doctor if you wish me to follow your advice i will tell you all i know myself some twelve or thirteen years ago i was quartered in medical charge of the thirteenth lances and stationed in jamaica where i knew of rather than knew the father of this girl henry brandt you called him a doctor he was not worthy of the name he was a scientist perhaps a murderer certainly how horrible do you really mean it listen to me this man brandt matriculated in the swiss hospitals whence he was expelled for having caused the death of more than one patient by trying his scientific experiments upon them the swiss laboratories are renowned for being the foremost in vivisection and other branches of science that gratify the curiosity and harden the heart of man more than they confer any lasting benefit on humanity even there henry brandts barbarity was considered to render him unfit for association with civilised practitioners and he was expelled with ignominy having a private fortune he settled in jamaica and set up his laboratory there and i would not shock your ears by detailing one hundredth part of the atrocities that were said to take place under his supervision and in company of this man trawler whom the girl calls her trustee and who is one of the greatest brutes unhung are you not a little prejudiced dear doctor not at all if when you have heard all you still say so you are not the woman i have taken you for brandt did not confine his scientific investigations to the poor dumb creation he was known to have decoyed natives into his pandemonium who were never heard of again which raised at last the public feeling so much against him that i am glad to say that his negroes revolted and after having murdered him with appropriate atrocity set fire to his house and burned it and all his property to the ground dont look so shocked i repeat that i am glad to say it for he richly deserved his fate and no torture could be too severe for one who spent his worthless life in torturing gods helpless animals and his wife commenced margaret he had no wife he was never married never married but this girl harriet brandt has no more right to the name than you have henry brandt was not the man to regard the laws either of god or man there was no reason why he should not have married for that very cause i suppose he preferred to live in concubinage poor harriet poor child and her mother did you know her dont speak to me of her mother she was not a woman she was a fiend a fitting match for henry brandt to my mind she was a revolting creature a fat flabby half caste who hardly ever moved out of her chair but sat eating all day long until the power to move had almost left her i can see her now with her sensual mouth her greedy eyes her low forehead and half formed brain and her lust for blood it was said that the only thing which made her laugh was to watch the dying agonies of the poor creatures her brutal protector slaughtered but she thirsted for blood she loved the sight and smell of it she would taste it on the tip of her finger when it came in her way her servants had some story amongst themselves to account for this lust they declared that when her slave mother was pregnant with her she was bitten by a vampire bat which are formidable creatures in the west indies and are said to fan their victims to sleep with their enormous wings whilst they suck their blood anyway the slave woman did not survive her delivery and her fellows prophecied that the child would grow up to be a murderess which doubtless she was in heart if not in deed what an awful description and what became of her she was killed at the same time as brandt indeed the natives would have killed her in preference to him had they been obliged to choose for they attributed all the atrocities that went on in the laboratory to her influence they said she was obeah which means diabolical witchcraft in their language and doubtless their unfortunate child would have been slaughtered also had not the overseer of the plantation carried her off to his cabin and afterwards when the disturbance was quelled to the convent where you say she has been educated but terrible as all this is dear doctor it is not the poor girls fault why should we give up her acquaintance for that my dear margaret are you so ignorant as not to see that a child born under such conditions cannot turn out well the bastard of a man like henry brandt cruel dastardly godless and a woman like her terrible mother a sensual self loving crafty and bloodthirsty half caste what do you expect their daughter to become she may seem harmless enough at present so does the tiger cub as it suckles its dam but that which is bred in her will come out sooner or later and curse those with whom she may be associated i beg and pray of you margaret not to let that girl come near you or your child any more there is a curse upon her and it will affect all within her influence you have made me feel very uncomfortable doctor replied mrs pullen of course if i had known all this previously i would not have cultivated miss brandts acquaintance and now i shall take your advice and drop her as soon as possible there will be no difficulty with miss leyton for she has had a strange dislike to the girl ever since we met but she has certainly been very kind to my baby for heavens sake dont let her come near your baby any more cried doctor phillips quickly certainly i will not and perhaps it would be as well if we moved on to ostende or blankenburghe as we have sometimes talked of doing it would sever the acquaintance in the most effectual way by all means do so particularly if the young lady does not go to brussels as that stout party was proposing at dinner time what an extraordinary person she appears to be quite a character that is just what she is but doctor there is another thing i should like to speak to you about concerning miss brandt and i am sure i may trust you to receive it in the strictest confidence it is regarding my brother in law ralph pullen i am rather afraid from one or two things i have observed that he likes miss brandt o i dont mean anything particular for as you know he is engaged to be married to elinor leyton and i dont suspect him of wronging her only young men are rather headstrong you know and fond of their own way and perhaps if you were to speak to ralph tell me plainly has he been carrying on with this girl not in the sense you would take it doctor but he affects her company and that of the gobellis a good deal miss brandt sings beautifully and ralph loves music but his action annoys elinor i can see that and since you think we should break off the intimacy i consider it most imperatively necessary for many reasons and especially in the case of a susceptible young man like captain pullen she has money you say fifteen hundred a year so i am told and miss leyton has nothing and ralph only his pay o yes you are quite right such an acquaintanceship is dangerous for him the sense of honour is not so strong now as it was when i was a boy and gold is a powerful bait with the rising generation i will take an early opportunity of talking to captain pullen on the subject you will not wound his feelings doctor nor betray me trust me for doing neither i shall speak from my own experience as i have done to you if he will not take my advice you must get someone with more influence to caution him about it i hardly know how to make my meaning clear to you margaret but miss brandt is a dangerous acquaintance for all of you we medical men know the consequences of heredity better than outsiders can do a woman born in such circumstances bred of sensuality cruelty and heartlessness cannot in the order of things be modest kind or sympathetic and she probably carries unknown dangers in her train whatever her fascinations or her position may be i beg of you to drop her at once and for ever of course i will but it seems hard upon her she has seemed to crave so for affection and companionship as her mother craved for food and blood as her father craved for inflicting needless agony on innocent creatures and sneered meanwhile at their sufferings i am afraid i should have little faith in miss brandt craving for anything except the gratification of her own senses they were seated on the lower step of the wooden flight that led from the digue to the sands so that whilst they could see what went on above them they were concealed from view themselves just then harriet brandts beautiful voice accompanied by the silvery strains of the mandoline was heard to warble gounods marguerite from the open window of the baronesss sitting room margaret glanced up the apartment was brilliantly lighted on the table were bottles of wine and spirits with cakes and fruit and madame gobellis bulky form might be seen leaning over the dishes she had assembled quite a little party there that night the two brimonts were present and captain pullens tall figure was distinctly visible under the lamplight harriet was seated on the sofa and her full voice filled the atmosphere with melody theres something like a voice remarked the old doctor that is the very girl we have been talking of replied mrs pullen i told you she had a lovely voice and was an accomplished musician is that so said doctor phillips then she is still more dangerous than i imagined her to be those tones would be enough to drag any man down to perdition especially if accompanied by such a nature as i cannot but believe she must have inherited from her progenitors and see doctor there is ralph continued margaret pointing out her brother in law i left him with miss leyton he must have got rid of her by some means and crept up to the gobellis he cannot go for them he is so refined so fastidious with regard to people in general that a woman like the baroness must grate upon his feelings every time she opens her mouth and the baron never opens his at all he can only frequent their company for the sake of harriet brandt i have seen it for some time past and it has made me very uneasy he shall know everything about her to morrow and then if he will not hear reason doctor phillips shrugged his shoulders and said no more but surely said his companion you do not think for a moment that ralph could ever seriously contemplate breaking his engagement with elinor leyton for the sake of this girl o how angry arthur would be if he suspected his brother could be guilty of such a thing he who considers that a mans word should be his bond it is impossible to say margaret i should not like to give an opinion on the subject when young men are led away by their passions they lose sight of everything else and if this girl is anything like her mother she must be an epitome of lust o you will speak to ralph as soon as ever you can cried margaret in a tone of distress you will put the matter as strongly before him as possible will you not you may depend on my doing all i can margaret but as there seems no likelihood of my being able to interview the young gentleman to night suppose you and i go to bed i feel rather tired after my passage over and you must want to go back to your baby doctor said margaret in a timid voice as they ascended the hotel staircase together you dont think baby very ill do you i think she requires a great deal of care margaret but she has always had that i dont doubt it but i cant deny that there are symptoms about her case that i do not understand she seems to have had all her strength drawn out of her she is in the condition of a child who has been exercised and excited and hurried from place to place far beyond what she is able to bear but it may arise from internal causes i shall be better able to judge to morrow when my medicine has had its effect good night my dear and dont worry please god we will have the little one all right again in a couple of days but he only said the words out of compassion in his own opinion the infant was dying meanwhile harriet having finished her songs was leaning out of the window with ralph pullen by her side she wore an open sleeve and as he placed his hand upon her bare arm the girl thrilled from head to foot and so you are determined not to go to brussels he whispered in her ear why should i go you will not be there the baroness wants to stay for a week what would become of me all that time moping after you are you sure that you would mope monsieur brimont is a nice young man and seems quite ready to throw himself at your feet would he not do as well pro tem harriets only answer was to cast her large eyes upwards to meet his own does that mean no continued captain pullen then how would it do if i joined you there after a couple of days would the baroness be complaisant do you think and a little short sighted and let us go about together and show each other the sights of the town o im sure she would cried harriet all the blood in her body flying into her face she is so very kind to me madame gobelli she continued turning from the window to the light captain pullen says that if you will allow him to show us the lions of brussels he will come and join us there in a couple of days if i find i can manage it interposed ralph cautiously manage it why of course you can manage it said the baroness whats to inder a young man like you doing as e chooses youre not tied to your sisters apron string are you now mind we shall old you to it for i believe its the only thing that will make arriet come and i think a week in brussels will do us all good youre not looking well yourself you know captain pullen youre as white as ashes this evening and if i didnt know you were such a good boy i should say youd been dissipating a bit lately he he he the only dissipating i have indulged in is basking in the sunshine of your eyes madame replied ralph gallantly thats a good un retorted the baroness it is more likely youve been looking too much in the eyes of my little friend ere youre a couple of foxes thats what you are and i expect it would take all my time to be looking after you both and so i suppose its settled miss arriet and youll come with us to brussels after all yes madame if youll take charge of me said miss brandt well do that for a couple of days and then well give over charge are we to engage a room for you captain at the htel de saxe i had better see after that myself madame as the date of my coming is uncertain replied ralph but you will come whispered harriet need you ask would i not run over the whole world only to find myself by your side havent you taken the taste out of everything else for me harriet chapter viii doctor phillips was a man of sixty and a bachelor he had never made any home ties for himself and was therefore more interested in margaret pullen whose father had been one of his dearest friends than he might otherwise have been he feared that a heavy trial lay before her and he was unwilling to see it aggravated by any misconduct on the part of her brother in law he could see that the young man was to say the least of it not behaving fairly towards his fiance elinor leyton and he was determined to open his eyes to the true state of affairs with regard to harriet brandt he spent a sleepless night his last visit to margarets suffering child having strengthened his opinion as to her hopeless condition and he lay awake wondering how he should break the news to the poor young mother he rose with the intention of speaking to ralph without delay but he found it more difficult to get a word with him than he had anticipated the gobelli party had decided to start with the brimonts that afternoon and captain pullen stuck to them the entire morning ostensibly to assist the baroness in her preparations for departure but in reality as anyone could see to linger by the side of miss brandt miss leyton perceived her lovers defalcation as plainly as the rest but she was too proud to make a hint upon the subject even to margaret pullen she sat alone in the balcony reading a book and gave no sign of annoyance or discomfiture but a close observer might have seen the trembling of her lip when she attempted to speak and the fixed white look upon her face which betrayed her inward anxiety it made margarets kind heart ache to see her and dr phillips more indignant with ralph pullen than before the party for brussels had arranged to travel by the three oclock train and at the appointed time the doctor was ready in the balcony to accompany them to the entrept there were no cabs in heyst the station being in the town luggage was conveyed backwards and forwards in hand carts drawn by the porters and travellers invariably walked to their destination the baroness appeared dressed for her journey in an amazing gown of blue velvet trimmed with rare maltese lace with a heavy mantle over it and a small hat on her head which made her round flat unmeaning face look coarser than before she used the herr baron as a walking stick as usual whilst harriet brandt in a white frock and large hat shading her glowing eyes under a scarlet parasol looked like a tropical bird skimming by her side with captain pullen in close attendance carrying a flimsy wrap in case she should require it before she reached her journeys end the brimonts following in the rear were of no account beside their more brilliant and important friends ralph pullen did not look pleased when he saw doctor phillips join the party are you also going to the entrept he exclaimed what can you find to interest you there a dirty little smutty place i am going just to help the ladies over the line as there is no bridge for crossing perhaps i am bent on the same errand replied the doctor do you give me credit for less gallantry than yourself pullen thats right doctor said the baroness and ive no doubt youll be very useful my bobby aint any manner of good and the baron as so many traps to carry that e asnt got an arm to spare i only wish you were coming with us why dont you make up your mind to come over with captain pullen the day after to morrow and ave a little oliday i was not aware that captain pullen was going to brussels madame i fancy he will have to get miss leytons consent first at the mention of miss leytons name in connection with himself ralph pullen flushed uneasily and harriet brandt turned a look of startled enquiry upon the speaker o ang miss leyton retorted the baroness graphically she surely wouldnt stop captain pullens fun just because es staying with is sister in law i should call that very ard you cant always tie a young man to is relations apron strings doctor not always madame he replied and dropped the subject you wouldnt let miss leyton or mrs pullen keep you from me whispered harriet to her cavalier never he answered emphatically they had reached the little station by this time and the porters were calling out vociferously that the train was about to start for brussels so that in the hurry of procuring their tickets and conveying the ladies and the luggage across the cinder besprinkled line to where the train stood puffing to be off there was no more time to exchange sentimentalities or excite suspicion the party being safely stowed away in their carriage ralph pullen and doctor phillips stood on the wooden platform with their hats off bowing their farewells mind you dont put off your coming after thursday screamed the baroness to ralph as she filled up the entire window with her bulky person we shall expect you by dinner time and i shall bespeak a room for you whether you will or no arriet ere will break er eart if you dont turn up and i dont want the responsibility of er committing suicide on my ands all right all right responded ralph pretending to turn it off as a joke none of you shall do that on my account i promise you o well i ope youre going to keep your word or we shall come back to eyst in double quick time good bye good bye and kissing her fat hand to the two gentlemen the baroness was whisked out of heyst ralph looked longingly after the departing line of carriages for a minute and then crossed the line again to the road beyond doctor phillips did not say a word till they were well clear of the station and then he commenced of course youre not in earnest about following these people to brussels why should i not be i knew brussels well as a lad and i should enjoy renewing my acquaintance with the old town in proper company perhaps but you can hardly call that party a fit one for you to associate with youre alluding to the baron and baroness being in trade well as a rule i confess that i do not care to associate intimately with bootmakers and their friends but one does things abroad that one would not dream of doing in england and for all her vulgarity madame gobelli is very good natured and generous and i really dont see that i lower my dignity by being on friendly terms with her whilst here i was not alluding to madame gobelli though i do not think that either she or the brimonts are fit companions for a man who belongs to the limerick rangers or is engaged to marry the daughter of lord walthamstowe neither do i admire the spirit which would induce you to hobnob with them in heyst when you would cut them in bond street but as far as i know the baron and his wife are harmless it is miss harriet brandt that i would caution you against a quick resentment appeared on ralph pullens features his eyes darkened and an ominous wrinkle stood out on his brow and what may you have to say of miss brandt he demanded coldly a great deal more than you know or can possibly imagine she is not a fit person for elinor leyton to associate with and consequently one whom it is your duty to avoid instead of cultivating i think you exceed your duty doctor in speaking to me thus i am sorry you should think so pullen but your anger will not deter me from telling you what is in my mind you must not forget how old a friend i am of both sides of your family your brother arthur is one of my greatest chums and his wifes father was without exception my dearest friend added to this i am on intimate terms with the walthamstowes knowing what i do therefore i should hold myself criminal if i left you in ignorance of the truth concerning this young woman are you alluding may i ask to miss brandt i am alluding to the girl who calls herself by that name but who is in reality only the bastard daughter of henry brandt one of the most infamous men whom god ever permitted to desecrate this earth and his half caste mistress be careful what you say doctor phillips said ralph pullen with ill suppressed wrath gleaming in his blue eyes there is no need to be my dear fellow i can verify everything i say and i fear no mans resentment i was stationed in jamaica with my regiment some fifteen years ago when this girl was a child of six years old running half naked about her fathers plantation uncared for by either parent and associating solely with the negro servants brandt was a brute the perpetrator of such atrocities in vivisection and other scientific experiments that he was finally slaughtered on his own plantation by his servants and everyone said it served him right the mother was the most awful woman i have ever seen and my experience of the sex in back slums and alleys has not been small she was the daughter of a certain judge carey of barbadoes by one of his slave girls and brandt took her as his mistress before she was fourteen at thirty when i saw her she was a revolting spectacle gluttonous and obese her large eyes rolling and her sensual lips protruding as if she were always licking them in anticipation of her prey she was said to be obeah too by the natives and they ascribed all the deaths and diseases that took place on the plantation to her malign influence consequently when they got her in their clutches i have heard that they did not spare her but killed her in the most torturing fashion they could devise and did the british government take no notice of the massacre there was an enquiry of course but the actual perpetrator of the murders could not be traced and so the matter died out the hatred and suspicion in which brandt had been held for some time had a great effect upon the verdict for in addition to his terrible experiments upon animals experiments which he performed simply for his own gratification and for no use that he made of them in treating his fellow creatures he had been known to decoy diseased and old natives into his laboratory after which they were never seen again and it was the digging up of human bones on the plantation which finally roused the negroes to such a pitch of indignation that they rose en masse and after murdering both brandt and his abominable mistress they set fire to the house and burned it to the ground there is no doubt but that if the overseer of the plantation an african negro named pete had not carried off the little girl she would have shared the fate of her parents and who can say if it would not have been as well if she had i really cannot see what right you have to give vent to such a sentiment exclaimed captain pullen what has this terrible story got to do with miss brandt everything when the cat is black the kitten is black too its the law of nature i dont believe it miss brandt bears no trace in feature or character of the parentage you ascribe to her does she not your assertion only proves your ignorance of character or characteristics the girl is a quadroon and she shews it distinctly in her long shaped eyes with their blue whites and her wide mouth and blood red lips also in her supple figure and apparently boneless hands and feet of her personal character i have naturally had no opportunity of judging but i can tell you by the way she eats her food and the way in which she uses her eyes that she has inherited her half caste mothers greedy and sensual disposition and in ten years time she will in all probability have no figure at all she will run to fat i could tell that also at a glance and have you any more compliments to pay the young lady enquired captain pullen sarcastically i have this still to say pullen that she is a woman whom you must never introduce to your wife and that it is your bounden duty to separate her as soon as possible from your fiance and your sister in law and what if i refuse to interfere in a matter which as far as i can see concerns no one but miss brandt herself in that case i regret to say that i shall feel it my duty to inform your brother colonel pullen and your future father in law lord walthamstowe of what i have told you come my dear boy be reasonable this girl has attracted you i suppose we are all subject to a womans influence at times but you must not let it go further you must break it off and this is an excellent opportunity to do so your sisters infant is i fear seriously ill take your party on to ostende and send the baroness a polite note to say that you are prevented from going to brussels and all will be right you will take my advice will you not no ill be hanged if i will exclaimed the young man i am not a boy to be ordered here and there as if i were not fit to take care of myself ive pledged my word to go to brussels and to brussels i shall go if miss leyton doesnt like it she must do the other thing she does not shew me such a superfluity of affection as to prevent the necessity of my seeking for sympathy and friendship elsewhere i am sorry to hear you speak like that pullen it does not augur well for the happiness of your married life i have thought more than once lately that i shall not be married at all that is to miss leyton no no dont say so it is only a passing infidelity engendered by the attraction of this other girl consider what your brother would say and what lord walthamstowe would think if you committed the great mistake at this late hour of breaking off your engagement i cannot see why my brothers opinion or lord walthamstowes thoughts should interfere with the happiness of my whole life rejoined ralph sullenly however let that pass the question on the tapis is my acquaintance with miss brandt which you consider should be put a stop to for what reason if what you bring against her is true it appears to me that she has all the more need of the protection and loyalty of her friends it would be cowardly to desert a girl just because her father and mother happened to be brutes it is not her fault i quite allow that neither is it the fault of a madman that his progenitors had lunacy in their blood nor of a consumptive that his were strumous all the same the facts affect their lives and the lives of those with whom they come in contact it is the curse of heredity well and if so how can it concern anyone but the poor child herself o yes it can and it will and if i am not greatly mistaken harriet brandt carries a worse curse with her even than that she possesses the fatal attributes of the vampire that affected her mothers birth that endued her with the thirst for blood which characterised her life that will make harriet draw upon the health and strength of all with whom she may be intimately associated that may render her love fatal to such as she may cling to i must tell you pullen that i fear we have already proofs of this in the illness of your little niece whom her mother tells me was at one time scarcely ever out of miss brandts arms i have no other means of accounting for her sudden failure of strength and vitality you need not stare at me as if you thought i do not know what i am talking about there are many cases like it in the world cases of persons who actually feed upon the lives of others as the deadly upas tree sucks the life of its victim by lulling him into a sleep from which he never wakens phillips you must be mad do you know that you are accusing miss brandt of murder of killing the child to whom she never shewed anything but the greatest kindness why i have known her carry little ethel about the sands for a whole afternoon all the worse for poor little ethel i do not say she does harm intentionally or even consciously but that the deadly attributes of her bloodthirsty parents have descended on her in this respect i have not a shadow of doubt if you watch that young womans career through life you will see that those she apparently cares for most and clings to most will soonest fade out of existence whilst she continues to live all the stronger that her victims die rubbish i dont believe it replied ralph sturdily you medical men generally have some crotchet in your brains but this is the most wonderful bee that ever buzzed in a bonnet and all i can say is that i should be quite willing to try the experiment you have tried it pullen in a mild form and it has had its effect on you you are not the same fellow who came over to heyst though by all rules you should be looking better and stronger for the change and margaret has already complained to me of the strange effect this girl has had upon her but you must not breathe a suspicion to her concerning the childs illness or i verily believe she would murder miss brandt putting all this nonsense aside said ralph do you consider margarets baby to be seriously ill very seriously my medicines have not had the slightest effect upon her condition which is inexplicable her little life is being slowly sapped she may cease to breathe at any moment but i have not yet had the courage to tell your sister the truth how disappointed poor arthur will be yes but his grief will be nothing to the mothers she is quite devoted to her child by mutual consent they had dropped the subject of harriet brandt and now spoke only of family affairs ralph was a kind hearted fellow under all his conceit and felt very grave at the prospect held out in regard to his baby niece the fulfilment of the prophecy came sooner than even doctor phillips had anticipated as they were all sitting at dinner that evening madame lamont her eyes over brimming with tears rushed unceremoniously into the salle manger calling to margaret madame madame please come up to your room at once the dear baby is worse margaret threw one agonised glance at doctor phillips and rushed from the room followed by himself and elinor leyton the high staircase seemed interminable more than once margarets legs failed under her and she thought she should never reach the top but she did so all too soon on the bed was laid the infant form limp and lifeless and martin the nurse met them at the door bathed in tears oh maam she cried it happened all of a minute she was lying on my lap pretty dear just as usual when she went off in a convulsion and died died died echoed margaret in a bewildered voice doctor phillips who is it that has died the baby maam the dear baby she went off like a lamb without a struggle o dear mistress do try to bear it is my baby dead said margaret in the same dazed voice turning to the doctor who had already satisfied himself that the tiny heart and pulse had ceased to beat no my dear child she is not dead she is living with god try to think of her as quite happy and free from this worlds ill o but i wanted her so i wanted her exclaimed the bereaved mother as she clasped the senseless form in her arms o baby baby why did you go before you had seen your father and then she slid rather than sank from the bedside in a tumbled heap upon the floor it is better so it will help her through it said doctor phillips as he directed the nurse to carry the dead child into elinor leytons room and placed margaret on her own bed you will not object miss leyton i am sure and you must not leave mrs pullen to night of course i shall not replied elinor i have been afraid for days past that this would happen but poor margaret would not take any hints she spoke sympathetically but there were no tears in her eyes and she did not caress nor attempt to console her friend she did all that was required of her but there was no spontaneous suggestion on her part with regard either to the mother or the dead child and as doctor phillips noted her coolness he did not wonder so much at ralphs being attracted by the fervour and warmth of harriet brandt as soon as poor margaret had revived and had her cry out he administered a sleeping draught to her and leaving her in charge of elinor leyton he went downstairs again to consult captain pullen as to what would be the best thing for them to do ralph was very much shocked to hear of the babys sudden death and eager to do all in his power for his brothers wife there was no protestant cemetery in heyst and doctor phillips proposed that they should at once order a little shell and convey the childs body either to ostende or england as margaret might desire for burial the sooner she left the place where she had lost her child he said the better and his idea was that she would wish the body to be taken to devonshire and buried in the quiet country churchyard where her husbands father and mother were laid to sleep he left ralph to telegraph to his brother in india and to anyone the news might concern in england also to settle all hotel claims and give notice to the lamonts that they would leave on the morrow but supposing margaret should object suggested ralph she will not object replied the doctor she might if we were not taking the childs body with us but as it is she will be grateful to be thought and acted for she is a true woman god bless her i only wish he had not seen fit to bring this heavy trial on her head not a word was exchanged between the two men about harriet brandt ralph remembering the hint the doctor had thrown out respecting her being the ultimate cause of the babys illness did not like to bring up her name again felt rather guilty with respect to it indeed and doctor phillips was only too glad to see the young man bestirring himself to be useful and losing sight of his own worry in the trouble of his sister in law of course he could not have refused or even demurred at accompanying his party to england on so mournful an errand and to do him justice he did not wish it to be otherwise brussels and its anticipated pleasures had been driven clean out of his head by the little tragedy that had occurred in heyst and his attitude towards margaret when they met again was so quietly affectionate and brotherly that he was of infinite comfort to her she quite acquiesced in doctor phillips decision that her child should be buried with her fathers family and the mournful group with the little coffin in their midst set out without delay for devonshire chapter ix harriet brandt set off for brussels in the best of spirits captain pullen had pledged himself to follow her in a couple of days and had sketched with a free hand the pleasure they would mutually enjoy in each others company without the fear of mrs pullen or miss leyton popping on them round the corner madame gobelli also much flattered her vanity by speaking of ralph as if he were her confessed lover and prospective fianc so that what with the new scenes she was passing through and her anticipated good fortune harriet was half delirious with delight and looked as handsome as paint in consequence olga brimont on the contrary although quietly happy in the prospect of keeping house for her brother did not share in the transports of her convent companion alfred brimont observed more than once that she seemed to visibly shrink from miss brandt and took an early opportunity of asking her the reason why but all her answer was conveyed in a shrug of the shoulders and a request that he would not leave her at the hotel de saxe with the rest of the party but take her home at once to the rooms over which she was to preside for him in consequence the two brimonts said good bye to the gobellis and harriet brandt at the brussels station and drove to their apartments in the rue de vienne after which the others saw no more of them the baroness declared they were a good riddance of bad rubbish and that she had never liked that pasty faced mademoiselle brimont and believed that she was jealous of the brilliancy and beauty of her dear arriet the baroness had conceived one of her violent and generally short lived fancies for the girl and nothing for the time being was too good for her she praised her looks and her talents in the most extravagant manner and told everyone at the hotel that the baron and she had known her from infancy that she was their ward and that they regarded her as the daughter of the house with various other falsehoods that made harriet open her dark eyes with amazement whilst she felt that she could not afford to put a sudden end to her friendship with madame gobelli by denying them brussels is a very pretty town full of modern and ancient interest and there was plenty for them to see and hear during their first days there but harriet was resolved to defer visiting the best sights until captain pullen had joined them she went to the concerts at the quinonce and wauxhall and visited the zoological gardens but she would not go to the muse nor the acadmie des beaux arts nor the cathedral of sainte gudule whilst ralph remained in heyst madame gobelli laughed at her for her reticence called her a sly cat said she supposed they must make up their minds to see nothing of her when the handsome captain came to brussels finally sending her off in company of bobby to walk in the parc or visit the wiertz museum the baroness was not equal to much walking at the best of times and had been suffering from rheumatism lately so that she and the baron did most of their sight seeing in a carriage and left the young people to amuse themselves bobby was very proud to be elected miss brandts cavalier and get out of the way of his formidable mamma who made his table dhte life a terror to him he was a well grown lad and not bad looking in his blue eyes and white teeth he took after his mother but his hair was fair and his complexion delicate he was an anmic young fellow and very delicate being never without a husky cough which however the baroness seemed to consider of no consequence he hardly ever opened his mouth in the presence of his parents unless it were to remonstrate against the baronesss strictures on his appearance or his conduct but harriet brandt found he could be communicative enough when he was alone with her he gave her lengthy descriptions of the red house and the treasures which it contained of his mammas barouche lined with satin of the large garden which they had at holloway with its greenhouses and hot houses and the numbers of people who came to visit them there o yes rejoined harriet the baroness has told me about them prince adalbert and prince loris and others she said they often came to the red house i should like to know them very much the youth looked at her in a mysterious manner yes they do come very often and plenty of other people with them the earl of watherhouse and lord drinkwater and lady mountacue and more than i know the names of but but did mamma tell you why they come no not exactly to see her and the baron i suppose well yes for that too perhaps stammered bobby but there is another reason mamma is very wonderful you know she can tell people things they never knew before and she has a room where but i had better not say any more you might repeat it to her and then she would be so angry the two were on their way to the wiertz museum at the time and harriets curiosity was excited i will not i promise you bobby she said what has the baroness in that room bobby drew near enough to whisper as he replied o i dont know i darent say but horrible things go on there mamma has threatened sometimes to make me go in with her but i wouldnt for all the world our servants will never stay with us long one girl told me before she left that mamma was a witch and could raise up the dead do you think it can be true that it is possible i dont know said harriet and i dont want to know there are no dead that i want to see back again unless indeed it were dear old pete our overseer he was the best friend i ever had one night our house was burned to the ground and lots of the things in it and old pete wrapped me up in a blanket and carried me to his cabin in the jungle and kept me safe until my friends were able to send me to the convent i shall never forget that i should like to see old pete again but i dont believe the baroness could bring him back it wants obeah to do that what is obeah miss brandt witchcraft bobby is it wicked i dont know i know nothing about it but let us talk of something else i dont believe your mamma can do anything more than other people and she only says it to frighten you but you mustnt tell her i said so is this the wiertz museum i thought it would be a much grander place i heard father say that it is the house wiertz lived in and he left it with all his pictures to the belgian government on condition they kept it just as it was they entered the gallery and harriet brandt although not a great lover of painting in general stood enwrapt before most of the pictures she passed over the bouton de rose and the sacred paintings with a cursory glance but the representation of napoleon in hell being fed with the blood and bones of his victims of the mother in a time of famine devouring her child and of the suicide between his good and evil angels appeared to absorb all her senses her eyes fixed themselves upon the canvasses she stood before them entranced enraptured and when bobby touched her arm as a hint to come and look at something else she drew a long breath as though she had been suddenly aroused from sleep again and again she returned to the same spot the pictures holding her with a strange fascination which she could not shake off and when she returned to the hotel she declared the first thing she should do on the following morning would be to go back to the wiertz museum and gaze once more upon those inimitable figures but such orrid subjects my dear said the baroness bobby says they were all blood and bones but i like them i like them replied harriet moving her tongue slowly over her lips they interest me they are so life like well to morrow will be thursday you know so i expect you will have somebodys elses wishes to consult you will ave a letter by the early post you may depend upon it to say that the captain will be with us by dinner time harriet brandt flushed a deep rose it was when the colour came into her usually pale cheeks and her eyes awakened from their slumbers and sparkled that she looked beautiful on the present occasion as she glanced up to see bobby bates regarding her with steadfast surprise and curiosity she blushed still more youll be aving a fine time of it together you two i expect continued the baroness facetiously and bobby ere will ave to content imself with me and his papa but well all go to the theatre together to morrow night ive taken five seats for the alcazar which the captain said was the house he liked best in brussels how good you are to me exclaimed harriet as she wound her slight arms about the uncouth form of the baroness good nonsense why gustave and i look upon you as our daughter and youre welcome to share everything that is ours you can come and live altogether at the red ouse if you like but i dont expect we shall keep you long though i must say i should be vexed to see you throw yourself away upon an army captain before you have seen the world a bit o dont talk of such a thing pray dont said the girl hiding her face in the baronesss ample bosom you know there is nothing as yet only a pleasant friendship he he he chuckled madame gobelli so thats what you call a pleasant friendship eh i wonder what captain pullen calls it i expect we shall ear in a few days but what e thinks is of no consequence so long as you dont commit yourself till youve looked about you a little i do want you to meet prince adalbert is airs like flax such a nice contrast to yours and you speaking french so well you would get on first rate together bobby did not appear to like this conversation at all i call prince adalbert hideous he interposed why his face is as red as a tomato and he drinks too much ive heard papa say so i am sure miss brandt wouldnt like him old your tongue exclaimed the baroness angrily ow dare you interrupt when im speaking to miss brandt a child like you what next i wonder just mind your own business bobby or ill send you out of the room go away now do and amuse yourself we dont want any boys ere miss brandt is going into the parc with me said bobby sturdily ah well if she is going to be so good i ope you wont worry er thats all but if you would prefer to come out in the carriage with the baron and me my dear well take a drive to the bois de cambres all right if bobby can come too acquiesced harriet lor whatever do you want that boy to come with us for ell only take up all the room with is long legs but we mustnt leave him alone said the girl kindly i shouldnt enjoy my drive if we were to do so the lad gave her a grateful glance through eyes that were already moist with the prospect of disappointment very well then said madame gobelli if you will ave your own way e may come but you must take all the trouble of im arriet mind that bobby was only too happy to accompany the party even in these humiliating circumstances and they all set out together for the bois de cambres the next day was looked forward to by harriet brandt as one of certain happiness but the morning post arrived without bringing the anticipated notice from ralph pullen that he should join them as arranged in the afternoon the piteous eyes that she lifted to the baronesss face as she discovered the defalcation were enough to excite the compassion of anyone its all right said her friend across the breakfast table e said e would come so theres no need of writing besides it was much safer not e couldnt stir i daresay without one of those two cats mrs pullen or miss leyton at is elbow so e thought they might find out what e was after and prevent is starting say they wanted to leave eyst or something just to keep im at their side you mark my words ive means of finding out things that you know nothing of and ive just seen it written over your ead that ell be ere by dinner time so you can go out for your mornings jaunt in perfect comfort harriet brightened up at this prophecy and bobby had never had a merrier time with her than he had that morning but the prophecy was not fulfilled ralph pullen was by that time in england with his bereaved sister in law and the night arrived without the people in brussels hearing anything of him he had not even written a line to account for his failure to keep his engagement with them the fact is that captain pullen although as a rule most punctilious in all matters of courtesy felt so ashamed of himself and the folly into which he had been led that he felt that silence would be the best explanation that he had decided to break off the acquaintanceship he had no real feeling for harriet brandt or anybody except himself with him out of sight was out of mind and the sad occurrence which had forced him to return to england seemed an excellent opportunity to rid himself of an undesirable entanglement but harriet became frantic at the nonfulfilment of his promise her strong feelings could not brook delay she wanted to rush back to heyst to demand the reason of his defalcation and in default of that to write or wire to him at once and ascertain what he intended to do but the baroness prevented her doing either look ere arriet she said to the girl who was working herself up into a fever its no use going on like this ell come or e wont come most likely youll see im to morrow or next day and if not itll be because is sister wont let im leave er and the poor young man doesnt know what excuse to make couldnt you see ow that doctor phillips was set against the captain joining us e went most likely and told mrs pullen and she as dissuaded her brother from coming to brussels its ard for a man to go against is own relations you know but he should have written pleaded harriet it makes me look a fool not a bit of it captain pullen thinks you no fool es more likely to be thinking imself one and after all you know we shall be going back to eyst in a couple more days and then you can ave im all to yourself in the evenings and scold im to your earts content but the girl was not made of the stuff that is amenable to reason she pouted and raved and denounced ralph pullen like a fury declaring she would not speak to him when they met again yet lay awake at night all the same wondering what had detained him from her side and longing with the fierceness of a tigress for blood to feel his lips against her own and to hear him say that he adored her bobby bates stood by during this tempestuous time very sorrowful and rather perplexed he was not admitted to the confidence of his mother and her young friend so that he did not quite understand why harriet brandt should have so suddenly changed from gay to grave just because captain pullen was unable to keep his promise to join them at brussels he had so enjoyed her company hitherto and she had seemed to enjoy his but now she bore the gloomiest face possible and it was no pleasure to go out with her at all he wondered if all girls were so as capricious and changeable bobby had not seen much of women he had been kept in the schoolroom for the better part of his life and his mamma had not impressed him with a great admiration for the sex so naturally he thought harriet brandt to be the most charming and beautiful creature he had ever seen though he was too shy to whisper the truth even to himself he tried to bring back the smiles to her face in his boyish way and the gift of an abnormally large and long sucre de pomme really did achieve that object better than anything else but the defalcation of captain pullen made them all lose their interest in brussels and they returned to heyst a day sooner than they had intended as the train neared the station harriets forgotten smiles began to dimple her face again and she peered eagerly from the windows of the carriage as if she expected ralph pullen to be on the platform to meet them but from end to end she saw only cinders flemish country women with huge baskets of fish or poultry on their arms priests in their soutanes and broad brimmed hats and belgians chattering and screaming to each other and their children as they crossed the line still she alighted with her party expectant and happy and traversed the little distance between the entrept and the hotel far quicker than the baroness and her husband could keep up with her she rushed into the balcony and almost fell into the arms of the proprietaire madame lamont ah mademoiselle she cried welcome back to heyst but have you heard the desolating news what news exclaimed harriet with staring eyes and a blanched cheek why that the english lady cette madame si tranquille si charmante lost her dear bb the very day that mademoiselle and madame la baronne left the hotel lost repeated harriet do you mean that the child is dead ah yes i do indeed replied madame lamont the dear bb was taken with a fit whilst they were all at dinner and never recovered again ctait une perte irrparable madame was like a creature distracted whilst she remained here where is she then where has she gone cried harriet excitedly ah that i cannot tell mademoiselle the dear bb was taken away to england to be buried madame pullen and mademoiselle leyton and monsieur phillippe and le beau capitaine all left heyst on the following day that is wednesday and went to ostende to take the boat for dover i know no more captain pullen has gone away he is not here exclaimed miss brandt betraying herself in her disappointment oh i dont believe it it cannot be true he has gone to ostende to see them on board the steamer but he will return i am sure he will madame lamont shrugged her shoulders monsieur paid everything before he went and gave douceurs to all the servants i do not think he has any intention of returning at that juncture the baron and baroness reached the hotel harriet flew to her friend for consolation i cannot believe what madame lamont says she exclaimed she declares that they are all gone for good mrs pullen and miss leyton and captain pullen and the doctor they have returned to england but he is sure to come back isnt he after all his promises to meet us in brussels he couldnt be so mean as to run off to england without a word or a line unless he intended to come back she clung to madame gobelli with her eyes wide open and her large mouth trembling with agitation until even the coarse fibre of the baronesss propriety made her feel ashamed of the exhibition ould up arriet she said you dont want the ole ouse to ear what youre thinking of surely let me speak to madame lamont what is all the row about madame she continued turning to the proprietaire there is no row at all madame was the reply i was only telling mademoiselle brandt of the sad event that has taken place here during your absence that that chre madame pullen had the great misfortune to lose her sweet bb the very day you left heyst and that the whole party have quitted in consequence and crossed to england i thought since mademoiselle seemed so intimate with madame pullen and so fond of the dear child that she would be dsole to hear the sad news but she appears to have forgotten all about it in her grief at hearing that the beau capitaine accompanied his family to england where they go to bury the petite and with rather a contemptuous smile upon her face madame lamont re entered the salle manger now arriet dont make a fool of yourself said the baroness you eard what that woman said shes laughing at you and your captain and the story will be all over the hotel in half an hour dont make any more fuss about it if es gone crying wont bring im back its much arder for mrs pullen losing her baby so suddenly im sorry for er poor woman but as for the other theres as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it but harriet brandt only answered her appeal by rushing away down the corridor and up the staircase to her bedroom like a whirlwind the girl had not the slightest control over her passions she would listen to no persuasion and argument only drove her mad she tumbled headlong up the stairs and dashing into her room which had been reserved for her threw herself tumultuously upon the bed how lonely and horrible the corridor on which her apartment opened seemed olga brimont mrs pullen miss leyton and ralph all gone no one to talk to no one to walk with except the baroness and her stupid husband of course this interpreted simply meant that captain pullen had left the place without leaving a word behind him to say the why or wherefore or hold out any prospect of their meeting again of course it was impossible but that they must meet again they should meet again harriet brandt said to herself between her closed teeth but meanwhile what a wilderness what a barren dreary place this detestable heyst would seem without him the girl put her head down on the pillow and taking the corner of the linen case between her strong white teeth shook it and bit it as a terrier worries a rat but that did not relieve her feelings sufficiently and she took to a violent fit of sobbing hot angry tears coursing each other down her cheeks until they were blurred and stained and she lay back upon the pillow utterly exhausted the first dinner bell rang without her taking any notice of it and the second was just about to sound when there came a low tap at her bedroom door at first she did not reply but when it was repeated though rather timidly she called out who is it i am ill i dont want any dinner i cannot come down a low voice answered it is i dear miss brandt bobby may i come in mamma has sent me to you with a message very well you can enter but i have a terrible headache said harriet the door opened softly and the tall lanky form of bobby bates crept silently into the room he held a small bunch of pink roses in his hand and he advanced to the bedside and laid them without a word on the pillow beside her hot inflamed cheek they felt deliciously cool and refreshing harriet turned her face towards them and in doing so met the anxious perturbed eyes of bobby well she said smiling faintly and what is your mammas message she wishes to know if you are coming down to dinner it is nearly ready no no i cannot i am not hungry and my eyes are painful replied harriet turning her face slightly away the lad rose and drew down the blind of her window through which the setting sun was casting a stream of light and then captured a flacon of eau de cologne from her toilet table and brought it to her in his hand may i sit beside you a little while in case you need anything he asked no no bobby you will want your dinner and your mamma will want you you had better go down again at once and tell her that if my head is better i will meet her on the digue this evening i dont want any dinner i could not eat it whilst you lie here sick and unhappy i want to stay to see if i can help you or do you any good i wish i wish i could murmured the lad your roses have done me good already replied harriet more brightly it was sweet of you to bring them to me bobby i wish i had ten thousand pounds a year said bobby feverishly that i might bring you roses and everything that you like best he laid his blonde head on the pillow by the side of hers and harriet turned her face to his and kissed him the blood rushed into his face and he trembled it was the first time that any woman had kissed him and all the feelings of his manhood rushed forth in a body to greet the creature who had awakened them as for harriet brandt the boys evident admiration flattered and pleased her the tigress deprived of blood will sometimes condescend to milder food and the feelings with which she regarded captain pullen were such as could be easily replaced by anyone who evinced the same reciprocity bobby bates was not a beau sabreur but he was a male creature whom she had vanquished by her charms and it interested her to watch his rising passion and to know that he could never possibly expect it to be requited she kissed and fondled him as he sat beside her with his head on the pillow calling him every nice name she could think of and caressing him as if he had been what the baroness chose to consider him a child of ten years old his sympathy and entreaties that she would make an effort to join them on the digue added to his lovelorn eyes the clear childish blue of which was already becoming blurred with the heat of passion convinced her that all was not lost although ralph pullen had been ungrateful and impolite enough to leave heyst without sending her notice and presently she persuaded the lad to go down to his dinner and inform the baroness that she had ordered a cup of tea to be sent up to her bedroom and would try to rise after she had taken it and join them on the digue but you will keep a look out for me bobby wont you she said in parting you will not let me miss your party or i shall feel so lonely that i shall come straight back to bed miss you as if i would exclaimed the boy fervently why i shall not stir from the balcony until you appear o miss brandt i love you so you cannot tell you will never know but you seem like part of my life silly boy replied harriet reproachfully as she gave him another kiss there run away at once and dont tell your mother what weve been about or she will never let me speak to you again bobbys eyes answered for him that he would be torn to pieces before he let their precious secret out of his grasp as he took his unwilling way down to the table dhte well you ave made a little fool of yourself and no mistake was the baronesss greeting as harriet joined her in the balcony an hour later and a nice lot of lies ive ad to tell about you to mrs montague and the rest but luckily theyre all so full of the poor childs death and the coffin of white cloth studded with silver nails that was brought from bruges to carry the body to england in that they ad no time to spare for your tantrums lor that poor young man must ave ad enough to do i can tell you from all accounts without writing to you everything was on is ands for mrs pullen wouldnt let the doctor out of er sight e ad to fly off to bruges to get the coffin and to wire half over the world besides aving the two women to tow about so you mustnt be ard on im ell write soon and explain everything you may make sure of that and if e dont why we shall be after im before long aldershot where the limerick rangers are quartered is within a stones throw of london and lord menzies and mr nalgett often run over to the red ouse and so can captain pullen if he chooses so you just make yourself appy and it will be all right before long o im all right cried harriet gaily i was only a little startled at the news so would anyone have been come along bobby let us walk over the dunes to the next town this cool air will do my head good good bye baroness you neednt expect us till you see us bobby and i are going for a good long walk and tucking the lads arm under her own she walked off at a tremendous pace and the pair were soon lost to view i wish that bobby was a few years older remarked the baroness thoughtfully to her husband as they were left alone she wouldnt ave made a bad match for him for she as a tidy little fortune and its all in consols but perhaps its just as well theres no chance of it she aint got much eart i couldnt ave believed that shed receive the news of that poor babys death without a tear or so much as a word of regret when at one time she ad it always in er arms she quite forgot all about it thinking of the man drat the men theyre more trouble than theyre worth but es pretty sure to come after er as soon as e ears shes at the red ouse but to what good mein tear demanded the baron when you know he is betrothed to miss leyton yes and ell marry miss leyton too es not the sort of man to let the main chance go and arriet will console erself with a better beau i can read all that without your telling me gustave but miss leyton wont get off without a scratch or two all the same and thats what im aiming at ill teach er not to call me a female elephant ive got my knife into that young woman and i mean to turn it confound er impudence what next and having delivered herself of her feelings the baroness rose and proceeded to take her evening promenade along the digue chapter x the red house at holloway was like its owner a contradiction and an anomaly it had lain for many years in chancery neglected and uncared for and the baroness had purchased it for a song she was very fond of driving bargains and sometimes she was horribly taken in she had been known to buy a house for two thousand pounds for a mere caprice and exchange it six months afterwards for a dinner service but as a rule she was too shrewd to be cheated for her income was not a tenth part of what she represented when she had concluded her bargain for the red house which she did after a single survey of the premises and entered on possession she found it would take double the sum she had paid to put it into proper repair it was a very old house of the georgian era standing in its own grounds of about a couple of acres and containing thirty rooms full of dust damp rats and decay the baroness however having sent for a couple of workmen from the firm to put the tangled wilderness which called itself a garden into something like order sent in all her household gods and settled down there with william and two rough maid servants as lady of the manor the inside of the red house presented an incongruous appearance this extraordinary woman who could not sound her aspirates and could hardly write her own name had a wonderful taste for old china and pictures and knew a good thing from a bad one her drawing room was heaped with valuables many of them piled on rickety tables which threatened every minute to overturn them upon the ground the entrance hall was dingy bare and ill lighted and the breakfast room to the side was furnished with the merest necessities yet the dressing table in the baronesss sleeping apartment was draped in ruby velvet and trimmed with a flounce of the most costly brussels lace which a princess might not have been ashamed to wear the bed was covered with a duvet of the thickest satin richly embroidered by her own hand whilst the washing stand held a set of the commonest and cheapest crockery everything about the house was on the same scale it looked as though it belonged to people who had fallen from the utmost affluence to the depths of poverty harriet brandt was terribly disappointed when she entered it bobbys accounts of the magnificence of his home having led her to expect nothing short of a palace the baroness had insisted on her accompanying them to england she had taken one of her violent fancies to the girl and nothing would satisfy her but that harriet should go back with her husband and herself to the red house and stay there as long as she chose now look ere she said in her rough way you must make the red ouse your ome liberty all as i call it get up and go to bed go out and come in just when you see fit do what you like see what you like and invite your friends as if the ouse was your own the baron and i are often alf the day at the boot shop but that need make no difference to you i daresay youll find some way to amuse yourself youre the daughter of the ouse remember and free to do as you choose harriet gladly accepted the offer she had no friends of her own to go to and the prospect of living by herself in an unknown city was rather lonely she was full of anticipation also that by means of the red house and the baronesss influence she would soon hear of or see captain pullen again full of hope that madame gobelli would write to the young man and force him to fulfil the promises he had made to her she did not want to know prince adalbert or prince loris at the present moment it was ralph and ralph only and none other would fill the void she felt at losing him she was sure there must be some great mistake at the bottom of his strange silence and that they had but to meet to see it rectified she was only too glad then when the day for their departure from heyst arrived most of the english party had left the lion dor by that time the death of mrs pullens child seemed to have frightened them away some became nervous lest little ethel had inhaled poisonous vapours from the drainage others thought that the atmosphere was unhealthy or that it was getting too late in the year for the seaside and so the visitors dwindled until the baroness gobelli found they were left alone with foreigners and elected to return to england in consequence harriet had wished to write to captain pullen and ask for an explanation of his conduct but the baroness conjured her not to do so even threatened to withdraw her friendship if the girl went against her advice the probabilities were she said that the young man was staying with his sister in law wherever she might be and that the letter would be forwarded to him from the camp and fall into the hands of mrs pullen or miss leyton she assured harriet that it would be safer to wait until she had ascertained his address and was sure that any communication would reach him at first hand a mans never the worse for being let alone arriet she said dont let im think es of too much consequence and ell value you all the more our fellows dont care for the bird that walks up to the gun a little olesome indifference will do my gentleman all the good in the world o but how can i be indifferent when i am burning to see him again and to hear why he never wrote to say that he could not come to brussels exclaimed harriet excitedly do you think it was all falsehoods madame gobelli do you think that he does not want to see me any more her eyes were flashing like diamonds her cheeks and hands were burning hot the baroness chuckled over her ardour and anxiety he he he you little fool no i dont anyone could see with alf an eye that he took a fancy for you youre the sort of stuff to stir up a man and make im forget everything but yourself now dont you worry ell be at the red ouse like a shot as soon as e ears were back in london mark my words it wont be long before we ave the ole lot of em down on us like bees umming round a flower pot after this flattering tale it was disheartening to arrive in town on a chilly september day under a pouring rain and to see the desolate appearance presented by the red house it was seven in the evening before they reached holloway and drove up the dark carriage drive clumped by laurels to the hall door after the grand description given by bobby of his mammas barouche lined with olive green satin harriet was rather astonished that they should have to charter cabs from the victoria station to holloway instead of being met by the baronesss private carriage but she discovered afterwards that though there was a barouche standing in the coach house which had been purchased in a moment of reckless extravagance by madame gobelli there were no horses to draw it and the only vehicle kept by the baroness was a very much patched not to say disreputable looking victoria with a spavined cob attached to it in which william drove the mistress when she visited the boot premises the chain having been taken down the hall door was opened to them by a slight timid looking person whom harriet mistook for an upper housemaid well miss wynward exclaimed the baroness as she stumped into the hall ere we are you see yes my lady said the person she addressed but i thought from not hearing again that you would travel by the night boat your rooms are ready she hastened to add only dinner you see i had no orders about it that doesnt signify interrupted the baroness send out for a steak and give us some supper instead ere william where are you take my bag and miss brandts up to our rooms and gustave you can carry the wraps wheres that devil bobby come ere at once and make yourself useful what are you standing there staring at arriet for dont you see miss wynward go and say ow dye do to er bobby started and crossing to where miss wynward stood held out his hand she shook it warmly how are you bobby she said you dont look much stronger for your trip i expected to see you come back with a colour nonsense commenced the baroness testily what rubbish you old maids do talk what should you know about boys ow many ave you got ere why dont you kiss im youve smacked im often enough i know miss wynward tried to pass the coarse rejoinder off as a joke but it was with a very plaintive smile that she replied i think bobby is growing rather too tall to be kissed and he thinks so too dont you bobby bobby was about to make some silly reply when his mamma interrupted him oh does he ell be wanting to kiss the gals soon so e may as well practise on you first come bobby do you ear what i say kiss er but miss wynward drew up her spare figure with dignity no my lady she said quietly i do not wish it he he he giggled the baroness as she commenced to mount the stairs e aint old enough for you thats whats the matter come along arriet my dear im dog tired and i daresay youre much the same let us ave some ot water to our rooms miss wynward harriet brandt was now ushered by her hostess into a bedroom on the same floor as her own and left to unpack her bundles and boxes as she best might it was not a badly furnished room but there was too much pomp and too little comfort in it the mantelshelf was ornamented with some rare old chelsea figures and a venetian glass hung above them but the carpet was threadbare and the dressing table was inconveniently small and of painted deal but as though to atone for these discrepancies the hangings to the bed were of satin and the blind that shaded the window was edged with neapolitan lace harriet had not been used to luxuries in the convent but her rooms in the lion dor had been amply provided with all she could need and she was a creature of sensual and indolent temperament who felt any rebuff in the way of her comfort terribly there was an un homelike feeling in the red house and its furniture and a coldness in their reception which made the passionate excited creature feel inclined to sit down and burst into tears she was on the very brink of doing so when a tap sounded on the door and miss wynward entered with a zinc can of hot water which she placed on the washing stand then she stood for a moment regarding the girl as though she guessed what was in her mind before she said miss brandt i believe i am so sorry that the baroness never wrote me with any certainty regarding her arrival or things would have been more comfortable i hope you had a good dinner on board no said harriet shaking her head i felt too ill to eat but it does not signify thank you but you are looking quite upset supper cannot be ready for another hour i will go and make you a cup of tea she hurried from the room again and presently returned with a small tray on which was set a svres cup and saucer and apostle teaspoon with an earthenware teapot that may possibly have cost sixpence but harriet was too grateful for the tea to cavil whence it came and drinking it refreshed her more than anything else could have done thank you thank you so much she said to miss wynward i think the long journey and the boat had been too much for me i feel much better now it is such a melancholy house to come to when one is out of sorts observed her companion i have felt that myself it will not give you a good impression of your first visit to london her ladyship wrote me you had just come from the west indies she added timidly yes i have not long arrived in europe replied harriet but i thought i fancied the baroness gave me the idea that the red house was particularly gay and cheerful and that so many people visited her here that is true a great many people visit here but not such people perhaps as a young lady would care for o i care for every sort said harriet more gaily and you dont you care for company miss wynward i have nothing to do with it miss brandt beyond seeing that the proper preparations are made for receiving it i am bobbys governess and housekeeper to the baroness bobby is getting rather tall for a governess laughed harriet he is poor boy but his education is very deficient he ought to have been sent to school long ago but her ladyship would not hear of it but i never teach him now he is supposed to be finished why dont you find another situation then demanded harriet who was becoming interested in the ex governess she was a fragile melancholy looking woman of perhaps five and thirty who had evidently been good looking in her day and would have been so then but for her attenuation and shabby dress but she was evidently a gentlewoman and far above the menial offices she appeared to fill in the red house she gazed at harriet for a minute in silence after she had put the last question to her and then answered slowly there are reasons which render it unadvisable but you miss brandt have you known the baroness before i never saw her till we met at heyst and she invited me here replied the girl o why did you come why did you come exclaimed miss wynward as she left the room harriet stood gazing at the door as it closed behind her why had she come what an extraordinary question to ask her for the same reason that other people accepted invitations to them by their friends because she expected to enjoy herself and have the protection of the baroness on first entering english society but why should this governess her dependant almost her servant put so strange a question to her why had she come she could not get it out of her mind she was roused from her train of speculation by hearing the baroness thumping on the outside panels of her door with her stick come along she cried never mind dressing the suppers ready at last and im as ungry as an unter hastily completing her toilet harriet joined her hostess who conducted her down to a large dining room wrapt in gloom the two dozen morocco chairs ranged against the wall looked sepulchral by the light of a single lamp placed in the centre of a long mahogany table which was graced by a fried steak a huge piece of cheese bread and butter and lettuces from the garden harriet regarded the preparations for supper with secret dismay she was greedy by nature but it was the love of good feeding rather than a superfluity of food that induced her to be so however when the baron produced a couple of bottles of the very best champagne to add to the meal she felt her appetite somewhat revive and played almost as good a knife and fork as the baroness bobby and miss wynward who as it appeared took her meals with the family were the only ones who did not do justice to the supper the lad looked worn out and very pale but when miss wynward suggested that a glass of champagne might do him good and dispel the exhaustion under which he was evidently labouring his mother vehemently opposed the idea champagne for a child like im she cried i never eard of such a thing do you want to make im a drunkard miss wynward no thank you there ave been no ard drinkers in our family and e shant begin it is father was one of the soberest men alive e never took anything stronger than toast and water all the time i knew im of course not your ladyship stammered miss wynward who seemed in abject fear of her employer i only thought as bobby seems so very tired that a little stimulant then let im go to bed replied madame gobelli bed is the proper place for boys when theyre tired come sir off to bed with you at once and dont let me ear anything more of you till to morrow morning but maynt i have some supper pleaded bobby not a bit of it reiterated the baroness if youre so done up that you require champagne your stomach cant be in a fit state to digest beef and bread be off at once i say or youll get a taste of my stick but my lady said miss wynward entreatingly its not a bit of good miss wynward i know more about boys insides than you do sleeps the thing for bobby now no more nonsense i say but bobby after one long look at harriet brandt had already quitted the room this episode had the effect of destroying miss wynwards appetite she sat gazing at her plate for a few minutes and then with some murmured excuse of its being late she rose and disappeared the baroness was some time over her meal and harriet had an opportunity to examine the apartment they sat in as well as the dim light allowed her to do the walls were covered with oil paintings and good ones as she could see at a glance whilst at the further end where narrow shelves were fixed from the floor to the ceiling was displayed the famous dinner service of svres for which the baroness was said to have bartered the two thousand lease of her house harriet glanced from the pictures and the china upon the walls to the steak and bread and cheese upon the table and marvelled at the incongruity of the whole establishment madame gobelli who whilst at the lion dor had appeared to think nothing good enough for her was now devouring fried steak and onions as if they had been the daintiest of fare but the champagne made amends on that night at least for the solids which accompanied it and the girl was quite ready to believe that the poverty of the table was only due to the fact that they had arrived at the red house unexpectedly as they reached the upper corridor her host and hostess parted with her with much effusion and passing into their own room shut the door and locked it noisily as harriet gained hers she saw the door opposite partly unclose to display poor bobby standing there to see her once again he was clothed only in his long night shirt and looked like a lanky ghost but he was too childish in mind to think for one moment that his garb was not a suitable one for a lover to accost his mistress in she heard him whisper her name as she turned the handle of her own door why bobby she exclaimed not in bed yet hush hush he said in a low voice or mamma will hear you i couldnt sleep till i had seen you again and wished you good night poor dear boy are you not very hungry no thanks miss wynward is very kind to me she has seen after that but to leave without a word to you that was the hard part of it poor bobby ejaculated harriet again drawing nearer to him but you must not stay out of bed you will catch your death of cold kiss me then and i will go he advanced his face to the opening of the door and she put her lips to his and drew his breath away with her own good night good night murmured bobby with a long sigh god bless you good night and then he disappeared and harriet entered her own room and her eyes gleamed as she recognised the fact that bobby also was going to make a fool of himself for her sake the next morning she was surprised on going downstairs at about nine oclock to find a cloth laid over only part of the dining table and breakfast evidently prepared for one person she was still gazing at it in astonishment and wondering what it meant when miss wynward entered the room to express a hope that miss brandt had slept well and had everything that she required o certainly yes but where are we going to have breakfast here miss brandt if it pleases you i was just about to ask what you would like for your breakfast but the baron and baroness o they started for the manufactory two hours ago her ladyship is a very early riser when at home and they have some four miles to drive the manufactory echoed harriet do you mean where they make the boots and shoes yes there is a manufactory in germany and another in england where the boots and shoes are finished off and then there is the shop in oxford street where they are sold the barons business is a very extensive one so i have understood but what good can madame gobelli do there what can a woman know about such things miss wynward shrugged her shoulders she looks after the young women who are employed i believe and keeps them up to their work the baroness is a very clever woman she knows something about most things and a good deal that were better left unknown she added with a sigh and does she go there every morning not always but as a rule she does she likes to have a finger in the pie and fancies that nothing can go on properly without her and she is right so far that she has a much better head for business than the baron who would like to be out of it all if he could but why cant he give it up then since they are so very rich demanded harriet miss wynward regarded her for a moment as if she wondered who had given her the information and then said quietly but all this time we are forgetting your breakfast miss brandt what will you take an egg or a piece of bacon o i dont care replied harriet yawning i never can eat when i am alone where is bobby wont he take his breakfast with me o he had his long ago with his mamma but i daresay he would not mind a second edition poor boy she walked to the french windows which opened from a rustic porch to the lawn and called bobby bobby yes miss wynward replied the lad in a more cheerful tone than harriet remembered to have ever heard him use before what is it come in my dear and keep miss brandt company whilst she takes her breakfast wont i cried bobby as he came running from the further end of the disorderly garden with a bunch of flowers they are for you he exclaimed as he put them into harriets hand i gathered them on purpose thank you bobby she replied it was kind of you she felt cheered by the simple attention for her hostess to have left her on the very first morning without a word of explanation had struck her as looking very much notwithstanding all the effusive flattery and protestations of attachment with which she had been laden as if she were not wanted at the red house but when her morning meal was over and she had been introduced to every part of the establishment under the chaperonage of bobby to the tangled overgrown garden the empty stables papas library which was filled with french and german books and mammas drawing room which was so full of valuable china that one scarcely dared move freely about it the burning thirst to see or hear something of ralph pullen returned with full force upon harriet and she enquired eagerly of miss wynward when her hostess might be expected to return miss wynward looked rather blank as she replied not till dinner time i am afraid i fancy she will find too much to enquire about and to do after so long an absence from home i am so sorry miss brandt she continued noting the look of disappointment on the girls face that her ladyship did not make this plain to you last night her injunctions to me were to see that you had everything you required and to spare no trouble or expense on your account but that is not like having her here of course have you been into the library there are some nice english works there and there is a piano in the drawing room which you might like to use i am afraid it is not in tune on account of the rain we have had and that i have not opened it myself during the baronesss absence and indeed it is never used except to teach bobby his music lessons on but it may amuse you in default of anything else o i daresay i shall find something to amuse myself with replied harriet rather sullenly i have my own instrument with me and my books thank you but is no one likely to call this afternoon do you think this afternoon echoed miss wynward are you expecting any of your own friends to see you o no i have no friends in england none at least that know i have returned from heyst but the baroness told me she said the red house was always full of guests prince adalbert and prince loris and a lot of others do you think they may come to day to see her o not in september replied her companion it is not the season now miss brandt and all the fashionable people are out of town at the foreign watering places or shooting in the country her ladyship could never have intended you to understand that the people you have mentioned would come here at any time except between may and july they do come here then sometimes but not i expect as you think not as friends i mean not as friends what as then demanded harriet well returned miss wynward dubiously many of them have business with her ladyship and they come to see her upon it i generally conduct them to her presence and leave them alone with her but that is all i see of them they have never come here to a party or dinner to my knowledge how very extraordinary cried harriet what do they come for then the baroness must tell you that replied the other gravely i am not in her confidence and if i were i should not feel justified in revealing it this conversation drove harriet to her room to indite a letter to captain pullen if she were to be deprived of the society of dukes and princes she would at least secure the company of one person who could make the time pass pleasantly to her as she wrote to him rapidly unadvisedly passionately her head burned and her heart was fluttering she felt as if she had been deceived cheated decoyed to the red house under false pretences and she was in as much of a rage as her indolent nature would permit her to be the revelations of miss wynward had sunk down into her very soul no parties no dinners with princes handing her into the dining room and whispering soft nothings into her ears all the time why had madame gobelli so often promised to console her for the loss of captain pullen by this very means and it was a dream a chimera they only came to the red house on business business horrid unromantic word and were shut up with the baroness what business she wondered could it be about boots and shoes and if so why did they not go to the shop which surely was the proper place from which to procure them the idea that she had been deceived in this particular made her write far more warmly and pleadingly perhaps than she would otherwise have done a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush harriet was not conversant with the proverb but she fully endorsed the sentiment when her letter was written and addressed to the camp at aldershot and she had walked out with bobby to post it in the pillar box she felt happier and less resentful at all events she was her own mistress and could leave the red house when she chose and take up her abode elsewhere a hot sun had dried the garden paths and grass and she spent the rest of the afternoon wandering about the unshaven lawn with bobby and lingering on the rotten wooden benches under the trees with the boys arm round her waist and his head drooping on her shoulder bobby was blissfully happy and she was content if we cannot get caviare it is wise to content ourselves with cods roe they spent hours together that afternoon until the dusk had fallen and the hour of dining had drawn nigh they talked of heyst and the pleasures they had left behind them and harriet was astonished to hear how manly were some of bobbys ideas and sentiments when out of sight of his mamma at last the strident tones of the baronesss voice were heard echoing through the grounds harriet and bobby leaped to their feet in a moment ere arriet bobby where are you youre a nice son and daughter to ide away from me when ive been toiling for your benefit all the day she came towards them as she spoke and when harriet saw how fatigued she looked she almost forgave her for leaving her in the lurch as she had done i suppose you thought we were both dead didnt you she continued well we are almost never ad such a days work in my life found everything wrong of course you cant turn your back for five minutes but these confounded workmen play old arry with your business i sent off ten fellows before id been in the factory ten minutes and fined as many girls and ave been running all over london since to replace em its ard work i can tell you she plumped down upon the rotten seat nearly bringing it to the ground as she spoke and burst out laughing you should ave seen one man you would ave died of laughing get out i said to im not another days work do you do ere get out of the factory where ive worked for twenty years e said well then i shant not for you if the governor ad said so it might be a different thing but a woman as no right to come interfering in business as she knows nothing about thats the way the wind lies i replied and you want a man to turn you out well soon see if a woman cant do it and i took my stick and laid it on his back till he holload again he was out of the place before you could say jack robinson ow will that do i said to the others who else wants a taste of my stick before ell go but they all cleared out before i ad done speaking i laughed till i was ill but come along children its time for dinner as they returned to the house she accosted harriet i ope youve amused yourself to day youll ave to look after yourself whenever im at the factory but a andsome gal like you wont want long for amusement well ave plenty of company ere soon miss wynward she continued as they entered the dining room mr milliken is coming to morrow see that is room is ready for im very good my lady replied miss wynward but harriet fancied she did not like the idea of mr milliken staying with them the dinner proceeded merrily it was more sumptuous than the day before consisting of several courses and the champagne flowed freely harriet sitting at her ease and thoroughly enjoying the repast thought that it atoned for all the previous inconvenience but a strange incident occurred before the meal was over the baron who was carver asked bobby twice if he would take some roast beef and received no answer which immediately aroused the indignation of the baroness do you ear what your father is saying to you bobby she cried shrilly answer im at once or ill send you out of the room will you ave some beef but still there was no reply my lady i think that he is ill said miss wynward in alarm ill rubbish exclaimed the baroness being so coarse fibred and robust a woman herself she never had any sympathy with delicacy or illness and generally declared all invalids to be humbugs shamming in order to attract the more attention she now jumped up from her seat and going round to her sons chair shook him violently by the shoulder ere wake up what are you about she exclaimed if you dont sit up at once and answer your fathers question ill lay my stick about your back she was going to put her argument into effect when harriet prevented her stop stop madame gobelli she exclaimed cant you see he has fainted it was really true bobby had fainted dead away in his chair where he lay white as a sheet with closed eyes and limp body miss wynward flew to her pupils assistance poor dear boy i was sure he was not well directly he entered the house she said not well replied the baroness nonsense what should ail im is father was one of the strongest men on gods earth he never ad a days illness in is life ow should the boy a great ulking fellow like im ave got ill she spoke roughly but there was a tremor in her voice as she uttered the words and she looked at bobby as though she were afraid of him but as he gradually revived under miss wynwards treatment she approached nearer and said with some tenderness in her tones well bobby lad and ow do you feel now better mamma thank you only my head keeps going round had i not better help him up to his bed my lady asked miss wynward o yes but i ope e isnt going to make a fool of imself like this again for i dont old with boys fainting like hysterical gals i couldnt help it mamma said bobby faintly o yes you could if you ad any pluck you never saw me faint nor gustave either its all abit trundle im off to bed miss wynward the sooner es there the better and i may give him a little stimulant suggested miss wynward timidly recalling the scene of the evening before a little champagne or brandy and water i think he requires it my lady o yes coddle im to your earts content only dont let me ear of it i ate a fuss good night bobby mind youre well by to morrow morning and she brushed the lads cheek with her bristly chin good night replied bobby good night to all as he was supported from the room on the arm of miss wynward the baroness did not make any further remarks concerning her son but harriet noticed that her appetite disappeared with him and declaring that she had tired herself too much to eat she sat unoccupied and almost silent for the remainder of the meal chapter xi mr alexander milliken arrived punctually upon the morrow he was a tall gaunt weak kneed man with a prominent nose and eyes that required the constant use of glasses harriet brandt could not at first determine his relationship to the baroness who received him with one of the rough kisses she was wont to bestow on bobby and herself he established himself in the red house as if he had been a member of the family and harriet frequently surprised him engaged in confidential talk with their hostess which was immediately stopped on her arrival she perceived that miss wynward had an evident dislike for the new comer and never addressed him but in the most formal manner and when it was strictly necessary the baroness did not go so often to the manufactory after mr millikens arrival but often shut herself up with him in a room with locked doors after which mr milliken would be much occupied with secretarial work writing letters with his short sighted eyes held close to the paper he was a source of much curiosity to harriet brandt but he need not have been he was only that very common and unclean animal the jackal to madame gobellis lion he was poor and she was rich so he did all the dirty work which she was unable or afraid to do for herself mr milliken called himself an author and an actor but he was neither on account of his accidental likeness to a popular actor he had once been engaged to play the part of his double at a west end theatre but with the waning of the piece mr millikens fame evaporated and he had never obtained an engagement since his assumed authorship was built on the same scale he had occasionally penned anonymous articles for newspapers which had been inserted without pay but no one in the literary or any other world knew him by name or by fame of late he had attached himself to madame gobelli writing her letters for her of doing which she was almost incapable and occasionally dabbling in dirtier work which she was too cunning to do for herself miss wynward could have told tales of abusive epistles which had been sent through his hand to people whom the baroness considered had offended her of anonymous letters also which if traced would have landed them both in the county court but mr milliken was out at elbows he found it very convenient to hang about the red house for weeks together to the saving of his pocket receiving douceurs sometimes in actual coin of the realm at the hands of his benefactress and making himself useful to her in any way in return lately notwithstanding her grand promises to harriet brandt of introductions to lords and princes the baroness had thought it would be a very good thing for her favourite jackal if the young heiress took a fancy for him and gave him full leave in consequence to go in and conquer if he could she would praise his appearance and his qualities to the girl before his very face calling attention to the fact of what a clever creature he was and what a fine figure he possessed and how well he was connected and advising her in her coarse fashion to cultivate his acquaintance better she even descended to having visions in the broad daylight and prophesying the future for them both arriet she would suddenly exclaim i see a man standing beind you o gracious the girl would reply jumping in her seat i wish you would not say such things madame rubbish why shouldnt i say em if theyre there stop a bit let me see im plainly es got dark air slightly sprinkled with grey a fine nose deep set eyes with bushy eyebrows no air on is face a tall figure and long ands and feet es living in this world too do you know anybody that answers to the description no replied the girl though she recognised it at once as being meant for mr milliken well if you dont know im now you will before long but its my belief youve met and mark my words you and e will be closely connected in life i shouldnt wonder if e turns out to be your future usband o nonsense exclaimed harriet trying to speak lightly im not going to marry anybody thank you madame gobelli unless its one of the princes you promised to introduce me to o princes are all rubbish replied the baroness forgetting her former assertions theyve none of them got any money and yours wouldnt go far enough for em they want a gal with something like five thousand a year at er back id rather ave an englishman any day than a dirty little german prince but harriet brandt was not the sort of woman to be forced into an intimacy against her will born under an hereditary curse as she undoubtedly had been and gifted with the fatal propensity of injuring rather than benefiting those whom she took a fancy for she was an epicure in her taste for her fellow creatures and would not have permitted mr alexander milliken to take a liberty with her had he been the last man left upon the earth she avoided his society as much as it was possible to do without being rude to her hostess but as the baroness was continually calling her to her side it was difficult to do so meanwhile the days went on very differently from what she had anticipated when coming to the red house bobby was languid and indifferent to everything but hanging about the place where she might have located herself sitting on the sofa beside her with his heavy head on her shoulder and his weak arm wound about her waist miss wynward feared he must have contracted some species of malaria at the seaside and harriet could see for herself that the lad was much altered from the time when they first met the baroness alone either from ignorance or obstinacy declaring that nothing ailed him but laziness and she would give him the stick if he didnt exert himself more sometimes harriet took him out with her for a drive into the country or to a concert or matine in london but what was that compared to the entertainment of royalty and aristocracy which she had been promised and she had not heard a word from captain pullen though her first letter of appeal had been succeeded by two or three more such a rebuff would have driven another girl to despondency or tears but that was not the effect it had on harriet brandt if you throw a bone to a tigress and then try to take it away she does not weep she fights for her prey harriet brandt deprived of the flatteries and attentions of captain pullen did not weep either but set her pretty teeth together and determined in her own mind that if she were to give him up she would know the reason why she was reckless she did not care what she did to obtain it but she would learn the truth of his defalcation if she travelled down to aldershot for the purpose she was in this mood one day when the maidservant who answered the door came to tell her that a lady was in the drawing room and desired to see her the baroness had gone out that afternoon and taken mr milliken with her so that harriet was alone she eagerly demanded the name of her visitor the lady didnt give me her name replied the servant but she asked if miss brandt was at home plain enough go back and say that i will be with her in a minute said harriet she had decided in her own mind that the stranger must be margaret pullen bringing her doubtless some news of her brother in law she only stayed to smoothe her hair which was rather disordered from bobby laying his head on her shoulder before with a heightened colour she entered the drawing room what was her surprise to encounter instead of mrs pullen miss leyton miss leyton who had been so reserved and proud with her at heyst and who even though she had sought her out at the red house looked as reserved and proud as before harriet advanced with an extended hand but elinor leyton did not appear to see the action as she coldly bowed and sank into her chair again harriet was rather taken aback but managed to stammer out i am very glad to see you miss leyton i thought you and mrs pullen had forgotten all about me since leaving heyst we had not forgotten miss brandt replied elinor but we had a great deal of trouble to encounter in the death of mrs pullens baby and that put everything else for a while out of our minds but but lately we have had reason to remember your existence more forcibly than before she spoke slowly and with an evident effort she was as agitated as it was in her nature to be the while but she did not show it outwardly elinor leyton had at all times the most perfect command over herself she was dressed on the present occasion with the utmost neatness and propriety though she had left her home labouring under a discovery which had pierced her to the very soul she was a woman who would have died upon the scaffold without evincing the least fear reason to remember my existence echoed harriet i do not understand you i think you soon will said elinor as she took three letters from her hand bag and laid them on the table i do not think you can fail to recognise that handwriting miss brandt harriet stooped down and read the address upon the envelopes they were her own letters to captain pullen how did you get these she demanded angrily as she seized them in her hand is thieving one of your proclivities miss leyton no miss brandt thieving as you elegantly put it is not one of my proclivities but captain pullen has been staying in the house of my father lord walthamstowe at richmond and left those letters behind him thrown in the empty grate just as they are a proof of how much he valued them one of the housemaids whilst setting his room in order after his departure found them and brought them to me so i determined that i would return them to your hands myself and have you read them demanded harriet i have read them i considered it my duty your duty replied the other scornfully what duty is there in a mean dishonourable action like that what right had you to interfere with things that dont belong to you these letters concern myself and captain pullen alone i deny that miss brandt they concern me quite as much if not more captain pullen is my affianced husband we are to be married in the spring i dont believe it cried harriet starting to her feet a woman who would read letters not addressed to her would say anything you are not engaged to be married to captain pullen indeed and on what grounds do you refuse to believe my statement because he made love to me all the time he was in heyst because he used to kiss me and tell me again and again that i was the only woman who had ever touched his heart because he had arranged to follow the baronesss party to brussels only to be near me and he would have done so had you not prevented him her great eyes were blazing with indignation and mortified vanity her slender hands were clenched she looked as if she were about to spring upon her rival and tear her to pieces whilst miss leyton sat there calm and collected and smiled at her ravings you are quite mistaken she said after a pause i have never mentioned your name to captain pullen i had no idea until those letters fell into my hands that he had so far forgotten what he owes to me as to address you in any terms but those of mere acquaintanceship but now that i do know it must of course be put a stop to at once and for ever it was to tell you so that i came here this afternoon put a stop to do you imagine that i am going to give up captain pullen at your request you are vastly mistaken but you must you shall exclaimed elinor getting for her quite excited he is engaged to marry me and i will not allow him to keep up any communication with you my decision is final and you will be good enough to respect it your decision is final cried harriet in mocking tones oh indeed is it and what about ralphs decision does that count for nothing what if ralph refuses to give me up elinor rose to her feet trembling with indignation at the others boldness you shall not call him ralph she exclaimed how dare you speak of a man who is nothing to you in such familiar terms but is he nothing to me retorted harriet and am i nothing to him we must have that question answered first ralph told me to call him by his name and he calls me hally how can you prevent our doing so he loves me he has told me so and i shall write to him as often as i choose yes and i will take him from you if i choose and keep him into the bargain what do you say to that i say that you are a bold brazen girl not fit for me to associate with and that i refuse to be contaminated by your presence any longer let me go she made an effort to gain the door as she spoke but harriet barred her exit no no miss leyton she said you dont come here to insult me and then leave before you have heard all i have to say to you in the first place your assurance to day is the first i ever heard of your being engaged to marry captain pullen he didnt take the trouble to make it public he never mentioned you except to say what a cold reserved unpleasant nature you had and how impossible it would be for a man with any human feeling to get on with you that is what he thought and he said it too when he had his arm round my waist and his face close to mine and now he has come to england i suppose he is afraid to carry on with me any more for fear that you should hear of it but i dont mean to let him off so easily i can tell you he shall answer those letters which you say he threw away in the grate but which you are just as likely to have pilfered from his desk before he is many days older you cannot make him answer them said elinor proudly whatever you may affirm not on paper perhaps but by word of mouth i will take them back to him at aldershot and see whether he can deny what i have told when he is face to face with me surely surely you would never proceed to so unmaidenly an extremity exclaimed elinor losing sight for a moment of her indignation in her horror at the idea you must not think of such a thing you would create a scandal in the camp you would be despised for it ever after i can take care of myself replied harriet boldly you need not fear for me and if even you do get your own way about this matter you will have the satisfaction all your married life of knowing that your husband was a coward and a traitor to you even during your engagement and that you will never be able to trust him further than you can see him to the end if you can care for such a husband take him for im sure i wouldnt but he shall answer to me for all that oh miss brandt let me go pray let me go said elinor in a tone of such unmistakeable pain that the other involuntarily drew back and let her push her way past her to the door as miss leyton disappeared harriet brandt commenced to pace up and down the length of the drawing room it was not the swaying walk of disappointment and despair it was determined and masterful born of anger and a longing for revenge all the creole in her came to the surface like her cruel mother she would have given over ralph pullen to the vivisecting laboratory if she could her dark eyes rolled in her passion her slight hands were clenched upon each other and her crimson lips quivered with the inability to express all she felt bobby glancing in upon her from the french windows which opened on the garden crept to her side and tried to capture her clenched hands and to keep her restless body still but she threw him off almost brutally at that moment she was brutal leave me alone she exclaimed impatiently dont touch me go away o hally the boy replied sympathetically what is the matter has anyone offended you let me know let me try to comfort you or tell me what i shall do to help you do cried the girl contemptuously what could you do a baby tied to your mothers apron string leave me to myself i say i dont want you or anyone i want to be alone boys are of no use it requires a man to revenge a womans wrong the lad after one long look of bitter disappointment walked quietly away from the spot and hid his grief in some sequestered part of the garden hally despised him she who had kissed him and let him lay his head upon her shoulder and tell her all his little troubles said he was of no use when she stood in need of help and comfort when if she only knew it he was ready to stand up in her defence against twenty men if need be and felt strong enough to defeat them all but she had called him a baby tied to his mothers apron strings the iron entered into his very soul meanwhile elinor leyton having blindly found her way out of the red house hailed a passing hansom and gave the driver directions to take her to a certain number in harley street where margaret pullen was staying with her godfather doctor phillips she knew no one else to whom she could go in this great trouble which made her feel as if her life had suddenly been cut in two yet she made no outward moan most young women having kept a bold front as she had done towards the enemy would have broken down as soon as they found themselves alone but elinor leyton was not in the habit of breaking down as soon as she had started for her destination she leaned her head upon the back of the cab closed her eyes and set her teeth fast together her face grew deadly pale and an observer would have noted the trembling of her lips and the ball which rose and fell in her throat but she uttered no sound not even a sigh her misery was too deep for words since she had returned to london margaret pullen had stayed with doctor phillips for he had insisted that it should be so the telegram which had conveyed to colonel pullen the news of his little daughters death had been answered by one to say that he had applied for immediate leave and should join his wife as soon as he received it and margaret was now expecting his arrival every day almost every hour she looked very sad in her deep mourning dress as she came forward to greet elinor but as soon as she caught sight of her visitors face she forgot her own trouble in her womanly sympathy for her friend my dear elinor she exclaimed what has brought you to town you have bad news for me i can read it in your eyes nothing wrong with ralph i hope she kissed the girl affectionately and held her hand but elinor did not answer she turned her white face towards her friend and bit her lips hard but the words would not come you are suffering my poor dear went on margaret tenderly as she made her sit down and removed her hat and cloak cant you trust me with your trouble havent i had enough of my own ah cry thats better god sends us tears in order that our hearts may not break and now what is it is anyone ill at home elinor shook her head the tears were rolling slowly one by one down her marble cheeks but she jerked them away as they came as though it were a shame to weep after a long pause she swallowed something in her throat and commenced in a husky voice it concerns ralph margaret he has been untrue to me all is over between us oh surely not said margaret have you had a full explanation with him who told you he had been untrue has ralph asked for a release from his engagement no but he shall have it she then went on to tell the story of the finding of harriet brandts letters in captain pullens grate and of the interview she had had with the girl that afternoon she did not attempt to deny it continued elinor on the contrary she declared that he had made love to her all the time he was at heyst that he had said she was the only woman who had ever touched his heart and that no man with human feelings could be happy with such a cold reserved nature as mine and if you could see her letters to him margaret i wish i had not given them to her but she snatched them from my hand they were too dreadful i never read such letters from a woman to a man i did not know they could be written but elinor it strikes me that all this time you have only heard one side of the question what does it signify what miss brandt may say the only thing of importance to you is what ralph will say but there were her letters they told their own story they were full of nothing but dearests and darlings and reminders of how he had embraced her in one place and what he had said to her in another such letters as i could not write to a man if it were to save my life i can quite understand that miss brandt and you possess two totally different natures and cannot you understand that a girl like that half educated wholly ignorant of the usages of society with a passionate undeveloped nature and a bold spirit might write as you have described her doing against the wishes of the recipient of her letters you say that ralph threw her epistles in the grate just as they were does that look as if he valued them or felt himself to be guilty concerning their reception but margaret you know he did make himself conspicuous with the gobellis and miss brandt at heyst i think everyone noticed their intimacy i noticed it also and i was very sorry for it but elinor my dear it was partly your own fault you were so much opposed to the idea of your engagement to ralph being made public that i feared it might lead to some contretemps and then she continued gently dont be offended if i say that your reserve with him and your objection to anything like love making on his part is in itself calculated to drive a young man to society he cares less for but but still i love him said poor elinor with a tremendous effort i know you do replied margaret kissing her again and better and more faithfully perhaps than half the women who show their love so openly yet men are but men elinor and as a rule they do not believe in the affection which is never expressed by caresses and fond words well whether i have been right or wrong it is over now said miss leyton and ralph can go to miss brandt or anyone else he chooses for amusement i shall never stand in his way but i cannot brook an affront so i shall write and release him from his promise to me at once no no elinor you must not do anything so rash i beg i implore you to do nothing until ralph has had an opportunity of denying the charges brought against him by this girl they may be utterly untrue she may be simply persecuting him depend upon it you have only to ask him for an explanation of those letters and everything will be satisfactorily cleared up you have more belief in him than i have margaret miss brandt has great confidence in her cause she told me that she had not only taken him from me but she meant to keep him and expressed her intention of going down to aldershot and confronting ralph with the letters she had written him at this intelligence margaret grew alarmed for her friends peace of mind no no that must never be she exclaimed that girl must not be permitted to make a scandal in the camp and get your name perhaps mixed up with it it must be prevented i fancy you will find that a difficult task said elinor she seems the most determined young woman i have ever come across she became so vehement at last that she frightened me and i was only too glad to get out of the house elinor said mrs pullen suddenly will you leave this matter in my hands to settle in my own way what do you intend to do see miss brandt yourself i advise you not she will only insult you as she did me no i shall not see her myself i promise you that but i will send a proper ambassador to interview miss brandt and the baroness this sort of thing must not be allowed to go on and unless ralph comes forward to second the girls assertions which i am sure he will never do she and her friend madame gobelli must be made to understand that if they dont behave themselves the law will be called into requisition to enforce obedience i should not be at all surprised if the baroness were not at the bottom of all this at anyrate it has ruined my life said elinor mournfully nonsense my dear girl no such thing it is only an unpleasant episode which will soon be forgotten but let it make you a little more careful for the future elinor ralph is a very conceited man he has been spoilt by the women all his life pour lamour de ses beaux yeux he has been used to flattery and attention and when he doesnt get it he misses it and goes where it is to be found it is rather a contemptible weakness but he shares it in common with most of his sex and you have promised remember to take him for better or worse not yet thank goodness retorted elinor with something of her usual spirit he and father got talking together about the marriage the other day when he was down at richmond and fixed it i believe for the spring but they will have to unfix it again now if i am not mistaken no such thing replied margaret and now you have consented have you not to leave the settlement of this other affair in my hands if you wish it margaret but remember no compromise if ralph has really promised this girl what she says let him keep his promises for i will have none of him and now i must go home or they will wonder what has become of me margaret was not sorry to see her depart for she was most anxious to summon anthony pennell her husbands cousin to her aid and ask his advice as to what was best to be done in the circumstances she had great faith in anthony pennell not only in his genius which was an accepted thing but in his good sense which is not usually found associated with the higher quality he was a man of about thirty with a grand intellect a sound understanding a liberal mind and a sympathetic disposition he had been originally intended for the bar but having taken silk and made a most promising debut he had suddenly blossomed into an author and his first novel had taken london by storm he had accomplished the rare feat of being lifted up at once on the waves of public opinion and carried over the heads of all his fellows since his first success he had continued writing had given up the law in consequence and was now making a large and steady income but anthony pennells great charm lay in his unassuming manner and modest judgment of his own work his triumphs were much more astonishing to him than to his friends in person he was less handsome than his cousin ralph pullen but much more manly looking having been a distinguished athlete in his college days and still finding his best recreation on the cricket field and the golf ground he was very fair with a white skin embrowned here and there by sun and outdoor exercise short curly hair a fine figure standing six foot high and the bluest of blue eyes he was smoking in his own chambers late that afternoon when he received a telegram from margaret pullen can you come over this evening and as soon as he had changed his lounging coat he obeyed her summons chapter xii anthony pennell was a very fresh pleasant and good looking presentment of a young english gentleman as he entered the room where margaret was sitting with doctor phillips that evening it had been arranged between them beforehand that as little as need be should be confided to him of harriet brandts former history all that was necessary for him to know was the danger that threatened to blast the future happiness of ralph pullen and elinor leyton well mrs pullen he said as he shook hands cordially with margaret and the doctor and what important business is it that you want to consult me upon i thought at the very least that i should meet my cousin arthur here if i had had arthur perhaps i should not have needed you replied margaret with a faint smile but really mr pennell i am in want of advice sorely and the doctor agreed with me that you would be the best person to whom i could apply i am at your service madam said the young man gaily as he seated himself then she told him the story of harriet brandt how ralph had met her at the lion dor and devoted his time to her and how she was persecuting him with letters and had threatened to follow him to the camp and interview him there and it must be put a stop to you know mr pennell she concluded not only for ralphs sake and elinors but for the sake of the walthamstowes and my husband i am sure that arthur would be exceedingly annoyed at any scandal of that sort and especially as lord walthamstowe is so old a friend of his family anthony pennell had looked very grave during her recital after a pause he said are you sure that ralph has not given this young lady good cause to run after him i think not i hope not there was very little amusement in heyst and this girl and the people with whom she is now staying a baron and baroness gobelli they call themselves were amongst the visitors to the lion dor miss leyton is rather a stickler for the proprieties and used to refuse to walk out with ralph alone in the evenings and i was too much occupied with my poor darling baby to accompany them said margaret in a faltering voice so ralph took to going to the baronesss private rooms instead and became intimate with miss brandt you acknowledge then that he was intimate with her i think he must have been because it appears that he had agreed to join their party at brussels when when my great trouble obliged him to return to england with us instead did you know this young lady mrs pullen i did and at one time i was rather intimate with her that is before the baroness took her up when she passed almost all her time with them she is i suppose very attractive in person o dear no not at all cried margaret with a womans dull appreciation of the charms of one of her own sex she has fine eyes and what men would i suppose call a good figure but no complexion and an enormous mouth not at all pretty but nice looking at times that is all clever said pennell interrogatively i do not think so she had just come out of a convent school and was utterly unused to society but she has a very good voice and plays well on the mandoline ladies are not always the best judges of their own sex remarked anthony turning to doctor phillips what do you say doctor had you an opportunity of appraising miss brandts beauties and accomplishments for yourself i would rather say nothing mr pennell replied the doctor the fact is i knew her parents in the west indies and could never believe in anything good coming from such a stock whatever the girl may be she inherits terrible proclivities added to black blood she is in point of fact a quadroon and not fit to marry into any decent english family o dear exclaimed mr pennell laconically and how do you expect me to help you he enquired after a pause i want you to see the baroness or miss brandt and tell them that this girl must cease all communication with captain pullen said margaret tell them that he is engaged to marry miss leyton that the marriage is fixed to take place next spring and that the walthamstowe family will be excessively annoyed if any scandal of this sort occurs to break it off do they not know that such an engagement exists no that is the unfortunate part of it elinor leyton is so absurdly scrupulous that she will not have the fact made public and forbade me to tell miss brandt about it elinor went to the red house where miss brandt is staying this morning and had a most stormy interview with her she came here afterwards in a most distressed state of mind harriet brandt had told her that she had secured ralph pullen and meant to keep him that he had told her he loved her and that miss leyton was too cold and prudish a nature for any man to be happy with of course elinor was terribly upset she seldom shows her feelings but it was quite impossible for her to disguise them to day i begged her to leave the matter in my hands and she consented to do so that is why i telegraphed for you it is rather an awkward predicament said anthony pennell thoughtfully you will forgive me for saying mrs pullen that ralph is so very likely to have done this sort of thing that i feel one might be treading on very delicate ground in fact putting ones foot in it by interfering you know what ralph is selfish and indolent and full of vanity he considers it far too much trouble to make love as it is called to a woman but he will accept any amount of love that is offered him so long as it gives him no trouble if this miss brandt is all that you and the doctor here say of her she may possibly have drawn ralph on and taken his languid satisfaction as proof that he agreed to all she said and did but it will make the dnouement just as unpleasant besides how will ralph himself take my interference in the matter he may have some designs on this girl some ideas in the future connected with her and will ask what business i had to come between them o no did i not tell you that he had left her letters in his grate that might be part of his indolent carelessness or they may have been left there by design as a means of breaking the ice between himself and miss leyton is not he after all the most proper person to appeal to why not wait till your husband returns and let him speak to his brother i am so afraid in that case that ralph might consider that he had gone too far with miss brandt and honour demanded that he should marry her and mr pennell doctor phillips could tell you things if he chose to prove to you that harriet brandt is not a fit wife for any decent man anthony pennell thought again for a few minutes sitting silent with his hand caressing his smooth chin then he said if you are very much bent on my doing what i can in this matter i see only one way to accomplish it i must enter the red house under a flag of truce did you know this baroness gobelli can you tell me what sort of woman she is i never heard the name before she is quite a character replied margaret i believe her husband is a german baron but she was a mrs bates and is an extraordinary baroness a strange mixture also of vulgarity and refined tastes she drops all her aspirates yet talks familiarly of aristocratic and royal titles she dresses like a cook out on sundays and yet has a passion for good paintings and old china at the last words anthony pennell pricked up his ears a passion for old china he exclaimed then there must be some good in her cannot you give me an introduction to the red house on the plea that i am a connoisseur and am desirous of seeing her collection of course i can but how can you approach these people in amity with a censure of miss brandts conduct in your hand madame gobelli is infatuated with harriet brandt i was telling poor elinor only this afternoon that i should not be at all surprised if she were at the bottom of all this unpleasantness she could not be at the bottom of anything unless ralph had given her cause replied mr pennell who had never had a good opinion of his cousins straightforward dealing and however it may turn out i should think he would have a heavy reckoning to settle with miss leyton this is not the first time remember you have not forgotten the trouble arthur had to get him out of that scrape with the laundresss girl at aldershot the year before last yes arthur told me about it replied margaret but you are going to help us this time mr pennell are you not in so far as procuring an introduction to the baroness and taking my opportunity to let her know the true state of affairs with miss leyton yes said mr pennell but there my responsibility must cease should ralph have committed himself in writing or anything of that sort you must promise to let them fight it out their own way i daresay there will be no trouble about the matter i can see how it has occurred at a glance ralph has been merely amusing himself with the girl and she has taken his philandering in earnest but i wish he would leave that sort of thing off it will ruin his married life if he does not yes indeed and elinor leyton really loves him more i am sure than he imagines she declared this afternoon that if it were not put a complete stop to she should break off her engagement and i think she would be right so do i acquiesced anthony pennell well if these people are ordinarily decent they will as soon as they hear the truth prevent their young friend interfering with another womans rights write me the introduction mrs pullen and i will pay the red house a visit as soon as its owner gives me leave and now let us talk of something pleasanter how soon do you expect arthur to arrive any day replied margaret and i am longing so for him to come of course you are will he remain long in england only a few weeks he has taken three months leave then i shall return with him to hosur and you like the idea of india o anything anything to find myself with him again she answered feverishly the conversation turned upon more indifferent subjects and armed with the note of introduction to the baroness anthony pennell presently took his leave he did not like the task imposed upon him and he hardly knew how he should set about it but on consideration he thought he could do no harm by having a look at the young lady who had taken the fancy of his fickle minded cousin ralph and leaving his future action to be decided by the interview he sat down therefore before turning into bed and wrote a note to the baroness enclosing the introduction from mrs pullen and asking permission to call and inspect her rare collection of china of which he had heard so much his letter reached the red house on the following morning at an unfortunate moment when madame gobelli was giving full display to the worst side of her eccentric character the baroness was not a lover of animals either dogs or horses she was merciless to the latter and the former she kicked whenever they came in her way it was considered necessary however for the safety of the red house that it should be guarded by a watch dog and a miserable retriever which answered to that name lived in a rotten cask in the stable yard this unhappy animal which had neither sufficient food exercise nor straw to lie on was in the habit of keeping up a continuous baying at night in remonstrance at the cruelty of its treatment which was a cause of annoyance to the neighbours who had often written to the baroness about it in vain on the morning in question a captain hill who lived on one side of the red house with his parents sent in his card to madame gobelli and asked for an interview she admitted him at once she liked men of all sorts and particularly if they were young and she could kiss them with impunity under the pretence that she was old enough to be their mother she therefore welcomed captain hill quite amiably she came in from the garden to receive him attired in a genoa velvet dress that trailed half a yard on the damp ground behind and a coarse zulu hat perched on her large bullet head she was attended by harriet brandt who had been making a tour of the premises with her and was always eager to see anybody who might call at the red house miss wynward also who was dusting the china with a feather brush as the visitor was announced continued her occupation and without apologising for doing so or asking leave harriet had not yet been able to determine the exact place which this lady held in the baronesss household for she was treated as one of the family and yet degraded at times to the position of a servant the baroness expected her to cook or dust rooms or darn stockings or do anything required of her whilst she introduced her to all her friends as if on a perfect equality with themselves as she entered the drawing room through one of the french windows she shook hands familiarly with captain hill and introduced him to both her companions well she went on and so youve come to see us at last i thought you were going to live and die in that tumble down old place of yours without so much as a shake of the and i ope youre all well at ome the stranger did not seem to know how to receive these civilities he had not seated himself but stood in the centre of the room with his hat in his hand as though he found a difficulty in stating his errand at the red house take a chair said madame gobelli in her rough way theres enough and to spare and my young friend ere wont eat you still captain hill deliberated about accepting her offer thank you he commenced but i shall not detain you above a few moments i came to speak to you about your dog madame gobelli my parents are both very old and my mother especially delicate indeed i fear that she may never rise from her bed again here his voice faltered a little but quickly recovering himself he went on she sleeps very little and that little has now become impossible to her on account of the incessant barking of your yard dog i am here to day by the wish of my mothers medical attendant doctor parker to tell you that the noise is seriously affecting her health and to beg that you will adopt some measures to have the annoyance stopped as the baroness understood the reason for which her neighbour had called upon her her countenance palpably changed the broad smile faded from her face and was replaced by an ominous frown if there was one thing which she resented above another it was being called to task for any disturbance in her household without taking any notice apparently of captain hills complaint she turned to miss wynward and said miss wynward come ere does that dog bark at night sometimes my lady replied the governess dubiously i dont believe it youre lying arriet does nelson ever bark so as to disturb anyone he barks whenever there is a ring at the bell or a stranger enters the grounds madame said harriet with politic evasion oh i assure you he does more than that interposed the visitor the poor animal howls without ceasing either he is ill or the servants do not give him sufficient food but at this censure cast upon her domestics whom she bullied from morning till night the baronesss uncontrolled temper burst forth ow dare you come ere she exclaimed loudly and bring false accusations against my servants no one in this ouse is kept short of food what do you mean a rubbishing fellow like you by coming ere and accusing the baron of starving is animals theres more money spent upon our animals i bet than goes in your poverty stricken ouse old in a year captain hill was now offended as he well might be i do not know what knowledge you may possess of the exigencies of my parents household madam he replied but what i came here to tell you is this that from whatever cause it may arise the howling and whining of your dog is a public nuisance and it must be stopped must must exclaimed madame gobelli shaking her stick at him and pray oos to make me stop it i will said captain hill the noise is endangering the life of my mother and i shall insist upon the animal being destroyed or taken elsewhere if you cannot take a friendly hint if you have so callous a nature that the sufferings of an aged and invalid lady cannot excite your sympathy the law shall teach you that whatever you may fail to feel you cannot annoy your neighbours with impunity fine neighbours indeed cried the baroness her whole face trembling and contorted with passion a beggarly lot of half pay officers and retired parsons ill soon see if youll be allowed to come riding the igh orse over me confound your impudence do you know oo i am a billingsgate fishwoman i should imagine from your language certainly not a gentlewoman said captain hill his eyes blazing with his wrath ang you ill soon teach you ow to insult a lady thats connected with royalty at that the stranger burst into a derisive laugh down the back stairs he muttered to himself but madame gobelli caught the words get out of my ouse she cried ere miss wynward see this fellow out at the front door and never you let im in again or ill give you a months warning down the back stairs indeed confound you if you dont clear out this very minute ill lay my stick across your back youll make me destroy my dog will you and just because your trumpery mother dont like is barking go ome and tell er to old er own row and you accuse my servants of not giving im enough to eat youd be glad enough to see is dinner on your own table once or twice a week out with you i say out with you at once and dont let me see your ugly mug and your carroty ead in ere again or ill set the dog you dont like upon you captain hill had turned white as a sheet with anger youll hear more of this madam and from my solicitor next time he said heartless unfeeling woman how can you call yourself a mother when you have no pity for a sons grief at his mothers illness pray god you may not have occasion to remember this morning when you have to part from your own son he rushed from the room as he spoke and they heard the hall door slam after him for a minute after he left there was a dead pause between the three women his last words seemed to have struck the baroness as with a two edged sword she stood silent staring into vacancy and breathing hard whilst harriet brandt and miss wynward regarded each other with furtive dismay the silence was broken by madame gobelli bursting into a harsh laugh i dont fancy e will show is face in my ouse again in an urry she exclaimed it was as good as a play to watch im trying to brave it out confound is old mother why dont she die and ave done with it ive no patience with old people anging on in that way and worrying the ole world with their fads well what is it she continued to a maid who brought her a letter by the post my lady the baroness broke the seal there was such a look of scare upon her features that some people might have thought she was glad to have anything to do that should hide it from her companions the letter was from anthony pennell whose name was familiar to her as to all the world as she finished its perusal her manner entirely altered the broad smile broke out on her countenance her eyes sparkled one would have thought she could never be in anything but a beaming good temper olloa arriet she exclaimed eres news for you oo do you think this letters from how can i guess replied the girl though her thoughts had flown at once to ralph pullen from mr anthony pennell the great author you know and own cousin to that rapscallion captain pullen now we shall ear all about the andsome captain mr pennell says e wants to come ere and see my china but i know better es bringing you a message from is cousin mark my words i can see it written up beind you harriets delicate face flushed with pleasure at the news but why shouldnt captain pullen have come himself she asked anxiously i cant tell you that perhaps e is coming beind the other and this is only a feeler theres wheels within wheels in these big families sometimes you know and the pullens are connected with a lot of big wigs but well ave some news anyway you just sit down my dear and write mr pennell a pretty note in my name you write a prettier and than i do and say we shall be very pleased to see im to morrow afternoon if convenient and i ope e will stay to dinner afterwards and be introduced to the baron will you o yes of course madame if you wish it replied the girl smiles dimpling her face at the thought of her triumph over elinor leyton now miss wynward we must ave a first rate dinner to morrow for mr pennell and you and bobby ad better dine at one oclock or youll spoil the table let me see well ave but turning to enforce her orders the baroness discovered that miss wynward had quitted the room why where as the woman gone did you see er leave the room arriet i did not i was too much occupied listening to you replied the girl from the table where she was inditing the answer to anthony pennells note ere miss wynward miss wynward screamed the baroness from the open door but no reply came to her call i must go and see after er she said as she stumped from the room as intent upon procuring a good dinner for one young man as she had been in insulting the other and turning him from her doors meanwhile captain hill hot and angry was striding away in the direction of his own home when he heard a soft voice calling his name in the rear he turned to encounter the spare humiliated form of miss wynward captain hill she ejaculated i beg your pardon but may i speak to you for a moment recognising her as having been in the room when the baroness had so grossly insulted him he waited rather coldly for her to come up with him dont think me impertinent or interfering faltered miss wynward but i was so shocked so distressed i could not let you go without saying how grieved and sorry i am i do not quite understand you replied captain hill o yes surely did you not see me in the room just now i felt as if i should die of shame but if you knew what it is to be dependent to be unable to speak or to expostulate you would guess perhaps yes yes i think i can understand but pray dont distress yourself about it it was my own fault i should have addressed her first through my solicitor but i thought she was a gentlewoman it is her temper that gets the better of her said miss wynward in an apologetic tone she is not always so bad as she was this morning that is fortunate for the world at large replied captain hill gravely i could have forgiven her vulgarity but not her heartlessness i can only think that she is a most terrible woman that is what everybody says answered his companion but she will admit of no remonstrance she will have her own way and the baron is as powerless to refrain her as you or i but that she should so insult a gentleman like yourself even descending to oaths and personalities o i cannot tell you how much i felt it how ashamed i was and how anxious that you should not confound me with anything the baroness said or did indeed said captain hill holding out his hand you need have no fear on that score i hope i know a gentlewoman when i see her but tell me since your eyes are open to all this how is it that a lady like yourself can stay under the roof of so terrible a person there are plenty of other situations to be had why do you not leave her and go elsewhere he was struck by the look of mingled anxiety and fear with which she regarded him o captain hill there are reasons that are difficult to explain that i could not tell to anyone on so short an acquaintance but the baroness possesses great power she could ruin me i believe she could kill if she chose she threatens you then yes came from miss wynwards lips but in almost a whisper well this is hardly the time and place to discuss such a question said captain hill but i should much like to see more of you miss wynward if you have any time at your disposal will you come over and see my old mother she is quite confined to her room but i know it would please her to have a quiet talk with you a light glistened in miss wynwards washed out eyes and a smile stole over her countenance do you really mean it captain hill i never say anything that i do not mean he answered i am sure both my parents would be glad to give you their advice and my dear father who is a clergyman though past an active ministry may be able to be of use to you in a more practical way at anyrate you will come and see us that is a bargain and he held out his hand to her again in farewell o i will i will indeed exclaimed miss wynward gratefully and thank you so very much for the permission you have put a little hope into my life she seized the hand he proffered her and kissed it as an inferior might have done and then hurried back to the red house before he had had time to remonstrate with her on the proceeding chapter xiii when anthony pennell received the baronesss invitation penned in the delicate foreign handwriting of harriet brandt he accepted it at once being out of the season he had no engagement for that evening but he would have broken twenty engagements sooner than miss the chance so unexpectedly offered him of meeting in an intimate family circle the girl who appeared to have led his cousin ralphs fancy astray he pictured her to himself as a whitey brown young woman with thick lips and rolling eyes and how ralph who was so daintily particular where the beau sexe was concerned could have been attracted by such a specimen puzzled anthony altogether the knowledge that she had money struck him unpleasantly for he could think of no other motive for captain pullen having philandered with her as he evidently had done at anyrate the idea that there was the least chance of allying herself with their family must be put out of her head at once and for ever mr pennell amused himself with thinking of the scare he should create at the dinner table by springing the news of ralphs intended marriage upon them all at once would the young lady have hysterics he wondered or faint away or burst into a passion of tears he laughed inwardly at the probability he felt very cruel over it he had no pity for the poor quadroon as doctor phillips had called her it was better that she should suffer than that elinor leyton should have to break off her engagement and by margaret pullens account miss brandt had been both defiant and insulting to miss leyton she must be a brazen unfeeling sort of girl it was meet that she paid the penalty of her foolhardiness it was in such a mood that anthony pennell arrived at the red house at five oclock in the afternoon that he might have the opportunity to inspect the collection of china that had gained him an entrance there the baroness had promised to be home in time to receive him but he was punctual and she was not harriet brandt was loitering about the garden which was still pleasant enough on fine days in the middle of september when the news that mr pennell was in the drawing room was brought to her by miss wynward harriet had been very eager to meet anthony pennell not because she was pining after his cousin but because her feminine curiosity was strong to discover why ralph had deserted her and if he had been subjected to undue influence to force him to do so but now that the time had come she felt shy and nervous suppose he mr pennell had seen miss leyton meanwhile and heard all that had taken place between them when she visited the red house and suppose he should take miss leytons part harriets mind was full of supposes as she turned to miss wynward and said o i cant go and receive him miss wynward mr pennell has come to see the baroness not me cannot you entertain him until she comes home she will not be long now her ladyships last words to me miss brandt were that if she had not returned from the factory by the time mr pennell arrived you were to receive him and give him afternoon tea in her stead i hope you will do as her ladyship desired well i suppose i must then replied harriet screwing up her mouth with a gesture of dissatisfaction but do send in the tea quickly please it shall be up miss brandt as soon as i can get back to make it mr pennell seems a very pleasant gentleman i wouldnt mind if i were you miss wynward hurried back to the house as she spoke and harriet walked slowly over the lawn towards the drawing room windows anthony pennell who had been bending over some rare specimens of old chelsea looked up suddenly as she approached and was struck dumb with admiration she had improved wonderfully in looks since she had been in europe though the women who lived with her continually were slow to perceive it her delicate complexion had acquired a colour like that of a blush rose which was heightened by contrast with her dark glowing eyes whilst her hair by exposure to the rays of the sun had caught some of its fire and showed ruddily here and there in streaks of auburn her figure without having lost its lissom grace was somewhat fuller and her manner was altogether more intelligent and less gauche than it had been but the dark eyes were still looking for their prey and the restless lips were incessantly twitching and moving one over the other she was beautifully dressed that evening she had not been in london for a month without finding a way to spend her money and anthony pennell like most artistic natures was very open to the influence of dress upon a woman harriet wore a frock of the palest lemon colour cut quite plain but perfect in every line and pleat and fold and finished off at the throat with some rare lace caught up here and there with tiny diamond pins by jove what a beautiful girl was mr pennells inward ejaculation as he saw her drawing nearer the spot where he stood it was strange that his first judgment of harriet brandt should have been the same as that of his cousin ralph pullen but it only proves from what a different standpoint men and women judge of beauty as harriet walked over the grass anthony pennell noted each line of her swaying figure each tint of her refined face with the pretty little hands hanging by her side and the slumbrous depths of her magnificent eyes he did not for one moment associate her with the idea which he had formed of the west indian heiress who was bent on capturing his cousin ralph he concluded she was another young friend who might be partaking of the baronesss hospitality he bowed low as she entered through the open french window looking as a georgian or cashmerian houri might have looked he thought if clad in the robes of civilisation harriet bowed in return and said timidly i am so sorry that madame gobelli is not here to receive you but she will not keep you waiting more than a few minutes i am sure she particularly said that she would not be later than five oclock she has left a very charming substitute in her place replied pennell with another bow i believe you have come to see the china continued harriet i do not know much about it myself but miss wynward will be here in a minute and she knows the name of every piece and where it came from that will be eminently satisfactory rejoined anthony pennell but i happen to be a connoisseur in such things myself i have one or two charming bits of old svres and majolica in my chambers which i think the baroness would like to see if she will honour me with a visit to my little place a lonely bachelor like myself must take up some hobby you know to fill his life and mine happens to be china madame gobelli appears to have some lovely chelsea there i would like to steal one or two of those groups on the cabinet will you hold the door open for me whilst i run away with them at this sally harriet laughed and mr pennell thought she looked even handsomer when she laughed than when she was pensive here is the tea she cried nervously as miss wynward appeared with the tray o miss wynward surely madame cannot be much longer now have you looked down the road to see if she is coming the carriage has just turned into the stable yard replied miss wynward and in another minute the doorway was filled with the ample proportions of the baroness olloa mr pennell and so youve stolen a march upon me was her first greeting ow are you extending her enormous hand ave you been looking at the china wait till ive ad my tea ill show you one or two bits thatll make your mouth water its my obby i used to save my pocket money when i was a little gal to buy china i remember my grandfather the dook of but there i avent known you long enough to let you into family secrets lets ave our tea and talk afterwards i ope arriet as entertained you well this young lady commenced anthony pennell interrogatively to be sure miss arriet brandt asnt she introduced erself to you shes like a daughter of the ouse to us we look upon er as one of our own gustave and me miss brandt from jamaica and she knew your cousin captain pullen too at heyst we all did and were dying to ear what as become of im for es never shown is face at the red ouse the murder was out now and harriet waited tremblingly for the result what did mr pennell know what would he say but mr pennell said nothing he was too much startled to speak this harriet brandt this lovely girl the quadroon of whom both doctor phillips and mrs pullen had spoken so disparagingly of whom they had said that she was not fit to be the wife of any decent man oh they must be fools and blind or he was dreaming the baroness was not slow to see the look upon his face and to interpret it rightly are you surprised you neednt look so incredulous i give you my word that this is arriet brandt the same young lady that knew mrs pullen and her brother in law and miss leyton over at heyst what sort of a character ave they been giving er beind er back indeed i assure you madame commenced mr pennell deprecatingly you neednt take the trouble to tell any tarradiddles about it i can see it in your face i didnt think much of that cousin of yours from the beginning es got a shifty sort of look and as for that cold bit of goods miss leyton well all i say is god elp the man that marries er for shes enough to freeze the sun himself but i liked mrs pullen well enough and i was sorry to ear that she ad lost er baby for she was quite wrapt up in it but i daresay shell soon ave another without feeling it incumbent on him to enter into an argument as to the probability of the baronesss last suggestion anthony pennell was glad of the digression as it gave him an opportunity of slurring over the dangerous subject of ralph pullens character the loss of her child was a very great blow to my poor cousin he replied and she is still suffering from it bitterly else i have no doubt that you would have seen something of her and the others he added in a lower tone after a slight interval he ventured to raise his eyes and see how the girl opposite to him had taken what was said but it did not appear to have made much impression on her she was on the contrary gazing at him with that magnetic glance of hers as though she wanted to read into his very soul dont go and say that i want to see em said the baroness as having devoured enough cake and bread and butter to feed an ordinary person for a day she rose and led the way into another room i dont want to see anybody at the red ouse that doesnt want to come and i avent expected the ladies but as for captain pullen oo made an engagement to follow our party to brussels and then never took the trouble to write a line to excuse imself for breaking is word why i say es a jerry sneak and you may tell im so if you like we didnt want im e proposed to come imself and i engaged is room and everything and then e skedaddled without a word and i call it beastly beaviour you mustnt mind my plain speaking mr pennell i always say what i think and i would like to break my stick over captain pullens back and thats the truth they were walking along the passage now on their way to the barons library the baroness in front with her hand leaning heavily on pennells shoulder and harriet lingering a little behind anthony pennell pondered awhile before he replied was this the time to announce ralphs intended marriage how would the girl behind them take it he turned slightly and looked at her face as the thought passed through his mind somehow the eyes that met his reassured him he began to think it must be a mistake that she did not care for ralph as much as mrs pullen had supposed that she was only offended perhaps as her hostess evidently was by the curt and uncivil manner in which he had treated them both so he replied i have not the slightest excuse to make for my cousins conduct madame gobelli it appears to me that he has treated you with very scant civility and he ought to be ashamed of himself but as you know his little nieces death was very sudden and unexpected and the least he could do was to escort his sister in law and miss leyton back to england and since then well and what since then demanded the baroness sharply lord walthamstowe and he have come to an arrangement said pennell speaking very slowly that his marriage with miss elinor leyton shall take place sooner than was at first intended the limerick rangers are under orders for foreign service and captain pullen naturally wishes to take his wife out with him and though of course all this is no excuse for his omitting to write you a letter the necessary preparations and the consequent excitement may have put his duty out of his head of course he continued you know that ralph is engaged to marry miss leyton i eard something of it replied the baroness reluctantly but one never knows what is true and what is not anyway captain pullen didnt give out the news imself e seemed appy enough without miss leyton didnt e arriet but turning round to emphasise her words she found that harriet had not followed them into the library whereupon she became confidential to tell you the truth mr pennell she continued e just beaved like a scoundrel to our little arriet there e ran after the gal all day and spent all is evenings in our private sitting room gazing at er as if e would eat er whilst she sang and played to im e never said a word about marrying miss leyton it was all ally ally ally with im and if the gal adnt been a deal too clever for im and wise enough to see what a vain zany e is she might ave broken er eart over it the conceited jackanapes but she has not fretted said anthony pennell eagerly not she i wouldnt let er shes meat for captain pullens master a gal with fifteen undred a year in er own ands and with a pair of eyes like that oh no arriet can pick up a usband worth two of your cousin any day i should think so indeed replied mr pennell fervently i have heard mrs pullen mention miss brandt but she did not prepare me for meeting so beautiful a girl but i can hardly wonder at my cousin running away from her madame gobelli knowing himself to be already engaged miss brandt must have proved a most dangerous companion perhaps he found his heart was no longer under his own control and thought discretion the better part of valour you must try and look upon his conduct in the best light you can oh well it dont signify much anyway for es no miss at the red ouse i can tell you and arriet could marry to morrow if she chose and to a man worthy of er but now you must look at my spode she walked up to a tall cabinet at one end of the room which was piled with china and took up a fragile piece in her hands do you see that she said turning up the plate and showing the mark upon the bottom there it is you see theres the m these five pieces are said to be the oldest in existence and heres a cup of limoges and thats majolica do you know the marks of majolica theyre some of the rarest known a cross on a shield the first real bit of china i ever possessed was a strasbourg have you ever seen any dutch pottery marked with an ap i picked that up at an old jews shop in the market in naples and this capo di monte strange to say in a back alley in brighton theres nothing i like better than to grub about back slums and look for something good some of my best pieces ave come out of pawnbrokers shops that plate youre looking at is old flemish more than two undred years i believe it came out of the rag market at bruges there used to be first rate pickings to be ad at bruges and ghent and in antwerp some years ago but the english ave pretty well cleared em out i never saw a better private collection madame gobelli said anthony pennell as he gloated over the delicate morsels of svres and limoges and strasbourg the baron should have had an old curiosity and bric a brac establishment instead of anything so prosaic as boots and shoes o i couldnt ave ad it exclaimed the baroness it would ave gone to my eart to sell a good bargain when i ad made it my cups and saucers and plates and teapots are like children to me and if i thought my bobby would sell em when i was gone i believe i should rise from my grave and whack im the woman became almost womanly as her eyes rested lovingly on her art treasures it seemed incongruous to pennell to watch her huge coarse hands with their thick stumpy fingers and broad chestnut nails fingering the delicate fabric with apparent carelessness cup after cup and vase and plate she almost tossed over each other as she pushed some away to make room for others and piled them up on the top of one another until he trembled lest they should all come toppling down together you are more used to handle these treasures than i am he remarked presently i should be too much afraid of smashing something to move them so quickly as you do i never broke a bit of china in my life returned the baroness energetically ive broken a stick over a mans back more than once but never ad an accident with my plates and dishes ow do you account for that you must have a flow of good luck said mr pennell i am so fearful for mine that i keep all the best under glass i ave more friends to elp me than perhaps you know of said the baroness mysteriously but it aint only that i never let a servant dust it miss wynward does it but shes too much afraid to do more than touch em with the tip of her feather brush they come to me sometimes and complain that the china is dirty let it be dirty i say that wont break it but if you clean it you will ha ha ha at that moment harriet brandt entered the room moving sinuously across the carpet as a snake might glide to its lair anthony pennell could not take his eyes off that gliding walk of hers it seemed to him the very essence of grace it distracted all his attention from the china the baron has just come in observed harriet to her hostess oh well come along and leave the rest of the china till after dinner said madame gobelli gustave likes to ave is dinner as soon as e comes ome she thrust her arm through that of anthony pennell and conducted him to the dining room where the baron without having observed the ceremony of changing his coat or boots was already seated just as he had come in at the table he gave a curt nod to the visitor as mr pennells name was mentioned to him and followed it up immediately by a query whether he would take fish mr pennell sat out the meal with increasing amazement at every course he who was accustomed in consequence of his popularity to sit at the tables of some of the highest in the land could liken this one to nothing but a farmhouse dinner course succeeded course in rapid succession and there was no particular fault to find with anything but the utter want of ceremony the mingling of well known and aristocratic names with the boot and shoe trade and the way in which the baron and baroness ate and drank filled him with surprise the climax was reached when mr milliken who was late for dinner entered the room and his hostess before introducing him to the stranger saluted him with a resounding smack on either cheek pennell thought it might be his turn next and shuddered but the wine flowed freely and the baroness being in an undoubted good humour the hospitality was unlimited after dinner the baron having settled to sleep in an armchair madame gobelli proposed that the party should amuse themselves with a game of hunt the slippers she was robed in an expensive satin dress but she threw herself down on the ground with a resounding thump and thrusting two enormous feet into view offered her slipper as an inducement to commence the game pennell stood aloof battling to restrain his laughter at the comical sight before him the baronesss foot from which she had taken the shoe was garbed in a black woollen stocking full of holes which displayed a set of bare toes but apparently quite unaware of the ludicrous object she presented she kept on calling out for harriet brandt and miss wynward to come and complete the circle at which only mr milliken and herself were seated but harriet shrank backwards and refused to play no indeed madame i cannot i do not know your english games she pleaded come on well teach you screamed madame gobelli eres milliken e knows all about it dont you milliken e knows ow to look for the slipper under the gals petticoats you come ere arriet and sit next me and mr pennell shall be the first to unt come on but miss brandt would not come on she remained seated and declared that she was too tired to play and did not care for les jeux innocents and she had a headache and anything and everything before she would comply with the outrageous request preferred to her madame gobelli grumbled at her idleness and called her disobliging but anthony admired the girl for her steadfast refusal he did not like to see her in the familiar society of such a woman as the baroness he would have liked still less to see her engaged in such a boisterous and unseemly game as hunt the slipper he took the opportunity of saying since you are disinclined for such an energetic game miss brandt perhaps you would oblige me by singing a song i should so much like to hear the mandoline mrs pullen has spoken to me of your efficiency on it if madame gobelli wishes it i have no objection replied harriet oh well if you are all going to be so disagreeable as not to play a good game said the baroness as mr milliken pulled her on her feet again arriet may as well sing to us but a good romp first wouldnt ave done us any arm she adjourned rather sulkily to a distant sofa with mr milliken where they entertained each other whilst harriet tuned her mandoline and presently let her rich voice burst forth in the strains of oh ma charmante anthony pennell was enchanted he had a passion for music and it appealed more powerfully to him than anything else he sat in rapt attention until harriets voice had died away and then he implored her to sing another song you cannot tell what it is for me who cares more for music than for anything else in this world to hear a voice like yours why you will create a perfect furore when you go into society you could make your fortune on the stage but i know you have no need of that oh one never knows what one may have need of said harriet gaily as she commenced dormez ma belle and sang it to perfection you must have had a very talented singing master observed pennell when the second song was finished indeed no my only instructress was a nun in the ursuline convent in jamaica but i always loved it said the girl as she ran over the strings of her mandoline in a merry little tarantelle which made everyone in the room feel as if they had been bitten by the spider from which it took its name and wanted above all other things to dance how pennell revelled in the music and the performer how he longed to hear from her own lips that ralphs treatment had left no ill effects behind it when she had ceased playing he drew nearer to her and under the cover of the baronesss conversation with mr milliken and the barons snores they managed to exchange a few words how can i ever thank you enough for the treat you have given me he began i am very glad that you liked it i was not prepared to hear such rare talent my experience of young ladies playing and singing has not hitherto been happy but you have great genius did you ever sing to mrs pullen whilst in heyst once or twice and to my cousin ralph pullen yes i cannot understand his having treated the baroness with such scant courtesy and you also who had been kind enough to allow him to enjoy your society you would not have found me so ungrateful but you have heard doubtless that he is going to be married shortly yes i have heard it and that has i suppose put everything else out of his head perhaps it may be as well especially for his future wife there are some things which are dangerous for men to remember such as your lovely voice for example do you think so harriet fixed her dark eyes on him as she put the question i am sure it will be dangerous for me unless you will give me leave to come and hear it again i shall not be able to sleep for thinking of it do you think the baroness will be so good as to enrol me as a visitor to the house you had better ask her and if she consents will you sing to me sometimes i am always singing or playing there is nothing else to do here the baron and baroness are almost always out and i have no company but that of bobby and miss wynward it is terribly dull i can tell you i am longing to get away but i do not know where to go have you no friends in england not one except mr tarver who is my solicitor that sounds very grim if you will let me count myself amongst your friends i shall be so grateful i should like it very much i am not so ignorant as not to have heard your name and to know that you are a celebrated man but i am afraid i shall prove a very stupid friend for you i have no such fear and if i may come and see you sometimes i shall count myself a very happy man i am generally alone in the afternoon replied miss brandt sophistically in another minute mr pennell was saying good night to his hostess and asking her permission to repeat his visit at some future time and if you and miss brandt would so far honour me madame gobelli as to come and have a little lunch at my chambers in piccadilly i shall feel myself only too much indebted to you perhaps we might arrange a matine or a concert for the same afternoon if it would please you will you let me know and pray fix as early a date as possible and i may really avail myself of your kind permission to come and see you again you may be sure that i shall not forget to do so good night good night baron good night miss brandt and with a nod to mr milliken he was gone aint e a nice fellow worth two of that conceited jackanapes is cousin remarked the baroness as he disappeared what do you think of im arriet oh he is well enough replied miss brandt with a yawn as she prepared also to take her departure he is taller and broader and stronger looking than captain pullen and he must be very clever into the bargain and e never said a word about is books exclaimed madame gobelli only fancy no he never said a word about his books echoed harriet chapter xiv anthony pennell had promised to let margaret pullen hear the result of his visit to the red house and as he entered her presence on the following evening she saluted him with the queries well have you been there have you seen her to which he answered soberly yes i have been there and i have seen her and what do you think of her what did she say i hope she was not rude to you my dear mrs pullen said pennell as he seated himself and prepared for a long talk you must let me say in the first place that i should never have recognised miss brandt from your description of her you led me to expect a gauche schoolgirl a half tamed savage or a juvenile virago and i am bound to say that she struck me as belonging to none of the species i sent your note of introduction to madame gobelli and received a very polite invitation in return in accordance with which i dined at the red house yesterday you dined there exclaimed margaret with renewed interest oh do tell me all about it from the very beginning what do you think of that dreadful woman the baroness and her little humpty baron and did you tell miss brandt of ralphs impending marriage my dear lady one question at a time if you please in the first place i arrived there rather sooner than i was expected and madame gobelli had not returned from her afternoon drive but miss harriet brandt did the honours of the tea table in a very efficient manner and with as much composure and dignity as if she had been a duchess we had a very pleasant time together until the baroness burst in upon us are you chaffing me asked margaret incredulously what do you really think of her i think she is without exception the most perfectly beautiful woman i have ever seen what exclaimed his companion she had thrown herself back in her armchair and was regarding him as if he were perpetrating some mysterious joke which she did not understand how extraordinary how very extraordinary she exclaimed at length that is the very thing that ralph said of her when they first met but why extraordinary there are few men who would not endorse the opinion miss brandt possesses the kind of beauty that appeals to the senses of animal creatures like ourselves she has a far more dangerous quality than that of mere regularity of feature she attracts without knowing it she is a mass of magnetism o do go on mr pennell tell me how she received the news you went to break to her i never broke it at all there was no need to do so miss brandt alluded to the magnificent captain pullens marriage with the greatest nonchalance she evidently estimates him at his true value and does not consider him worth troubling her head about you astonish me but how are we to account then for the attitude she assumed towards miss leyton and the boast she made of ralphs attentions to her bravado most likely miss leyton goes to the red house all aflame like an angry turkey cock and accuses miss brandt of having robbed her of her lover and what would you have the girl do not cry peccavi surely and lower her womanhood she had but one course to brave it out besides you have heard only one side of the question remember i can imagine miss leyton being very nasty if she liked you forget the letters which miss brandt wrote to ralph and which were found in his empty grate at richmond i do not i remember them as only another proof of how unworthy he is of the confidence of any woman really mr pennell you seem to be all on miss brandts side i am and for this reason if your ideas concerning her are correct she displayed a large amount of fortitude whilst speaking of your brother in law yesterday but my own belief is that you are mistaken that miss brandt is too clever for ralph or any of you and that she cares no more for him in that way than you do she considers doubtless that he has behaved in a most ungentlemanly manner towards them all and so do i i did not know what excuse to make for ralph i was ashamed to own him as a relation harriet brandt did then confide her supposed wrongs to you not at all when she mentioned ralphs name it was like that of any other acquaintance but when she was out of the room the baroness told me that he had behaved like a scoundrel to the girl that he had never confided the fact of his engagement to her but run after her on every occasion and then after having promised to join their party in brussels and asked madame gobelli to engage his room for him he left for england without even sending her a line of apology nor has he taken the least notice of them since ah but you know the reason of his sudden departure cried margaret her soft eyes welling over with tears my dear mrs pullen said anthony pennell sympathetically even at that sad moment ralph might have sent a telegram or scratched a line of apology we have to attend to such little courtesies you know even if our hearts are breaking and how can you excuse his not having called on them or written since no wonder the baroness is angry she did not restrain her tongue in speaking of him yesterday she said she never wished to see his face again does she know that elinor went to the red house i think not there was no mention of her name then i suppose we may at all events consider the affair une chose finie i hope so sincerely i should not advise master ralph to show his face at the red house again the baroness said she longed to lay her stick across his back and i believe she is quite capable of doing so oh indeed she is replied margaret smiling we heard a great many stories of her valour in that respect from madame lamont the landlady of the lion dor has miss brandt taken up her residence altogether with madame gobelli i think not she told me her life there was very dull and she should like to change it she is in a most unfortunate position for a young girl remarked margaret left parentless with money at her command and in a strange country and with the strange stigma attached to her birth i dont believe in stigmas being attached to ones birth returned pennell hastily the only stigmas worth thinking about are those we bring upon ourselves by our misconduct such a one for instance as my cousin ralph has done with regard to miss brandt i would rather be in her shoes than his ralph thinks perhaps that being a stranger and friendless she is fair game who is that taking my name in vain interrupted a languid voice at the open door as captain pullen advanced into the room margaret pullen started and grew very red at being detected in discussing her brother in laws actions but anthony pennell who was always ruffled by his cousins affected walk and drawl blurted the truth right out i was he replied hardly touching the hand which captain pullen extended to him i was just telling mrs pullen of the high estimation in which your name is held at the red house it was now ralphs turn to grow red his fair face flushed from chin to brow as he repeated the red house what red house did they not mention the name to you i mean the residence of madame gobelli i was dining there yesterday dining there were you by jove i didnt know you were acquainted with the woman isnt she a queer old party baroness boots eh fancy your knowing them i thought you were a cut above that anthony if the gobellis were good enough for you to be intimate with in heyst i suppose they are good enough for me to dine with in london ralph i did not know until last evening however that you had left them to pay for your rooms in brussels or i would have taken the money over with me to defray the debt ralph had seated himself by this time but he looked very uneasy and as if he wished he had not come did the old girl engage rooms for me he stammered well you know the reason i could not go to brussels but of course if i had known that she had gone to any expense for me i would have repaid her did she tell you of it herself he added rather anxiously yes and a good many more things besides as you have happened to come in whilst we are on the question i had better make a clean breast of it perhaps you have heard that miss leyton has been to the red house and had an interview with miss brandt yes ive just come from richmond where weve had a jolly row over it grumbled ralph pulling his moustaches your family all felt that sort of thing could not go on that it must end one way or the other and therefore i went to the red house ostensibly to view madame gobellis collection of china but in reality to ascertain what view of the matter she and miss brandt took and to undeceive them as to your being in a position to pursue your intimacy with the young lady any further and what the devil business have you to meddle in my private affairs demanded captain pullen rousing himself because unfortunately your mother happened to be my fathers sister replied pennell sternly and the scrapes you get in harm me more than they do yourself one officer more or less who gets into a scrape with women goes pretty well unnoticed but i have attained a position in which i cannot afford to have my relations names bandied about as having behaved in a manner unbecoming gentlemen who dares to say that of me cried ralph angrily everybody who knows of the attention you paid miss brandt in heyst replied anthony pennell boldly and without telling her that you were already engaged to be married i do not wonder at miss leyton being angry about it i only wonder she consents to have any more to do with you in the circumstances o weve settled all that said ralph testily we had the whole matter out at richmond this afternoon and ive promised to be a good boy for the future and never speak to a pretty woman again you need not wonder any more about elinor she is only glad enough to get me back at any price yes and what about miss brandt enquired pennell is she worrying about this affair asked captain pullen quickly not a bit i think she estimates your attentions at their true value i was alluding to the opinion she and her friends must have formed of your character as an officer and a gentleman o ill soon set all that right ill run over to the red house and see the old girl if you two will promise not to tell elinor i should not advise you to do that i am afraid you might get a warm reception i think madame gobelli is quite capable of having you soused in the horse pond you would think the same if you had heard the names she called you yesterday what did she call me everything she could think of she considers you have behaved not only in a most ungentlemanly manner towards her but in a most dishonourable one to miss brandt she particularly told me to tell you that she never wished to see your face again damn her exclaimed captain pullen wrathfully and all her boots and shoes into the bargain a vulgar coarse old tradesmans wife how dare she stop a minute ralph the baronesss status in society makes no difference in this matter you know perfectly well that you did wrong let us have no more discussion of the subject captain pullen leaned back sulkily in his chair well if i did flirt a little bit more than was prudent with an uncommonly distracting little girl he muttered presently i am sure i have had to pay for it lord walthamstowe insists that if i do not marry elinor before the rangers start for malta the engagement shall be broken off so i suppose i must do it but it is a doosid nuisance to be tied up at five and twenty before one has half seen life what the dickens i am to do with her when ive got her im sure i dont know o you will find married life very charming when youre used to it said pennell consolingly and miss leyton is everything a fellow could wish for in a wife only you must give up flirting my boy or if i mistake not youll find youve caught a tartar i expect to have to give up everything said the other with a sour mouth as soon as he perceived a favourable opportunity anthony pennell rose to take his leave he did not wish to quarrel with ralph pullen about a girl whom he had only seen once at the same time he feared for his own self control if his cousin continued to mention the matter in so nonchalant a manner pennell had always despised captain pullen for his easy conceit with regard to women and it seemed to him to have grown more detestably contemptible than before he was anxious therefore to quit the scene of action but to his annoyance when he bade margaret good evening ralph also rose and expressed his wish to walk with him in the direction of his chambers i suppose you couldnt put me up for the night old chappie he said with his most languid air decidedly not replied pennell i have only my own bedroom and ive no intention of your sharing it why do you not go back to richmond or put up at an hotel doosid inhospitable remarked captain pullen with a faded smile sorry you think so but a man cannot give what he does not possess you had better stay and keep your sister in law company for a little while i have work to do and am going straight home all right ill walk with you a little way persisted ralph and the two young men left the house together as soon as they found themselves in the street captain pullen attacked his cousin eagerly i say pennell what is the exact direction of the red house why do you want to know enquired his companion because i feel that i owe the baroness a visit i acknowledge that i was wrong not to write and make my apologies but you must know what it is with a deuce of a lot of women to look after and the whole gang crying their eyes out and everything thrown on my shoulders coffin funeral taking them over from heyst to england and all it was enough to drive everything else out of a mans head you must acknowledge that you owe no excuses to me pullen neither do i quite believe in them you have had plenty of time since to remedy your negligence even if you did forget to be courteous at the moment i know that and youre quite right about the other thing i had more reasons than one for letting the matter drop you are a man and i can tell you with impunity what would set the women tearing my eyes out i did flirt a bit with harriet brandt perhaps more than was quite prudent in the circumstances you mean the circumstance of your engagement to miss leyton yes and no if i had been free it would have been all the same perhaps worse for i should not have had a loophole of escape for you see miss brandt is not the sort of girl that any man could marry why not demanded pennell with some asperity oh because well you should hear old phillips talk of her and her parents they were the most awful people and she has black blood in her her mother was a half caste so you see it would be impossible for any man in my position to think of marrying her one might get a piebald son and heir ha ha ha but putting all that aside she is one of the demndest fascinating little women i ever came across you would say so too if you had seen as much of her as i did i cant tell you what it is exactly but she has a drawing way about her that pulls a fellow into the net before he knows what he is about and her voice by jove have you heard her sing i have but that has nothing to do that i can see with the subject under discussion you an engaged man who had no more right to philander with a girl than if you had been married appear to me to have followed this young lady about and paid her attentions which were to say the least of them compromising never announcing the fact meanwhile that you were bound to miss leyton after which you left her without a word of explanation to think what she chose of your conduct and now you wish to see her again in order to apologise am i right pretty well only you make such a serious matter out of a little fun well then i repeat that if you are wise you will save yourself the trouble ralph miss brandt is happily too sensible to have been taken in by your pretence of making love to her she estimates you at your true value she knows that you are engaged to elinor leyton that you were engaged all the time she knew you and i think she rather pities miss leyton for being engaged to you but this point of view had never presented itself before to the inflated vanity of ralph pullen pities her he exclaimed the devil i daresay it seems incomprehensible to you that any woman should not be thankful to accept at your hands the crumbs that may fall from anothers table but with regard to miss brandt i assure you it is true and even were it otherwise i am certain madame gobelli would not admit you to her house you know the sort of person she is she can be very violent if she chooses and the names she called you yesterday were not pretty ones i had much trouble as your relative to stand by and listen to them quietly yet i could not say that they were undeserved o well i daresay returned ralph impatiently let us allow for the sake of argument that you are right and that i behaved like a brute the matter lies only between hally brandt and myself the old woman has nothing to do with it she never met the girl till she went to heyst what i want to do is to see hally again and make my peace with her you know how easily women are won over a pretty present a few kisses and excuses a few tears and the thing is done i shouldnt like to leave england without making my peace with the little girl couldnt you get her to come to your chambers and let me meet her there then the baroness need know nothing about it i thought you told us just now that you had had a reconciliation with miss leyton on condition that you were to be a good boy for the future does that not include a surreptitious meeting with miss brandt i suppose it does but we have to make all sorts of promises where women are concerned a nice kind of life a man would lead if he consented to be tied to his wifes apron strings and never go anywhere nor see anyone of whom she did not approve i swore to everything she and old walthamstowe asked me just for peaces sake but if they imagine im going to be hampered like that they must be greater fools than i take them for you must do as you think right pullen but i am not going to help you to break your word tell me where the red house is tell me whereabouts hally takes her daily walks urged captain pullen i shall tell you nothing you must find out for yourself well you are damned particular exclaimed his cousin one would think this little half caste was a princess of the blood royal what is she when alls said and done the daughter of a mulatto and a man who made himself so detested that he was murdered by his own servants the bastard of a stop cried pennell so vehemently that the passers by turned their heads to look at him i dont believe it and if it is true i do not wish to hear it miss brandt may be all that you say i am not in a position to contradict your assertions but to me she represents only a friendless and unprotected woman who has a right to our sympathy and respect a friendless woman sneered captain pullen yes and a doosid good looking one into the bargain eh my dear fellow and much of your sympathy and respect she would command if she were ugly and humpbacked o i know you pennell its no use your coming the benevolent samaritan over me you have an eye for a jimper waist and a trim ancle as well as most men but i fancy your interest is rather thrown away in this quarter miss brandt has a thorny path before her she is a young lady who will have her own way and with the glorious example of the baroness the way is not likely to be too carefully chosen to tell the truth old boy i ran away because i was afraid of falling into the trap the girl wishes intensely to be married and she is not a girl whom men will marry and so we need go no further only i should not be surprised if notwithstanding her fortune and her beauty we should find miss harriet brandt figuring before long amongst the free lances of london and you would have done your best to send her there replied anthony pennell indignantly as he stopped on the doorstep of his piccadilly chambers but i am glad to say that your folly has been frustrated this time and miss brandt sees you as you are good night and without further discussion he turned on his heel and walked upstairs by jove thought ralph as he too went on his way i believe old anthony is smitten with the girl himself though he has only seen her once that was the most remarkable thing about her the ease with which she seemed to attract looking so innocent all the while and the deadly strength with which she resisted ones efforts to get free again perhaps it is as well after all that i should not meet her i dont believe i could trust myself only speaking of her seems to have revived the old sensation of being drawn against my will hypnotised i suppose the scientists would call it to be near her to touch her to embrace her until all power of resistance is gone but i do hope old anthony is not going to be hypnotised hes too good for that meanwhile pennell having reached his rooms lighted the gas threw himself into an armchair and rested his head upon his hands poor little girl he murmured to himself poor little girl anthony pennell was a socialist in the best and truest sense of the world he loved his fellow creatures both high and low better than he loved himself he wanted all to share alike to be equally happy equally comfortable to help and be helped to rest and depend upon one another he knew that the dream was only a dream that it would never be fulfilled in his time nor any other that some men would be rich and some poor as long as the world lasts and that what one man can do to alleviate the misery and privation and suffering with which we are surrounded is very little what little pennell could do however to prove that his theories were not mere talk he did he made a large income by his popular writings and the greater part of it went to relieve the want of his humbler friends not through governors and secretaries and the heads of charitable societies but from his own hand to theirs but his socialism went further and higher than this money was not the only thing which his fellow creatures required they wanted love sympathy kindness and consideration and these he gave also wherever he found that there was need he set his face pertinaciously against all scandal and back biting and waged a perpetual warfare against the tyranny of men over women the ill treatment of children and the barbarities practised upon dumb animals and all living things he was a liberal minded man with a heart large enough and tender enough to belong to a woman with a horror of cruelty and a great compassion for everything that was incapable of defending itself he was always writing in defence of the people calling the attention of those in authority to their misfortunes their evil chances their lack of opportunity and their patience under tribulation for this purpose and in order to know them thoroughly he had gone and lived amongst them shared their filthy dens in whitechapel partaken of their unappetising food in stratford and watched them at their labour in homerton his figure and his kindly face were well known in some of the worst and most degraded parts of london and he could pass anywhere without fear of a hand being lifted up against him or an oath called after him in salutation anthony pennell was in fact a general lover a lover of mankind and that is why he leant his head upon his hand as he ejaculated with reference to harriet brandt poor little girl it seemed so terrible in his eyes that just because she was friendless and an orphan just because her parents had been perhaps unworthy just because she had a dark stream mingling with her blood just because she needed the more sympathy and kindness the more protection and courtesy she should be considered fit prey for the sensualist a fit subject to wipe mens feet upon what difference did it make to harriet brandt herself that she was marked with an hereditary taint did it render her less beautiful less attractive less graceful and accomplished were the sins of the fathers ever to be visited upon the children was no sympathetic fellow creature to be found to say if it is so let us forget it it is not your fault nor mine our duty is to make each others lives as happy as possible and trust the rest to god he hoped as he sat there that before long harriet brandt would find a friend for life who would never remind her of anything outside her own loveliness and loveable qualities presently he rose with a sigh and going to his bookcase drew thence an uncut copy of his last work god and the people it had been a tremendous success having already reached the tenth edition it dealt largely as its title indicated with his favourite theory but it was light and amusing also full of strong nervous language and bristling every here and there with wit not strained epigrams such as no society conversationalists ever tossed backward and forward to each other but honest mirth provoking humour arising from the humorous side of pennells own character which ever had a good humoured jest for the oddities and comicalities of everyday life he regarded the volume for a moment as though he were considering if it were an offering worthy of its destination and then he took up a pen and transcribed upon the fly leaf the name of harriet brandt only her name nothing more she seems intelligent he thought and she may like to read it who knows if there is any fear of the sad destiny which ralph prophesies for her whether i may not be happy enough to turn her ideas into a worthier and more wholesome direction with an independent fortune how much good might she not accomplish amongst those less happily situated than herself but the other idea no i will not entertain it for a moment she is too good too pure too beautiful for so horrible a fate poor little girl poor poor little girl chapter xv the holiday season being now over and the less fashionable people returned to town harriet brandts curiosity was much excited by the number of visitors who called at the red house but were never shewn into the drawing room as many as a dozen might arrive in the course of an afternoon and were taken by miss wynward straight upstairs to the room where madame gobelli and mr milliken so often shut themselves up together these mysterious visitors were not objects of charity either but well dressed men and women some of whom came in their own carriages and all of whom appeared to be of the higher class of society the baroness had left off going to the factory also and stayed at home every day apparently with the sole reason of being at hand to receive her visitors harriet could not understand it at all and after having watched two fashionably attired ladies accompanied by a gentleman ascend the staircase to madame gobellis room one afternoon she ventured to sound miss wynward on the subject who were the ladies who went upstairs just now she asked friends of the baroness miss brandt was the curt reply but why do they not come down to the drawing room then what does madame gobelli do with them in that little room upstairs i was passing one day just after someone had entered and i heard the key turned in the lock what is all the secrecy about there is no secrecy on my part miss brandt you know the position i hold here when i have shewn the visitors upstairs according to my ladys directions my duty is done but you must know why they come to see her i know nothing if you are curious on the subject you must ask the baroness but harriet did not like to do that the baroness had become less affectionate to her of late her fancy was already on the wane she no longer called the attention of strangers to her young friend as the daughter of the house and harriet felt the change though she could scarcely have defined where it exactly lay she had begun to feel less at home in her hostesss presence and her high spirit chafed at the alteration in her manner she realised as many had done before her that she had out stayed her welcome but her curiosity respecting the people who visited madame gobelli upstairs was none the less she confided it to bobby poor bobby who grew whiter and more languid ever day but her playful threat to invade the sacred precincts and find out what the baroness and her friends were engaged upon was received by the youth with horror he trembled as he begged her not to think of such a thing hally you mustnt indeed you mustnt you dont know you have no idea what might not happen to you if you offended mamma by breaking in upon her privacy o dont pray dont she can be so terrible at times i do not know what she might not do or say my dear bobby i was only in fun i have not the least idea of doing anything so rude only if you think that i am frightened of your mamma or any other woman you are very much mistaken its all nonsense no one person can harm another in this world o yes they can if they have help replied the boy shaking his head help what help the help of mr milliken i suppose i would rather fight him than the baroness any day but i fear neither of them o hally you are wrong said the lad you must be careful indeed you must for my sake why you silly bobby you are actually trembling however i promise you i will do nothing rash and i shall not be here much longer now your mamma is getting tired of me i can see that plainly enough she has hardly spoken a word to me for the last two days i am going to ask mr pennell to advise me where to find another home no no cried the lad clinging to her you shall not leave us mr pennell shall not take you away i will kill him first he was getting terribly jealous of anthony pennell but harriet laughed at his complaints and reproaches as the emanations of a love sick schoolboy she was flattered by his feverish longing for her society and his outspoken admiration of her beauty but she did not suppose for one moment that bobby was capable of a lasting or dangerous sentiment mr pennell had become a familiar figure at the red house by this time his first visit had been speedily succeeded by another at which he had presented harriet brandt with the copy of his book an attention which had he known it flattered her vanity more than any praises of her beauty could have done a plain woman likes to be told that she is good looking a handsome one that she is clever harriet brandt was not unintelligent on the contrary she had inherited a very fair amount of brains from her scientific father but no one ever seemed to have found it out until anthony pennell came her way she was a little tired of being told that she had lovely eyes and the most fascinating smile she knew all that by heart and craved for something new mr pennell had supplied the novelty by talking to her as if her intellect were on a level with his own as if she were perfectly able to understand and sympathise with his quixotic plans for the alleviation of the woes of all mankind with his arcadian dreams of liberty equality and fraternity and might help them also if she chose not with money only but by raising her own voice in the cause of the people harriet had never been treated so by anyone before and her ardent impetuous passionate nature which had a large amount of gratitude in its composition fixed itself upon her new friend with a vehemence which neither of them would find it easy to overcome or to disentangle themselves from her love eager to repair the void left by the desertion of captain pullen had poured itself by means of looks and sighs and little timid tender touches upon anthony pennell like a mountain torrent that had burst its bounds and he had been responsive he had opened his arms to receive the flood actuated not only by the admiration which he had conceived for her from the first but by the intense yearning pity which her loneliness and friendlessness had evoked in his generous compassionate nature in fact they were desperately in love with each other and harriet was expecting each time he came to hear anthony pennell say that he could no longer live without her and bobby looked on from a little distance and suffered the next time that mr pennell came to see her harriet confided to him the mystery of the upstairs room and asked his opinion as to what it could possibly mean perhaps they are people connected with the boot trade suggested anthony jestingly does madame keep a stock of boots and shoes up there do you think o no mr pennell you must not joke about it this is something serious poor bobby grew as white as a sheet when i proposed to make a raid upon the room some day and discover the mystery and said that his mother was a terrible woman and able to do me great harm if i offended her i quite agree with bobby in his estimate of his mamma being a terrible woman replied mr pennell but it is all nonsense about her being able to harm you i should soon see about that what would you do asked harriet with downcast eyes what would i not do to save you from anything disagreeable let alone anything dangerous but the baroness is too fond of you surely to do you any harm harriet pursed up her lips i am not so sure about her being fond of me mr pennell she used to profess to be i know but lately her manner has very much altered she will pass half a day without speaking a word to me and they have cut off wine and champagne and everything nice from the dinner table i declare the meals here are sometimes not fit to eat and i believe they grudge me the little i consider worthy my attention but why do you stay here if you fancy you are not welcome asked pennell earnestly you are not dependent on these people or their hospitality but where am i to go said the girl i know no one in london and miss wynward says that i am too young to live at an hotel by myself miss wynward is quite right you are far too young and too beautiful you dont know what wicked men and women there are in the world who would delight in fleecing an innocent lamb like you but i can soon find you a home where you could stay in respectability and comfort until until until what asked harriet with apparent ingenuousness for she knew well enough what was coming they were seated on one of those little couches made expressly for conversation where a couple can sit back to back with their faces turned to one another harriet half raised her slumbrous black eyes as she put the question and met the fire in his own he stretched out his arms and caught her round the waist hally hally you know there is no need for me to tell you will you come home to me dearest dont ever say that you are friendless again here is your friend and your lover and your devoted slave for ever my darling my beautiful hally say you will be my wife and make me the very happiest man in all the world she did not shrink from his warm wooing that was not her nature her eyes waked up and flashed fire responsive to his own she let her head rest on his shoulder and turned her lips upwards eagerly to meet his kiss she cooed her love into his ear and clasped him tightly round the neck as if she would never let him go i love you i love you she kept on murmuring i have loved you from the very first o hally how happy it makes me to hear you say so he replied how few women have the honesty and courage to avow their love as you do my sweet child of the sun the women in this cold country have no idea of the joy that a mutual love like ours has the power to bestow we will love each other for ever and ever my hally and when our bodies are withered by age our spirits shall still go loving on he the man whose whole thoughts hitherto had been so devoted to the task of ameliorating the condition of his fellow creatures that he had had no time to think of dalliance succumbed as fully to its pleasures now as the girl whose life had simply been a ripening process for the seed which had burst forth into flower they were equally passionate equally loving equally unreserved and they were soon absorbed in their own feelings and noticed nothing that was taking place around them but they were not as entirely alone as they imagined a pale face full of misery was watching them through one of the panes in the french windows gazing at what seemed like his death doom too horribly fascinated to tear himself away bobby stood there and saw hally his hally as he had often fondly called her without knowing the meaning of the word clasped in the arms of this stranger pressing her lips to his and being released with tumbled hair and a flushed face only to seek the source of her delight again at last bobby could stand the bitter sight no longer and with a low moan he fled to his own apartment and flung himself face downward on the bed and anthony pennell and harriet brandt continued to make love to each other until the shadows lengthened and six oclock was near at hand i must go now my darling he said at last though it is hard to tear myself away but i am so happy hally so very very happy that i dare not complain why cannot you stay the evening she urged i had better not i have not been asked in the first instance and if what you say about the baronesss altered demeanour towards yourself be true i am afraid i should find it difficult to keep my temper but we part for a very short time my darling the first thing to morrow i shall see about another home for you where i can visit you as freely as i like and as soon as it can ever be hally we will be married is that a promise a promise yes a thousand times over anthony i long for the time when i shall be your wife god bless you my sweet you have made my future life look all sunshine i will write to you as soon as ever i have news and then you will lose no time in leaving your present home will you not an instant that i can help replied harriet eagerly i am longing to get away i feel that i have lost my footing here and with another long embrace the lovers parted as soon as anthony had left her harriet ran up to her room to cool her feverish face and change her dress for dinner she was really and truly fond of the man she had just promised to marry and if anything could have the power to transform her into a thinking and responsible woman it would be marriage with anthony pennell she was immensely proud that so clever and popular a writer should have chosen her from out the world of women to be his wife and she loved him for the excellent qualities he had displayed towards his fellow men as well as for the passionate warmth he had shewn for herself she was a happier girl than she had ever been in all her life before as she stood flushed and triumphant in front of her mirror and saw the beautiful light in her dark eyes and the luxuriant growth of her dusky hair and the carmine of her lips and loved every charm she possessed for anthonys sake she felt less vexed even with the baroness than she had done and determined that she would not break the news of her intended departure from the red house that evening but try to leave as pleasant an impression behind her as she could and she put on the lemon coloured frock though anthony was not there to see it from a feeling that since he approved of her she must be careful of her appearance for the future to do justice to his opinion madame gobelli appeared to be in a worse temper than usual that evening she stumped in to the dining room and took her seat at table without vouchsafing a word to harriet although she had not seen her since luncheon time she found fault with everything that miss wynward did and telling her that she grew stupider and stupider each day ordered her to attend her upstairs after dinner as she had some friends coming and needed her assistance the ex governess did not answer at first and the baroness sharply demanded if she had heard her speak yes my lady she replied slowly but i trust that you will excuse my attendance as i have made an engagement for this evening madame gobelli boiled over with rage engagement what do you mean by making an engagement without asking my leave first you cant keep it i want you to elp me in something and youll ave to come you must forgive me repeated miss wynward firmly but i cannot do as you wish harriet opened her eyes in amazement miss wynward refusing a request from madame gobelli what would happen next the baroness grew scarlet in the face she positively trembled with rage old your tongue she screamed youll do as i say or you leave my ouse then i will leave your house replied miss wynward madame gobelli was thunderstruck where was this insolent menial who had actually dared to defy her going what friends had she what home to go to she had received no salary from her for years past but had accepted board and lodging and cast off clothes in return for her services how could she face the world without money you go at your peril she exclaimed hoarse with rage you know what will appen to you if you try to resist me i ave those that will elp me to be revenged on my enemies you know that those i ate die and when i ave my knife in a body i turn it you ad better be careful and think twice about what youre going to do your ladyship cannot frighten me any longer replied miss wynward calmly i thank god and my friends that i have got over that nor do i believe any more in your boasted powers of revenge if they are really yours you should be ashamed to use them gustave shrieked the baroness get up and put this woman from the door she dont stop in the red ouse another hour let er pack up er trumpery and go do you ear me gustave turn er out of the room mein tear mein tear a little patience miss wynward will go quietly but the law mein tear the law we must be careful damn the law exclaimed the baroness ere wheres that devil bobby why aint e at dinner whats the good of my aving a usband and a son if neither of em will do my bidding then everyone looked round and discovered that bobby was not at the table wheres bobby demanded the baroness of the servant in waiting dont know im sure replied the domestic who like most of madame gobellis dependents talked as familiarly with her as though they had been on an equality the last time i saw im was at luncheon i will go and look for him said miss wynward quietly as she rose from table no you dont exclaimed the baroness insolently you dont touch my child nor my usband again whilst you remain under this roof i wont ave them polluted by your fingers ere sarah you go upstairs and see if bobbys in is room itll be the worse for im if e isnt sarah took her way upstairs in obedience to her employers behest and the next minute a couple of shrieks loud and terrified proceeded from the upper story they were in sarahs voice and they startled everyone at the dinner table oh what is that exclaimed harriet as her face grew white with fear something is wrong said miss wynward as she hastily left the room the baroness said nothing until miss wynwards voice was heard calling out over the banisters baron will you come here please at once then she said gustave elp me up and steadying herself by means of her stick she proceeded to the upper story accompanied by her husband and harriet brandt they were met on the landing by miss wynward who addressed herself exclusively to the baron will you send for a doctor at once she said eagerly bobby is very ill very ill indeed what is the matter enquired the stolid german its all rubbish exclaimed madame gobelli forcing her way past the ex governess ow can e be ill when e was running about all the morning ere bobby she continued addressing the prostrate figure of her son which was lying face downward on the bed get up at once and dont lets ave any of your nonsense or ill give you such a taste of my stick as youve never ad before get up i say at once now she had laid hold of her sons arm and was about to drag him down upon the floor when miss wynward interposed with a face of horror leave him alone she cried indignantly woman cannot you see what is the matter your son has left you he is dead the baroness was about to retort that it was a lie and she didnt believe it when a sudden trembling overtook her which she was powerless to resist her whole face shook as if every muscle had lost control and her cumbersome frame followed suit she did not cry nor call out but stood where the news had reached her immovable except for that awful shaking which made her sway from head to foot the baron on hearing the intelligence turned round to go downstairs and dispatch william who was employed in the stables in search of a medical man miss wynward took the lifeless body in her arms and tenderly turned it over kissing the pallid face as she did so when harriet brandt full of mournful curiosity advanced to have a look at her dead playmate her appearance till then unnoticed seemed to wake the paralysed energies of the baroness into life she pushed the girl from the bed with a violence that sent her reeling against the mantelshelf whilst she exclaimed furiously out of my sight dont you dare to touch im this is all your doing you poisonous wicked creature harriet stared at her hostess in amazement had she suddenly gone mad with grief what do you mean madame she cried what i say i ought to ave known better than to let you enter an ouse of mine i was a fool not to ave left you beind me at heyst to practise your devilish arts on your army captains and foreign grocers instead of letting you come within touch of my innocent child you are mad cried harriet what have i done do you mean to insinuate that bobbys death has anything to do with me it is you oo ave killed im screamed the baroness shaking her stick its your poisonous breath that as sapped is i should ave seen it from the beginning do you suppose i dont know your istory do you think i avent eard all about your parents and their vile doings that i dont know that youre a common bastard and that your mother was a devilish negress and your father a murderer why didnt i listen to my friends and forbid you the ouse miss wynward said harriet who had turned deadly white at this unexpected attack what can i say what can i do leave the room my dear leave the room her ladyship is not herself she does not know what she is saying dont i screamed madame gobelli barring the way to the door i am telling er nothing but the truth and she doesnt go till she as eard it she has the vampires blood in er and she poisons everybody with whom she comes in contact wasnt mrs pullen and mademoiselle brimont both taken ill from being too intimate with er and didnt the baby die because she carried it about and breathed upon it and now she as killed my bobby in the same way curse er even when reiterating the terrible truth in which she evidently believed madame gobelli showed no signs of breaking down but stood firm leaning heavily on her stick and trembling in every limb harriet brandts features had assumed a scared expression miss wynward she stammered piteously oh miss wynward this cannot be true of course not of course not replied the other soothingly her ladyship will regret that she has spoken so hastily to you to morrow i shant regret it said the baroness sturdily for it is the truth her father and her mother were murderers who were killed by their own servants in revenge for their atrocities and they left their curse upon this girl the curse of black blood and of the vampires blood which kills everything which it caresses look back over your past life she continued to harriet and youll see that its the case and if you dont believe me go and ask your friend dr phillips for e knew your infamous parents and the curse that lies upon you madame madame cried miss wynward is this a moment for such recrimination if all this were true it is no fault of miss brandts think of what lies here and that he loved her and the thought will soften your feelings but it dont exclaimed the baroness when i look at my dead son i could kill er because she has killed im and in effect she advanced upon harriet with so vengeful a look that the girl with a slight cry darted from the room and rushed into her own for shame said miss wynward whose previous fear of the baroness seemed to have entirely evaporated how dare you intimidate an innocent woman in the very presence of death dont you try to browbeat me replied the baroness i will tell you what i think said miss wynward boldly and that is that you should blush to give way to your evil temper in the face of gods warning to yourself you accuse that poor girl of unholy dealings what can you say of your own you who for years past have made money by deceiving your fellow creatures in the grossest manner who have professed to hold communication with the spiritual world for their satisfaction when if any spirits have come to you they must have been those of devils akin to your own and because i refused to help you to deceive to take the place of that miserable cur milliken and play cheating tricks with cards and dress up stuffed figures to further your money getting ends you threatened me with loss of home and character and friends until god forgive me i consented to further the fraud from fear of starving but now thank heaven i have no more fear of you yes you may shake your stick at me and threaten to take my life but it is useless this pointing to the dead boy upon the bed was the only tie i had to the red house and as soon as he is dressed for his grave i shall leave you for ever and where would you go enquired the baroness the voice did not sound like her own it was the cracked dry voice of a very old woman that is no concern of yours my lady replied miss wynward as she prepared to quit the room be good enough to let me pass the inexcusable manner in which you have insulted that poor young lady miss brandt makes me feel that my first duty is to her i forbid you commenced madame gobelli in her old tone but the ex governess simply looked her in the face and passed on she made the woman feel that her power was gone miss wynward found harriet in her own room tossing all her possessions into her travelling trunks there was no doubt of her intention she was going to leave the red house not at this time of night my dear said miss wynward kindly it is nearly nine oclock i would go if i had to walk the street all night replied harriet feverishly her eyes were inflamed with crying and she shook like an aspen leaf oh miss wynward such awful things to say what could she mean what have i done to be so cruelly insulted and when i am so sorry for poor bobby too she began to cry afresh as she threw dresses mantles stockings and shoes one on the top of the other in her endeavour to pack as quickly as possible let me help you dear miss brandt it is cruel that you should be driven from the house in this way but i am going too as soon as the doctor has been and dear bobbys body may be prepared for burial it is a great grief to me miss brandt i have had the care of him since he was five years old and i loved him like my own but i am glad he is dead i am glad he has escaped from it all for this is a wicked house a godless deceiving and slanderous house and this trouble has fallen on it as a nemesis i will not stay here a moment longer now he has gone i shall join my friends to morrow i am glad you have friends said harriet for i can see you are not happy here do they live far off have you sufficient money for your journey forgive my asking miss wynward stooped down and kissed the girls brow thank you so much for your kind thought but it is unnecessary you will be surprised perhaps continued miss wynward blushing but i am going to be married and so am i was on harriets lips when she laid her head down on the lid of her trunk and began to cry anew oh miss wynward what did she mean can there be any truth in it is there something poisonous in my nature that harms those with whom i come in contact how can it be how can it be no no of course not replied her friend cannot you see that it was the baronesss temper that made her speak so cruelly to you but you are right to go only where are you going i do not know i am so ignorant of london can you advise me you will communicate with your friends to morrow asked miss wynward anxiously oh yes as soon as i can then i should go to the langham hotel in portland place for to night at all events there you will be safe till your friends advise you further what can i do to help you ask sarah or william to fetch a cab and to have my boxes placed on it there is a douceur for them said harriet placing a handsome sum in miss wynwards hand and you will not see the baroness again asked her companion no no for gods sake no i could not trust myself i can never look upon her face again in a few minutes the hired vehicle rolled away from the door bearing harriet brandt and her possessions to the langham hotel and miss wynward returned to the room where bobby lay madame gobelli stood exactly where she had left her gazing at the corpse there were no tears in her eyes only the continuous shaking of her huge limbs come said miss wynward not unkindly you had better sit down and let me bring you a glass of wine this terrible shock has been too much for you but the baroness only pushed her hand away impatiently who was that driving away just now she enquired miss brandt you have driven her from the house with your cruel and unnecessary accusations no one liked bobby better than she did has the doctor arrived i expect so i hear the barons voice in the hall now almost as she spoke the baron and the doctor entered the room the medical man did what was required of him he felt the heart and pulse of the corpse turned back the eyelids sighed professionally and asked how long it was since it had happened he was told that it was about an hour since they had found him ah he has been dead longer than that three hours at the least maybe four i am afraid there must be an inquest and it would be advisable in the interests of science to have a post mortem a great pity a fine grown lad nineteen years old you say shall probably detect hidden mischief in the heart and lungs i will make all the necessary arrangements with the baron good evening and the doctor bowed himself out of sight again it is quite true then articulated the baroness thickly he is gone oh yes my lady he is gone poor dear boy i felt sure of that it is quite certain quite certain the body is already stiffening the baroness did not utter a sound but miss wynward glancing at her saw her body sway slowly backwards and forwards once or twice before it fell heavily to the ground stricken with paralysis chapter xvi doctor phillips was a great favourite with the beau sexe he was so mild and courteous so benevolent and sympathetic that they felt sure he might be trusted with their little secrets women both old and young invaded his premises daily and therefore it was no matter of surprise to him when whilst he was still occupied with his breakfast on the morning following harriet brandts flight from the red house his confidential servant charles announced that a young lady was waiting to see him in his consulting room no name charles demanded the doctor no name sir replied the discreet charles without the ghost of a smile say that i will be with her in a minute doctor phillips finished his cutlet and his coffee before he rose from table he knew what ladies confidences were like and that he should not have much chance of returning to finish an interrupted meal but as he entered his consulting room his air of indifference changed to one of surprise pacing restlessly up and down the carpet was harriet brandt but so altered that he should hardly have recognised her her face was puffy and swollen as though she had wept all night her eyelids red and inflamed her whole demeanour wild and anxious my dear young lady is it possible that i see miss brandt the doctor began she turned towards him and coming up close to his side grasped his arm i must speak to you she exclaimed without further preliminary you are the only person who can set my doubts at rest well well well he said soothingly for the girl looked and spoke as though her mind were disordered you may rely that i will do all i can for you but let us sit down first no no cried harriet there is no time i cannot rest you must satisfy my mind at once or i shall go mad i have not closed my eyes all night the time was interminable but how could i sleep i seemed to be torn in pieces by ten thousand devils my dear child said doctor phillips as he laid his hand on hers and looked her steadily in the face you are over excited you must try to restrain yourself he went up to a side table and pouring out some cordial made her drink it harriet gulped it down and sank back exhausted in a chair she was weak and worn out with the excitement she had passed through come that is better said the doctor as he saw the tears stealing from beneath her closed eyelids now dont hurry yourself keep quiet till you feel strong enough to speak and then tell me what it is that brings you here the allusion appeared to stir up all her misery again she sat upright and grasped the doctor by the arm as she had done at first you must tell me she said breathlessly you must tell me all i want to know they say you knew my father and mother in jamaica is that true the old doctor began to feel uncomfortable it is one thing to warn those in whom you are interested against a certain person or persons and another to be confronted with the individual you have spoken of and forced to repeat your words yet doctor phillips was innocent of having misjudged or slandered anyone i did know your father and mother for a short time he answered cautiously and were they married to each other my dear young lady what is the use of dragging up such questions now your parents are both gone to their account why not let all that concerned them rest also no no you forget that i live to suffer the effects of their wrong doing i must know the truth i will not leave the house until you tell me were they married am i a a bastard if you insist upon knowing i believe they were not married at least it was the general opinion in the island but would not mr tarver be the proper person to inform you of anything which you may wish to know harriet seized his hand and carried it to her forehead it was burning hot feel that she exclaimed and you would have me wait for weeks before i could get any satisfaction from mr tarver and not then perhaps do you think i could live through the agony of suspense i should kill myself before the answer to my letter came no you are the only person that can give me any satisfaction madame gobelli told me to ask you for the truth if i did not believe her madame gobelli reiterated the doctor in surprise yes i was staying with her at the red house until last night and then she was so cruel to me that i left her son bobby is dead and she accused me of having killed him she said that my father was a murderer and my mother a negress that they were both so wicked that their own servants killed them and that i have inherited all their vices she said that it was i who killed mrs pullens baby and that i had vampire blood in me and should poison everyone i came in contact with what does she mean tell me the truth for gods sake for more depends upon it than you have any idea of madame gobelli was extremely wrong to speak in such a manner and i do not know on what authority she did so what can she know of your parents or their antecedents but you you cried harriet feverishly what do you say doctor phillips was silent he did not know what to say he was not a man who could tell a lie glibly and appear as if he were speaking the truth patients always guessed when he had no hope to give them however soothing and carefully chosen his words might be he regarded the distracted girl before him for some moments in compassionate silence and then he answered i have said already that if a daughter cannot hear any good of her parents she had better hear nothing at all then it is true my father and mother were people so wicked and so cruel that their names are only fit for execration if you could have said a good word for them you would i can read that in your eyes the purity and charity of your own life can do much to wipe out the stain upon theirs said the doctor you have youth and money and the opportunity of doing good you may be as beloved as they were hated interposed the girl i understand you perfectly but what about my possessing the fatal power of injuring those i come in contact with what truth is there in that answer me for gods sake have i inherited the vampires blood who bequeathed to me that fatal heritage my dear miss brandt you must not talk of such a thing you are alluding only to a superstition but have i got it whatever it may be persisted harriet had i anything to do with the babys death or with that of bobby bates i loved them both was it my love that killed them shall i always kill everybody i love i must know i will miss brandt you have now touched upon a subject that is little thought of or discussed amongst medical men but that is undoubtedly true the natures of persons differ very widely there are some born into this world who nourish those with whom they are associated they give out their magnetic power and their families their husbands or wives children and friends feel the better for it there are those on the other hand who draw from their neighbours sometimes making large demands upon their vitality sapping their physical strength and feeding upon them as it were until they are perfectly exhausted and unable to resist disease this proclivity has been likened to that of the vampire bat who is said to suck the breath of its victims and it was doubtless to this fable that madame gobelli alluded when speaking to you but have i got it have i got it the girl demanded eagerly the doctor looked at her lustrous glowing eyes at her parted feverish lips at the working hands clasped together the general appearance of excited sensuality and thought it was his duty to warn her at least a little against the dangers of indulging such a temperament as she unfortunately possessed but like all medical men he temporised i should certainly say that your temperament was more of the drawing than the yielding order miss brandt but that is not your fault you know it is a natural organism but i think it is my duty to warn you that you are not likely to make those with whom you intimately associate stronger either in mind or body you will always exert a weakening and debilitating effect upon them so that after a while having sapped their brains and lowered the tone of their bodies you will find their affection or friendship for you visibly decrease you will have in fact sucked them dry so if i may venture to advise you i would say if there is any one person in the world whom you most desire to benefit and retain the affection of let that be the very person from whom you separate as often as possible you must never hope to keep anyone near you for long without injuring them make it your rule through life never to cleave to any one person altogether or you will see that persons interest in you wax and wane until it is destroyed and what if i marry asked harriet in a strained voice if you insist upon my answering that question i should advise you seriously not to marry i do not think yours is a temperament fitted for married life nor likely to be happy in it you will not be offended by my plain speaking i hope remember you have forced it from me and that is the truth medically and scientifically that i must not marry she repeated dully i think it would be unadvisable but everyone must judge for himself in such matters but marriage is not after all the ultimatum of earthly bliss miss brandt many married couples would tell you it is just the reverse and with a fortune at your command you have many pleasures and interests quite apart from that very over rated institution of matrimony but dont think i am presuming to do more than advise you there is no real reason medical or legal why you should not choose for yourself in the matter only only that those i cling to most nearly will suffer from the contact said harriet in the same strained tones just so responded the doctor gaily and an old mans advice to you is to keep out of it as he has done and now if there is anything more he continued that i can do for you nothing more thank you replied the girl rising i understand it all now will you not see your old friend mrs pullen before you go asked the doctor she and her husband are staying with me oh no no cried harriet shrinking from the idea i could not see her i would rather go back at once and she hurried from the consulting room as she spoke doctor phillips stood for a while musing after her departure had he done right he thought in telling her yet how in the face of persistent questioning could he have done otherwise his thoughts were all fixed upon ralph pullen and the scenes that had taken place lately with him respecting this girl he did not dream she had an interest in anthony pennell he did not know that they had met more than once he thought she might still be pursuing ralph still expecting that he might break his engagement with miss leyton in order to marry herself and he believed he had done the wisest thing in trying to crush any hopes she might have left concerning him a most dangerous temperament he said to himself as he prepared to receive another patient one that is sufficient to mar a mans life if not to kill him entirely i trust that she and captain pullen may never meet again it was evident that my remarks on marriage disappointed the poor child ah well she will be much better without it and here the discreet charles softly opened the door and ushered in another lady an hour later anthony pennell who had projected a visit to the red house that afternoon received a note by a commissionaire instead containing a few hurried lines come to me as soon as you can it said i have left madame gobelli i am at the langham hotel and very unhappy needless to say that ten minutes after the reception of this news her lover was rushing to her presence as fast as hansom wheels could take him he was very desperately and truly in love with harriet brandt like most men who use their brains in fiction his work whilst in course of progression occupied his energies to such an extent that he had no time or thought for anything else but the burden once lifted the romance written the strain and anxiety removed the pendulum swung in the other direction and anthony pennell devoted all his attention to pleasure and amusement he had been set down by his colleagues as a reserved and cold blooded man with regard to the other sex but he was only self contained and thoughtful he was as warm by nature as harriet herself and once sure of a response could make love with the best and as he flew to her assistance now he resolved that if anything unpleasant had occurred to drive her from the red house and launch her friendless on the world he would persuade her to marry him at once and elect him her protector and defence his fair face flushed with anticipation as he thought of the joy it would be to make her his wife and take her far away from everything that could annoy or harass her having arrived at the langham and flung a double fare to the cab driver he ran up the high staircase with the light step of a boy and dashed into harriets private room the girl was sitting much as she had done since returning from her interview with the doctor silent sullen and alone at war with heaven and destiny and all that had conduced to blight the brightest hopes she had ever had hally my darling why is this exclaimed pennell as he essayed to fold her in his arms but she pushed him off not unkindly but with considerable determination dont touch me tony dont come near me you had better not i might harm you what is the matter are you ill if so you know me too well to imagine that i should fear infection no no you do not understand replied harriet as she rose from her seat and edged further away from him but i am going to tell you all it is for that i sent for you then waving him from her with her hand she related the whole story to him what the baroness had accused her of and what doctor phillips had said in confirmation of it only that morning pennell had heard something of it before through margaret pullen but he had paid no attention to it and now when harriet repeated it in detail with swollen eyes and quivering lips he laughed the idea to scorn pooh nonsense i dont believe a word of it he exclaimed it is a parcel of old womans tales phillips should be ashamed of himself to place any credence in it far more to repeat it to you hally my darling you are surely not going to make yourself unhappy because of such nonsense if so you are not the sensible girl i have taken you for but tony said the girl still backing from his advances listen to me it is not all nonsense indeed i know for myself that it is true having been shut up for so many years in the convent dulled my memory for what went before it but it has all come back to me now it seems as if what madame gobelli and doctor phillips have said had lifted a veil from my eyes and i can recall things that had quite escaped my memory before i can remember now hearing old pete say that when i was born i was given to a black wet nurse and after a little while she was taken so ill they had to send her away and get me another and the next one died pete used to laugh and call me the pumas cub but i didnt know the meaning of it then and oh stop a moment tony till i have done there was a little white child i can see her so plainly now they called her little caroline i think she must have belonged to the planter who lived next to us and i was very fond of her i was quite unhappy when we did not meet and i used to creep into her nursery door and lie down in the cot beside her poor little caroline i can see her now so pale and thin and wan she was and one night i remember her mother came in and found me there and called to her husband to send the brandt bastard back to helvetia i had no idea what she meant but i cried because she sent me home and i asked pete what a bastard was but he would not tell me and went on harriet in a scared tone little caroline died pete carried me on his shoulder to see the funeral and i would not believe that caroline could be in the narrow box and i struck pete on the face for saying so well my darling and if you did are these childish reminiscences to come between our happiness why should they distress you hally madame gobellis insolence must have been very hard to bear i acknowledge that and i wish i had been by to prevent it but you must make excuses for her i suppose the poor creature was so mad with grief that she did not know what she was saying but you need never see her again so you must try to forgive her but anthony you do not understand me what the baroness said was true i see it now i killed bobby my dearest you are raving you killed bobby what utter utter folly how could you have killed bobby harriet passed her hand wearily across her brow as if she found it too hard to make her meaning plain oh yes i did we were always together in the garden or the house and he used to sit with his head on my shoulder and his arm round my waist i should not have allowed it i should have driven him away but he loved me poor bobby and it will be the same doctor phillips says with everybody i love i shall only do them harm hally i shall begin to think in another moment that you are ill yourself that you have a fever or something and that it is affecting your brain there was a sister at the convent sister theodosia who was very good to me when i first went there continued the girl in a dreamy voice as if she had not heard his words and she used to sit with me upon her lap for hours together because i was sad but she grew ill and they had to send her away up to the hill where they had their sanatorium that made the fourth in jamaica now i will not have you talk any more of this nonsense said pennell half annoyed by her perseverance and to prove to you what a little silly you are to imagine that everyone who falls ill or dies or who comes within the range of your acquaintance owes it to your influence tell me how it is that your father and mother who must have lived nearer to you than anybody else did not fall sick and die also my parents saw less of me than anybody replied harriet sadly they were ashamed of their bastard i suppose but old pete loved me and took me with him everywhere and he didnt get sick she concluded with a faint smile of course not see what rubbish you have been talking making yourself and me unhappy for nothing at all so now let me take you in my arms and kiss the remembrance of it away he was about to put his suggestion into execution but she still shrank from him no no indeed you must not it is all true i cannot forget olga brimont and mrs pullen and the baby and poor bobby it is true indeed it is and i have been accursed from my birth and she burst into a torrent of passionate tears pennell let her expend some of her emotion before he continued well and what is to be the upshot of it all i must part from you replied the girl indeed indeed i must i cannot injure you as i have done others doctor phillips said i was not fit for marriage that i should always weaken and hurt those whom i loved most and that i should draw from them physically and mentally until i had sapped all their strength that i have the blood of the vampire in me the vampire that sucks its victims breaths until they die doctor phillips be damned exclaimed pennell what right has he to promulgate his absurd and untenable theories and to poison the happiness of a girls life with his folly he is an old fool a dotard a senseless ass and i shall tell him so vampire be hanged and if it were the truth i for one could not wish for a sweeter death come along hally and try your venom upon me i am quite ready to run the risk he held out his arms to her again as he spoke and she sank on her knees beside him oh tony tony cannot you read the truth i love you dear i love you i never loved any creature in this world before i loved you i did not know that it was given to mortals to love so much and my love has opened my eyes sooner than injure you whom i would die to save from harm i will separate myself from you i will give you up i will live my lonely life without you i could do that but i can never never consent to sap your manhood and your brains which do not belong to me but to the world and see you wither like a poisoned plant the leaves of which lie discoloured and dead upon the garden path never in the course of their acquaintanceship had harriet brandt seemed so sweet so pathetic so unselfish to anthony pennell as then if he had resolved not to resign her from the first he did so a thousand times more now he threw his arms around her kneeling figure and lowered his head until it lay upon the crown of her dusky hair my darling my darling my own sweet girl he murmured our destinies are interwoven for ever no one and nothing shall come between us you cannot give me up unless you have my consent to doing so i hold your sacred promise to become my wife and i shall not release you from it but if i harmed you she said fearfully i do not believe in the possibility of your harming me he replied but if i am to die which is what i suppose you mean i claim my right to die in your arms but whenever it happens you will have neither hastened nor retarded it oh if i could only think so she murmured you must why cannot you trust my judgment as much as that of madame gobelli or old phillips a couple of mischief makers and now hally when shall it be when shall what be she whispered you know what i mean as well as i do when shall we be married we have no one to consult but ourselves i am my own master and you are alone in the world these things are very easily managed you know i have but to go to doctors commons for a special license to enable us to be married at a registrars office to morrow shall it be to morrow love oh no no i could not make up my mind so soon but why not would you live in this dull hotel all by yourself hally i do not know i am so very unhappy leave me anthony for gods sake leave me whilst there is time you do not know the risk you may be running by remaining by my side how can i consent to let you whom i love like my very life run any risk for my sake oh i love you i love you cried the impassioned girl as she clung tightly to him you are my lord and master and my king and i will never never be so selfish as to harm you for the sake of my own gratification you must go away put the seas between us never see me never write or speak to me more only save yourself my beloved save yourself he smiled compassionately as he would have smiled at the ravings of a child as he raised her from her lowly position and placed her in a chair do you know what i am going to do little woman he said cheerfully i am going to leave you all alone to think this matter over until to morrow by that time you will have been able to compare the opinions of two people who do not care a jot about you with those of mine who love you so dearly think well over what they have said to you and i have said to you and you have said to me remember that if you adhere to your present determination you will make both yourself and me most unhappy and do no one any good as for myself i venture to say that if i lose you my grief and disappointment will be so great that in all probability i shall never do any good work again but be a sensible girl make up your mind to marry me and give the lie to all this nonsense and ill write a book that will astonish the world come hally is it to be ruin or success for me ruin to spend my life without the only woman i have ever cared for or success to win my wife and a companion who will help me in my work and make my happiness complete he kissed her tear stained face several times and left her with a bright smile this time to morrow remember and i shall come with the licence in my pocket chapter xvii doctor phillips did not meet margaret and her husband until luncheon time and then they were full of an encounter which they had had during their morning walk only fancy doctor exclaimed margaret with more animation than she had displayed of late arthur and i have been shopping in regent street and whom do you think we met i give it up my dear replied the doctor helping himself to cold beef i am not good at guessing riddles ralph and elinor they had just come from some exhibition of pictures in new bond street and i never saw them so pleased with each other before ralph was looking actually spooney and elinor was positively radiant souvent femme varie quoted doctor phillips shrugging his shoulders oh but doctor it made arthur and me so glad to see them elinor is very fond of ralph you know although she has shewn it so little and so i have no doubt is he of her and there would never have been any unpleasantness between them if it had not been for that horrid girl harriet brandt it is not like you my dear margaret to condemn anyone without a hearing perhaps you have not heard the true case of miss harriet brandt although i am glad that ralph has disentangled himself from her i still believe that he behaved very badly to both the young ladies and whilst i am glad to hear that miss leyton smiles upon him again i think it is more than he deserves and i agree with you doctor interposed colonel pullen i have never seen this miss brandt but i know what a fool my brother is with women and can quite understand that he may have raised her hopes just to gratify his own vanity i have no patience with him well for miss leytons sake let us hope that this will be his last experience of dallying with forbidden pleasures but what will you say when i tell you that one of my visitors this morning has been the young lady in question miss brandt harriet brandt exclaimed margaret but why is she ill oh no her trouble is mental not physical she is not still hankering after ralph i hope you are afraid he might not be able to resist the bait so should i be but she did not mention captain pullen her distress was all about herself oh do tell me about it doctor if it is not a secret you know i have a kind of interest in harriet brandt when she does not interfere with the prospects of your family observed the doctor drily exactly so well then the poor girl is in great trouble and i had very little consolation to give her she has left madame gobellis house it seems that the old woman insulted her terribly and almost turned her out oh that awful baroness cried margaret it is only what might have been expected we heard dreadful stories about her at heyst she has an uncontrollable temper and when offended a most vituperative tongue her ill breeding is apparent at all times but it must be overwhelming when she is angry but how did she insult miss brandt you remember what i told you of the girls antecedents it appears that the baroness must have got hold of the same story for she cast it in her teeth accusing her moreover of having caused the death of her son madame gobellis son what bobby oh you do not mean to say that bobby is dead yes there was but one son i think he died yesterday as i understood miss brandt and the mother in her rage and grief turned upon the poor girl and told her such bitter truths that she rushed from the house at once her visit to me this morning was paid in order to ascertain if such things were true as the baroness very unjustifiably i think had referred her to me for confirmation and what did you tell her what could i tell her at first i declined to give an opinion but she put such pertinent questions to me that unless i had lied i saw no way of getting out of it i glossed over matters as well as i could but even so they were bad enough but i impressed it upon her that she must not think of marrying i thought it the best way to put all idea of catching captain pullen out of her mind let him once get safely married and she can decide for herself with regard to the next but at all hazards we must keep ralph out of her way for between you and me and the post she is a young woman whom most men would find it difficult to resist oh yes she and ralph must not meet again said margaret dreamingly her thoughts had wandered back to bobby and heyst and all the trouble she had encountered whilst there what despair had attacked her when she lost her only child and now madame gobelli the woman she so much disliked had lost her only child also poor madame gobelli she ejaculated i cannot help thinking of her fancy bobby being dead and she used to make him so unhappy and humiliate him before strangers how she must be suffering for it now how it must all come back upon her poor bobby elinor will be sorry to hear that he is gone she used to pity him so and often gave him fruit and cakes fancy his being dead i cannot believe it it is true nevertheless but it is the common lot margaret perhaps as his mother used to treat him so roughly the poor lad is better off where he is oh of course i have no doubt of that but he was all she had like me said margaret with her eyes over brimming her husband put his arms round her and let her have her cry out on his shoulder then as he wiped her tears away she whispered arthur i should like to go and see her the baroness i mean i can sympathise so truly with her i might be able to say a few words of comfort do as you like my darling replied colonel pullen that is if you are sure that the woman wont insult you as she did miss brandt oh no no i am not in the least afraid why should she i shall only tell her how much i feel for her own our common loss she could not proceed and the doctor whispered to the colonel let her do as she wishes the best salve for our own wounds is to try and heal those of others margaret rose and prepared to leave the room i shall go at once she said i suppose there is no chance of my meeting harriet brandt there i think not she told me she had left the red house for good and all but she did not say where she was staying though after all i think she is in most want of comfort of the two oh no replied margaret faintly there is no grief like that of of she did not finish her sentence but left the room hastily in order to assume her walking things will she ever get over the loss of her child demanded colonel pullen gloomily the doctor regarded him with a half amused surprise my dear fellow though it is useless to preach the doctrine to a bereaved mother the loss of an innocent baby is perhaps the least trying in the category of human ills to rear the child as thousands do to be unloving or unsympathetic or ungrateful is a thousand times worse but it is too soon for your dear wife to acknowledge it let her go to this other mother and let them cry together it will do her all the good in the world and the doctor having finished his luncheon put on his top coat and prepared to make a round of professional calls margaret came back ready for her visit i shall not offer to go with you darling said the colonel because my presence would only be inconvenient but mind you keep the cab waiting or you may find some difficulty in getting another in that district what address shall i give the driver first to our florist in regent street that i may get some white flowers in another minute she was off and in about an hour afterwards she found herself outside the red house which looked gloomier than ever with all the blinds drawn down margaret rang the front door bell which was answered by miss wynward can i see madame gobelli commenced margaret i have just heard the sad news and came to condole with her miss wynward let her into the hall and ushered her into a side room you will excuse my asking if you are a friend of her ladyships she said i can hardly call myself a friend replied margaret but i stayed with her in the same hotel at heyst last summer and i knew the dear boy who is dead i was most grieved to hear of his death and naturally anxious to enquire after the baroness but if she is too upset to see me of course i would not think of forcing my presence upon her i dont think her ladyship would object to receiving any friend but i am not sure if she would recognise you not recognise me it is not three months since we parted you do not understand me our dear boys death was so sudden i have been with him since he was five years old so you will forgive my mentioning him in such a fashion that it has had a terrible effect upon his poor mother in fact she is paralysed the medical men think the paralysis is confined to the lower limbs but at present they are unable to decide definitely as the baroness has not opened her lips since the event occurred oh poor madame gobelli cried margaret tearfully i felt sure she loved him under all her apparent roughness and indifference yes i have been with them so long that i know her manner amounted at times to cruelty but she did not mean it to be so she thought to make him hardy and independent instead of which it had just the opposite effect but she is paying bitterly for it now i really think his death will kill her though the doctors laugh at my fears i i too have lost my only child my precious little baby replied margaret encouraged by the sympathetic tenderness in the other womans eyes and i thought also at first that i must die that i could not live without her but god is so good and there is such comfort in the thought that whatever we may suffer our darlings have missed all the bitterness and sin and disappointments of this world that at last that is sometimes one feels almost thankful that they are safe with him ah madame gobelli has not your hope and trust madam said miss wynward if she had she would be a better and happier woman but i must tell you that she is in the same room as bobby she will not be moved from there but lies on the couch where we placed her when she fell stricken with the paralysis gazing at the corpse poor dear woman exclaimed margaret perhaps you would hardly care to go into that room oh i should like it i want to see the dear boy again i have brought some flowers to put over him then what name shall i tell her ladyship mrs pullen say margaret pullen whose little baby died at heyst then i think she will remember will you take a seat mrs pullen whilst i go upstairs and see if i can persuade her to receive you margaret sat down and miss wynward went up to the chamber which had once been bobbys on the bed was stretched the body of the dead boy whilst opposite to it lay on a couch a woman with dry eyes but palsied limbs staring staring without intermission at the silent figure which had once contained the spirit of her son she did not turn her head as miss wynward entered the room my lady she said going up to her mrs pullen is downstairs and would like to see you she told me to say that she is margaret pullen whose baby died in heyst last summer and she knew bobby and has brought some flowers to strew over his bed may she came up but she received no answer madame gobellis features were working but that was the only sign of life which she gave mrs pullen is so very sorry for your loss miss wynward went on she cried when she spoke of it and as she has suffered the same i am sure she will sympathise with you may i say that you will see her still there was no response and miss wynward went down again to margaret i think you had better come up without waiting for her consent she said if seeing you roused her even to anger it would do her good do you mind making the attempt no replied margaret but if the baroness gets very angry you must let me run away again i am quite unequal to standing anything like a scene you will have but to quit the room whatever her ladyship may say she cannot move from her couch she attacked poor miss brandt most unwarrantably last evening but that was in the first frenzy of her grief she is quite different now poor woman again ejaculated margaret as she followed miss wynward not without some inward qualms to the presence of madame gobelli but when she caught sight of the immovable figure on the couch all her fear and resentment left her overcome by a mighty compassion she went straight up to the baroness and bending down tenderly kissed her twitching face dear madame she said i am we all are so truly sorry for your grievous loss it reminds me of the bitter time not so long ago you may remember when i lost my darling little ethel and thought for the while that my life was over it is so hard so unnatural to us poor mothers to see our children go before ourselves i can weep with you tear for tear but do remember try to remember that he is safe that though you remain here with empty arms for a while death can no more take your boy from you than a veil over your face can take gods light from you he is there dear madame gobelli just in the next room with the door closed between you and though i know full well how bitter it is to see the door closed think of the time when it will open again when you and i will spring through it and find not only our dear bobby and ethel but christ our lord ready to give them back into our arms again the baroness said nothing but two tears gathered in her eyes and rolled down her flabby cheeks margaret turned from her for a minute and walking up to the bed knelt down beside it in prayer dear christ she said thou who knowest what our mothers hearts are called upon to bear have pity on us and give us thy peace and open our eyes that we may gather strength to realise what our dear children have escaped by being taken home to thee the sin the trouble the anxiety the disappointment and make us thankful to bear them in their stead and give us grace to look forward to our happy meeting and reunion in the better land then she rose and bent over the dead boy dear bobby she murmured as she kissed the cold brow and placed the white blossoms in his hands and round his head good bye i know how happy you must be now in company with the spirits of all those whom we have loved and who have gone home before us how grateful you must feel to the dear redeemer who has called you so early but dont forget your poor mother upon earth pray for her bobby never cease to ask our dear lord to send her comfort and peace and joy in believing for his own dear sake amen when she turned again the baronesss cheeks were wet with tears and she was stretching forth her arms towards her oh she gasped as margaret reached her side i am a godless woman i am a godless woman no no my dear friend we are none of us godless replied margaret we may think we are but god knows better we may forsake him but he never forsakes us we should never be saved if we waited till we wanted to be so it is he who wants us that is our great safeguard he wanted our two dear children not to spite us but to draw us after them try to look at it in that light and then bobbys death will prove your greatest gain i am a godless woman repeated the baroness and this is my punishment pointing to the bed i loved him best of all my eart is broken so much the better if it was a hard heart rejoined margaret smiling who was it that said if your heart is broken give the pieces to christ and he will mend it again never think of bobby dear madame gobelli except as with christ walking with him talking with him learning of him and growing in grace and the love of god daily never disassociate the two memories and in a little while you would hate yourself if you could separate them again god bless you i must go back to my husband now you will come again said the baroness i am afraid i shall have no time we sail for india on saturday but i shall not forget you good bye bobby she repeated with a last look at the corpse remember your mother and me in your prayers as miss wynward let her out of the red house she remarked i could never have believed that anyone could have had so much influence over her ladyship as you have mrs pullen i hope you will come again i shall not be able to do so but madame gobelli will have you to talk to her you live here altogether do you not i have lived here for many years but i am on the point of leaving bobby was my only tie to the red house or i should have gone long ago but now that the baroness is so helpless surely you will delay your departure until she no longer needs you i shall not leave her until she has secured a better woman in my stead but to tell you the truth i am going to be married mrs pullen and i consider my first duty is towards my future husband and his parents who are very old oh doubtless may i ask his name captain hill he lives in the next house to this stevenage you are surprised perhaps that a man who has been in the army should marry a poor governess like myself that is his goodness i know that i am worn and faded and no longer young thirty three on my last birthday but he is good enough to care for me all the more for the troubles i have passed through mine has been a chequered life mrs pullen but i have told captain hill everything and he still wishes to make me his wife i ought to be a happy woman for the future ought i not indeed yes said margaret heartily and i sincerely hope that you may be so but i cant help thinking of poor madame gobelli is the baron good to her pretty well answered miss wynward but he is very stolid and unsympathetic it is strange to think that her heart must have been bound up in that boy and yet at times she was positively cruel to him it has all been permitted for some good purpose said margaret as she bade her farewell perhaps her remorse and self accusation are the only things which would have brought her down upon her knees she returned home considerably saddened by what she had seen but in three days she was to accompany her husband to india and in the bustle of preparation and the joy of knowing that she was not to be separated from him again her heart was comforted and at peace never once during that time did she give one thought to harriet brandt miss wynward had hardly mentioned her name and no one seemed to know where she had gone the girl had passed out of their lives altogether margaret only regretted one thing in leaving england that she had not seen anthony pennell again colonel pullen had called twice at his chambers but had each time found him from home margaret wanted to put in a good word for the baroness with him she thought perhaps that he might see her after a while and speak a few words of comfort to her but she was obliged to be content with writing her wishes in a farewell letter she little knew how hardened anthony pennell felt at that moment against anyone who had treated the woman he loved in so harsh a manner harriet brandt spent the time after her lover had left her to think over and decide upon their mutual fate in walking up and down the room she was like a restless animal she could not stay two moments in the same place even when night fell and the inhabitants of the langham hotel had retired to rest she still kept pacing up and down the room without thinking of undressing herself or seeking repose whilst her conscience wrestled in warfare with her inclinations her thoughts took her far far back to the earliest remembrance of which her mind was capable she thought of her hard unfeeling indifferent father of her gross flabby sensual mother and shuddered at the remembrance what had she done she said to herself wherein had she sinned that she should have been cursed with such progenitors how had they dared to bring her into the world an innocent yet hapless child of sin the inheritor of their evil propensities of their lust their cruelty their sensuality their gluttony and worst of all the fatal heritage that made her a terror and a curse to her fellow creatures how dared they how dared they why had gods vengeance not fallen upon them before they had completed their cruel work or having accomplished it why did he not let her perish with them so that the awful power with which they had imbued her might have been prevented from harming others harriet thought of little caroline of her two nurses of sister theodosia of mrs pullens baby of bobby bates until she felt as though she should go mad no no she would never bring that curse upon her beloved he must go far away he must never see her again or else she would destroy herself in order that he might escape but if she persuaded anthony to consent to her wishes if she insisted upon a total separation between them what would become of her what should she do she had no friends in england madame gobelli had turned against her she was all alone she would live and die alone how should she ever get to know people or to obtain an entrance to society she would be a pariah to the end of her life and if she did surmount all these obstacles what would be the result except a repetition of what had gone before strangers would come to know her to like her would grow more intimate and she would respond to their kindness with the same result they would droop and fail die perhaps like bobby and the baby find out that she was the cause and shun her ever after oh god cried harriet in her perplexity and anguish i am accursed my parents have made me not fit to live she passed that night through the agonies of death not the death that overtakes the believer in a god and a future but the darkness and uncertainty that enwraps the man who knows he is full of sin and yet has no knowledge that his lord has paid his debt to the uttermost farthing the doubt and anxiety that beset the unbeliever when he is called upon to enter the dark valley the poor child saw her destiny entangling her as in a net she longed to break through it but saw no means of escape and she rebelled against the cruel lot that heredity had marked out for her why am i to suffer she exclaimed aloud i have youth and health and good looks and money everything the world would say calculated to make my life a pleasant one and yet i am tortured by this awful thought that i must keep aloof from everybody that i am a social leper full of contagion and death doctor phillips said that the more i loved a person the more i must keep away from him it is incredible unheard of could he have had any motive in saying such a thing the remembrance of her flirtation with ralph pullen recurred to her mind and she seized it as a drowning man clutches at a straw was it a plant after all did the old man want to put me off the track of captain pullen margaret pullen is staying in the house he said so had she asked him to get rid of me if possible after all am i torturing myself by believing the story of my fatal power to be true when it was only a ruse to get rid of me the baroness said the same thing but she was mad about poor bobby and would have said anything to annoy me and after all what does it amount to the baby died in teething heaps of babies do and bobby was consumptive from the first i have heard miss wynward say so and would have died anyway as he grew to be a man and had larger demands made upon his physical strength and for the others what happened to them happens to all the world it is fortune de guerre people drop every day like rotten sheep everyone might accuse himself of causing the death of his neighbour i have been frightening myself with a chimera anthony said so and he must know better than i and i cant give up tony i cant i cant i cant it is of no use thinking of it besides he wouldnt let me he would never leave me alone until i had consented to marry him so i may as well do it at the first as at the last but the tide of triumphant feeling would be succeeded by a wave of despondency which threatened to upset all her casuistry but if if it should be true and anthony should should oh god oh god i dare not think of it i will kill myself before it shall occur when the morning dawned it found her quite undecided lamenting her unfortunate fate one instant and declaring that she could never give up her lover the next she tore off her clothes and took a cold bath and re robed herself but she was looking utterly ill and exhausted when pennell burst in upon her at eleven oclock well darling he exclaimed and have you made up your mind by this time which death am i to die suffocated in your dear embrace or left to perish of cold and hunger outside o tony she cried throwing herself into his arms i dont know what to say i have not closed my eyes all night trying to decide what will be for the best and i am as far off as ever only i can never never consent to do anything that shall work you harm then i shall decide for you exclaimed her lover and that is that you make me and yourself happy and forget all the rubbish these people have been telling you depend upon it whatever they may have said was for their own gratification and not yours and that they would be quick enough to accept the lot that lies before you were it in their power i have been so lonely and friendless all my life said harriet sobbing in his arms and i have longed for love and sympathy so much and now that they have come to me it is hard oh so hard to have to give them up so hard hally for me remember as well as yourself that we will not make the attempt now i want you to place yourself in my hands and start for paris to night to night she cried lifting such a flushed startled happy face from his breast that he had no alternative but to kiss it again yes to night what did i tell you yesterday that i should come with the ring and the license in my pocket i am as good as my word and better for i have given notice to the registrar of marriages in my district that he is to be ready for us at twelve oclock to day am i not a good manager tony tony but i have not made up my mind i have made it up for you and i will take no refusal i have calculated it all to a nicety married at twelve back here at one for lunch a couple of hours to pack up and off by the four oclock train for dover sleep at the castle warden and cross to morrow to paris how will that do mrs pennell eh oh ought i to do it ought i to do it exclaimed harriet with a look of despair if you dont ill shoot myself i swear it no no darling dont say that it is of you alone that i am thinking god forgive me if i am doing wrong but i feel that i cannot refuse you take me and do with me as you think best after which it came to pass that mr and mrs anthony pennell started in very high spirits for dover by the four oclock train that afternoon chapter xviii a fortnight afterwards the married couple found themselves at nice much as has been said and sung of the lune de miel none ever surpassed if it ever reached this one in happiness harriet passed the time in a silent ecstasy of delight her cup of bliss was filled to overflowing her satisfaction was too deep for words to this girl for whom the world had been seen as yet only through the barred windows of a convent who had never enjoyed the society of an intellectual companion before who had viewed no scenery but that of the island seen no records of the past and visited no foreign capital the first weeks of her married life were a panorama of novelties her days one long astonishment and delight she could not adore anthony pennell sufficiently for having afforded her the opportunity of seeing all this and more especially of feeling it the presents he lavished upon her were as nothing in her eyes compared to the lover like attentions he paid her the bouquets of flowers he brought her every morning the glass of lemonade or milk he had ready to supply her need when they were taking their excursions the warm shawl or mantle he carried on his arm in the evenings lest the air should become too chilly for her delicate frame after sunset money harriet had no need of but love love she had thirsted for as the hart thirsts for the water streams yet had never imagined it could be poured out at her feet as her husband poured it now and pennell on the other hand though he had been much sought after and flattered by the fair sex for the sake of the fame he had acquired and the money he made had never lost his heart to any woman as he had done to his little unknown wife he had never met anyone like hally before she combined the intelligence of the englishwoman with the espiglerie of the french the devotion of the creole with the fiery passion of the spanish or italian he could conceive her quite capable of dying silently and uncomplainingly for him or anyone she loved or on the other hand stabbing her lover without remorse if roused by jealousy or insult he was hourly discovering new traits in her character which delighted him because they were so utterly unlike any possessed by the women of the world with whom he had hitherto associated he felt as though he had captured some beautiful wild creature and was taming it for his own pleasure harriet would sit for hours at a time in profound silence contemplating his features or watching his actions crouched on the floor at his feet until he was fain to lay down his book or writing and take to fondling her instead she was an ever constant joy to him he felt it would be impossible to do anything to displease her so long as he loved her that like the patient griselda she would submit to any injustice and meekly call it justice if from his hand and yet he knew all the while that the savage in her was not tamed that at any moment like the domesticated lion or tiger her nature might assert itself and become furious wild and intractable it was the very uncertainty that pleased him men love the women of whom they are not quite certain all the more from nice they wandered to mentone but the proximity of the monte carlo tables had no charm for anthony pennell he was not a speculative man his brain was filled with better things and he only visited such places for the sake of reproduction although the autumn was now far advanced the air of mentone was too enervating to suit either of them and pennell proposed that they should move on to italy i must show you venice and rome before we return home hally he said and when i come to think of it why should we return to england at all just yet why not winter in rome richards is always advising me to take a good long holiday he says i overwork my brain and it reacts upon my body what better opportunity could we find to adopt his advice hitherto i have pooh poohed the idea wandering over a foreign country in solitary grandeur held no charms for me but with you my darling to double the pleasure of everything any place assumes the appearance of paradise what do you say little wife shall we set up our tent south until the spring dont you feel well tony asked harriet anxiously never better in my life dear i am afraid you will not make an interesting invalid out of me i am as fit as a fiddle but i fancy my next novel will deal with italy and i should like to make a few notes of the spots i may require to introduce it is nothing to take me away from you darling we will inspect the old places together and your quick eye and clear brain shall help me in my researches is it a settled thing hally o yes darling she replied anywhere with you the only place i shall ever object to will be the one where i cannot go with you that place does not exist on this earth hally said pennell but if you are willing we may as well start to morrow for if we leave it till too late we shall find all the best winter quarters pre engaged he left the room as she thought rather hurriedly but as he gained the hotel corridor he slightly staggered and leaned against the wall he had told his wife that he was quite well but he knew it was not the truth he had felt weak and enervated ever since coming to mentone but he ascribed it to the soft mild atmosphere confound this dizziness he said inwardly as the corridor swam before his eyes i think my liver must be out of order and yet i have been taking plenty of exercise it must be this mild moist air heat never did agree with me i shall be glad to get on we shall find florence cold by comparison he descended to the bureau and announced his intention of giving up his rooms on the morrow and then ordered a carriage and returned to take hally out for a drive in florence they procured rooms in a grand old palazzo furnished with rococo chairs and tables placed upon marble floors harriet was charmed and astonished by the ease with which they got everything en route as though they possessed aladins lamp she told pennell and had but to wish to obtain ah hally said her husband we have something better than the genies lamp we have money that is the true magician in this century i am very thankful that you have a fortune of your own my dearest because i know that whatever happens my girl will be able to hold her own with the world harriet grew pale what could happen she stammered my silly little goose are we immortal he replied i make a first rate income my dear but have not laid by enough as yet to leave you more than comfortably off but with your own money dont speak of it pray dont speak of it she exclaimed with ashen lips and noting her distress pennell changed the subject you are a lucky little woman he continued i wonder what some people would give to possess your income poor margaret pullen for instance why mrs pullen in particular tony are they poor not whilst colonel pullen is on active service but he has nothing but his pay to depend upon and whilst he can work he must which means a residence in india and perhaps separation from his wife and children if he should lose his health a compulsory retirement and if he keeps it toiling out there till old age and then coming home to spin out the remainder of his life on an inadequate pension a man who accepts service in india should make up his mind to live and die in the country but so many accidents may prevent it and at the best it means banishment from england and all ones friends and relations poor margaret feels that severely i am sure has mrs pullen many relations then she has a mother still living and several brothers and sisters besides her husbands family what a sweet gentle woman she is she was kind to you hally was she not whilst you were abroad by mutual agreement they never spoke of heyst or the red house or anything which was associated with what pennell called his wifes infatuation regarding herself yes she was very kind at first replied harriet until until it all happened and they went to england oh do not let us talk of it she broke off suddenly no we will not have you unpacked your mandoline yet hally fetch it dear and let me hear your lovely voice again i shall get you to sing to me when i am in the vein for composing you would bring me all sorts of beautiful ideas and phantasies should i should i exclaimed the girl joyfully oh how lovely i should do a part of your work then shouldnt i tony i should inspire you why i would sing day and night for that no no my bird i would not let you tire yourself a few notes now and then they will help me more than enough i must draw from you for my next heroine hally i could not have a fairer model oh tony she rushed to him in the extremity of her delight and hid her face upon his breast i am not good enough not pretty enough your heroines should be perfect i dont think so i prefer them to be of flesh and blood like you he stooped his head and kissed her passionately hally hally he whispered you draw my very life away the girl got up suddenly almost roughly and walked into the next room to fetch her mandoline no no she cried to herself with a cold fear not that my god not that but when she returned with the instrument she did not revert to the subject but played and sang as usual to her husbands admiration and delight they did florence very thoroughly during the first week of their stay there and were both completely tired i must really stay at home to morrow cried hally one afternoon on returning to dinner tony i am regularly fagged out i feel as if i had a corn upon every toe so do i replied her husband and i cannot have my darling knocked up by fatigue we will be lazy to morrow hally and lie on two sofas and read our books all day i have been thinking for the last few days that we have been going a little too fast let me see child how long have we been married six weeks to morrow she answered glibly bless my soul we are quite an old married couple a species of darby and joan and have you been happy hally the tears of excitement rushed into her dark eyes happy that is no word for what i have been tony i have been in heaven in heaven all the while and so have i rejoined her husband i met some nuns whilst i was out this morning continued hally the sisters of the annunciation and they stopped and spoke to me and were so pleased to hear that i had been brought up in a convent and have you no vocation my child asked one of them yes sister i replied i have a big strong handsome vocation called my husband they looked quite shocked poor dears at first but i gave them a subscription for their orphan schools one hundred francs and they were so pleased they said if i was sick whilst in florence i must send for one of them and she would come and nurse me i gave it as a thanksgiving tony a thanksgiving offering because i am so very happy i am not a good woman like margaret pullen i know that but i love you i love you who said that you were not a good woman asked pennell as he drew her fondly to his side and kissed away the tears that hung on her dark lashes oh i know i am not besides you once said that margaret pullen was the best woman you had ever known i think she is very sweet and unselfish replied pennell musingly she felt the loss of her infant terribly doctor phillips told me but the way in which she struggled to subdue her grief in order not to distress others was wonderful poor margaret how she mourns little ethel to this day dont dont cried harriet in a stifled voice i cannot bear to think of it my darling it had nothing to do with you i have told you so a thousand times yes yes i know you have but i loved the little darling it is dreadful to me to think that she is mouldering in the grave come child you will be hysterical if you indulge in any more reminiscences suppose we go for a stroll through the ghetto or some other antiquated part of florence or shall we take a drive into the country i am at your commands madam a drive darling then a drive whispered his wife as she left him to get ready for the excursion it was three hours before they returned to their rooms in the old palazzo harriet was dull and somewhat silent and anthony confessed to a headache i am not quite sure now he said as they were dining whether a trip to australia or america would not do us both more good than lingering about these mild warm places i think our constitutions both require bracing rather than coddling australia is a grand young country i have often contemplated paying her a visit what would you say to it hally i should enjoy it as much as yourself tony you so often have a headache now i think the drainage of these southern towns must be defective oh shocking they are famous for typhoid and malarial fevers they are not drained at all dont let us stay here long then what should i do if you were to fall ill you are far more liable to fall sick of the two my darling returned her husband i do not think your beautiful little body has much strength to sustain it and then what should i do ah neither of us could do without the other tony of course we couldnt and so we will provide against such a contingency by moving on before our systems get saturated with miasma and mistral will you sing to me to night hally not unless you very much wish it i am a little tired i feel as if i couldnt throw any expression into my songs to night then come here and sit down on the sofa beside me and let us talk she did as he desired but pennell was too sleepy to talk in five minutes he had fallen fast asleep and it was with difficulty she could persuade him to abandon the couch and drag his weary limbs up to bed where he threw himself down in a profound slumber harriet was also tired her husband was breathing heavily as she slipped into her place beside him his arm was thrown out over her pillow as though he feared she might go to sleep without remembering to wish him good night she bent over him and kissed him passionately on the lips good night my beloved she whispered sleep well and wake in happiness she kissed the big hand too that lay upon her pillow and composed herself to sleep while it still encircled her the dawn is early in florence but it had broken for some time before she roused herself again the sun was streaming brightly into the long narrow uncurtained windows and everything it lighted on was touched with a molten glory harriet started up in bed her husbands arm was still beneath her body oh my poor darling she exclaimed as though the fault were her own how cramped he must be how soundly we must have slept not to have once moved through the night she raised tonys arm and commenced to chafe it how strangely heavy and cold it felt why he was cold all over she drew up the bedclothes and tucked them in around his chin then for the first time she looked at his face his eyes were open tony tony she exclaimed are you making fun of me have you been awake all the time she bent over his face laughingly and pressed a kiss upon his cheek how stiff it felt my god what was the matter could he have fainted she leapt from the bed and running to her husbands side pulled down the bedclothes again and placed her hand upon his heart the body was cold cold and still all over his eyes were glazed and dull his mouth was slightly open in one awful moment she knew the truth tony was dead she stood for some moments some hours some months she could not have reckoned the time silent and motionless trying to realise what had occurred then as it came upon her like a resistless flood which she could not stem nor escape harriet gave one fearful shriek which brought the servants hurrying upstairs to know what could be the matter i have killed my husband i have killed him it was i myself who did it was all that she would say of course they did not believe her they accepted the unmeaning words as part of their mistresss frenzy at her sudden and unexpected loss they saw what had happened and they ran breathlessly for a doctor who confirmed their worst fears the signor was dead the old palazzo became like a disturbed ant hill the servants ran hither and thither unknowing how to act whilst the mistress sat by the bedside with staring tearless eyes holding the hand of her dead husband but there were a dozen things to be done half a hundred orders to be issued death in florence is quickly followed by burial the law does not permit a mourner to lament his dead for more than four and twenty hours but the signora would give no orders for the funeral nor answer any questions put to her she had no friends in florence for ought they knew she had no money what were they to do at last one of them thought of the neighbouring convent of the annunciation and ran to implore one of the good sisters to come to their mistress in her extremity shortly afterwards sister angelica entered the bedroom where harriet sat murmuring at intervals it is i who have killed him and attempted to administer comfort to the young mourner but her words and prayers had no effect upon harriet her brain could hold but one idea she had killed tony doctor phillips was right it was she who had killed margaret pullens baby and bobby bates and to look further back little caroline and now now her tony the light of her life the passion of her being the essence of all her joy her hope for this world and the next she had killed him she who worshipped him whose pride was bound up in him who was to have helped him and comforted him and waited on him all his life she had killed him her dry lips refused to say the words distinctly but they kept revolving in her brain until they dazed and wearied her the little sister stood by her and held her hand as the professional assistants entered the death chamber and arranged and straightened the body for the grave finally placing it in a coffin and carrying it away to a mortuary where it would have to remain until buried on the morrow but harriet made no resistance to the ceremony and no sign she did not even say good bye as tony was carried from her sight for ever sister angelica talked to her of the glorious heaven where they must hope that her dear husband would be translated of the peace and happiness he would enjoy of the reunion which awaited them when her term of life was also past she pressed her to make the convent her refuge until the first agony of her loss was overcome reminded her of the peace and rest she would encounter within the cloisters and how the whole fraternity would unite in praying for the soul of her beloved that he might speedily obtain the remission of his sins and an entrance into the beatific presence harriet listened dully and at last in order to get rid of her well intentioned but rather wearisome consoler she promised to do all that she wished let the sister return to the convent for the present and on the morrow if she would come for her at the same time she might take her back with her she wanted rest and peace she would be thankful for them poor harriet said only to night this one night more she wished to be alone so the good little sister went away rejoicing that she had succeeded in her errand of mercy and looking forward to bearing the poor young widow to the convent on the morrow there to learn the true secret of earthly happiness when she had gone and the old palazzo was quiet and empty the bewildered girl rose to her feet and tried to steady her shaking limbs sufficiently to write what seemed to be a letter but was in reality a will i leave all that i possess so it ran to margaret pullen the wife of colonel arthur pullen the best woman tony said that he had ever met and i beg her to accept it in return for the kindness she showed to me when i went to heyst a stranger signed harriet pennell she put the paper into an envelope and as soon as the morning had dawned she asked her servant lorenzo to show her the way to the nearest notary in whose presence she signed the document and directed him to whom it should be sent in case of her own death and after another visit to a pharmacien she returned to the palazzo and took up her watch again in the now deserted bedchamber her servants brought her refreshments and pressed her to eat without effect all she desired she told them was to be left alone until the sister came for her in the afternoon sister angelica arrived true to her appointment and went at once to the bedchamber to her surprise she found harriet lying on the bed just where the corpse of anthony pennell had lain and apparently asleep pauvre enfant thought the kind hearted nun grief has exhausted her i should not have attended to her request but have watched with her through the night eh donc ma pauvre she continued gently touching the girl on the shoulder levez vous je suis l but there was no awakening on this earth for harriet pennell she had taken an overdose of chloral and joined her husband when margaret pullen received the will which harriet had left behind her she found these words with it scribbled in a very trembling hand upon a scrap of paper do not think more unkindly of me than you can help my parents have made me unfit to live let me go to a world where the curse of heredity which they laid upon me may be mercifully wiped out the end printing office of the publisher november
