transcribed from charles scribners sons works of charles dickens edition by david price email ccxpglaforg the chimes a goblin story of some bells that rang an old year out and a new year in chapter ifirst quarter there are not many peopleand as it is desirable that a story teller and a story reader should establish a mutual understanding as soon as possible i beg it to be noticed that i confine this observation neither to young people nor to little people but extend it to all conditions of people little and big young and old yet growing up or already growing down againthere are not i say many people who would care to sleep in a church i dont mean at sermon time in warm weather when the thing has actually been done once or twice but in the night and alone a great multitude of persons will be violently astonished i know by this position in the broad bold day but it applies to night it must be argued by night and i will undertake to maintain it successfully on any gusty winters night appointed for the purpose with any one opponent chosen from the rest who will meet me singly in an old churchyard before an old church door and will previously empower me to lock him in if needful to his satisfaction until morning for the night wind has a dismal trick of wandering round and round a building of that sort and moaning as it goes and of trying with its unseen hand the windows and the doors and seeking out some crevices by which to enter and when it has got in as one not finding what it seeks whatever that may be it wails and howls to issue forth again and not content with stalking through the aisles and gliding round and round the pillars and tempting the deep organ soars up to the roof and strives to rend the rafters then flings itself despairingly upon the stones below and passes muttering into the vaults anon it comes up stealthily and creeps along the walls seeming to read in whispers the inscriptions sacred to the dead at some of these it breaks out shrilly as with laughter and at others moans and cries as if it were lamenting it has a ghostly sound too lingering within the altar where it seems to chaunt in its wild way of wrong and murder done and false gods worshipped in defiance of the tables of the law which look so fair and smooth but are so flawed and broken ugh heaven preserve us sitting snugly round the fire it has an awful voice that wind at midnight singing in a church but high up in the steeple there the foul blast roars and whistles high up in the steeple where it is free to come and go through many an airy arch and loophole and to twist and twine itself about the giddy stair and twirl the groaning weathercock and make the very tower shake and shiver high up in the steeple where the belfry is and iron rails are ragged with rust and sheets of lead and copper shrivelled by the changing weather crackle and heave beneath the unaccustomed tread and birds stuff shabby nests into corners of old oaken joists and beams and dust grows old and grey and speckled spiders indolent and fat with long security swing idly to and fro in the vibration of the bells and never loose their hold upon their thread spun castles in the air or climb up sailor like in quick alarm or drop upon the ground and ply a score of nimble legs to save one life high up in the steeple of an old church far above the light and murmur of the town and far below the flying clouds that shadow it is the wild and dreary place at night and high up in the steeple of an old church dwelt the chimes i tell of they were old chimes trust me centuries ago these bells had been baptized by bishops so many centuries ago that the register of their baptism was lost long long before the memory of man and no one knew their names they had had their godfathers and godmothers these bells for my own part by the way i would rather incur the responsibility of being godfather to a bell than a boy and had their silver mugs no doubt besides but time had mowed down their sponsors and henry the eighth had melted down their mugs and they now hung nameless and mugless in the church tower not speechless though far from it they had clear loud lusty sounding voices had these bells and far and wide they might be heard upon the wind much too sturdy chimes were they to be dependent on the pleasure of the wind moreover for fighting gallantly against it when it took an adverse whim they would pour their cheerful notes into a listening ear right royally and bent on being heard on stormy nights by some poor mother watching a sick child or some lone wife whose husband was at sea they had been sometimes known to beat a blustering nor wester aye all to fits as toby veck saidfor though they chose to call him trotty veck his name was toby and nobody could make it anything else either except tobias without a special act of parliament he having been as lawfully christened in his day as the bells had been in theirs though with not quite so much of solemnity or public rejoicing for my part i confess myself of toby vecks belief for i am sure he had opportunities enough of forming a correct one and whatever toby veck said i say and i take my stand by toby veck although he did stand all day long and weary work it was just outside the church door in fact he was a ticket porter toby veck and waited there for jobs and a breezy goose skinned blue nosed red eyed stony toed tooth chattering place it was to wait in in the winter time as toby veck well knew the wind came tearing round the cornerespecially the east windas if it had sallied forth express from the confines of the earth to have a blow at toby and oftentimes it seemed to come upon him sooner than it had expected for bouncing round the corner and passing toby it would suddenly wheel round again as if it cried why here he is incontinently his little white apron would be caught up over his head like a naughty boys garments and his feeble little cane would be seen to wrestle and struggle unavailingly in his hand and his legs would undergo tremendous agitation and toby himself all aslant and facing now in this direction now in that would be so banged and buffeted and touzled and worried and hustled and lifted off his feet as to render it a state of things but one degree removed from a positive miracle that he wasnt carried up bodily into the air as a colony of frogs or snails or other very portable creatures sometimes are and rained down again to the great astonishment of the natives on some strange corner of the world where ticket porters are unknown but windy weather in spite of its using him so roughly was after all a sort of holiday for toby thats the fact he didnt seem to wait so long for a sixpence in the wind as at other times the having to fight with that boisterous element took off his attention and quite freshened him up when he was getting hungry and low spirited a hard frost too or a fall of snow was an event and it seemed to do him good somehow or otherit would have been hard to say in what respect though toby so wind and frost and snow and perhaps a good stiff storm of hail were toby vecks red letter days wet weather was the worst the cold damp clammy wet that wrapped him up like a moist great coatthe only kind of great coat toby owned or could have added to his comfort by dispensing with wet days when the rain came slowly thickly obstinately down when the streets throat like his own was choked with mist when smoking umbrellas passed and re passed spinning round and round like so many teetotums as they knocked against each other on the crowded footway throwing off a little whirlpool of uncomfortable sprinklings when gutters brawled and waterspouts were full and noisy when the wet from the projecting stones and ledges of the church fell drip drip drip on toby making the wisp of straw on which he stood mere mud in no time those were the days that tried him then indeed you might see toby looking anxiously out from his shelter in an angle of the church wallsuch a meagre shelter that in summer time it never cast a shadow thicker than a good sized walking stick upon the sunny pavementwith a disconsolate and lengthened face but coming out a minute afterwards to warm himself by exercise and trotting up and down some dozen times he would brighten even then and go back more brightly to his niche they called him trotty from his pace which meant speed if it didnt make it he could have walked faster perhaps most likely but rob him of his trot and toby would have taken to his bed and died it bespattered him with mud in dirty weather it cost him a world of trouble he could have walked with infinitely greater ease but that was one reason for his clinging to it so tenaciously a weak small spare old man he was a very hercules this toby in his good intentions he loved to earn his money he delighted to believetoby was very poor and couldnt well afford to part with a delightthat he was worth his salt with a shilling or an eighteenpenny message or small parcel in hand his courage always high rose higher as he trotted on he would call out to fast postmen ahead of him to get out of the way devoutly believing that in the natural course of things he must inevitably overtake and run them down and he had perfect faithnot often testedin his being able to carry anything that man could lift thus even when he came out of his nook to warm himself on a wet day toby trotted making with his leaky shoes a crooked line of slushy footprints in the mire and blowing on his chilly hands and rubbing them against each other poorly defended from the searching cold by threadbare mufflers of grey worsted with a private apartment only for the thumb and a common room or tap for the rest of the fingers toby with his knees bent and his cane beneath his arm still trotted falling out into the road to look up at the belfry when the chimes resounded toby trotted still he made this last excursion several times a day for they were company to him and when he heard their voices he had an interest in glancing at their lodging place and thinking how they were moved and what hammers beat upon them perhaps he was the more curious about these bells because there were points of resemblance between themselves and him they hung there in all weathers with the wind and rain driving in upon them facing only the outsides of all those houses never getting any nearer to the blazing fires that gleamed and shone upon the windows or came puffing out of the chimney tops and incapable of participation in any of the good things that were constantly being handed through the street doors and the area railings to prodigious cooks faces came and went at many windows sometimes pretty faces youthful faces pleasant faces sometimes the reverse but toby knew no more though he often speculated on these trifles standing idle in the streets whence they came or where they went or whether when the lips moved one kind word was said of him in all the year than did the chimes themselves toby was not a casuistthat he knew of at leastand i dont mean to say that when he began to take to the bells and to knit up his first rough acquaintance with them into something of a closer and more delicate woof he passed through these considerations one by one or held any formal review or great field day in his thoughts but what i mean to say and do say is that as the functions of tobys body his digestive organs for example did of their own cunning and by a great many operations of which he was altogether ignorant and the knowledge of which would have astonished him very much arrive at a certain end so his mental faculties without his privity or concurrence set all these wheels and springs in motion with a thousand others when they worked to bring about his liking for the bells and though i had said his love i would not have recalled the word though it would scarcely have expressed his complicated feeling for being but a simple man he invested them with a strange and solemn character they were so mysterious often heard and never seen so high up so far off so full of such a deep strong melody that he regarded them with a species of awe and sometimes when he looked up at the dark arched windows in the tower he half expected to be beckoned to by something which was not a bell and yet was what he had heard so often sounding in the chimes for all this toby scouted with indignation a certain flying rumour that the chimes were haunted as implying the possibility of their being connected with any evil thing in short they were very often in his ears and very often in his thoughts but always in his good opinion and he very often got such a crick in his neck by staring with his mouth wide open at the steeple where they hung that he was fain to take an extra trot or two afterwards to cure it the very thing he was in the act of doing one cold day when the last drowsy sound of twelve oclock just struck was humming like a melodious monster of a bee and not by any means a busy bee all through the steeple dinner time eh said toby trotting up and down before the church ah tobys nose was very red and his eyelids were very red and he winked very much and his shoulders were very near his ears and his legs were very stiff and altogether he was evidently a long way upon the frosty side of cool dinner time eh repeated toby using his right hand muffler like an infantine boxing glove and punishing his chest for being cold ah h h h he took a silent trot after that for a minute or two theres nothing said toby breaking forth afreshbut here he stopped short in his trot and with a face of great interest and some alarm felt his nose carefully all the way up it was but a little way not being much of a nose and he had soon finished i thought it was gone said toby trotting off again its all right however i am sure i couldnt blame it if it was to go it has a precious hard service of it in the bitter weather and precious little to look forward to for i dont take snuff myself its a good deal tried poor creetur at the best of times for when it does get hold of a pleasant whiff or so which ant too often its generally from somebody elses dinner a coming home from the bakers the reflection reminded him of that other reflection which he had left unfinished theres nothing said toby more regular in its coming round than dinner time and nothing less regular in its coming round than dinner thats the great difference between em its took me a long time to find it out i wonder whether it would be worth any gentlemans while now to buy that obserwation for the papers or the parliament toby was only joking for he gravely shook his head in self depreciation why lord said toby the papers is full of obserwations as it is and sos the parliament heres last weeks paper now taking a very dirty one from his pocket and holding it from him at arms length full of obserwations full of obserwations i like to know the news as well as any man said toby slowly folding it a little smaller and putting it in his pocket again but it almost goes against the grain with me to read a paper now it frightens me almost i dont know what we poor people are coming to lord send we may be coming to something better in the new year nigh upon us why father father said a pleasant voice hard by but toby not hearing it continued to trot backwards and forwards musing as he went and talking to himself it seems as if we cant go right or do right or be righted said toby i hadnt much schooling myself when i was young and i cant make out whether we have any business on the face of the earth or not sometimes i think we must havea little and sometimes i think we must be intruding i get so puzzled sometimes that i am not even able to make up my mind whether there is any good at all in us or whether we are born bad we seem to be dreadful things we seem to give a deal of trouble we are always being complained of and guarded against one way or other we fill the papers talk of a new year said toby mournfully i can bear up as well as another man at most times better than a good many for i am as strong as a lion and all men ant but supposing it should really be that we have no right to a new yearsupposing we really are intruding why father father said the pleasant voice again toby heard it this time started stopped and shortening his sight which had been directed a long way off as seeking the enlightenment in the very heart of the approaching year found himself face to face with his own child and looking close into her eyes bright eyes they were eyes that would bear a world of looking in before their depth was fathomed dark eyes that reflected back the eyes which searched them not flashingly or at the owners will but with a clear calm honest patient radiance claiming kindred with that light which heaven called into being eyes that were beautiful and true and beaming with hope with hope so young and fresh with hope so buoyant vigorous and bright despite the twenty years of work and poverty on which they had looked that they became a voice to trotty veck and said i think we have some business herea little trotty kissed the lips belonging to the eyes and squeezed the blooming face between his hands why pet said trotty whats to do i didnt expect you to day meg neither did i expect to come father cried the girl nodding her head and smiling as she spoke but here i am and not alone not alone why you dont mean to say observed trotty looking curiously at a covered basket which she carried in her hand that you smell it father dear said meg only smell it trotty was going to lift up the cover at once in a great hurry when she gaily interposed her hand no no no said meg with the glee of a child lengthen it out a little let me just lift up the corner just the lit tle ti ny cor ner you know said meg suiting the action to the word with the utmost gentleness and speaking very softly as if she were afraid of being overheard by something inside the basket there now whats that toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket and cried out in a rapture why its hot its burning hot cried meg ha ha ha its scalding hot ha ha ha roared toby with a sort of kick its scalding hot but what is it father said meg come you havent guessed what it is and you must guess what it is i cant think of taking it out till you guess what it is dont be in such a hurry wait a minute a little bit more of the cover now guess meg was in a perfect fright lest he should guess right too soon shrinking away as she held the basket towards him curling up her pretty shoulders stopping her ear with her hand as if by so doing she could keep the right word out of tobys lips and laughing softly the whole time meanwhile toby putting a hand on each knee bent down his nose to the basket and took a long inspiration at the lid the grin upon his withered face expanding in the process as if he were inhaling laughing gas ah its very nice said toby it anti suppose it ant polonies no no no cried meg delighted nothing like polonies no said toby after another sniff itsits mellower than polonies its very nice it improves every moment its too decided for trotters ant it meg was in an ecstasy he could not have gone wider of the mark than trottersexcept polonies liver said toby communing with himself no theres a mildness about it that dont answer to liver pettitoes no it ant faint enough for pettitoes it wants the stringiness of cocks heads and i know it ant sausages ill tell you what it is its chitterlings no it ant cried meg in a burst of delight no it ant why what am i a thinking of said toby suddenly recovering a position as near the perpendicular as it was possible for him to assume i shall forget my own name next its tripe tripe it was and meg in high joy protested he should say in half a minute more it was the best tripe ever stewed and so said meg busying herself exultingly with the basket ill lay the cloth at once father for i have brought the tripe in a basin and tied the basin up in a pocket handkerchief and if i like to be proud for once and spread that for a cloth and call it a cloth theres no law to prevent me is there father not that i know of my dear said toby but theyre always a bringing up some new law or other and according to what i was reading you in the paper the other day father what the judge said you know we poor people are supposed to know them all ha ha what a mistake my goodness me how clever they think us yes my dear cried trotty and theyd be very fond of any one of us that did know em all hed grow fat upon the work hed get that man and be popular with the gentlefolks in his neighbourhood very much so hed eat his dinner with an appetite whoever he was if it smelt like this said meg cheerfully make haste for theres a hot potato besides and half a pint of fresh drawn beer in a bottle where will you dine father on the post or on the steps dear dear how grand we are two places to choose from the steps to day my pet said trotty steps in dry weather post in wet theres a greater conveniency in the steps at all times because of the sitting down but theyre rheumatic in the damp then here said meg clapping her hands after a moments bustle here it is all ready and beautiful it looks come father come since his discovery of the contents of the basket trotty had been standing looking at herand had been speaking tooin an abstracted manner which showed that though she was the object of his thoughts and eyes to the exclusion even of tripe he neither saw nor thought about her as she was at that moment but had before him some imaginary rough sketch or drama of her future life roused now by her cheerful summons he shook off a melancholy shake of the head which was just coming upon him and trotted to her side as he was stooping to sit down the chimes rang amen said trotty pulling off his hat and looking up towards them amen to the bells father cried meg they broke in like a grace my dear said trotty taking his seat theyd say a good one i am sure if they could manys the kind thing they say to me the bells do father laughed meg as she set the basin and a knife and fork before him well seem to my pet said trotty falling to with great vigour and wheres the difference if i hear em what does it matter whether they speak it or not why bless you my dear said toby pointing at the tower with his fork and becoming more animated under the influence of dinner how often have i heard them bells say toby veck toby veck keep a good heart toby toby veck toby veck keep a good heart toby a million times more well i never cried meg she had thoughover and over again for it was tobys constant topic when things is very bad said trotty very bad indeed i mean almost at the worst then its toby veck toby veck job coming soon toby toby veck toby veck job coming soon toby that way and it comesat last father said meg with a touch of sadness in her pleasant voice always answered the unconscious toby never fails while this discourse was holding trotty made no pause in his attack upon the savoury meat before him but cut and ate and cut and drank and cut and chewed and dodged about from tripe to hot potato and from hot potato back again to tripe with an unctuous and unflagging relish but happening now to look all round the streetin case anybody should be beckoning from any door or window for a porterhis eyes in coming back again encountered meg sitting opposite to him with her arms folded and only busy in watching his progress with a smile of happiness why lord forgive me said trotty dropping his knife and fork my dove meg why didnt you tell me what a beast i was father sitting here said trotty in penitent explanation cramming and stuffing and gorging myself and you before me there never so much as breaking your precious fast nor wanting to when but i have broken it father interposed his daughter laughing all to bits i have had my dinner nonsense said trotty two dinners in one day it ant possible you might as well tell me that two new years days will come together or that i have had a gold head all my life and never changed it i have had my dinner father for all that said meg coming nearer to him and if youll go on with yours ill tell you how and where and how your dinner came to be brought andand something else besides toby still appeared incredulous but she looked into his face with her clear eyes and laying her hand upon his shoulder motioned him to go on while the meat was hot so trotty took up his knife and fork again and went to work but much more slowly than before and shaking his head as if he were not at all pleased with himself i had my dinner father said meg after a little hesitation withwith richard his dinner time was early and as he brought his dinner with him when he came to see me wewe had it together father trotty took a little beer and smacked his lips then he said ohbecause she waited and richard says father meg resumed then stopped what does richard say meg asked toby richard says father another stoppage richards a long time saying it said toby he says then father meg continued lifting up her eyes at last and speaking in a tremble but quite plainly another year is nearly gone and where is the use of waiting on from year to year when it is so unlikely we shall ever be better off than we are now he says we are poor now father and we shall be poor then but we are young now and years will make us old before we know it he says that if we wait people in our condition until we see our way quite clearly the way will be a narrow one indeedthe common waythe grave father a bolder man than trotty veck must needs have drawn upon his boldness largely to deny it trotty held his peace and how hard father to grow old and die and think we might have cheered and helped each other how hard in all our lives to love each other and to grieve apart to see each other working changing growing old and grey even if i got the better of it and forgot him which i never could oh father dear how hard to have a heart so full as mine is now and live to have it slowly drained out every drop without the recollection of one happy moment of a womans life to stay behind and comfort me and make me better trotty sat quite still meg dried her eyes and said more gaily that is to say with here a laugh and there a sob and here a laugh and sob together so richard says father as his work was yesterday made certain for some time to come and as i love him and have loved him full three yearsah longer than that if he knew itwill i marry him on new years day the best and happiest day he says in the whole year and one that is almost sure to bring good fortune with it its a short notice fatherisnt itbut i havent my fortune to be settled or my wedding dresses to be made like the great ladies father have i and he said so much and said it in his way so strong and earnest and all the time so kind and gentle that i said id come and talk to you father and as they paid the money for that work of mine this morning unexpectedly i am sure and as you have fared very poorly for a whole week and as i couldnt help wishing there should be something to make this day a sort of holiday to you as well as a dear and happy day to me father i made a little treat and brought it to surprise you and see how he leaves it cooling on the step said another voice it was the voice of this same richard who had come upon them unobserved and stood before the father and daughter looking down upon them with a face as glowing as the iron on which his stout sledge hammer daily rung a handsome well made powerful youngster he was with eyes that sparkled like the red hot droppings from a furnace fire black hair that curled about his swarthy temples rarely and a smilea smile that bore out megs eulogium on his style of conversation see how he leaves it cooling on the step said richard meg dont know what he likes not she trotty all action and enthusiasm immediately reached up his hand to richard and was going to address him in great hurry when the house door opened without any warning and a footman very nearly put his foot into the tripe out of the vays here will you you must always go and be a settin on our steps must you you cant go and give a turn to none of the neighbours never cant you will you clear the road or wont you strictly speaking the last question was irrelevant as they had already done it whats the matter whats the matter said the gentleman for whom the door was opened coming out of the house at that kind of light heavy pacethat peculiar compromise between a walk and a jog trotwith which a gentleman upon the smooth down hill of life wearing creaking boots a watch chain and clean linen may come out of his house not only without any abatement of his dignity but with an expression of having important and wealthy engagements elsewhere whats the matter whats the matter youre always a being begged and prayed upon your bended knees you are said the footman with great emphasis to trotty veck to let our door steps be why dont you let em be cant you let em be there thatll do thatll do said the gentleman halloa there porter beckoning with his head to trotty veck come here whats that your dinner yes sir said trotty leaving it behind him in a corner dont leave it there exclaimed the gentleman bring it here bring it here so this is your dinner is it yes sir repeated trotty looking with a fixed eye and a watery mouth at the piece of tripe he had reserved for a last delicious tit bit which the gentleman was now turning over and over on the end of the fork two other gentlemen had come out with him one was a low spirited gentleman of middle age of a meagre habit and a disconsolate face who kept his hands continually in the pockets of his scanty pepper and salt trousers very large and dogs eared from that custom and was not particularly well brushed or washed the other a full sized sleek well conditioned gentleman in a blue coat with bright buttons and a white cravat this gentleman had a very red face as if an undue proportion of the blood in his body were squeezed up into his head which perhaps accounted for his having also the appearance of being rather cold about the heart he who had tobys meat upon the fork called to the first one by the name of filer and they both drew near together mr filer being exceedingly short sighted was obliged to go so close to the remnant of tobys dinner before he could make out what it was that tobys heart leaped up into his mouth but mr filer didnt eat it this is a description of animal food alderman said filer making little punches in it with a pencil case commonly known to the labouring population of this country by the name of tripe the alderman laughed and winked for he was a merry fellow alderman cute oh and a sly fellow too a knowing fellow up to everything not to be imposed upon deep in the peoples hearts he knew them cute did i believe you but who eats tripe said mr filer looking round tripe is without an exception the least economical and the most wasteful article of consumption that the markets of this country can by possibility produce the loss upon a pound of tripe has been found to be in the boiling seven eights of a fifth more than the loss upon a pound of any other animal substance whatever tripe is more expensive properly understood than the hothouse pine apple taking into account the number of animals slaughtered yearly within the bills of mortality alone and forming a low estimate of the quantity of tripe which the carcases of those animals reasonably well butchered would yield i find that the waste on that amount of tripe if boiled would victual a garrison of five hundred men for five months of thirty one days each and a february over the waste the waste trotty stood aghast and his legs shook under him he seemed to have starved a garrison of five hundred men with his own hand who eats tripe said mr filer warmly who eats tripe trotty made a miserable bow you do do you said mr filer then ill tell you something you snatch your tripe my friend out of the mouths of widows and orphans i hope not sir said trotty faintly id sooner die of want divide the amount of tripe before mentioned alderman said mr filer by the estimated number of existing widows and orphans and the result will be one pennyweight of tripe to each not a grain is left for that man consequently hes a robber trotty was so shocked that it gave him no concern to see the alderman finish the tripe himself it was a relief to get rid of it anyhow and what do you say asked the alderman jocosely of the red faced gentleman in the blue coat you have heard friend filer what do you say whats it possible to say returned the gentleman what is to be said who can take any interest in a fellow like this meaning trotty in such degenerate times as these look at him what an object the good old times the grand old times the great old times those were the times for a bold peasantry and all that sort of thing those were the times for every sort of thing in fact theres nothing now a days ah sighed the red faced gentleman the good old times the good old times the gentleman didnt specify what particular times he alluded to nor did he say whether he objected to the present times from a disinterested consciousness that they had done nothing very remarkable in producing himself the good old times the good old times repeated the gentleman what times they were they were the only times its of no use talking about any other times or discussing what the people are in these times you dont call these times do you i dont look into strutts costumes and see what a porter used to be in any of the good old english reigns he hadnt in his very best circumstances a shirt to his back or a stocking to his foot and there was scarcely a vegetable in all england for him to put into his mouth said mr filer i can prove it by tables but still the red faced gentleman extolled the good old times the grand old times the great old times no matter what anybody else said he still went turning round and round in one set form of words concerning them as a poor squirrel turns and turns in its revolving cage touching the mechanism and trick of which it has probably quite as distinct perceptions as ever this red faced gentleman had of his deceased millennium it is possible that poor trottys faith in these very vague old times was not entirely destroyed for he felt vague enough at that moment one thing however was plain to him in the midst of his distress to wit that however these gentlemen might differ in details his misgivings of that morning and of many other mornings were well founded no no we cant go right or do right thought trotty in despair there is no good in us we are born bad but trotty had a fathers heart within him which had somehow got into his breast in spite of this decree and he could not bear that meg in the blush of her brief joy should have her fortune read by these wise gentlemen god help her thought poor trotty she will know it soon enough he anxiously signed therefore to the young smith to take her away but he was so busy talking to her softly at a little distance that he only became conscious of this desire simultaneously with alderman cute now the alderman had not yet had his say but he was a philosopher toopractical though oh very practicaland as he had no idea of losing any portion of his audience he cried stop now you know said the alderman addressing his two friends with a self complacent smile upon his face which was habitual to him i am a plain man and a practical man and i go to work in a plain practical way thats my way there is not the least mystery or difficulty in dealing with this sort of people if you only understand em and can talk to em in their own manner now you porter dont you ever tell me or anybody else my friend that you havent always enough to eat and of the best because i know better i have tasted your tripe you know and you cant chaff me you understand what chaff means eh thats the right word isnt it ha ha ha lord bless you said the alderman turning to his friends again its the easiest thing on earth to deal with this sort of people if you understand em famous man for the common people alderman cute never out of temper with them easy affable joking knowing gentleman you see my friend pursued the alderman theres a great deal of nonsense talked about wanthard up you know thats the phrase isnt it ha ha haand i intend to put it down theres a certain amount of cant in vogue about starvation and i mean to put it down thats all lord bless you said the alderman turning to his friends again you may put down anything among this sort of people if you only know the way to set about it trotty took megs hand and drew it through his arm he didnt seem to know what he was doing though your daughter eh said the alderman chucking her familiarly under the chin always affable with the working classes alderman cute knew what pleased them not a bit of pride wheres her mother asked that worthy gentleman dead said toby her mother got up linen and was called to heaven when she was born not to get up linen there i suppose remarked the alderman pleasantly toby might or might not have been able to separate his wife in heaven from her old pursuits but query if mrs alderman cute had gone to heaven would mr alderman cute have pictured her as holding any state or station there and youre making love to her are you said cute to the young smith yes returned richard quickly for he was nettled by the question and we are going to be married on new years day what do you mean cried filer sharply married why yes were thinking of it master said richard were rather in a hurry you see in case it should be put down first ah cried filer with a groan put that down indeed alderman and youll do something married married the ignorance of the first principles of political economy on the part of these people their improvidence their wickedness is by heavens enough tonow look at that couple will you well they were worth looking at and marriage seemed as reasonable and fair a deed as they need have in contemplation a man may live to be as old as methuselah said mr filer and may labour all his life for the benefit of such people as those and may heap up facts on figures facts on figures facts on figures mountains high and dry and he can no more hope to persuade em that they have no right or business to be married than he can hope to persuade em that they have no earthly right or business to be born and that we know they havent we reduced it to a mathematical certainty long ago alderman cute was mightily diverted and laid his right forefinger on the side of his nose as much as to say to both his friends observe me will you keep your eye on the practical manand called meg to him come here my girl said alderman cute the young blood of her lover had been mounting wrathfully within the last few minutes and he was indisposed to let her come but setting a constraint upon himself he came forward with a stride as meg approached and stood beside her trotty kept her hand within his arm still but looked from face to face as wildly as a sleeper in a dream now im going to give you a word or two of good advice my girl said the alderman in his nice easy way its my place to give advice you know because im a justice you know im a justice dont you meg timidly said yes but everybody knew alderman cute was a justice oh dear so active a justice always who such a mote of brightness in the public eye as cute you are going to be married you say pursued the alderman very unbecoming and indelicate in one of your sex but never mind that after you are married youll quarrel with your husband and come to be a distressed wife you may think not but you will because i tell you so now i give you fair warning that i have made up my mind to put distressed wives down so dont be brought before me youll have childrenboys those boys will grow up bad of course and run wild in the streets without shoes and stockings mind my young friend ill convict em summarily every one for i am determined to put boys without shoes and stockings down perhaps your husband will die young most likely and leave you with a baby then youll be turned out of doors and wander up and down the streets now dont wander near me my dear for i am resolved to put all wandering mothers down all young mothers of all sorts and kinds its my determination to put down dont think to plead illness as an excuse with me or babies as an excuse with me for all sick persons and young children i hope you know the church service but im afraid not i am determined to put down and if you attempt desperately and ungratefully and impiously and fraudulently attempt to drown yourself or hang yourself ill have no pity for you for i have made up my mind to put all suicide down if there is one thing said the alderman with his self satisfied smile on which i can be said to have made up my mind more than on another it is to put suicide down so dont try it on thats the phrase isnt it ha ha now we understand each other toby knew not whether to be agonised or glad to see that meg had turned a deadly white and dropped her lovers hand and as for you you dull dog said the alderman turning with even increased cheerfulness and urbanity to the young smith what are you thinking of being married for what do you want to be married for you silly fellow if i was a fine young strapping chap like you i should be ashamed of being milksop enough to pin myself to a womans apron strings why shell be an old woman before youre a middle aged man and a pretty figure youll cut then with a draggle tailed wife and a crowd of squalling children crying after you wherever you go o he knew how to banter the common people alderman cute there go along with you said the alderman and repent dont make such a fool of yourself as to get married on new years day youll think very differently of it long before next new years day a trim young fellow like you with all the girls looking after you there go along with you they went along not arm in arm or hand in hand or interchanging bright glances but she in tears he gloomy and down looking were these the hearts that had so lately made old tobys leap up from its faintness no no the alderman a blessing on his head had put them down as you happen to be here said the alderman to toby you shall carry a letter for me can you be quick youre an old man toby who had been looking after meg quite stupidly made shift to murmur out that he was very quick and very strong how old are you inquired the alderman im over sixty sir said toby o this mans a great deal past the average age you know cried mr filer breaking in as if his patience would bear some trying but this really was carrying matters a little too far i feel im intruding sir said toby ii misdoubted it this morning oh dear me the alderman cut him short by giving him the letter from his pocket toby would have got a shilling too but mr filer clearly showing that in that case he would rob a certain given number of persons of ninepence halfpenny a piece he only got sixpence and thought himself very well off to get that then the alderman gave an arm to each of his friends and walked off in high feather but he immediately came hurrying back alone as if he had forgotten something porter said the alderman sir said toby take care of that daughter of yours shes much too handsome even her good looks are stolen from somebody or other i suppose thought toby looking at the sixpence in his hand and thinking of the tripe shes been and robbed five hundred ladies of a bloom a piece i shouldnt wonder its very dreadful shes much too handsome my man repeated the alderman the chances are that shell come to no good i clearly see observe what i say take care of her with which he hurried off again wrong every way wrong every way said trotty clasping his hands born bad no business here the chimes came clashing in upon him as he said the words full loud and soundingbut with no encouragement no not a drop the tunes changed cried the old man as he listened theres not a word of all that fancy in it why should there be i have no business with the new year nor with the old one neither let me die still the bells pealing forth their changes made the very air spin put em down put em down good old times good old times facts and figures facts and figures put em down put em down if they said anything they said this until the brain of toby reeled he pressed his bewildered head between his hands as if to keep it from splitting asunder a well timed action as it happened for finding the letter in one of them and being by that means reminded of his charge he fell mechanically into his usual trot and trotted off chapter iithe second quarter the letter toby had received from alderman cute was addressed to a great man in the great district of the town the greatest district of the town it must have been the greatest district of the town because it was commonly called the world by its inhabitants the letter positively seemed heavier in tobys hand than another letter not because the alderman had sealed it with a very large coat of arms and no end of wax but because of the weighty name on the superscription and the ponderous amount of gold and silver with which it was associated how different from us thought toby in all simplicity and earnestness as he looked at the direction divide the lively turtles in the bills of mortality by the number of gentlefolks able to buy em and whose share does he take but his own as to snatching tripe from anybodys mouthhed scorn it with the involuntary homage due to such an exalted character toby interposed a corner of his apron between the letter and his fingers his children said trotty and a mist rose before his eyes his daughtersgentlemen may win their hearts and marry them they may be happy wives and mothers they may be handsome like my darling m e he couldnt finish the name the final letter swelled in his throat to the size of the whole alphabet never mind thought trotty i know what i mean thats more than enough for me and with this consolatory rumination trotted on it was a hard frost that day the air was bracing crisp and clear the wintry sun though powerless for warmth looked brightly down upon the ice it was too weak to melt and set a radiant glory there at other times trotty might have learned a poor mans lesson from the wintry sun but he was past that now the year was old that day the patient year had lived through the reproaches and misuses of its slanderers and faithfully performed its work spring summer autumn winter it had laboured through the destined round and now laid down its weary head to die shut out from hope high impulse active happiness itself but active messenger of many joys to others it made appeal in its decline to have its toiling days and patient hours remembered and to die in peace trotty might have read a poor mans allegory in the fading year but he was past that now and only he or has the like appeal been ever made by seventy years at once upon an english labourers head and made in vain the streets were full of motion and the shops were decked out gaily the new year like an infant heir to the whole world was waited for with welcomes presents and rejoicings there were books and toys for the new year glittering trinkets for the new year dresses for the new year schemes of fortune for the new year new inventions to beguile it its life was parcelled out in almanacks and pocket books the coming of its moons and stars and tides was known beforehand to the moment all the workings of its seasons in their days and nights were calculated with as much precision as mr filer could work sums in men and women the new year the new year everywhere the new year the old year was already looked upon as dead and its effects were selling cheap like some drowned mariners aboardship its patterns were last years and going at a sacrifice before its breath was gone its treasures were mere dirt beside the riches of its unborn successor trotty had no portion to his thinking in the new year or the old put em down put em down facts and figures facts and figures good old times good old times put em down put em downhis trot went to that measure and would fit itself to nothing else but even that one melancholy as it was brought him in due time to the end of his journey to the mansion of sir joseph bowley member of parliament the door was opened by a porter such a porter not of tobys order quite another thing his place was the ticket though not tobys this porter underwent some hard panting before he could speak having breathed himself by coming incautiously out of his chair without first taking time to think about it and compose his mind when he had found his voicewhich it took him a long time to do for it was a long way off and hidden under a load of meathe said in a fat whisper whos it from toby told him youre to take it in yourself said the porter pointing to a room at the end of a long passage opening from the hall everything goes straight in on this day of the year youre not a bit too soon for the carriage is at the door now and they have only come to town for a couple of hours a purpose toby wiped his feet which were quite dry already with great care and took the way pointed out to him observing as he went that it was an awfully grand house but hushed and covered up as if the family were in the country knocking at the room door he was told to enter from within and doing so found himself in a spacious library where at a table strewn with files and papers were a stately lady in a bonnet and a not very stately gentleman in black who wrote from her dictation while another and an older and a much statelier gentleman whose hat and cane were on the table walked up and down with one hand in his breast and looked complacently from time to time at his own picturea full length a very full lengthhanging over the fireplace what is this said the last named gentleman mr fish will you have the goodness to attend mr fish begged pardon and taking the letter from toby handed it with great respect from alderman cute sir joseph is this all have you nothing else porter inquired sir joseph toby replied in the negative you have no bill or demand upon memy name is bowley sir joseph bowleyof any kind from anybody have you said sir joseph if you have present it there is a cheque book by the side of mr fish i allow nothing to be carried into the new year every description of account is settled in this house at the close of the old one so that if death was toto to cut suggested mr fish to sever sir returned sir joseph with great asperity the cord of existencemy affairs would be found i hope in a state of preparation my dear sir joseph said the lady who was greatly younger than the gentleman how shocking my lady bowley returned sir joseph floundering now and then as in the great depth of his observations at this season of the year we should think ofofourselves we should look into ourour accounts we should feel that every return of so eventful a period in human transactions involves a matter of deep moment between a man and hisand his banker sir joseph delivered these words as if he felt the full morality of what he was saying and desired that even trotty should have an opportunity of being improved by such discourse possibly he had this end before him in still forbearing to break the seal of the letter and in telling trotty to wait where he was a minute you were desiring mr fish to say my lady observed sir joseph mr fish has said that i believe returned his lady glancing at the letter but upon my word sir joseph i dont think i can let it go after all it is so very dear what is dear inquired sir joseph that charity my love they only allow two votes for a subscription of five pounds really monstrous my lady bowley returned sir joseph you surprise me is the luxury of feeling in proportion to the number of votes or is it to a rightly constituted mind in proportion to the number of applicants and the wholesome state of mind to which their canvassing reduces them is there no excitement of the purest kind in having two votes to dispose of among fifty people not to me i acknowledge replied the lady it bores one besides one cant oblige ones acquaintance but you are the poor mans friend you know sir joseph you think otherwise i am the poor mans friend observed sir joseph glancing at the poor man present as such i may be taunted as such i have been taunted but i ask no other title bless him for a noble gentleman thought trotty i dont agree with cute here for instance said sir joseph holding out the letter i dont agree with the filer party i dont agree with any party my friend the poor man has no business with anything of that sort and nothing of that sort has any business with him my friend the poor man in my district is my business no man or body of men has any right to interfere between my friend and me that is the ground i take i assume aa paternal character towards my friend i say my good fellow i will treat you paternally toby listened with great gravity and began to feel more comfortable your only business my good fellow pursued sir joseph looking abstractedly at toby your only business in life is with me you neednt trouble yourself to think about anything i will think for you i know what is good for you i am your perpetual parent such is the dispensation of an all wise providence now the design of your creation isnot that you should swill and guzzle and associate your enjoyments brutally with food toby thought remorsefully of the tripe but that you should feel the dignity of labour go forth erect into the cheerful morning air andand stop there live hard and temperately be respectful exercise your self denial bring up your family on next to nothing pay your rent as regularly as the clock strikes be punctual in your dealings i set you a good example you will find mr fish my confidential secretary with a cash box before him at all times and you may trust to me to be your friend and father nice children indeed sir joseph said the lady with a shudder rheumatisms and fevers and crooked legs and asthmas and all kinds of horrors my lady returned sir joseph with solemnity not the less am i the poor mans friend and father not the less shall he receive encouragement at my hands every quarter day he will be put in communication with mr fish every new years day myself and friends will drink his health once every year myself and friends will address him with the deepest feeling once in his life he may even perhaps receive in public in the presence of the gentry a trifle from a friend and when upheld no more by these stimulants and the dignity of labour he sinks into his comfortable grave then my ladyhere sir joseph blew his nosei will be a friend and a fatheron the same termsto his children toby was greatly moved o you have a thankful family sir joseph cried his wife my lady said sir joseph quite majestically ingratitude is known to be the sin of that class i expect no other return ah born bad thought toby nothing melts us what man can do i do pursued sir joseph i do my duty as the poor mans friend and father and i endeavour to educate his mind by inculcating on all occasions the one great moral lesson which that class requires that is entire dependence on myself they have no business whatever withwith themselves if wicked and designing persons tell them otherwise and they become impatient and discontented and are guilty of insubordinate conduct and black hearted ingratitude which is undoubtedly the case i am their friend and father still it is so ordained it is in the nature of things with that great sentiment he opened the aldermans letter and read it very polite and attentive i am sure exclaimed sir joseph my lady the alderman is so obliging as to remind me that he has had the distinguished honourhe is very goodof meeting me at the house of our mutual friend deedles the banker and he does me the favour to inquire whether it will be agreeable to me to have will fern put down most agreeable replied my lady bowley the worst man among them he has been committing a robbery i hope why no said sir joseph referring to the letter not quite very near not quite he came up to london it seems to look for employment trying to better himselfthats his story and being found at night asleep in a shed was taken into custody and carried next morning before the alderman the alderman observes very properly that he is determined to put this sort of thing down and that if it will be agreeable to me to have will fern put down he will be happy to begin with him let him be made an example of by all means returned the lady last winter when i introduced pinking and eyelet holing among the men and boys in the village as a nice evening employment and had the lines o let us love our occupations bless the squire and his relations live upon our daily rations and always know our proper stations set to music on the new system for them to sing the while this very ferni see him nowtouched that hat of his and said i humbly ask your pardon my lady but ant i something different from a great girl i expected it of course who can expect anything but insolence and ingratitude from that class of people that is not to the purpose however sir joseph make an example of him hem coughed sir joseph mr fish if youll have the goodness to attend mr fish immediately seized his pen and wrote from sir josephs dictation private my dear sir i am very much indebted to you for your courtesy in the matter of the man william fern of whom i regret to add i can say nothing favourable i have uniformly considered myself in the light of his friend and father but have been repaid a common case i grieve to say with ingratitude and constant opposition to my plans he is a turbulent and rebellious spirit his character will not bear investigation nothing will persuade him to be happy when he might under these circumstances it appears to me i own that when he comes before you again as you informed me he promised to do to morrow pending your inquiries and i think he may be so far relied upon his committal for some short term as a vagabond would be a service to society and would be a salutary example in a country wherefor the sake of those who are through good and evil report the friends and fathers of the poor as well as with a view to that generally speaking misguided class themselvesexamples are greatly needed and i am and so forth it appears remarked sir joseph when he had signed this letter and mr fish was sealing it as if this were ordained really at the close of the year i wind up my account and strike my balance even with william fern trotty who had long ago relapsed and was very low spirited stepped forward with a rueful face to take the letter with my compliments and thanks said sir joseph stop stop echoed mr fish you have heard perhaps said sir joseph oracularly certain remarks into which i have been led respecting the solemn period of time at which we have arrived and the duty imposed upon us of settling our affairs and being prepared you have observed that i dont shelter myself behind my superior standing in society but that mr fishthat gentlemanhas a cheque book at his elbow and is in fact here to enable me to turn over a perfectly new leaf and enter on the epoch before us with a clean account now my friend can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that you also have made preparations for a new year i am afraid sir stammered trotty looking meekly at him that i am aalittle behind hand with the world behind hand with the world repeated sir joseph bowley in a tone of terrible distinctness i am afraid sir faltered trotty that theres a matter of ten or twelve shillings owing to mrs chickenstalker to mrs chickenstalker repeated sir joseph in the same tone as before a shop sir exclaimed toby in the general line also aa little money on account of rent a very little sir it oughtnt to be owing i know but we have been hard put to it indeed sir joseph looked at his lady and at mr fish and at trotty one after another twice all round he then made a despondent gesture with both hands at once as if he gave the thing up altogether how a man even among this improvident and impracticable race an old man a man grown grey can look a new year in the face with his affairs in this condition how he can lie down on his bed at night and get up again in the morning andthere he said turning his back on trotty take the letter take the letter i heartily wish it was otherwise sir said trotty anxious to excuse himself we have been tried very hard sir joseph still repeating take the letter take the letter and mr fish not only saying the same thing but giving additional force to the request by motioning the bearer to the door he had nothing for it but to make his bow and leave the house and in the street poor trotty pulled his worn old hat down on his head to hide the grief he felt at getting no hold on the new year anywhere he didnt even lift his hat to look up at the bell tower when he came to the old church on his return he halted there a moment from habit and knew that it was growing dark and that the steeple rose above him indistinct and faint in the murky air he knew too that the chimes would ring immediately and that they sounded to his fancy at such a time like voices in the clouds but he only made the more haste to deliver the aldermans letter and get out of the way before they began for he dreaded to hear them tagging friends and fathers friends and fathers to the burden they had rung out last toby discharged himself of his commission therefore with all possible speed and set off trotting homeward but what with his pace which was at best an awkward one in the street and what with his hat which didnt improve it he trotted against somebody in less than no time and was sent staggering out into the road i beg your pardon im sure said trotty pulling up his hat in great confusion and between the hat and the torn lining fixing his head into a kind of bee hive i hope i havent hurt you as to hurting anybody toby was not such an absolute samson but that he was much more likely to be hurt himself and indeed he had flown out into the road like a shuttlecock he had such an opinion of his own strength however that he was in real concern for the other party and said again i hope i havent hurt you the man against whom he had run a sun browned sinewy country looking man with grizzled hair and a rough chin stared at him for a moment as if he suspected him to be in jest but satisfied of his good faith he answered no friend you have not hurt me nor the child i hope said trotty nor the child returned the man i thank you kindly as he said so he glanced at a little girl he carried in his arms asleep and shading her face with the long end of the poor handkerchief he wore about his throat went slowly on the tone in which he said i thank you kindly penetrated trottys heart he was so jaded and foot sore and so soiled with travel and looked about him so forlorn and strange that it was a comfort to him to be able to thank any one no matter for how little toby stood gazing after him as he plodded wearily away with the childs arm clinging round his neck at the figure in the worn shoesnow the very shade and ghost of shoesrough leather leggings common frock and broad slouched hat trotty stood gazing blind to the whole street and at the childs arm clinging round its neck before he merged into the darkness the traveller stopped and looking round and seeing trotty standing there yet seemed undecided whether to return or go on after doing first the one and then the other he came back and trotty went half way to meet him you can tell me perhaps said the man with a faint smile and if you can i am sure you will and id rather ask you than anotherwhere alderman cute lives close at hand replied toby ill show you his house with pleasure i was to have gone to him elsewhere to morrow said the man accompanying toby but im uneasy under suspicion and want to clear myself and to be free to go and seek my breadi dont know where so maybe hell forgive my going to his house to night its impossible cried toby with a start that your names fern eh cried the other turning on him in astonishment fern will fern said trotty thats my name replied the other why then said trotty seizing him by the arm and looking cautiously round for heavens sake dont go to him dont go to him hell put you down as sure as ever you were born here come up this alley and ill tell you what i mean dont go to him his new acquaintance looked as if he thought him mad but he bore him company nevertheless when they were shrouded from observation trotty told him what he knew and what character he had received and all about it the subject of his history listened to it with a calmness that surprised him he did not contradict or interrupt it once he nodded his head now and thenmore in corroboration of an old and worn out story it appeared than in refutation of it and once or twice threw back his hat and passed his freckled hand over a brow where every furrow he had ploughed seemed to have set its image in little but he did no more its true enough in the main he said master i could sift grain from husk here and there but let it be as tis what odds i have gone against his plans to my misfortun i cant help it i should do the like to morrow as to character them gentlefolks will search and search and pry and pry and have it as free from spot or speck in us afore theyll help us to a dry good wordwell i hope they dont lose good opinion as easy as we do or their lives is strict indeed and hardly worth the keeping for myself master i never took with that handholding it before himwhat wasnt my own and never held it back from work however hard or poorly paid whoever can deny it let him chop it off but when work wont maintain me like a human creetur when my living is so bad that i am hungry out of doors and in when i see a whole working life begin that way go on that way and end that way without a chance or change then i say to the gentlefolks keep away from me let my cottage be my doors is dark enough without your darkening of em more dont look for me to come up into the park to help the show when theres a birthday or a fine speechmaking or what not act your plays and games without me and be welcome to em and enjoy em weve nowt to do with one another im best let alone seeing that the child in his arms had opened her eyes and was looking about her in wonder he checked himself to say a word or two of foolish prattle in her ear and stand her on the ground beside him then slowly winding one of her long tresses round and round his rough forefinger like a ring while she hung about his dusty leg he said to trotty im not a cross grained man by natu i believe and easy satisfied im sure i bear no ill will against none of em i only want to live like one of the almightys creeturs i canti dontand so theres a pit dug between me and them that can and do theres others like me you might tell em off by hundreds and by thousands sooner than by ones trotty knew he spoke the truth in this and shook his head to signify as much ive got a bad name this way said fern and im not likely im afeared to get a better tant lawful to be out of sorts and i am out of sorts though god knows id sooner bear a cheerful spirit if i could well i dont know as this alderman could hurt me much by sending me to jail but without a friend to speak a word for me he might do it and you see pointing downward with his finger at the child she has a beautiful face said trotty why yes replied the other in a low voice as he gently turned it up with both his hands towards his own and looked upon it steadfastly ive thought so many times ive thought so when my hearth was very cold and cupboard very bare i thought so tother night when we were taken like two thieves but theythey shouldnt try the little face too often should they lilian thats hardly fair upon a man he sunk his voice so low and gazed upon her with an air so stern and strange that toby to divert the current of his thoughts inquired if his wife were living i never had one he returned shaking his head shes my brothers child a orphan nine year old though youd hardly think it but shes tired and worn out now theyd have taken care on her the unioneight and twenty mile away from where we livebetween four walls as they took care of my old father when he couldnt work no more though he didnt trouble em long but i took her instead and shes lived with me ever since her mother had a friend once in london here we are trying to find her and to find work too but its a large place never mind more room for us to walk about in lilly meeting the childs eyes with a smile which melted toby more than tears he shook him by the hand i dont so much as know your name he said but ive opened my heart free to you for im thankful to you with good reason ill take your advice and keep clear of this justice suggested toby ah he said if thats the name they give him this justice and to morrow will try whether theres better fortun to be met with somewheres near london good night a happy new year stay cried trotty catching at his hand as he relaxed his grip stay the new year never can be happy to me if we part like this the new year never can be happy to me if i see the child and you go wandering away you dont know where without a shelter for your heads come home with me im a poor man living in a poor place but i can give you lodging for one night and never miss it come home with me here ill take her cried trotty lifting up the child a pretty one id carry twenty times her weight and never know id got it tell me if i go too quick for you im very fast i always was trotty said this taking about six of his trotting paces to one stride of his fatigued companion and with his thin legs quivering again beneath the load he bore why shes as light said trotty trotting in his speech as well as in his gait for he couldnt bear to be thanked and dreaded a moments pause as light as a feather lighter than a peacocks feathera great deal lighter here we are and here we go round this first turning to the right uncle will and past the pump and sharp off up the passage to the left right opposite the public house here we are and here we go cross over uncle will and mind the kidney pieman at the corner here we are and here we go down the mews here uncle will and stop at the black door with t veck ticket porter wrote upon a board and here we are and here we go and here we are indeed my precious meg surprising you with which words trotty in a breathless state set the child down before his daughter in the middle of the floor the little visitor looked once at meg and doubting nothing in that face but trusting everything she saw there ran into her arms here we are and here we go cried trotty running round the room and choking audibly here uncle will heres a fire you know why dont you come to the fire oh here we are and here we go meg my precious darling wheres the kettle here it is and here it goes and itll bile in no time trotty really had picked up the kettle somewhere or other in the course of his wild career and now put it on the fire while meg seating the child in a warm corner knelt down on the ground before her and pulled off her shoes and dried her wet feet on a cloth ay and she laughed at trotty tooso pleasantly so cheerfully that trotty could have blessed her where she kneeled for he had seen that when they entered she was sitting by the fire in tears why father said meg youre crazy to night i think i dont know what the bells would say to that poor little feet how cold they are oh theyre warmer now exclaimed the child theyre quite warm now no no no said meg we havent rubbed em half enough were so busy so busy and when theyre done well brush out the damp hair and when thats done well bring some colour to the poor pale face with fresh water and when thats done well be so gay and brisk and happy the child in a burst of sobbing clasped her round the neck caressed her fair cheek with its hand and said oh meg oh dear meg tobys blessing could have done no more who could do more why father cried meg after a pause here i am and here i go my dear said trotty good gracious me cried meg hes crazy hes put the dear childs bonnet on the kettle and hung the lid behind the door i didnt go for to do it my love said trotty hastily repairing this mistake meg my dear meg looked towards him and saw that he had elaborately stationed himself behind the chair of their male visitor where with many mysterious gestures he was holding up the sixpence he had earned i see my dear said trotty as i was coming in half an ounce of tea lying somewhere on the stairs and im pretty sure there was a bit of bacon too as i dont remember where it was exactly ill go myself and try to find em with this inscrutable artifice toby withdrew to purchase the viands he had spoken of for ready money at mrs chickenstalkers and presently came back pretending he had not been able to find them at first in the dark but here they are at last said trotty setting out the tea things all correct i was pretty sure it was tea and a rasher so it is meg my pet if youll just make the tea while your unworthy father toasts the bacon we shall be ready immediate its a curious circumstance said trotty proceeding in his cookery with the assistance of the toasting fork curious but well known to my friends that i never care myself for rashers nor for tea i like to see other people enjoy em said trotty speaking very loud to impress the fact upon his guest but to me as food theyre disagreeable yet trotty sniffed the savour of the hissing baconahas if he liked it and when he poured the boiling water in the tea pot looked lovingly down into the depths of that snug cauldron and suffered the fragrant steam to curl about his nose and wreathe his head and face in a thick cloud however for all this he neither ate nor drank except at the very beginning a mere morsel for forms sake which he appeared to eat with infinite relish but declared was perfectly uninteresting to him no trottys occupation was to see will fern and lilian eat and drink and so was megs and never did spectators at a city dinner or court banquet find such high delight in seeing others feast although it were a monarch or a pope as those two did in looking on that night meg smiled at trotty trotty laughed at meg meg shook her head and made belief to clap her hands applauding trotty trotty conveyed in dumb show unintelligible narratives of how and when and where he had found their visitors to meg and they were happy very happy although thought trotty sorrowfully as he watched megs face that match is broken off i see now ill tell you what said trotty after tea the little one she sleeps with meg i know with good meg cried the child caressing her with meg thats right said trotty and i shouldnt wonder if she kiss megs father wont she im megs father mightily delighted trotty was when the child went timidly towards him and having kissed him fell back upon meg again shes as sensible as solomon said trotty here we come and here weno we donti dont mean thatiwhat was i saying meg my precious meg looked towards their guest who leaned upon her chair and with his face turned from her fondled the childs head half hidden in her lap to be sure said toby to be sure i dont know what im rambling on about to night my wits are wool gathering i think will fern you come along with me youre tired to death and broken down for want of rest you come along with me the man still played with the childs curls still leaned upon megs chair still turned away his face he didnt speak but in his rough coarse fingers clenching and expanding in the fair hair of the child there was an eloquence that said enough yes yes said trotty answering unconsciously what he saw expressed in his daughters face take her with you meg get her to bed there now will ill show you where you lie its not much of a place only a loft but having a loft i always say is one of the great conveniences of living in a mews and till this coach house and stable gets a better let we live here cheap theres plenty of sweet hay up there belonging to a neighbour and its as clean as hands and meg can make it cheer up dont give way a new heart for a new year always the hand released from the childs hair had fallen trembling into trottys hand so trotty talking without intermission led him out as tenderly and easily as if he had been a child himself returning before meg he listened for an instant at the door of her little chamber an adjoining room the child was murmuring a simple prayer before lying down to sleep and when she had remembered megs name dearly dearlyso her words rantrotty heard her stop and ask for his it was some short time before the foolish little old fellow could compose himself to mend the fire and draw his chair to the warm hearth but when he had done so and had trimmed the light he took his newspaper from his pocket and began to read carelessly at first and skimming up and down the columns but with an earnest and a sad attention very soon for this same dreaded paper re directed trottys thoughts into the channel they had taken all that day and which the days events had so marked out and shaped his interest in the two wanderers had set him on another course of thinking and a happier one for the time but being alone again and reading of the crimes and violences of the people he relapsed into his former train in this mood he came to an account and it was not the first he had ever read of a woman who had laid her desperate hands not only on her own life but on that of her young child a crime so terrible and so revolting to his soul dilated with the love of meg that he let the journal drop and fell back in his chair appalled unnatural and cruel toby cried unnatural and cruel none but people who were bad at heart born bad who had no business on the earth could do such deeds its too true all ive heard to day too just too full of proof were bad the chimes took up the words so suddenlyburst out so loud and clear and sonorousthat the bells seemed to strike him in his chair and what was that they said toby veck toby veck waiting for you toby toby veck toby veck waiting for you toby come and see us come and see us drag him to us drag him to us haunt and hunt him haunt and hunt him break his slumbers break his slumbers toby veck toby veck door open wide toby toby veck toby veck door open wide toby then fiercely back to their impetuous strain again and ringing in the very bricks and plaster on the walls toby listened fancy fancy his remorse for having run away from them that afternoon no no nothing of the kind again again and yet a dozen times again haunt and hunt him haunt and hunt him drag him to us drag him to us deafening the whole town meg said trotty softly tapping at her door do you hear anything i hear the bells father surely theyre very loud to night is she asleep said toby making an excuse for peeping in so peacefully and happily i cant leave her yet though father look how she holds my hand meg whispered trotty listen to the bells she listened with her face towards him all the time but it underwent no change she didnt understand them trotty withdrew resumed his seat by the fire and once more listened by himself he remained here a little time it was impossible to bear it their energy was dreadful if the tower door is really open said toby hastily laying aside his apron but never thinking of his hat whats to hinder me from going up into the steeple and satisfying myself if its shut i dont want any other satisfaction thats enough he was pretty certain as he slipped out quietly into the street that he should find it shut and locked for he knew the door well and had so rarely seen it open that he couldnt reckon above three times in all it was a low arched portal outside the church in a dark nook behind a column and had such great iron hinges and such a monstrous lock that there was more hinge and lock than door but what was his astonishment when coming bare headed to the church and putting his hand into this dark nook with a certain misgiving that it might be unexpectedly seized and a shivering propensity to draw it back again he found that the door which opened outwards actually stood ajar he thought on the first surprise of going back or of getting a light or a companion but his courage aided him immediately and he determined to ascend alone what have i to fear said trotty its a church besides the ringers may be there and have forgotten to shut the door so he went in feeling his way as he went like a blind man for it was very dark and very quiet for the chimes were silent the dust from the street had blown into the recess and lying there heaped up made it so soft and velvet like to the foot that there was something startling even in that the narrow stair was so close to the door too that he stumbled at the very first and shutting the door upon himself by striking it with his foot and causing it to rebound back heavily he couldnt open it again this was another reason however for going on trotty groped his way and went on up up up and round and round and up up up higher higher higher up it was a disagreeable staircase for that groping work so low and narrow that his groping hand was always touching something and it often felt so like a man or ghostly figure standing up erect and making room for him to pass without discovery that he would rub the smooth wall upward searching for its face and downward searching for its feet while a chill tingling crept all over him twice or thrice a door or niche broke the monotonous surface and then it seemed a gap as wide as the whole church and he felt on the brink of an abyss and going to tumble headlong down until he found the wall again still up up up and round and round and up up up higher higher higher up at length the dull and stifling atmosphere began to freshen presently to feel quite windy presently it blew so strong that he could hardly keep his legs but he got to an arched window in the tower breast high and holding tight looked down upon the house tops on the smoking chimneys on the blur and blotch of lights towards the place where meg was wondering where he was and calling to him perhaps all kneaded up together in a leaven of mist and darkness this was the belfry where the ringers came he had caught hold of one of the frayed ropes which hung down through apertures in the oaken roof at first he started thinking it was hair then trembled at the very thought of waking the deep bell the bells themselves were higher higher trotty in his fascination or in working out the spell upon him groped his way by ladders now and toilsomely for it was steep and not too certain holding for the feet up up up and climb and clamber up up up higher higher higher up until ascending through the floor and pausing with his head just raised above its beams he came among the bells it was barely possible to make out their great shapes in the gloom but there they were shadowy and dark and dumb a heavy sense of dread and loneliness fell instantly upon him as he climbed into this airy nest of stone and metal his head went round and round he listened and then raised a wild holloa holloa was mournfully protracted by the echoes giddy confused and out of breath and frightened toby looked about him vacantly and sunk down in a swoon chapter iiithird quarter black are the brooding clouds and troubled the deep waters when the sea of thought first heaving from a calm gives up its dead monsters uncouth and wild arise in premature imperfect resurrection the several parts and shapes of different things are joined and mixed by chance and when and how and by what wonderful degrees each separates from each and every sense and object of the mind resumes its usual form and lives again no manthough every man is every day the casket of this type of the great mysterycan tell so when and how the darkness of the night black steeple changed to shining light when and how the solitary tower was peopled with a myriad figures when and how the whispered haunt and hunt him breathing monotonously through his sleep or swoon became a voice exclaiming in the waking ears of trotty break his slumbers when and how he ceased to have a sluggish and confused idea that such things were companioning a host of others that were not there are no dates or means to tell but awake and standing on his feet upon the boards where he had lately lain he saw this goblin sight he saw the tower whither his charmed footsteps had brought him swarming with dwarf phantoms spirits elfin creatures of the bells he saw them leaping flying dropping pouring from the bells without a pause he saw them round him on the ground above him in the air clambering from him by the ropes below looking down upon him from the massive iron girded beams peeping in upon him through the chinks and loopholes in the walls spreading away and away from him in enlarging circles as the water ripples give way to a huge stone that suddenly comes plashing in among them he saw them of all aspects and all shapes he saw them ugly handsome crippled exquisitely formed he saw them young he saw them old he saw them kind he saw them cruel he saw them merry he saw them grim he saw them dance and heard them sing he saw them tear their hair and heard them howl he saw the air thick with them he saw them come and go incessantly he saw them riding downward soaring upward sailing off afar perching near at hand all restless and all violently active stone and brick and slate and tile became transparent to him as to them he saw them in the houses busy at the sleepers beds he saw them soothing people in their dreams he saw them beating them with knotted whips he saw them yelling in their ears he saw them playing softest music on their pillows he saw them cheering some with the songs of birds and the perfume of flowers he saw them flashing awful faces on the troubled rest of others from enchanted mirrors which they carried in their hands he saw these creatures not only among sleeping men but waking also active in pursuits irreconcilable with one another and possessing or assuming natures the most opposite he saw one buckling on innumerable wings to increase his speed another loading himself with chains and weights to retard his he saw some putting the hands of clocks forward some putting the hands of clocks backward some endeavouring to stop the clock entirely he saw them representing here a marriage ceremony there a funeral in this chamber an election in that a ball he saw everywhere restless and untiring motion bewildered by the host of shifting and extraordinary figures as well as by the uproar of the bells which all this while were ringing trotty clung to a wooden pillar for support and turned his white face here and there in mute and stunned astonishment as he gazed the chimes stopped instantaneous change the whole swarm fainted their forms collapsed their speed deserted them they sought to fly but in the act of falling died and melted into air no fresh supply succeeded them one straggler leaped down pretty briskly from the surface of the great bell and alighted on his feet but he was dead and gone before he could turn round some few of the late company who had gambolled in the tower remained there spinning over and over a little longer but these became at every turn more faint and few and feeble and soon went the way of the rest the last of all was one small hunchback who had got into an echoing corner where he twirled and twirled and floated by himself a long time showing such perseverance that at last he dwindled to a leg and even to a foot before he finally retired but he vanished in the end and then the tower was silent then and not before did trotty see in every bell a bearded figure of the bulk and stature of the bellincomprehensibly a figure and the bell itself gigantic grave and darkly watchful of him as he stood rooted to the ground mysterious and awful figures resting on nothing poised in the night air of the tower with their draped and hooded heads merged in the dim roof motionless and shadowy shadowy and dark although he saw them by some light belonging to themselvesnone else was thereeach with its muffled hand upon its goblin mouth he could not plunge down wildly through the opening in the floor for all power of motion had deserted him otherwise he would have done soaye would have thrown himself headforemost from the steeple top rather than have seen them watching him with eyes that would have waked and watched although the pupils had been taken out again again the dread and terror of the lonely place and of the wild and fearful night that reigned there touched him like a spectral hand his distance from all help the long dark winding ghost beleaguered way that lay between him and the earth on which men lived his being high high high up there where it had made him dizzy to see the birds fly in the day cut off from all good people who at such an hour were safe at home and sleeping in their beds all this struck coldly through him not as a reflection but a bodily sensation meantime his eyes and thoughts and fears were fixed upon the watchful figures which rendered unlike any figures of this world by the deep gloom and shade enwrapping and enfolding them as well as by their looks and forms and supernatural hovering above the floor were nevertheless as plainly to be seen as were the stalwart oaken frames cross pieces bars and beams set up there to support the bells these hemmed them in a very forest of hewn timber from the entanglements intricacies and depths of which as from among the boughs of a dead wood blighted for their phantom use they kept their darksome and unwinking watch a blast of airhow cold and shrillcame moaning through the tower as it died away the great bell or the goblin of the great bell spoke what visitor is this it said the voice was low and deep and trotty fancied that it sounded in the other figures as well i thought my name was called by the chimes said trotty raising his hands in an attitude of supplication i hardly know why i am here or how i came i have listened to the chimes these many years they have cheered me often and you have thanked them said the bell a thousand times cried trotty how i am a poor man faltered trotty and could only thank them in words and always so inquired the goblin of the bell have you never done us wrong in words no cried trotty eagerly never done us foul and false and wicked wrong in words pursued the goblin of the bell trotty was about to answer never but he stopped and was confused the voice of time said the phantom cries to man advance time is for his advancement and improvement for his greater worth his greater happiness his better life his progress onward to that goal within its knowledge and its view and set there in the period when time and he began ages of darkness wickedness and violence have come and gonemillions uncountable have suffered lived and diedto point the way before him who seeks to turn him back or stay him on his course arrests a mighty engine which will strike the meddler dead and be the fiercer and the wilder ever for its momentary check i never did so to my knowledge sir said trotty it was quite by accident if i did i wouldnt go to do it im sure who puts into the mouth of time or of its servants said the goblin of the bell a cry of lamentation for days which have had their trial and their failure and have left deep traces of it which the blind may seea cry that only serves the present time by showing men how much it needs their help when any ears can listen to regrets for such a pastwho does this does a wrong and you have done that wrong to us the chimes trottys first excess of fear was gone but he had felt tenderly and gratefully towards the bells as you have seen and when he heard himself arraigned as one who had offended them so weightily his heart was touched with penitence and grief if you knew said trotty clasping his hands earnestlyor perhaps you do knowif you know how often you have kept me company how often you have cheered me up when ive been low how you were quite the plaything of my little daughter meg almost the only one she ever had when first her mother died and she and me were left alone you wont bear malice for a hasty word who hears in us the chimes one note bespeaking disregard or stern regard of any hope or joy or pain or sorrow of the many sorrowed throng who hears us make response to any creed that gauges human passions and affections as it gauges the amount of miserable food on which humanity may pine and wither does us wrong that wrong you have done us said the bell i have said trotty oh forgive me who hears us echo the dull vermin of the earth the putters down of crushed and broken natures formed to be raised up higher than such maggots of the time can crawl or can conceive pursued the goblin of the bell who does so does us wrong and you have done us wrong not meaning it said trotty in my ignorance not meaning it lastly and most of all pursued the bell who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind abandons them as vile and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which they fell from goodgrasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that lost soil and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in the gulf below does wrong to heaven and man to time and to eternity and you have done that wrong spare me cried trotty falling on his knees for mercys sake listen said the shadow listen cried the other shadows listen said a clear and childlike voice which trotty thought he recognised as having heard before the organ sounded faintly in the church below swelling by degrees the melody ascended to the roof and filled the choir and nave expanding more and more it rose up up up up higher higher higher up awakening agitated hearts within the burly piles of oak the hollow bells the iron bound doors the stairs of solid stone until the tower walls were insufficient to contain it and it soared into the sky no wonder that an old mans breast could not contain a sound so vast and mighty it broke from that weak prison in a rush of tears and trotty put his hands before his face listen said the shadow listen said the other shadows listen said the childs voice a solemn strain of blended voices rose into the tower it was a very low and mournful straina dirgeand as he listened trotty heard his child among the singers she is dead exclaimed the old man meg is dead her spirit calls to me i hear it the spirit of your child bewails the dead and mingles with the deaddead hopes dead fancies dead imaginings of youth returned the bell but she is living learn from her life a living truth learn from the creature dearest to your heart how bad the bad are born see every bud and leaf plucked one by one from off the fairest stem and know how bare and wretched it may be follow her to desperation each of the shadowy figures stretched its right arm forth and pointed downward the spirit of the chimes is your companion said the figure go it stands behind you trotty turned and sawthe child the child will fern had carried in the street the child whom meg had watched but now asleep i carried her myself to night said trotty in these arms show him what he calls himself said the dark figures one and all the tower opened at his feet he looked down and beheld his own form lying at the bottom on the outside crushed and motionless no more a living man cried trotty dead dead said the figures all together gracious heaven and the new year past said the figures what he cried shuddering i missed my way and coming on the outside of this tower in the dark fell downa year ago nine years ago replied the figures as they gave the answer they recalled their outstretched hands and where their figures had been there the bells were and they rung their time being come again and once again vast multitudes of phantoms sprung into existence once again were incoherently engaged as they had been before once again faded on the stopping of the chimes and dwindled into nothing what are these he asked his guide if i am not mad what are these spirits of the bells their sound upon the air returned the child they take such shapes and occupations as the hopes and thoughts of mortals and the recollections they have stored up give them and you said trotty wildly what are you hush hush returned the child look here in a poor mean room working at the same kind of embroidery which he had often often seen before her meg his own dear daughter was presented to his view he made no effort to imprint his kisses on her face he did not strive to clasp her to his loving heart he knew that such endearments were for him no more but he held his trembling breath and brushed away the blinding tears that he might look upon her that he might only see her ah changed changed the light of the clear eye how dimmed the bloom how faded from the cheek beautiful she was as she had ever been but hope hope hope oh where was the fresh hope that had spoken to him like a voice she looked up from her work at a companion following her eyes the old man started back in the woman grown he recognised her at a glance in the long silken hair he saw the self same curls around the lips the childs expression lingering still see in the eyes now turned inquiringly on meg there shone the very look that scanned those features when he brought her home then what was this beside him looking with awe into its face he saw a something reigning there a lofty something undefined and indistinct which made it hardly more than a remembrance of that childas yonder figure might beyet it was the same the same and wore the dress hark they were speaking meg said lilian hesitating how often you raise your head from your work to look at me are my looks so altered that they frighten you asked meg nay dear but you smile at that yourself why not smile when you look at me meg i do so do i not she answered smiling on her now you do said lilian but not usually when you think im busy and dont see you you look so anxious and so doubtful that i hardly like to raise my eyes there is little cause for smiling in this hard and toilsome life but you were once so cheerful am i not now cried meg speaking in a tone of strange alarm and rising to embrace her do i make our weary life more weary to you lilian you have been the only thing that made it life said lilian fervently kissing her sometimes the only thing that made me care to live so meg such work such work so many hours so many days so many long long nights of hopeless cheerless never ending worknot to heap up riches not to live grandly or gaily not to live upon enough however coarse but to earn bare bread to scrape together just enough to toil upon and want upon and keep alive in us the consciousness of our hard fate oh meg meg she raised her voice and twined her arms about her as she spoke like one in pain how can the cruel world go round and bear to look upon such lives lilly said meg soothing her and putting back her hair from her wet face why lilly you so pretty and so young oh meg she interrupted holding her at arms length and looking in her face imploringly the worst of all the worst of all strike me old meg wither me and shrivel me and free me from the dreadful thoughts that tempt me in my youth trotty turned to look upon his guide but the spirit of the child had taken flight was gone neither did he himself remain in the same place for sir joseph bowley friend and father of the poor held a great festivity at bowley hall in honour of the natal day of lady bowley and as lady bowley had been born on new years day which the local newspapers considered an especial pointing of the finger of providence to number one as lady bowleys destined figure in creation it was on a new years day that this festivity took place bowley hall was full of visitors the red faced gentleman was there mr filer was there the great alderman cute was therealderman cute had a sympathetic feeling with great people and had considerably improved his acquaintance with sir joseph bowley on the strength of his attentive letter indeed had become quite a friend of the family since thenand many guests were there trottys ghost was there wandering about poor phantom drearily and looking for its guide there was to be a great dinner in the great hall at which sir joseph bowley in his celebrated character of friend and father of the poor was to make his great speech certain plum puddings were to be eaten by his friends and children in another hall first and at a given signal friends and children flocking in among their friends and fathers were to form a family assemblage with not one manly eye therein unmoistened by emotion but there was more than this to happen even more than this sir joseph bowley baronet and member of parliament was to play a match at skittlesreal skittleswith his tenants which quite reminds me said alderman cute of the days of old king hal stout king hal bluff king hal ah fine character very said mr filer dryly for marrying women and murdering em considerably more than the average number of wives by the bye youll marry the beautiful ladies and not murder em eh said alderman cute to the heir of bowley aged twelve sweet boy we shall have this little gentleman in parliament now said the alderman holding him by the shoulders and looking as reflective as he could before we know where we are we shall hear of his successes at the poll his speeches in the house his overtures from governments his brilliant achievements of all kinds ah we shall make our little orations about him in the common council ill be bound before we have time to look about us oh the difference of shoes and stockings trotty thought but his heart yearned towards the child for the love of those same shoeless and stockingless boys predestined by the alderman to turn out bad who might have been the children of poor meg richard moaned trotty roaming among the company to and fro where is he i cant find richard where is richard not likely to be there if still alive but trottys grief and solitude confused him and he still went wandering among the gallant company looking for his guide and saying where is richard show me richard he was wandering thus when he encountered mr fish the confidential secretary in great agitation bless my heart and soul cried mr fish wheres alderman cute has anybody seen the alderman seen the alderman oh dear who could ever help seeing the alderman he was so considerate so affable he bore so much in mind the natural desires of folks to see him that if he had a fault it was the being constantly on view and wherever the great people were there to be sure attracted by the kindred sympathy between great souls was cute several voices cried that he was in the circle round sir joseph mr fish made way there found him and took him secretly into a window near at hand trotty joined them not of his own accord he felt that his steps were led in that direction my dear alderman cute said mr fish a little more this way the most dreadful circumstance has occurred i have this moment received the intelligence i think it will be best not to acquaint sir joseph with it till the day is over you understand sir joseph and will give me your opinion the most frightful and deplorable event fish returned the alderman fish my good fellow what is the matter nothing revolutionary i hope nono attempted interference with the magistrates deedles the banker gasped the secretary deedles brotherswho was to have been here to dayhigh in office in the goldsmiths company not stopped exclaimed the alderman it cant be shot himself good god put a double barrelled pistol to his mouth in his own counting house said mr fish and blew his brains out no motive princely circumstances circumstances exclaimed the alderman a man of noble fortune one of the most respectable of men suicide mr fish by his own hand this very morning returned mr fish oh the brain the brain exclaimed the pious alderman lifting up his hands oh the nerves the nerves the mysteries of this machine called man oh the little that unhinges it poor creatures that we are perhaps a dinner mr fish perhaps the conduct of his son who i have heard ran very wild and was in the habit of drawing bills upon him without the least authority a most respectable man one of the most respectable men i ever knew a lamentable instance mr fish a public calamity i shall make a point of wearing the deepest mourning a most respectable man but there is one above we must submit mr fish we must submit what alderman no word of putting down remember justice your high moral boast and pride come alderman balance those scales throw me into this the empty one no dinner and natures founts in some poor woman dried by starving misery and rendered obdurate to claims for which her offspring has authority in holy mother eve weigh me the two you daniel going to judgment when your day shall come weigh them in the eyes of suffering thousands audience not unmindful of the grim farce you play or supposing that you strayed from your five witsits not so far to go but that it might beand laid hands upon that throat of yours warning your fellows if you have a fellow how they croak their comfortable wickedness to raving heads and stricken hearts what then the words rose up in trottys breast as if they had been spoken by some other voice within him alderman cute pledged himself to mr fish that he would assist him in breaking the melancholy catastrophe to sir joseph when the day was over then before they parted wringing mr fishs hand in bitterness of soul he said the most respectable of men and added that he hardly knew not even he why such afflictions were allowed on earth its almost enough to make one think if one didnt know better said alderman cute that at times some motion of a capsizing nature was going on in things which affected the general economy of the social fabric deedles brothers the skittle playing came off with immense success sir joseph knocked the pins about quite skilfully master bowley took an innings at a shorter distance also and everybody said that now when a baronet and the son of a baronet played at skittles the country was coming round again as fast as it could come at its proper time the banquet was served up trotty involuntarily repaired to the hall with the rest for he felt himself conducted thither by some stronger impulse than his own free will the sight was gay in the extreme the ladies were very handsome the visitors delighted cheerful and good tempered when the lower doors were opened and the people flocked in in their rustic dresses the beauty of the spectacle was at its height but trotty only murmured more and more where is richard he should help and comfort her i cant see richard there had been some speeches made and lady bowleys health had been proposed and sir joseph bowley had returned thanks and had made his great speech showing by various pieces of evidence that he was the born friend and father and so forth and had given as a toast his friends and children and the dignity of labour when a slight disturbance at the bottom of the hall attracted tobys notice after some confusion noise and opposition one man broke through the rest and stood forward by himself not richard no but one whom he had thought of and had looked for many times in a scantier supply of light he might have doubted the identity of that worn man so old and grey and bent but with a blaze of lamps upon his gnarled and knotted head he knew will fern as soon as he stepped forth what is this exclaimed sir joseph rising who gave this man admittance this is a criminal from prison mr fish sir will you have the goodness a minute said will fern a minute my lady you was born on this day along with a new year get me a minutes leave to speak she made some intercession for him sir joseph took his seat again with native dignity the ragged visitorfor he was miserably dressedlooked round upon the company and made his homage to them with a humble bow gentlefolks he said youve drunk the labourer look at me just come from jail said mr fish just come from jail said will and neither for the first time nor the second nor the third nor yet the fourth mr filer was heard to remark testily that four times was over the average and he ought to be ashamed of himself gentlefolks repeated will fern look at me you see im at the worst beyond all hurt or harm beyond your help for the time when your kind words or kind actions could have done me goodhe struck his hand upon his breast and shook his head is gone with the scent of last years beans or clover on the air let me say a word for these pointing to the labouring people in the hall and when youre met together hear the real truth spoke out for once theres not a man here said the host who would have him for a spokesman like enough sir joseph i believe it not the less true perhaps is what i say perhaps thats a proof on it gentlefolks ive lived many a year in this place you may see the cottage from the sunk fence over yonder ive seen the ladies draw it in their books a hundred times it looks well in a picter ive heerd say but there ant weather in picters and maybe tis fitter for that than for a place to live in well i lived there how hardhow bitter hard i lived there i wont say any day in the year and every day you can judge for your own selves he spoke as he had spoken on the night when trotty found him in the street his voice was deeper and more husky and had a trembling in it now and then but he never raised it passionately and seldom lifted it above the firm stern level of the homely facts he stated tis harder than you think for gentlefolks to grow up decent commonly decent in such a place that i growed up a man and not a brute says something for meas i was then as i am now theres nothing can be said for me or done for me im past it i am glad this man has entered observed sir joseph looking round serenely dont disturb him it appears to be ordained he is an example a living example i hope and trust and confidently expect that it will not be lost upon my friends here i dragged on said fern after a moments silence somehow neither me nor any other man knows how but so heavy that i couldnt put a cheerful face upon it or make believe that i was anything but what i was now gentlemenyou gentlemen that sits at sessionswhen you see a man with discontent writ on his face you says to one another hes suspicious i has my doubts says you about will fern watch that fellow i dont say gentlemen it aint quite natral but i say tis so and from that hour whatever will fern does or lets aloneall oneit goes against him alderman cute stuck his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets and leaning back in his chair and smiling winked at a neighbouring chandelier as much as to say of course i told you so the common cry lord bless you we are up to all this sort of thingmyself and human nature now gentlemen said will fern holding out his hands and flushing for an instant in his haggard face see how your laws are made to trap and hunt us when were brought to this i tries to live elsewhere and im a vagabond to jail with him i comes back here i goes a nutting in your woods and breakswho donta limber branch or two to jail with him one of your keepers sees me in the broad day near my own patch of garden with a gun to jail with him i has a natral angry word with that man when im free again to jail with him i cuts a stick to jail with him i eats a rotten apple or a turnip to jail with him its twenty mile away and coming back i begs a trifle on the road to jail with him at last the constable the keeperanybodyfinds me anywhere a doing anything to jail with him for hes a vagrant and a jail bird known and jails the only home hes got the alderman nodded sagaciously as who should say a very good home too do i say this to serve my cause cried fern who can give me back my liberty who can give me back my good name who can give me back my innocent niece not all the lords and ladies in wide england but gentlemen gentlemen dealing with other men like me begin at the right end give us in mercy better homes when were a lying in our cradles give us better food when were a working for our lives give us kinder laws to bring us back when we're a going wrong and dont set jail jail jail afore us everywhere we turn there ant a condescension you can show the labourer then that he wont take as ready and as grateful as a man can be for he has a patient peaceful willing heart but you must put his rightful spirit in him first for whether hes a wreck and ruin such as me or is like one of them that stand here now his spirit is divided from you at this time bring it back gentlefolks bring it back bring it back afore the day comes when even his bible changes in his altered mind and the words seem to him to read as they have sometimes read in my own eyesin jail whither thou goest i can not go where thou lodgest i do not lodge thy people are not my people nor thy god my god a sudden stir and agitation took place in hall trotty thought at first that several had risen to eject the man and hence this change in its appearance but another moment showed him that the room and all the company had vanished from his sight and that his daughter was again before him seated at her work but in a poorer meaner garret than before and with no lilian by her side the frame at which she had worked was put away upon a shelf and covered up the chair in which she had sat was turned against the wall a history was written in these little things and in megs grief worn face oh who could fail to read it meg strained her eyes upon her work until it was too dark to see the threads and when the night closed in she lighted her feeble candle and worked on still her old father was invisible about her looking down upon her loving herhow dearly loving herand talking to her in a tender voice about the old times and the bells though he knew poor trotty though he knew she could not hear him a great part of the evening had worn away when a knock came at her door she opened it a man was on the threshold a slouching moody drunken sloven wasted by intemperance and vice and with his matted hair and unshorn beard in wild disorder but with some traces on him too of having been a man of good proportion and good features in his youth he stopped until he had her leave to enter and she retiring a pace or two from the open door silently and sorrowfully looked upon him trotty had his wish he saw richard may i come in margaret yes come in come in it was well that trotty knew him before he spoke for with any doubt remaining on his mind the harsh discordant voice would have persuaded him that it was not richard but some other man there were but two chairs in the room she gave him hers and stood at some short distance from him waiting to hear what he had to say he sat however staring vacantly at the floor with a lustreless and stupid smile a spectacle of such deep degradation of such abject hopelessness of such a miserable downfall that she put her hands before her face and turned away lest he should see how much it moved her roused by the rustling of her dress or some such trifling sound he lifted his head and began to speak as if there had been no pause since he entered still at work margaret you work late i generally do and early and early so she said she said you never tired or never owned that you tired not all the time you lived together not even when you fainted between work and fasting but i told you that the last time i came you did she answered and i implored you to tell me nothing more and you made me a solemn promise richard that you never would a solemn promise he repeated with a drivelling laugh and vacant stare a solemn promise to be sure a solemn promise awakening as it were after a time in the same manner as before he said with sudden animation how can i help it margaret what am i to do she has been to me again again cried meg clasping her hands o does she think of me so often has she been again twenty times again said richard margaret she haunts me she comes behind me in the street and thrusts it in my hand i hear her foot upon the ashes when im at my work ha ha that ant often and before i can turn my head her voice is in my ear saying richard dont look round for heavens love give her this she brings it where i live she sends it in letters she taps at the window and lays it on the sill what can i do look at it he held out in his hand a little purse and chinked the money it enclosed hide it said meg hide it when she comes again tell her richard that i love her in my soul that i never lie down to sleep but i bless her and pray for her that in my solitary work i never cease to have her in my thoughts that she is with me night and day that if i died to morrow i would remember her with my last breath but that i cannot look upon it he slowly recalled his hand and crushing the purse together said with a kind of drowsy thoughtfulness i told her so i told her so as plain as words could speak ive taken this gift back and left it at her door a dozen times since then but when she came at last and stood before me face to face what could i do you saw her exclaimed meg you saw her o lilian my sweet girl o lilian lilian i saw her he went on to say not answering but engaged in the same slow pursuit of his own thoughts there she stood trembling how does she look richard does she ever speak of me is she thinner my old place at the table whats in my old place and the frame she taught me our old work onhas she burnt it richard there she was i heard her say it meg checked her sobs and with the tears streaming from her eyes bent over him to listen not to lose a breath with his arms resting on his knees and stooping forward in his chair as if what he said were written on the ground in some half legible character which it was his occupation to decipher and connect he went on richard i have fallen very low and you may guess how much i have suffered in having this sent back when i can bear to bring it in my hand to you but you loved her once even in my memory dearly others stepped in between you fears and jealousies and doubts and vanities estranged you from her but you did love her even in my memory i suppose i did he said interrupting himself for a moment i did thats neither here nor thereo richard if you ever did if you have any memory for what is gone and lost take it to her once more once more tell her how i laid my head upon your shoulder where her own head might have lain and was so humble to you richard tell her that you looked into my face and saw the beauty which she used to praise all gone all gone and in its place a poor wan hollow cheek that she would weep to see tell her everything and take it back and she will not refuse again she will not have the heart so he sat musing and repeating the last words until he woke again and rose you wont take it margaret she shook her head and motioned an entreaty to him to leave her good night margaret good night he turned to look upon her struck by her sorrow and perhaps by the pity for himself which trembled in her voice it was a quick and rapid action and for the moment some flash of his old bearing kindled in his form in the next he went as he had come nor did this glimmer of a quenched fire seem to light him to a quicker sense of his debasement in any mood in any grief in any torture of the mind or body megs work must be done she sat down to her task and plied it night midnight still she worked she had a meagre fire the night being very cold and rose at intervals to mend it the chimes rang half past twelve while she was thus engaged and when they ceased she heard a gentle knocking at the door before she could so much as wonder who was there at that unusual hour it opened o youth and beauty happy as ye should be look at this o youth and beauty blest and blessing all within your reach and working out the ends of your beneficent creator look at this she saw the entering figure screamed its name cried lilian it was swift and fell upon its knees before her clinging to her dress up dear up lilian my own dearest never more meg never more here here close to you holding to you feeling your dear breath upon my face sweet lilian darling lilian child of my heartno mothers love can be more tenderlay your head upon my breast never more meg never more when i first looked into your face you knelt before me on my knees before you let me die let it be here you have come back my treasure we will live together work together hope together die together ah kiss my lips meg fold your arms about me press me to your bosom look kindly on me but dont raise me let it be here let me see the last of your dear face upon my knees o youth and beauty happy as ye should be look at this o youth and beauty working out the ends of your beneficent creator look at this forgive me meg so dear so dear forgive me i know you do i see you do but say so meg she said so with her lips on lilians cheek and with her arms twined roundshe knew it nowa broken heart his blessing on you dearest love kiss me once more he suffered her to sit beside his feet and dry them with her hair o meg what mercy and compassion as she died the spirit of the child returning innocent and radiant touched the old man with its hand and beckoned him away chapter ivfourth quarter some new remembrance of the ghostly figures in the bells some faint impression of the ringing of the chimes some giddy consciousness of having seen the swarm of phantoms reproduced and reproduced until the recollection of them lost itself in the confusion of their numbers some hurried knowledge how conveyed to him he knew not that more years had passed and trotty with the spirit of the child attending him stood looking on at mortal company fat company rosy cheeked company comfortable company they were but two but they were red enough for ten they sat before a bright fire with a small low table between them and unless the fragrance of hot tea and muffins lingered longer in that room than in most others the table had seen service very lately but all the cups and saucers being clean and in their proper places in the corner cupboard and the brass toasting fork hanging in its usual nook and spreading its four idle fingers out as if it wanted to be measured for a glove there remained no other visible tokens of the meal just finished than such as purred and washed their whiskers in the person of the basking cat and glistened in the gracious not to say the greasy faces of her patrons this cosy couple married evidently had made a fair division of the fire between them and sat looking at the glowing sparks that dropped into the grate now nodding off into a doze now waking up again when some hot fragment larger than the rest came rattling down as if the fire were coming with it it was in no danger of sudden extinction however for it gleamed not only in the little room and on the panes of window glass in the door and on the curtain half drawn across them but in the little shop beyond a little shop quite crammed and choked with the abundance of its stock a perfectly voracious little shop with a maw as accommodating and full as any sharks cheese butter firewood soap pickles matches bacon table beer peg tops sweetmeats boys kites bird seed cold ham birch brooms hearth stones salt vinegar blacking red herrings stationery lard mushroom ketchup staylaces loaves of bread shuttlecocks eggs and slate pencil everything was fish that came to the net of this greedy little shop and all articles were in its net how many other kinds of petty merchandise were there it would be difficult to say but balls of packthread ropes of onions pounds of candles cabbage nets and brushes hung in bunches from the ceiling like extraordinary fruit while various odd canisters emitting aromatic smells established the veracity of the inscription over the outer door which informed the public that the keeper of this little shop was a licensed dealer in tea coffee tobacco pepper and snuff glancing at such of these articles as were visible in the shining of the blaze and the less cheerful radiance of two smoky lamps which burnt but dimly in the shop itself as though its plethora sat heavy on their lungs and glancing then at one of the two faces by the parlour fire trotty had small difficulty in recognising in the stout old lady mrs chickenstalker always inclined to corpulency even in the days when he had known her as established in the general line and having a small balance against him in her books the features of her companion were less easy to him the great broad chin with creases in it large enough to hide a finger in the astonished eyes that seemed to expostulate with themselves for sinking deeper and deeper into the yielding fat of the soft face the nose afflicted with that disordered action of its functions which is generally termed the snuffles the short thick throat and labouring chest with other beauties of the like description though calculated to impress the memory trotty could at first allot to nobody he had ever known and yet he had some recollection of them too at length in mrs chickenstalkers partner in the general line and in the crooked and eccentric line of life he recognised the former porter of sir joseph bowley an apoplectic innocent who had connected himself in trottys mind with mrs chickenstalker years ago by giving him admission to the mansion where he had confessed his obligations to that lady and drawn on his unlucky head such grave reproach trotty had little interest in a change like this after the changes he had seen but association is very strong sometimes and he looked involuntarily behind the parlour door where the accounts of credit customers were usually kept in chalk there was no record of his name some names were there but they were strange to him and infinitely fewer than of old from which he argued that the porter was an advocate of ready money transactions and on coming into the business had looked pretty sharp after the chickenstalker defaulters so desolate was trotty and so mournful for the youth and promise of his blighted child that it was a sorrow to him even to have no place in mrs chickenstalkers ledger what sort of a night is it anne inquired the former porter of sir joseph bowley stretching out his legs before the fire and rubbing as much of them as his short arms could reach with an air that added here i am if its bad and i dont want to go out if its good blowing and sleeting hard returned his wife and threatening snow dark and very cold im glad to think we had muffins said the former porter in the tone of one who had set his conscience at rest its a sort of night thats meant for muffins likewise crumpets also sally lunns the former porter mentioned each successive kind of eatable as if he were musingly summing up his good actions after which he rubbed his fat legs as before and jerking them at the knees to get the fire upon the yet unroasted parts laughed as if somebody had tickled him youre in spirits tugby my dear observed his wife the firm was tugby late chickenstalker no said tugby no not particular im a little elewated the muffins came so pat with that he chuckled until he was black in the face and had so much ado to become any other colour that his fat legs took the strangest excursions into the air nor were they reduced to anything like decorum until mrs tugby had thumped him violently on the back and shaken him as if he were a great bottle good gracious goodness lord a mercy bless and save the man cried mrs tugby in great terror whats he doing mr tugby wiped his eyes and faintly repeated that he found himself a little elewated then dont be so again thats a dear good soul said mrs tugby if you dont want to frighten me to death with your struggling and fighting mr tugby said he wouldnt but his whole existence was a fight in which if any judgment might be founded on the constantly increasing shortness of his breath and the deepening purple of his face he was always getting the worst of it so its blowing and sleeting and threatening snow and its dark and very cold is it my dear said mr tugby looking at the fire and reverting to the cream and marrow of his temporary elevation hard weather indeed returned his wife shaking her head aye aye years said mr tugby are like christians in that respect some of em die hard some of em die easy this one hasnt many days to run and is making a fight for it i like him all the better theres a customer my love attentive to the rattling door mrs tugby had already risen now then said that lady passing out into the little shop whats wanted oh i beg your pardon sir im sure i didnt think it was you she made this apology to a gentleman in black who with his wristbands tucked up and his hat cocked loungingly on one side and his hands in his pockets sat down astride on the table beer barrel and nodded in return this is a bad business up stairs mrs tugby said the gentleman the man cant live not the back attic cant cried tugby coming out into the shop to join the conference the back attic mr tugby said the gentleman is coming down stairs fast and will be below the basement very soon looking by turns at tugby and his wife he sounded the barrel with his knuckles for the depth of beer and having found it played a tune upon the empty part the back attic mr tugby said the gentleman tugby having stood in silent consternation for some time is going then said tugby turning to his wife he must go you know before hes gone i dont think you can move him said the gentleman shaking his head i wouldnt take the responsibility of saying it could be done myself you had better leave him where he is he cant live long its the only subject said tugby bringing the butter scale down upon the counter with a crash by weighing his fist on it that weve ever had a word upon she and me and look what it comes to hes going to die here after all going to die upon the premises going to die in our house and where should he have died tugby cried his wife in the workhouse he returned what are workhouses made for not for that said mrs tugby with great energy not for that neither did i marry you for that dont think it tugby i wont have it i wont allow it id be separated first and never see your face again when my widows name stood over that door as it did for many years this house being known as mrs chickenstalkers far and wide and never known but to its honest credit and its good report when my widows name stood over that door tugby i knew him as a handsome steady manly independent youth i knew her as the sweetest looking sweetest tempered girl eyes ever saw i knew her father poor old creetur he fell down from the steeple walking in his sleep and killed himself for the simplest hardest working childest hearted man that ever drew the breath of life and when i turn them out of house and home may angels turn me out of heaven as they would and serve me right her old face which had been a plump and dimpled one before the changes which had come to pass seemed to shine out of her as she said these words and when she dried her eyes and shook her head and her handkerchief at tugby with an expression of firmness which it was quite clear was not to be easily resisted trotty said bless her bless her then he listened with a panting heart for what should follow knowing nothing yet but that they spoke of meg if tugby had been a little elevated in the parlour he more than balanced that account by being not a little depressed in the shop where he now stood staring at his wife without attempting a reply secretly conveying howevereither in a fit of abstraction or as a precautionary measureall the money from the till into his own pockets as he looked at her the gentleman upon the table beer cask who appeared to be some authorised medical attendant upon the poor was far too well accustomed evidently to little differences of opinion between man and wife to interpose any remark in this instance he sat softly whistling and turning little drops of beer out of the tap upon the ground until there was a perfect calm when he raised his head and said to mrs tugby late chickenstalker theres something interesting about the woman even now how did she come to marry him why that said mrs tugby taking a seat near him is not the least cruel part of her story sir you see they kept company she and richard many years ago when they were a young and beautiful couple everything was settled and they were to have been married on a new years day but somehow richard got it into his head through what the gentlemen told him that he might do better and that hed soon repent it and that she wasnt good enough for him and that a young man of spirit had no business to be married and the gentlemen frightened her and made her melancholy and timid of his deserting her and of her children coming to the gallows and of its being wicked to be man and wife and a good deal more of it and in short they lingered and lingered and their trust in one another was broken and so at last was the match but the fault was his she would have married him sir joyfully ive seen her heart swell many times afterwards when he passed her in a proud and careless way and never did a woman grieve more truly for a man than she for richard when he first went wrong oh he went wrong did he said the gentleman pulling out the vent peg of the table beer and trying to peep down into the barrel through the hole well sir i dont know that he rightly understood himself you see i think his mind was troubled by their having broke with one another and that but for being ashamed before the gentlemen and perhaps for being uncertain too how she might take it hed have gone through any suffering or trial to have had megs promise and megs hand again thats my belief he never said so mores the pity he took to drinking idling bad companions all the fine resources that were to be so much better for him than the home he might have had he lost his looks his character his health his strength his friends his work everything he didnt lose everything mrs tugby returned the gentleman because he gained a wife and i want to know how he gained her im coming to it sir in a moment this went on for years and years he sinking lower and lower she enduring poor thing miseries enough to wear her life away at last he was so cast down and cast out that no one would employ or notice him and doors were shut upon him go where he would applying from place to place and door to door and coming for the hundredth time to one gentleman who had often and often tried him he was a good workman to the very end that gentleman who knew his history said i believe you are incorrigible there is only one person in the world who has a chance of reclaiming you ask me to trust you no more until she tries to do it something like that in his anger and vexation ah said the gentleman well well sir he went to her and kneeled to her said it was so said it ever had been so and made a prayer to her to save him and shedont distress yourself mrs tugby she came to me that night to ask me about living here what he was once to me she said is buried in a grave side by side with what i was to him but i have thought of this and i will make the trial in the hope of saving him for the love of the light hearted girl you remember her who was to have been married on a new years day and for the love of her richard and she said he had come to her from lilian and lilian had trusted to him and she never could forget that so they were married and when they came home here and i saw them i hoped that such prophecies as parted them when they were young may not often fulfil themselves as they did in this case or i wouldnt be the makers of them for a mine of gold the gentleman got off the cask and stretched himself observing i suppose he used her ill as soon as they were married i dont think he ever did that said mrs tugby shaking her head and wiping her eyes he went on better for a short time but his habits were too old and strong to be got rid of he soon fell back a little and was falling fast back when his illness came so strong upon him i think he has always felt for her i am sure he has i have seen him in his crying fits and tremblings try to kiss her hand and i have heard him call her meg and say it was her nineteenth birthday there he has been lying now these weeks and months between him and her baby she has not been able to do her old work and by not being able to be regular she has lost it even if she could have done it how they have lived i hardly know i know muttered mr tugby looking at the till and round the shop and at his wife and rolling his head with immense intelligence like fighting cocks he was interrupted by a crya sound of lamentationfrom the upper story of the house the gentleman moved hurriedly to the door my friend he said looking back you neednt discuss whether he shall be removed or not he has spared you that trouble i believe saying so he ran up stairs followed by mrs tugby while mr tugby panted and grumbled after them at leisure being rendered more than commonly short winded by the weight of the till in which there had been an inconvenient quantity of copper trotty with the child beside him floated up the staircase like mere air follow her follow her follow her he heard the ghostly voices in the bells repeat their words as he ascended learn it from the creature dearest to your heart it was over it was over and this was she her fathers pride and joy this haggard wretched woman weeping by the bed if it deserved that name and pressing to her breast and hanging down her head upon an infant who can tell how spare how sickly and how poor an infant who can tell how dear thank god cried trotty holding up his folded hands o god be thanked she loves her child the gentleman not otherwise hard hearted or indifferent to such scenes than that he saw them every day and knew that they were figures of no moment in the filer sumsmere scratches in the working of these calculationslaid his hand upon the heart that beat no more and listened for the breath and said his pain is over its better as it is mrs tugby tried to comfort her with kindness mr tugby tried philosophy come come he said with his hands in his pockets you mustnt give way you know that wont do you must fight up what would have become of me if i had given way when i was porter and we had as many as six runaway carriage doubles at our door in one night but i fell back upon my strength of mind and didnt open it again trotty heard the voices saying follow her he turned towards his guide and saw it rising from him passing through the air follow her it said and vanished he hovered round her sat down at her feet looked up into her face for one trace of her old self listened for one note of her old pleasant voice he flitted round the child so wan so prematurely old so dreadful in its gravity so plaintive in its feeble mournful miserable wail he almost worshipped it he clung to it as her only safeguard as the last unbroken link that bound her to endurance he set his fathers hope and trust on the frail baby watched her every look upon it as she held it in her arms and cried a thousand times she loves it god be thanked she loves it he saw the woman tend her in the night return to her when her grudging husband was asleep and all was still encourage her shed tears with her set nourishment before her he saw the day come and the night again the day the night the time go by the house of death relieved of death the room left to herself and to the child he heard it moan and cry he saw it harass her and tire her out and when she slumbered in exhaustion drag her back to consciousness and hold her with its little hands upon the rack but she was constant to it gentle with it patient with it patient was its loving mother in her inmost heart and soul and had its being knitted up with hers as when she carried it unborn all this time she was in want languishing away in dire and pining want with the baby in her arms she wandered here and there in quest of occupation and with its thin face lying in her lap and looking up in hers did any work for any wretched sum a day and night of labour for as many farthings as there were figures on the dial if she had quarrelled with it if she had neglected it if she had looked upon it with a moments hate if in the frenzy of an instant she had struck it no his comfort was she loved it always she told no one of her extremity and wandered abroad in the day lest she should be questioned by her only friend for any help she received from her hands occasioned fresh disputes between the good woman and her husband and it was new bitterness to be the daily cause of strife and discord where she owed so much she loved it still she loved it more and more but a change fell on the aspect of her love one night she was singing faintly to it in its sleep and walking to and fro to hush it when her door was softly opened and a man looked in for the last time he said william fern for the last time he listened like a man pursued and spoke in whispers margaret my race is nearly run i couldnt finish it without a parting word with you without one grateful word what have you done she asked regarding him with terror he looked at her but gave no answer after a short silence he made a gesture with his hand as if he set her question by as if he brushed it aside and said its long ago margaret now but that night is as fresh in my memory as ever twas we little thought then he added looking round that we should ever meet like this your child margaret let me have it in my arms let me hold your child he put his hat upon the floor and took it and he trembled as he took it from head to foot is it a girl yes he put his hand before its little face see how weak im grown margaret when i want the courage to look at it let her be a moment i wont hurt her its long ago butwhats her name margaret she answered quickly im glad of that he said im glad of that he seemed to breathe more freely and after pausing for an instant took away his hand and looked upon the infants face but covered it again immediately margaret he said and gave her back the child its lilians lilians i held the same face in my arms when lilians mother died and left her when lilians mother died and left her she repeated wildly how shrill you speak why do you fix your eyes upon me so margaret she sunk down in a chair and pressed the infant to her breast and wept over it sometimes she released it from her embrace to look anxiously in its face then strained it to her bosom again at those times when she gazed upon it then it was that something fierce and terrible began to mingle with her love then it was that her old father quailed follow her was sounded through the house learn it from the creature dearest to your heart margaret said fern bending over her and kissing her upon the brow i thank you for the last time good night good bye put your hand in mine and tell me youll forget me from this hour and try to think the end of me was here what have you done she asked again therell be a fire to night he said removing from her therell be fires this winter time to light the dark nights east west north and south when you see the distant sky red theyll be blazing when you see the distant sky red think of me no more or if you do remember what a hell was lighted up inside of me and think you see its flames reflected in the clouds good night good bye she called to him but he was gone she sat down stupefied until her infant roused her to a sense of hunger cold and darkness she paced the room with it the livelong night hushing it and soothing it she said at intervals like lilian when her mother died and left her why was her step so quick her eye so wild her love so fierce and terrible whenever she repeated those words but it is love said trotty it is love shell never cease to love it my poor meg she dressed the child next morning with unusual careah vain expenditure of care upon such squalid robesand once more tried to find some means of life it was the last day of the old year she tried till night and never broke her fast she tried in vain she mingled with an abject crowd who tarried in the snow until it pleased some officer appointed to dispense the public charity the lawful charity not that once preached upon a mount to call them in and question them and say to this one go to such a place to that one come next week to make a football of another wretch and pass him here and there from hand to hand from house to house until he wearied and lay down to die or started up and robbed and so became a higher sort of criminal whose claims allowed of no delay here too she failed she loved her child and wished to have it lying on her breast and that was quite enough it was night a bleak dark cutting night when pressing the child close to her for warmth she arrived outside the house she called her home she was so faint and giddy that she saw no one standing in the doorway until she was close upon it and about to enter then she recognised the master of the house who had so disposed himselfwith his person it was not difficultas to fill up the whole entry o he said softly you have come back she looked at the child and shook her head dont you think you have lived here long enough without paying any rent dont you think that without any money youve been a pretty constant customer at this shop now said mr tugby she repeated the same mute appeal suppose you try and deal somewhere else he said and suppose you provide yourself with another lodging come dont you think you could manage it she said in a low voice that it was very late to morrow now i see what you want said tugby and what you mean you know there are two parties in this house about you and you delight in setting em by the ears i dont want any quarrels im speaking softly to avoid a quarrel but if you dont go away ill speak out loud and you shall cause words high enough to please you but you shant come in that i am determined she put her hair back with her hand and looked in a sudden manner at the sky and the dark lowering distance this is the last night of an old year and i wont carry ill blood and quarrellings and disturbances into a new one to please you nor anybody else said tugby who was quite a retail friend and father i wonder you ant ashamed of yourself to carry such practices into a new year if you havent any business in the world but to be always giving way and always making disturbances between man and wife youd be better out of it go along with you follow her to desperation again the old man heard the voices looking up he saw the figures hovering in the air and pointing where she went down the dark street she loves it he exclaimed in agonised entreaty for her chimes she loves it still follow her the shadow swept upon the track she had taken like a cloud he joined in the pursuit he kept close to her he looked into her face he saw the same fierce and terrible expression mingling with her love and kindling in her eyes he heard her say like lilian to be changed like lilian and her speed redoubled o for something to awaken her for any sight or sound or scent to call up tender recollections in a brain on fire for any gentle image of the past to rise before her i was her father i was her father cried the old man stretching out his hands to the dark shadows flying on above have mercy on her and on me where does she go turn her back i was her father but they only pointed to her as she hurried on and said to desperation learn it from the creature dearest to your heart a hundred voices echoed it the air was made of breath expended in those words he seemed to take them in at every gasp he drew they were everywhere and not to be escaped and still she hurried on the same light in her eyes the same words in her mouth like lilian to be changed like lilian all at once she stopped now turn her back exclaimed the old man tearing his white hair my child meg turn her back great father turn her back in her own scanty shawl she wrapped the baby warm with her fevered hands she smoothed its limbs composed its face arranged its mean attire in her wasted arms she folded it as though she never would resign it more and with her dry lips kissed it in a final pang and last long agony of love putting its tiny hand up to her neck and holding it there within her dress next to her distracted heart she set its sleeping face against her closely steadily against her and sped onward to the river to the rolling river swift and dim where winter night sat brooding like the last dark thoughts of many who had sought a refuge there before her where scattered lights upon the banks gleamed sullen red and dull as torches that were burning there to show the way to death where no abode of living people cast its shadow on the deep impenetrable melancholy shade to the river to that portal of eternity her desperate footsteps tended with the swiftness of its rapid waters running to the sea he tried to touch her as she passed him going down to its dark level but the wild distempered form the fierce and terrible love the desperation that had left all human check or hold behind swept by him like the wind he followed her she paused a moment on the brink before the dreadful plunge he fell down on his knees and in a shriek addressed the figures in the bells now hovering above them i have learnt it cried the old man from the creature dearest to my heart o save her save her he could wind his fingers in her dress could hold it as the words escaped his lips he felt his sense of touch return and knew that he detained her the figures looked down steadfastly upon him i have learnt it cried the old man o have mercy on me in this hour if in my love for her so young and good i slandered nature in the breasts of mothers rendered desperate pity my presumption wickedness and ignorance and save her he felt his hold relaxing they were silent still have mercy on her he exclaimed as one in whom this dreadful crime has sprung from love perverted from the strongest deepest love we fallen creatures know think what her misery must have been when such seed bears such fruit heaven meant her to be good there is no loving mother on the earth who might not come to this if such a life had gone before o have mercy on my child who even at this pass means mercy to her own and dies herself and perils her immortal soul to save it she was in his arms he held her now his strength was like a giants i see the spirit of the chimes among you cried the old man singling out the child and speaking in some inspiration which their looks conveyed to him i know that our inheritance is held in store for us by time i know there is a sea of time to rise one day before which all who wrong us or oppress us will be swept away like leaves i see it on the flow i know that we must trust and hope and neither doubt ourselves nor doubt the good in one another i have learnt it from the creature dearest to my heart i clasp her in my arms again o spirits merciful and good i take your lesson to my breast along with her o spirits merciful and good i am grateful he might have said more but the bells the old familiar bells his own dear constant steady friends the chimes began to ring the joy peals for a new year so lustily so merrily so happily so gaily that he leapt upon his feet and broke the spell that bound him and whatever you do father said meg dont eat tripe again without asking some doctor whether its likely to agree with you for how you have been going on good gracious she was working with her needle at the little table by the fire dressing her simple gown with ribbons for her wedding so quietly

for a dance in half a second meg and richard at the top and the drum was on the very brink of feathering away with all his power when a combination of prodigious sounds was heard outside and a good humoured comely woman of some fifty years of age or thereabouts came running in attended by a man bearing a stone pitcher of terrific size and closely followed by the marrow bones and cleavers and the bells not the bells but a portable collection on a frame trotty said its mrs chickenstalker and sat down and beat his knees again married and not tell me meg cried the good woman never i couldnt rest
