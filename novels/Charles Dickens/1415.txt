transcribed from the chapman and hall christmas stories edition by david price email ccxcoventryacuk doctor marigold i am a cheap jack and my own father's name was willum marigold it was in his lifetime supposed by some that his name was william but my own father always consistently said no it was willum on which point i content myself with looking at the argument this way if a man is not allowed to know his own name in a free country how much is he allowed to know in a land of slavery as to looking at the argument through the medium of the register willum marigold come into the world before registers come up much and went out of it too they wouldn't have been greatly in his line neither if they had chanced to come up before him i was born on the queen's highway but it was the king's at that time a doctor was fetched to my own mother by my own father when it took place on a common and in consequence of his being a very kind gentleman and accepting no fee but a tea tray i was named doctor out of gratitude and compliment to him there you have me doctor marigold i am at present a middle aged man of a broadish build in cords leggings and a sleeved waistcoat the strings of which is always gone behind repair them how you will they go like fiddle strings you have been to the theatre and you have seen one of the wiolin players screw up his wiolin after listening to it as if it had been whispering the secret to him that it feared it was out of order and then you have heard it snap that's as exactly similar to my waistcoat as a waistcoat and a wiolin can be like one another i am partial to a white hat and i like a shawl round my neck wore loose and easy sitting down is my favourite posture if i have a taste in point of personal jewelry it is mother of pearl buttons there you have me again as large as life the doctor having accepted a tea tray you'll guess that my father was a cheap jack before me you are right he was it was a pretty tray it represented a large lady going along a serpentining up hill gravel walk to attend a little church two swans had likewise come astray with the same intentions when i call her a large lady i don't mean in point of breadth for there she fell below my views but she more than made it up in heighth her heighth and slimness was in short the heighth of both i often saw that tray after i was the innocently smiling cause or more likely screeching one of the doctor's standing it up on a table against the wall in his consulting room whenever my own father and mother were in that part of the country i used to put my head i have heard my own mother say it was flaxen curls at that time though you wouldn't know an old hearth broom from it now till you come to the handle and found it wasn't me in at the doctor's door and the doctor was always glad to see me and said aha my brother practitioner come in little md how are your inclinations as to sixpence you can't go on for ever you'll find nor yet could my father nor yet my mother if you don't go off as a whole when you are about due you're liable to go off in part and two to one your head's the part gradually my father went off his and my mother went off hers it was in a harmless way but it put out the family where i boarded them the old couple though retired got to be wholly and solely devoted to the cheap jack business and were always selling the family off whenever the cloth was laid for dinner my father began rattling the plates and dishes as we do in our line when we put up crockery for a bid only he had lost the trick of it and mostly let 'em drop and broke 'em as the old lady had been used to sit in the cart and hand the articles out one by one to the old gentleman on the footboard to sell just in the same way she handed him every item of the family's property and they disposed of it in their own imaginations from morning to night at last the old gentleman lying bedridden in the same room with the old lady cries out in the old patter fluent after having been silent for two days and nights now here my jolly companions every one which the nightingale club in a village was held at the sign of the cabbage and shears where the singers no doubt would have greatly excelled but for want of taste voices and ears now here my jolly companions every one is a working model of a used up old cheap jack without a tooth in his head and with a pain in every bone so like life that it would be just as good if it wasn't better just as bad if it wasn't worse and just as new if it wasn't worn out bid for the working model of the old cheap jack who has drunk more gunpowder tea with the ladies in his time than would blow the lid off a washerwoman's copper and carry it as many thousands of miles higher than the moon as naught nix naught divided by the national debt carry nothing to the poor rates three under and two over now my hearts of oak and men of straw what do you say for the lot two shillings a shilling tenpence eightpence sixpence fourpence twopence who said twopence the gentleman in the scarecrow's hat i am ashamed of the gentleman in the scarecrow's hat i really am ashamed of him for his want of public spirit now i'll tell you what i'll do with you come i'll throw you in a working model of a old woman that was married to the old cheap jack so long ago that upon my word and honour it took place in noah's ark before the unicorn could get in to forbid the banns by blowing a tune upon his horn there now come what do you say for both i'll tell you what i'll do with you i don't bear you malice for being so backward here if you make me a bid that'll only reflect a little credit on your town i'll throw you in a warming pan for nothing and lend you a toasting fork for life now come what do you say after that splendid offer say two pound say thirty shillings say a pound say ten shillings say five say two and six you don't say even two and six you say two and three no you shan't have the lot for two and three i'd sooner give it to you if you was good looking enough here missis chuck the old man and woman into the cart put the horse to and drive 'em away and bury 'em such were the last words of willum marigold my own father and they were carried out by him and by his wife my own mother on one and the same day as i ought to know having followed as mourner my father had been a lovely one in his time at the cheap jack work as his dying observations went to prove but i top him i don't say it because it's myself but because it has been universally acknowledged by all that has had the means of comparison i have worked at it i have measured myself against other public speakers members of parliament platforms pulpits counsel learned in the law and where i have found 'em good i have took a bit of imagination from 'em and where i have found 'em bad i have let 'em alone now i'll tell you what i mean to go down into my grave declaring that of all the callings ill used in great britain the cheap jack calling is the worst used why ain't we a profession why ain't we endowed with privileges why are we forced to take out a hawker's license when no such thing is expected of the political hawkers where's the difference betwixt us except that we are cheap jacks and they are dear jacks i don't see any difference but what's in our favour for look here say it's election time i am on the

i'll give you that and it's a rolling pin and if the baby can only get it well into its mouth when its teeth is coming and rub the gums once with it they'll come through double in a fit of laughter equal to being tickled stop again i'll throw you in another article because i don't like the looks of you for you haven't the appearance of buyers unless i lose by you and because i'd rather lose than not take money to night and that's a looking glass in which you may see how ugly you look when you don't bid what do you say now come do you say a pound not you for you haven't got it do you say ten shillings not you for you owe more to the tallyman well then i'll tell you what i'll do with you i'll heap 'em all on the footboard of the cart there they are razors flat watch dinner plates rolling

altogether and the lot's your own on your own terms there you won't take it yet well then i'll tell you what i'll do with you come you are such free and independent woters and i am so proud of you you

out two thousand seven hundred and fifty pound on the footboard of the cart to be dropped in the streets of your magnificent town for them to pick up that can what do you say come now you won't do better and you may do worse you take it hooray sold again and got the seat these dear jacks soap the people shameful but we cheap jacks don't we tell 'em the truth about themselves to their faces and scorn to court 'em as to wenturesomeness in the way of puffing up the lots the dear jacks beat us hollow it is considered in the cheap jack calling that better patter can be made out of a gun than any article we put up from the cart except a pair of spectacles i often hold forth about a gun for a quarter of an hour and feel as if i need never leave off but when i tell 'em what the gun can do and what the gun has brought down i never go half so far as the dear jacks do when they make speeches in praise of their guns their great guns that set 'em on to do it besides i'm in business for myself i ain't sent down into the market place to order as they are besides again my guns don't know what i say in their laudation and their guns do and the whole concern of 'em have reason to be sick and ashamed all round these are some of my arguments for declaring that the cheap jack calling is treated ill in great britain and for turning warm when i think of the other jacks in question setting themselves up to pretend to look down upon it i courted my wife from the footboard of the cart i did indeed she was a suffolk young woman and it was in ipswich market place right opposite the corn chandler's shop i had noticed her up at a window last saturday that was appreciating highly i had took to her and i had said to myself if not already disposed of i'll have that lot next saturday that come i pitched the cart on the same pitch and i was in very high feather indeed keeping 'em laughing the whole of the time and getting off the goods briskly at last i took out of my waistcoat pocket a small lot wrapped in soft paper and i put it this way looking up at the window where she was now here my blooming english maidens is an article the last article of the present evening's sale which i offer to only you the lovely suffolk dumplings biling over with beauty and i won't take a bid of a thousand pounds for from any man alive now what is it why i'll tell you what it is it's made of fine gold and it's not broke though there's a hole in the middle of it and it's stronger than any fetter that ever was forged though it's smaller than any finger in my set of ten why ten because when my parents made over my property to me i tell you true there was twelve sheets twelve towels twelve table cloths twelve knives twelve forks twelve tablespoons and twelve teaspoons but my set of fingers was two short of a dozen and could never since be matched now what else is it come i'll tell you it's a hoop of solid gold wrapped in a silver curl paper that i myself took off the shining locks of the ever beautiful old lady in threadneedle street london city i wouldn't tell you so if i hadn't the paper to show or you mightn't believe it even of me now what else is it it's a man trap and a handcuff the parish stocks and a leg lock all in gold and all in one now what else is it it's a wedding ring now i'll tell you what i'm a going to do with it i'm not a going to offer this lot for money but i mean to give it to the next of you beauties that laughs and i'll pay her a visit to morrow morning at exactly half after nine o'clock as the chimes go and i'll take her out for a walk to put up the banns she laughed and got the ring handed up to her when i called in the morning she says o dear it's never you and you never mean it it's ever me says i and i am ever yours and i ever mean it so we got married after being put up three times which by the bye is quite in the cheap jack way again and shows once more how the cheap jack customs pervade society she wasn't a bad wife but she had a temper if she could have parted with that one article at a sacrifice i wouldn't have swopped her away in exchange for any other woman in england not that i ever did swop her away for we lived together till she died and that was thirteen year now my lords and ladies and gentlefolks all i'll let you into a secret though you won't believe it thirteen year of temper in a palace would try the worst of you but thirteen year of temper in a cart would try the best of you you are kept so very close to it in a cart you see there's thousands of couples among you getting on like sweet ile upon a whetstone in houses five and six pairs of stairs high that would go to the divorce court in a cart whether the jolting makes it worse i don't undertake to decide but in a cart it does come home to you and stick to you wiolence in a cart is so wiolent and aggrawation in a cart is so aggrawating we might have had such a pleasant life a roomy cart with the large goods hung outside and the bed slung underneath it when on the road an iron pot and a kettle a fireplace for the cold weather a chimney for the smoke a hanging shelf and a cupboard a dog and a horse what more do you want you draw off upon a bit of turf in a green lane or by the roadside you hobble your old horse and turn him grazing you light your fire upon the ashes of the last visitors you cook your stew and you wouldn't call the emperor of france your father but have a temper in the cart flinging language and the hardest goods in stock at you and where are you then put a name to your feelings my dog knew as well when she was on the turn as i did before she broke out he would give a howl and bolt how he knew it was a mystery to me but the sure and certain knowledge of it would wake him up out of his soundest sleep and he would give a howl and bolt at such times i wished i was him the worst of it was we had a daughter born to us and i love children with all my heart when she was in her furies she beat the child this got to be so shocking as the child got to be four or five year old that i have many a time gone on with my whip over my shoulder at the old horse's head sobbing and crying worse than ever little sophy did for how could i prevent it such a thing is not to be tried with such a temper in a cart without coming to a fight it's in the natural size and formation of a cart to bring it to a fight and then the poor child got worse terrified than before as well as worse hurt generally and her mother made complaints to the next people we lighted on and the word went round here's a wretch of a cheap jack been a beating his wife little sophy was such a brave child she grew to be quite devoted to her poor father though he could do so little to help her she had a wonderful quantity of shining dark hair all curling natural about her it is quite astonishing to me now that i didn't go tearing mad when i used to see her run from her mother before the cart and her mother catch her by this hair and pull her down by it and beat her such a brave child i said she was ah with reason don't you mind next time father dear she would whisper to me with her little face still flushed and her bright eyes still wet if i don't cry out you may know i am not much hurt and even if i do cry out it will only be to get mother to let go and leave off what i have seen the little spirit bear for me without crying out yet in other respects her mother took great care of her her clothes were always clean and neat and her mother was never tired of working at 'em such is the inconsistency in things our being down in the marsh country in unhealthy weather i consider the cause of sophy's taking bad low fever but however she took it once she got it she turned away from her mother for evermore and nothing would persuade her to be touched by her mother's hand she would shiver and say no no no when it was offered at and would hide her face on my shoulder and hold me tighter round the neck the cheap jack business had been worse than ever i had known it what with one thing and what with another and not least with railroads which will cut it all to pieces i expect at last and i was run dry of money for which reason one night at that period of little sophy's being so bad either we must have come to a dead lock for victuals and drink or i must have pitched the cart as i did i couldn't get the dear child to lie down or leave go of me and indeed i hadn't the heart to try so i stepped out on the footboard with her holding round my neck they all set up a laugh when they see us and one chuckle headed joskin that i hated for it made the bidding tuppence for her now you country boobies says i feeling as if my heart was a heavy weight at the end of a broken sashline i give you notice that i am a going to charm the money out of your pockets and to give you so much more than your money's worth that you'll only persuade yourselves to draw your saturday night's wages ever again arterwards by the hopes of meeting me to lay 'em out with which you never will and why not because i've made my fortunes by selling my goods on a large scale for seventy five per cent less than i give for 'em and i am consequently to be elevated to the house of peers next week by the title of the duke of cheap and markis jackaloorul now let's know what you want to night and you shall have it but first of all shall i tell you why i have got this little girl round my neck you don't want to know then you shall she belongs to the fairies she's a fortune teller she can tell me all about you in a whisper and can put me up to whether you're going to buy a lot or leave it now do you want a saw no she says you don't because you're too clumsy to use one else here's a saw which would be a lifelong blessing to a handy man at four shillings at three and six at three at two and six at two at eighteen pence but none of you shall have it at any price on account of your well known awkwardness which would make it manslaughter the same objection applies to this set of three planes which i won't let you have neither so don't bid for 'em now i am a going to ask her what you do want then i whispered your head burns so that i am afraid it hurts you bad my pet and she answered without opening her heavy eyes just a little father o this little fortune teller says it's a memorandum book you want then why didn't you mention it here it is look at it two hundred superfine hot pressed wire wove pages if you don't believe me count 'em ready ruled for your expenses an everlastingly pointed pencil to put 'em down with a double bladed penknife to scratch 'em out with a book of printed tables to calculate your income with and a camp stool to sit down upon while you give your mind to it stop and an umbrella to keep the moon off when you give your mind to it on a pitch dark night now i won't ask you how much for the lot but how little how little are you thinking of don't be ashamed to mention it because my fortune teller knows already then making believe to whisper i kissed her and she kissed me why she says you are thinking of as little as three and threepence i couldn't have believed it even of you unless she told me three and threepence and a set of printed tables in the lot that'll calculate your income up to forty thousand a year with an income of forty thousand a year you grudge three and sixpence well then i'll tell you my opinion i so despise the threepence that i'd sooner take three shillings there for three shillings three shillings three shillings gone hand 'em over to the lucky man as there had been no bid at all everybody looked about and grinned at everybody while i touched little sophy's face and asked her if she felt faint or giddy not very father it will soon be over then turning from the pretty patient eyes which were opened now and seeing nothing but grins across my lighted grease pot i went on again in my cheap jack style where's the butcher my sorrowful eye had just caught sight of a fat young butcher on the outside of the crowd she says the good luck is the butcher's where is he everybody handed on the blushing butcher to the front and there was a roar and the butcher felt himself obliged to put his hand in his pocket and take the lot the party so picked out in general does feel obliged to take the lot good four times out of six then we had another lot the counterpart of that one and sold it sixpence cheaper which is always wery much enjoyed then we had the spectacles it ain't a special profitable lot but i put 'em on and i see what the chancellor of the exchequer is going to take off the taxes and i see what the sweetheart of the young woman in the shawl is doing at home and i see what the bishops has got for dinner and a deal more that seldom fails to fetch 'em 'up in their spirits and the better their spirits the better their bids then we had the ladies' lot the teapot tea caddy glass sugar basin half a dozen spoons and caudle cup and all the time i was making similar excuses to give a look or two and say a word or two to my poor child it was while the second ladies' lot was holding 'em enchained that i felt her lift herself a little on my shoulder to look across the dark street what troubles you darling nothing troubles me father i am not at all troubled but don't i see a pretty churchyard over there yes my dear kiss me twice dear father and lay me down to rest upon that churchyard grass so soft and green i staggered back into the cart with her head dropped on my shoulder and i says to her mother quick shut the door don't let those laughing people see what's the matter she cries o woman woman i tells her you'll never catch my little sophy by her hair again for she has flown away from you maybe those were harder words than i meant 'em but from that time forth my wife took to brooding and would sit in the cart or walk beside it hours at a stretch with her arms crossed and her eyes looking on the ground when her furies took her which was rather seldomer than before they took her in a new way and she banged herself about to that extent that i was forced to hold her she got none the better for a little drink now and then and through some years i used to wonder as i plodded along at the old horse's head whether there was many carts upon the road that held so much dreariness as mine for all my being looked up to as the king of the cheap jacks so sad our lives went on till one summer evening when as we were coming into exeter out of the farther west of england we saw a woman beating a child in a cruel manner who screamed don't beat me o mother mother mother then my wife stopped her ears and ran away like a wild thing and next day she was found in the river me and my dog were all the company left in the cart now and the dog learned to give a short bark when they wouldn't bid and to give another and a nod of his head when i asked him who said half a crown are you the gentleman sir that offered half a crown he attained to an immense height of popularity and i shall always believe taught himself entirely out of his own head to growl at any person in the crowd that bid as low as sixpence but he got to be well on in years and one night when i was conwulsing york with the spectacles he took a conwulsion on his own account upon the very footboard by me and it finished him being naturally of a tender turn i had dreadful lonely feelings on me arter this i conquered 'em at selling times having a reputation to keep not to mention keeping myself but they got me down in private and rolled upon me that's often the way with us public characters see us on the footboard and you'd give pretty well anything you possess to be us see us off the footboard and you'd add a trifle to be off your bargain it was under those circumstances that i come acquainted with a giant i might have been too high to fall into conversation with him had it not been for my lonely feelings for the general rule is going round the country to draw the line at dressing up when a man can't trust his getting a living to his undisguised abilities you consider him below your sort and this giant when on view figured as a roman he was a languid young man which i attribute to the distance betwixt his extremities he had a little head and less in it he had weak eyes and weak knees and altogether you couldn't look at him without feeling that there was greatly too much of him both for his joints and his mind but he was an amiable though timid young man his mother let him out and spent the money and we come acquainted when he was walking to ease the horse betwixt two fairs he was called rinaldo di velasco his name being pickleson this giant otherwise pickleson mentioned to me under the seal of confidence that beyond his being a burden to himself his life was made a burden to him by the cruelty of his master towards a step daughter who was deaf and dumb her mother was dead and she had no living soul to take her part and was used most hard she travelled with his master's caravan only because there was nowhere to leave her and this giant otherwise pickleson did go so far as to believe that his master often tried to lose her he was such a very languid young man that i don't know how long it didn't take him to get this story out but it passed through his defective circulation to his top extremity in course of time when i heard this account from the giant otherwise pickleson and likewise that the poor girl had beautiful long dark hair and was often pulled down by it and beaten i couldn't see the giant through what stood in my eyes having wiped 'em i give him sixpence for he was kept as short as he was long and he laid it out in two three penn'orths of gin and water which so brisked him up that he sang the favourite comic of shivery shakey ain't it cold a popular effect which his master had tried every other means to get out of him as a roman wholly in vain his master's name was mim a wery hoarse man and i knew him to speak to i went to that fair as a mere civilian leaving the cart outside the town and i looked about the back of the vans while the performing was going on and at last sitting dozing against a muddy cart wheel i come upon the poor girl who was deaf and dumb at the first look i might almost have judged that she had escaped from the wild beast show but at the second i thought better of her and thought that if she was more cared for and more kindly used she would be like my child she was just the same age that my own daughter would have been if her pretty head had not fell down upon my shoulder that unfortunate night to cut it short i spoke confidential to mim while he was beating the gong outside betwixt two lots of pickleson's publics and i put it to him she lies heavy on your own hands what'll you take for her mim was a most ferocious swearer suppressing that part of his reply which was much the longest part his reply was a pair of braces now i'll tell you says i what i'm a going to do with you i'm a going to fetch you half a dozen pair of the primest braces in the cart and then to take her away with me says mim again ferocious i'll believe it when i've got the goods and no sooner i made all the haste i could lest he should think twice of it and the bargain was completed which pickleson he was thereby so relieved in his mind that he come out at his little back door longways like a serpent and give us shivery shakey in a whisper among the wheels at parting it was happy days for both of us when sophy and me began to travel in the cart i at once give her the name of sophy to put her ever towards me in the attitude of my own daughter we soon made out to begin to understand one another through the goodness of the heavens when she knowed that i meant true and kind by her in a very little time she was wonderful fond of me you have no idea what it is to have anybody wonderful fond of you unless you have been got down and rolled upon by the lonely feelings that i have mentioned as having once got the better of me you'd have laughed or the rewerse it's according to your disposition if you could have seen me trying to teach sophy at first i was helped you'd never guess by what milestones i got some large alphabets in a box all the letters separate on bits of bone and saying we was going to windsor i give her those letters in that order and then at every milestone i showed her those same letters in that same order again and pointed towards the abode of royalty another time i give her cart and then chalked the same upon the cart another time i give her doctor marigold and hung a corresponding inscription outside my waistcoat people that met us might stare a bit and laugh but what did i care if she caught the idea she caught it after long patience and trouble and then we did begin to get on swimmingly i believe you at first she was a little given to consider me the cart and the cart the abode of royalty but that soon wore off we had our signs too and they was hundreds in number sometimes she would sit looking at me and considering hard how to communicate with me about something fresh how to ask me what she wanted explained and then she was or i thought she was what does it signify so like my child with those years added to her that i half believed it was herself trying to tell me where she had been to up in the skies and what she had seen since that unhappy night when she flied away she had a pretty face and now that there was no one to drag at her bright dark hair and it was all in order there was a something touching in her looks that made the cart most peaceful and most quiet though not at all melancholy nb in the cheap jack patter we generally sound it lemonjolly and it gets a laugh the way she learnt to understand any look of mine was truly surprising when i sold of a night she would sit in the cart unseen by them outside and would give a eager look into my eyes when i looked in and would hand me straight the precise article or articles i wanted and then she would clap her hands and laugh for joy and as for me seeing her so bright and remembering what she was when i first lighted on her starved and beaten and ragged leaning asleep against the muddy cart wheel it give me such heart that i gained a greater heighth of reputation than ever and i put pickleson down by the name of mim's travelling giant otherwise pickleson for a fypunnote in my will this happiness went on in the cart till she was sixteen year old by which time i began to feel not satisfied that i had done my whole duty by her and to consider that she ought to have better teaching than i could give her it drew a many tears on both sides when i commenced explaining my views to her but what's right is right and you can't neither by tears nor laughter do away with its character so i took her hand in mine and i went with her one day to the deaf and dumb establishment in london and when the gentleman come to speak to us i says to him now i'll tell you what i'll do with you sir i am nothing but a cheap jack but of late years i have laid by for a rainy day notwithstanding this is my only daughter adopted and you can't produce a deafer nor a dumber teach her the most that can be taught her in the shortest separation that can be named state the figure for it and i am game to put the money down i won't bate you a single farthing sir but i'll put down the money here and now and i'll thankfully throw you in a pound to take it there the gentleman smiled and then well well says he i must first know what she has learned already how do you communicate with her then i showed him and she wrote in printed writing many names of things and so forth and we held some sprightly conversation sophy and me about a little story in a book which the gentleman showed her and which she was able to read this is most extraordinary says the gentleman is it possible that you have been her only teacher i have been her only teacher sir i says besides herself then says the gentleman and more acceptable words was never spoke to me you're a clever fellow and a good fellow this he makes known to sophy who kisses his hands claps her own and laughs and cries upon it we saw the gentleman four times in all and when he took down my name and asked how in the world it ever chanced to be doctor it come out that he was own nephew by the sister's side if you'll believe me to the very doctor that i was called after this made our footing still easier and he says to me now marigold tell me what more do you want your adopted daughter to know i want her sir to be cut off from the world as little as can be considering her deprivations and therefore to be able to read whatever is wrote with perfect ease and pleasure my good fellow urges the gentleman opening his eyes wide why i can't do that myself i took his joke and gave him a laugh knowing by experience how flat you fall without it and i mended my words accordingly what do you mean to do with her afterwards asks the gentleman with a sort of a doubtful eye to take her about the country in the cart sir but only in the cart she will live a private life you understand in the cart i should never think of bringing her infirmities before the public i wouldn't make a show of her for any money the gentleman nodded and seemed to approve well says he can you part with her for two years to do her that good yes sir there's another question says the gentleman looking towards her can she part with you for two years i don't know that it was a harder matter of itself for the other was hard enough to me but it was harder to get over however she was pacified to it at last and the separation betwixt us was settled how it cut up both of us when it took place and when i left her at the door in the dark of an evening i don't tell but i know this remembering that night i shall never pass that same establishment without a heartache and a swelling in the throat and i couldn't put you up the best of lots in sight of it with my usual spirit no not even the gun nor the pair of spectacles for five hundred pound reward from the secretary of state for the home department and throw in the honour of putting my legs under his mahogany arterwards still the loneliness that followed in the cart was not the old loneliness because there was a term put to it however long to look forward to and because i could think when i was anyways down that she belonged to me and i belonged to her always planning for her coming back i bought in a few months' time another cart and what do you think i planned to do with it i'll tell you i planned to fit it up with shelves and books for her reading and to have a seat in it where i could sit and see her read and think that i had been her first teacher not hurrying over the job i had the fittings knocked together in contriving ways under my own inspection and here was her bed in a berth with curtains and there was her reading table and here was her writing desk and elsewhere was her books in rows upon rows picters and no picters bindings and no bindings gilt edged and plain just as i could pick 'em up for her in lots up and down the country north and south and west and east winds liked best and winds liked least here and there and gone astray over the hills and far away and when i had got together pretty well as many books as the cart would neatly hold a new scheme come into my head which as it turned out kept my time and attention a good deal employed and helped me over the two years' stile without being of an awaricious temper i like to be the owner of things i shouldn't wish for instance to go partners with yourself in the cheap jack cart it's not that i mistrust you but that i'd rather know it was mine similarly very likely you'd rather know it was yours well a kind of a jealousy began to creep into my mind when i reflected that all those books would have been read by other people long before they was read by her it seemed to take away from her being the owner of 'em like in this way the question got into my head couldn't i have a book new made express for her which she should be the first to read it pleased me that thought did and as i never was a man to let a thought sleep you must wake up all the whole family of thoughts you've got and burn their nightcaps or you won't do in the cheap jack line i set to work at it considering that i was in the habit of changing so much about the country and that i should have to find out a literary character here to make a deal with and another literary character there to make a deal with as opportunities presented i hit on the plan that this same book should be a general miscellaneous lot like the razors flat iron chronometer watch dinner plates rolling pin and looking glass and shouldn't be offered as a single indiwidual article like the spectacles or the gun when i had come to that conclusion i come to another which shall likewise be yours often had i regretted that she never had heard me on the footboard and that she never could hear me it ain't that i am vain but that you don't like to put your own light under a bushel what's the worth of your reputation if you can't convey the reason for it to the person you most wish to value it now i'll put it to you is it worth sixpence fippence fourpence threepence twopence a penny a halfpenny a farthing no it ain't not worth a farthing very well then my conclusion was that i would begin her book with some account of myself so that through reading a specimen or two of me on the footboard she might form an idea of my merits there i was aware that i couldn't do myself justice a man can't write his eye at least i don't know how to nor yet can a man write his voice nor the rate of his talk nor the quickness of his action nor his general spicy way but he can write his turns of speech when he is a public speaker and indeed i have heard that he very often does before he speaks 'em well having formed that resolution then come the question of a name how did i hammer that hot iron into shape this way the most difficult explanation i had ever had with her was how i come to be called doctor and yet was no doctor after all i felt that i had failed of getting it correctly into her mind with my utmost pains but trusting to her improvement in the two years i thought that i might trust to her understanding it when she should come to read it as put down by my own hand then i thought i would try a joke with her and watch how it took by which of itself i might fully judge of her understanding it we had first discovered the mistake we had dropped into through her having asked me to prescribe for her when she had supposed me to be a doctor in a medical point of view so thinks i now if i give this book the name of my prescriptions and if she catches the idea that my only prescriptions are for her amusement and interest to make her laugh in a pleasant way or to make her cry in a pleasant way it will be a delightful proof to both of us that we have got over our difficulty it fell out to absolute perfection for when she saw the book as i had it got up the printed and pressed book lying on her desk in her cart and saw the title doctor marigold's prescriptions she looked at me for a moment with astonishment then fluttered the leaves then broke out a laughing in the charmingest way then felt her pulse and shook her head then turned the pages pretending to read them most attentive then kissed the book to me and put it to her bosom with both her hands i never was better pleased in all my life but let me not anticipate i take that expression out of a lot of romances i bought for her i never opened a single one of 'em and i have opened many but i found the romancer saying let me not anticipate which being so i wonder why he did anticipate or who asked him to it let me not i say anticipate this same book took up all my spare time it was no play to get the other articles together in the general miscellaneous lot but when it come to my own article there i couldn't have believed the blotting nor yet the buckling to at it nor the patience over it which again is like the footboard the public have no idea at last it was done and the two years' time was gone after all the other time before it and where it's all gone to who knows the new cart was finished yellow outside relieved with wermilion and brass fittings the old horse was put in it a new 'un and a boy being laid on for the cheap jack cart and i cleaned myself up to go and fetch her bright cold weather it was cart chimneys smoking carts pitched private on a piece of waste ground over at wandsworth where you may see 'em from the sou'western railway when not upon the road look out of the right hand window going down marigold says the gentleman giving his hand hearty i am very glad to see you yet i have my doubts sir says i if you can be half as glad to see me as i am to see you the time has appeared so long has it marigold i won't say that sir considering its real length but what a start my good fellow ah i should think it was grown such a woman so pretty so intelligent so expressive i knew then that she must be really like my child or i could never have known her standing quiet by the door you are affected says the gentleman in a kindly manner i feel sir says i that i am but a rough chap in a sleeved waistcoat i feel says the gentleman that it was you who raised her from misery and degradation and brought her into communication with her kind but why do we converse alone together when we can converse so well with her address her in your own way i am such a rough chap in a sleeved waistcoat sir says i and she is such a graceful woman and she stands so quiet at the door try if she moves at the old sign says the gentleman they had got it up together o' purpose to please me for when i give her the old sign she rushed to my feet and dropped upon her knees holding up her hands to me with pouring tears of love and joy and when i took her hands and lifted her she clasped me round the neck and lay there and i don't know what a fool i didn't make of myself until we all three settled down into talking without sound as if there was a something soft and pleasant spread over the whole world for us a portion is here omitted from the text having reference to the sketches contributed by other writers but the reader will be pleased to have what follows retained in a note now i'll tell you what i am a going to do with you i am a going to offer you the general miscellaneous lot her own book never read by anybody else but me added to and completed by me after her first reading of it eight and forty printed pages six and ninety columns whiting's own work beaufort house to wit thrown off by the steam ingine best of paper beautiful green wrapper folded like clean linen come home from the clear starcher's and so exquisitely stitched that regarded as a piece of needlework alone it's better than the sampler of a seamstress undergoing a competitive examination for starvation before the civil service commissioners and i offer the lot for what for eight pound not so much for six pound less for four pound why i hardly expect you to believe me but that's the sum four pound the stitching alone cost half as much again here's forty eight original pages ninety six original columns for four pound you want more for the money take it three whole pages of advertisements of thrilling interest thrown in for nothing read 'em and believe 'em more my best of wishes for your merry christmases and your happy new years your long lives and your true prosperities worth twenty pound good if they are delivered as i send them remember here's a final prescription added to be taken for life which will tell you how the cart broke down and where the journey ended you think four pound too much and still you think so come i'll tell you what then say four pence and keep the secret so every item of my plan was crowned with success our reunited life was more than all that we had looked forward to content and joy went with us as the wheels of the two carts went round and the same stopped with us when the two carts stopped i was as pleased and as proud as a pug dog with his muzzle black leaded for a evening party and his tail extra curled by machinery but i had left something out of my calculations now what had i left out to help you to guess i'll say a figure come make a guess and guess right nought no nine no eight no seven no six no five no four no three no two no one no now i'll tell you what i'll do with you i'll say it's another sort of figure altogether there why then says you it's a mortal figure no nor yet a mortal figure by such means you got yourself penned into a corner and you can't help guessing a immortal figure that's about it why didn't you say so sooner yes it was a immortal figure that i had altogether left out of my calculations neither man's nor woman's but a child's girl's or boy's boy's i says the sparrow with my bow and arrow now you have got it we were down at lancaster and i had done two nights more than fair average business though i cannot in honour recommend them as a quick audience in the open square there near the end of the street where mr sly's king's arms and royal hotel stands mim's travelling giant otherwise pickleson happened at the self same time to be trying it on in the town the genteel lay was adopted with him no hint of a van green baize alcove leading up to pickleson in a auction room printed poster free list suspended with the exception of that proud boast of an enlightened country a free press schools admitted by private arrangement nothing to raise a blush in the cheek of youth or shock the most fastidious mim swearing most horrible and terrific in a pink calico pay place at the slackness of the public serious handbill in the shops importing that it was all but impossible to come to a right understanding of the history of david without seeing pickleson i went to the auction room in question and i found it entirely empty of everything but echoes and mouldiness with the single exception of pickleson on a piece of red drugget this suited my purpose as i wanted a private and confidential word with him which was pickleson owing much happiness to you i put you in my will for a fypunnote but to save trouble here's fourpunten down which may equally suit your views and let us so conclude the transaction pickleson who up to that remark had had the dejected appearance of a long roman rushlight that couldn't anyhow get lighted brightened up at his top extremity and made his acknowledgments in a way which for him was parliamentary eloquence he likewise did add that having ceased to draw as a roman mim had made proposals for his going in as a conwerted indian giant worked upon by the dairyman's daughter this pickleson having no acquaintance with the tract named after that young woman and not being willing to couple gag with his serious views had declined to do thereby leading to words and the total stoppage of the unfortunate young man's beer all of which during the whole of the interview was confirmed by the ferocious growling of mim down below in the pay place which shook the giant like a leaf but what was to the present point in the remarks of the travelling giant otherwise pickleson was this doctor marigold i give his words without a hope of conweying their feebleness who is the strange young man that hangs about your carts the strange young man i gives him back thinking that he meant her and his languid circulation had dropped a syllable doctor he returns with a pathos calculated to draw a tear from even a manly eye i am weak but not so weak yet as that i don't know my words i repeat them doctor the strange young man it then appeared that pickleson being forced to stretch his legs not that they wanted it only at times when he couldn't be seen for nothing to wit in the dead of the night and towards daybreak had twice seen hanging about my carts in that same town of lancaster where i had been only two nights this same unknown young man it put me rather out of sorts what it meant as to particulars i no more foreboded then than you forebode now but it put me rather out of sorts howsoever i made light of it to pickleson and i took leave of pickleson advising him to spend his legacy in getting up his stamina and to continue to stand by his religion towards morning i kept a look out for the strange young man and what was more i saw the strange young man he was well dressed and well looking he loitered very nigh my carts watching them like as if he was taking care of them and soon after daybreak turned and went away i sent a hail after him but he never started or looked round or took the smallest notice we left lancaster within an hour or two on our way towards carlisle next morning at daybreak i looked out again for the strange young man i did not see him but next morning i looked out again and there he was once more i sent another hail after him but as before he gave not the slightest sign of being anyways disturbed this put a thought into my head acting on it i watched him in different manners and at different times not necessary to enter into till i found that this strange young man was deaf and dumb the discovery turned me over because i knew that a part of that establishment where she had been was allotted to young men some of them well off and i thought to myself if she favours him where am i and where is all that i have worked and planned for hoping i must confess to the selfishness that she might not favour him i set myself to find out at last i was by accident present at a meeting between them in the open air looking on leaning behind a fir tree without their knowing of it it was a moving meeting for all the three parties concerned i knew every syllable that passed between them as well as they did i listened with my eyes which had come to be as quick and true with deaf and dumb conversation as my ears with the talk of people that can speak he was a going out to china as clerk in a merchant's house which his father had been before him he was in circumstances to keep a wife and he wanted her to marry him and go along with him she persisted no he asked if she didn't love him yes she loved him dearly dearly but she could never disappoint her beloved good noble generous and i don't know what all father meaning me the cheap jack in the sleeved waistcoat and she would stay with him heaven bless him though it was to break her heart then she cried most bitterly and that made up my mind while my mind had been in an unsettled state about her favouring this young man i had felt that unreasonable towards pickleson that it was well for him he had got his legacy down for i often thought if it hadn't been for this same weak minded giant i might never have come to trouble my head and wex my soul about the young man but once that i knew she loved him once that i had seen her weep for him it was a different thing i made it right in my mind with pickleson on the spot and i shook myself together to do what was right by all she had left the young man by that time for it took a few minutes to get me thoroughly well shook together and the young man was leaning against another of the fir trees of which there was a cluster with his face upon his arm i touched him on the back looking up and seeing me he says in our deaf and dumb talk do not be angry i am not angry good boy i am your friend come with me i left him at the foot of the steps of the library cart and i went up alone she was drying her eyes you have been crying my dear yes father why a headache not a heartache i said a headache father doctor marigold must prescribe for that headache she took up the book of my prescriptions and held it up with a forced smile but seeing me keep still and look earnest she softly laid it down again and her eyes were very attentive the prescription is not there sophy where is it here my dear i brought her young husband in and i put her hand in his and my only farther words to both of them were these doctor marigold's last prescription to be taken for life after which i bolted when the wedding come off i mounted a coat blue and bright buttons for the first and last time in all my days and i give sophy away with my own hand there were only us three and the gentleman who had had charge of her for those two years i give the wedding dinner of four in the library cart pigeon pie a leg of pickled pork a pair of fowls and suitable garden stuff the best of drinks i give them a speech and the gentleman give us a speech and all our jokes told and the whole went off like a sky rocket in the course of the entertainment i explained to sophy that i should keep the library cart as my living cart when not upon the road and that i should keep all her books for her just as they stood till she come back to claim them so she went to china with her young husband and it was a parting sorrowful and heavy and i got the boy i had another service and so as of old when my child and wife were gone i went plodding along alone with my whip over my shoulder at the old horse's head sophy wrote me many letters and i wrote her many letters about the end of the first year she sent me one in an unsteady hand dearest father not a week ago i had a darling little daughter but i am so well that they let me write these words to you dearest and best father i hope my child may not be deaf and dumb but i do not yet know when i wrote back i hinted the question but as sophy never answered that question i felt it to be a sad one and i never repeated it for a long time our letters were regular but then they got irregular through sophy's husband being moved to another station and through my being always on the move but we were in one another's thoughts i was equally sure letters or no letters five years odd months had gone since sophy went away i was still the king of the cheap jacks and at a greater height of popularity than ever i had had a first rate autumn of it and on the twenty third of december one thousand eight hundred and sixty four i found myself at uxbridge middlesex clean sold out so i jogged up to london with the old horse light and easy to have my christmas eve and christmas day alone by the fire in the library cart and then to buy a regular new stock of goods all round to sell 'em again and get the money i am a neat hand at cookery and i'll tell you what i knocked up for my christmas eve dinner in the library cart i knocked up a beefsteak pudding for one with two kidneys a dozen oysters and a couple of mushrooms thrown in it's a pudding to put a man in good humour with everything except the two bottom buttons of his waistcoat having relished that pudding and cleared away i turned the lamp low and sat down by the light of the fire watching it as it shone upon the backs of sophy's books sophy's books so brought sophy's self that i saw her touching face quite plainly before i dropped off dozing by the fire this may be a reason why sophy with her deaf and dumb child in her arms seemed to stand silent by me all through my nap i was on the road off the road in all sorts of places north and south and west and east winds liked best and winds liked least here and there and gone astray over the hills and far away and still she stood silent by me with her silent child in her arms even when i woke with a start she seemed to vanish as if she had stood by me in that very place only a single instant before i had started at a real sound and the sound was on the steps of the cart it was the light hurried tread of a child coming clambering up that tread of a child had once been so familiar to me that for half a moment i believed i was a going to see a little ghost but the touch of a real child was laid upon the outer handle of the door and the handle turned and the door opened a little way and a real child peeped in a bright little comely girl with large dark eyes looking full at me the tiny creature took off her mite of a straw hat and a quantity of dark curls fell about her face then she opened her lips and said in a pretty voice grandfather ah my god i cries out she can speak yes dear grandfather and i am to ask you whether there was ever any one that i remind you of in a moment sophy was round my neck as well as the child and her husband was a wringing my hand with his face hid and we all had to shake ourselves together before we could get over it and when we did begin to get over it and i saw the pretty child a talking pleased and quick and eager and busy to her mother in the signs that i had first taught her mother the happy and yet pitying tears fell rolling down my face
