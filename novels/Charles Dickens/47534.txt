the gloom and converts into a dazzling brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the public career of the immortal pickwick would appear to be involved is derived from the perusal of the following entry in the transactions of the pickwick club which the editor of these papers feels the highest pleasure in laying before his readers as a proof of the careful attention indefatigable assiduity and nice discrimination with which his search among the multifarious documents confided to him has been conducted may joseph smiggers esq pvpmpc presiding the following resolutions unanimously agreed to perpetual vice president member pickwick club that this association has heard read with feelings of unmingled satisfaction and unqualified approval the paper communicated by samuel pickwick esq gcmpc entitled 'speculations on the source of the hampstead ponds with some observations on the theory of tittlebats' and that this association does hereby return its warmest thanks to the said samuel pickwick esq gcmpc for the same general chairman member pickwick club that while this association is deeply sensible of the advantages which must accrue to the cause of science from the production to which they have just adverted no less than from the unwearied researches of samuel pickwick esq gcmpc in hornsey highgate brixton and camberwell they cannot but entertain a lively sense of the inestimable benefits which must inevitably result from carrying the speculations of that learned man into a wider field from extending his travels and consequently enlarging his sphere of observation to the advancement of knowledge and the diffusion of learning that with the view just mentioned this association has taken into its serious consideration a proposal emanating from the aforesaid samuel pickwick esq gcmpc and three other pickwickians hereinafter named for forming a new branch of united pickwickians under the title of the corresponding society of the pickwick club that the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this association that the corresponding society of the pickwick club is therefore hereby constituted and that samuel pickwick esq gcmpc tracy tupman esq mpc augustus snodgrass esq mpc and nathaniel winkle esq mpc are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same and that they be requested to forward from time to time authenticated accounts of their journeys and investigations of their observations of character and manners and of the whole of their adventures together with all tales and papers to which local scenery or associations may give rise to the pickwick club stationed in london that this association cordially recognises the principle of every member of the corresponding society defraying his own travelling expenses and that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the said society pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they please upon the same terms that the members of the aforesaid corresponding society be and are hereby informed that their proposal to pay the postage of their letters and the carriage of their parcels has been deliberated upon by this association that this association considers such proposal worthy of the great minds from which it emanated and that it hereby signifies its perfect acquiescence therein a casual observer adds the secretary to whose notes we are indebted for the following account a casual observer might possibly have remarked nothing extraordinary in the bald head and circular spectacles which were intently turned towards his the secretary's face during the reading of the above resolutions to those who knew that the gigantic brain of pickwick was working beneath that forehead and that the beaming eyes of pickwick were twinkling behind those glasses the sight was indeed an interesting one there sat the man who had traced to their source the mighty ponds of hampstead and agitated the scientific world with his theory of tittlebats as calm and unmoved as the deep waters of the one on a frosty day or as a solitary specimen of the other in the inmost recesses of an earthen jar and how much more interesting did the spectacle become when starting into full life and animation as a simultaneous call for pickwick burst from his followers that illustrious man slowly mounted into the windsor chair on which he had been previously seated and addressed the club himself had founded what a study for an artist did that exciting scene present the eloquent pickwick with one hand gracefully concealed behind his coat tails and the other waving in air to assist his glowing declamation his elevated position revealing those tights and gaiters which had they clothed an ordinary man might have passed without observation but which when pickwick clothed them if we may use the expression inspired involuntary awe and respect surrounded by the men who had volunteered to share the perils of his travels and who were destined to participate in the glories of his discoveries on his right hand sat mr tracy tupman the too susceptible tupman who to the wisdom and experience of maturer years superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a boy in the most interesting and pardonable of human weaknesses love time and feeding had expanded that once romantic form the black silk waistcoat had become more and more developed inch by inch had the gold watch chain beneath it disappeared from within the range of tupman's vision and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders of the white cravat but the soul of tupman had known no change admiration of the fair sex was still its ruling passion on the left of his great leader sat the poetic snodgrass and near him again the sporting winkle the former poetically enveloped in a mysterious blue cloak with a canine skin collar and the latter communicating additional lustre to a new green shooting coat plaid neckerchief and closely fitted drabs mr pickwick's oration upon this occasion together with the debate thereon is entered on the transactions of the club both bear a strong affinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies and as it is always interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of great men we transfer the entry to these pages mr pickwick observed says the secretary that fame was dear to the heart of every man poetic fame was dear to the heart of his friend snodgrass the fame of conquest was equally dear to his friend tupman and the desire of earning fame in the sports of the field the air and the water was uppermost in the breast of his friend winkle he mr pickwick would not deny that he was influenced by human passions and human feelings cheers possibly by human weaknesses loud cries of 'no' but this he would say that if ever the fire of self importance broke out in his bosom the desire to benefit the human race in preference effectually quenched it the praise of mankind was his swing philanthropy was his insurance office vehement cheering he had felt some pride he acknowledged it freely and let his enemies make the most of it he had felt some pride when he presented his tittlebatian theory to the world it might be celebrated or it might not a cry of 'it is' and great cheering he would take the assertion of that honourable pickwickian whose voice he had just heard it was celebrated but if the fame of that treatise were to extend to the furthest confines of the known world the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of that production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which he looked around him on this the proudest moment of his existence cheers he was a humble individual 'no no' still he could not but feel that they had selected him for a service of great honour and of some danger travelling was in a troubled state and the minds of coachmen were unsettled let them look abroad and contemplate the scenes which were enacting around them stage coaches were upsetting in all directions horses were bolting boats were overturning and boilers were bursting cheers a voice 'no' no cheers let that honourable pickwickian who cried 'no' so loudly come forward and deny it if he could cheers who was it that cried 'no' enthusiastic cheering was it some vain and disappointed man he would not say haberdasher loud cheers who jealous of the praise which had been perhaps undeservedly bestowed on his mr pickwick's researches and smarting under the censure which had been heaped upon his own feeble attempts at rivalry now took this vile and calumnious mode of mr blotton of aldgate rose to order did the honourable pickwickian allude to him cries of 'order' 'chair' 'yes' 'no' 'go on' 'leave off' c mr pickwick would not put up to be put down by clamour he had alluded to the honourable gentleman great excitement mr blotton would only say then that he repelled the hon gent's false and scurrilous accusation with profound contempt great cheering the hon gent was a humbug immense confusion and loud cries of 'chair' and 'order' mr a snodgrass rose to order he threw himself upon the chair hear he wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two members of that club should be allowed to continue hear hear the chairman was quite sure the hon pickwickian would withdraw the expression he had just made use of mr blotton with all possible respect for the chair was quite sure he would not the chairman felt it his imperative duty to demand of the honourable gentleman whether he had used the expression which had just escaped him in a common sense mr blotton had no hesitation in saying that he had not he had used the word in its pickwickian sense hear hear he was bound to acknowledge that personally he entertained the highest regard and esteem for the honourable gentleman he had merely considered him a humbug in a pickwickian point of view hear hear mr pickwick felt much gratified by the fair candid and full explanation of his honourable friend he begged it to be at once understood that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a pickwickian construction cheers here the entry terminates as we have no doubt the debate did also after arriving at such a highly satisfactory and intelligible point we have no official statement of the facts which the reader will find recorded in the next chapter but they have been carefully collated from letters and other ms authorities so unquestionably genuine as to justify their narration in a connected form chapter ii illustration the first day's journey and the first evening's adventures with their consequences that punctual servant of all work the sun had just risen and begun to strike a light on the morning of the thirteenth of may one thousand eight hundred and twenty seven when mr samuel pickwick burst like another sun from his slumbers threw open his chamber window and looked out upon the world beneath goswell street was at his feet goswell street was on his right hand as far as the eye could reach goswell street extended on his left and the opposite side of goswell street was over the way such thought mr pickwick are the narrow views of those philosophers who content with examining the things that lie before them look not to the truths which are hidden beyond as well might i be content to gaze on goswell street for ever without one effort to penetrate to the hidden countries which on every side surround it and having given vent to this beautiful reflection mr pickwick proceeded to put himself into his clothes and his clothes into his portmanteau great men are seldom over scrupulous in the arrangement of their attire the operation of shaving dressing and coffee imbibing was soon performed and in another hour mr pickwick with his portmanteau in his hand his telescope in his great coat pocket and his note book in his waistcoat ready for the reception of any discoveries worthy of being noted down had arrived at the coach stand in st martin's le grand cab said mr pickwick here you are sir shouted a strange specimen of the human race in a sackcloth coat and apron of the same who with a brass label and number round his neck looked as if he were catalogued in some collection of rarities this was the waterman here you are sir now then fust cab and the first cab having been fetched from the public house where he had been smoking his first pipe mr pickwick and his portmanteau were thrown into the vehicle golden cross said mr pickwick only a bob's vorth tommy cried the driver sulkily for the information of his friend the waterman as the cab drove off how old is that horse my friend inquired mr pickwick rubbing his nose with the shilling he had reserved for the fare forty two replied the driver eyeing him askant what ejaculated mr pickwick laying his hand upon his note book the driver reiterated his former statement mr pickwick looked very hard at the man's face but his features were immovable so he noted down the fact forthwith and how long do you keep him out at a time inquired mr pickwick searching for further information two or three veeks replied the man weeks said mr pickwick in astonishment and out came the note book again he lives at pentonwil when he's at home observed the driver coolly but we seldom takes him home on account of his veakness on account of his weakness reiterated the perplexed mr pickwick he always falls down when he's took out o' the cab continued the driver but when he's in it we bears him up wery tight and takes him in wery short so as he can't wery well fall down and we've got a pair o' precious large wheels on so ven he does move they run after him and he must go on he can't help it mr pickwick entered every word of this statement in his note book with the view of communicating it to the club as a singular instance of the tenacity of life in horses under trying circumstances the entry was scarcely completed when they reached the golden cross down jumped the driver and out got mr pickwick mr tupman mr snodgrass and mr winkle who had been anxiously waiting the arrival of their illustrious leader crowded to welcome him illustration weeks said mr pickwick in astonishment and out came the note book again here's your fare said mr pickwick holding out the shilling to the driver what was the learned man's astonishment when that unaccountable person flung the money on the pavement and requested in figurative terms to be allowed the pleasure of fighting him mr pickwick for the amount you are mad said mr snodgrass or drunk said mr winkle or both said mr tupman come on said the cab driver sparring away like clock work come on all four on you here's a lark shouted half a dozen hackney coachmen go to vork sam and they crowded with great glee round the party what's the row sam inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves row replied the cabman what did he want my number for i didn't want your number said the astonished mr pickwick what did you take it for then inquired the cabman i didn't take it said mr pickwick indignantly would anybody believe continued the cab driver appealing to the crowd would anybody believe as an informer 'ud go about in a man's cab not only takin' down his number but ev'ry word he says into the bargain a light flashed upon mr pickwick it was the note book did he though inquired another cabman yes did he replied the first and then arter aggerawatin' me to assault him gets three witnesses here to prove it but i'll give it him if i've six months for it come on and the cabman dashed his hat upon the ground with a reckless disregard of his own private property and knocked mr pickwick's spectacles off and followed up the attack with a blow on mr pickwick's nose and another on mr pickwick's chest and a third in mr snodgrass's eye and a fourth by way of variety in mr tupman's waistcoat and then danced into the road and then back again to the pavement and finally dashed the whole temporary supply of breath out of mr winkle's body and all in half a dozen seconds where's an officer said mr snodgrass put 'em under the pump suggested a hot pieman you shall smart for this gasped mr pickwick informers shouted the crowd come on cried the cabman who had been sparring without cessation the whole time the mob had hitherto been passive spectators of the scene but as the intelligence of the pickwickians being informers was spread among them they began to canvass with considerable vivacity the propriety of enforcing the heated pastry vendor's proposition and there is no saying what acts of personal aggression they might have committed had not the affray been unexpectedly terminated by the interposition of a new comer illustration what's the fun said a rather tall thin young man what's the fun said a rather tall thin young man in a green coat emerging suddenly from the coach yard informers shouted the crowd again we are not roared mr pickwick in a tone which to any dispassionate listener carried conviction with it ain't you though ain't you said the young man appealing to mr pickwick and making his way through the crowd by the infallible process of elbowing the countenances of its component members that learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the case come along then said he of the green coat lugging mr pickwick after him by main force and talking the whole way here no take your fare and take yourself off respectable gentleman know him well none of your nonsense this way sir where's your friends all a mistake i see never mind accidents will happen best regulated families never say die down upon your luck pull him up put that in his pipe like the flavour damned rascals and with a lengthened string of similar broken sentences delivered with extraordinary volubility the stranger led the way to the travellers' waiting room whither he was closely followed by mr pickwick and his disciples here waiter shouted the stranger ringing the bell with tremendous violence glasses round brandy and water hot and strong and sweet and plenty eye damaged sir waiter raw beef steak for the gentleman's eye nothing like raw beef steak for a bruise sir cold lamp post very good but lamp post inconvenient damned odd standing in the open street half an hour with your eye against a lamp post eh very good ha ha and the stranger without stopping to take breath swallowed at a draught full half a pint of the reeking brandy and water and flung himself into a chair with as much ease as if nothing uncommon had occurred while his three companions were busily engaged in proffering their thanks to their new acquaintance mr pickwick had leisure to examine his costume and appearance he was about the middle height but the thinness of his body and the length of his legs gave him the appearance of being much taller the green coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow tails but had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the stranger for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his wrists it was buttoned closely up to his chin at the imminent hazard of splitting the back and an old stock without a vestige of shirt collar ornamented his neck his scanty black trousers displayed here and there those shiny patches which bespeak long service and were strapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes as if to conceal the dirty white stockings which were nevertheless distinctly visible his long black hair escaped in negligent waves from beneath each side of his old pinched up hat and glimpses of his bare wrists might be observed between the tops of his gloves and the cuffs of his coat sleeves his face was thin and haggard but an indescribable air of jaunty impudence and perfect self possession pervaded the whole man such was the individual on whom mr pickwick gazed through his spectacles which he had fortunately recovered and to whom he proceeded when his friends had exhausted themselves to return in chosen terms his warmest thanks for his recent assistance never mind said the stranger cutting the address very short said enough no more smart chap that cabman handled his fives well but if i'd been your friend in the green jemmy damn me punch his head 'cod i would pig's whisper pieman too no gammon this coherent speech was interrupted by the entrance of the rochester coachman to announce that the commodore was on the point of starting commodore said the stranger starting up my coach place booked one outside leave you to pay for the brandy and water want change for a five bad silver brummagem buttons won't do no go eh and he shook his head most knowingly now it so happened that mr pickwick and his three companions had resolved to make rochester their first halting place too and having intimated to their new found acquaintance that they were journeying to the same city they agreed to occupy the seat at the back of the coach where they could all sit together up with you said the stranger assisting mr pickwick on to the roof with so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman's deportment very materially any luggage sir inquired the coachman who i brown paper parcel here that's all other luggage gone by water packing cases nailed up big as houses heavy heavy damned heavy replied the stranger as he forced into his pocket as much as he could of the brown paper parcel which presented most suspicious indications of containing one shirt and a handkerchief heads heads take care of your heads cried the loquacious stranger as they came out under the low archway which in those days formed the entrance to the coach yard terrible place dangerous work other day five children mother tall lady eating sandwiches forgot the arch crash knock children look round mother's head off sandwich in her hand no mouth to put it in head of a family off shocking shocking looking at whitehall sir fine place little window somebody else's head off there eh sir he didn't keep a sharp look out enough either eh sir eh i am ruminating said mr pickwick on the strange mutability of human affairs ah i see in at the palace door one day out at the window the next philosopher sir an observer of human nature sir said mr pickwick ah so am i most people are when they've little to do and less to get poet sir my friend mr snodgrass has a strong poetic turn said mr pickwick so have i said the stranger epic poem ten thousand lines revolution of july composed it on the spot mars by day apollo by night bang the field piece twang the lyre you were present at that glorious scene sir said mr snodgrass present think i was fired a musket fired with an idea rushed into wine shop wrote it down back again whiz bang another idea wine shop again pen and ink back again cut and slash noble time sir sportsman sir abruptly turning to mr winkle a remarkable instance of the prophetic force of mr jingle's imagination this dialogue occurring in the year and the revolution in a little sir replied that gentleman fine pursuit sir fine pursuit dogs sir not just now said mr winkle ah you should keep dogs fine animals sagacious creatures dog of my own once pointer surprising instinct out shooting one day entering enclosure whistled dog stopped whistled again ponto no go stock still called him ponto ponto wouldn't move dog transfixed staring at a board looked up saw an inscription 'gamekeeper has orders to shoot all dogs found in this enclosure' wouldn't pass it wonderful dog valuable dog that very singular circumstance that said mr pickwick will you allow me to make a note of it certainly sir certainly hundred more anecdotes of the same animal fine girl sir to mr tracy tupman who had been bestowing sundry anti pickwickian glances on a young lady by the roadside very said mr tupman english girls not so fine as spanish noble creatures jet hair black eyes lovely forms sweet creatures beautiful you have been in spain sir said mr tracy tupman lived there ages many conquests sir inquired mr tupman conquests thousands don bolaro fizzgig grandee only daughter donna christina splendid creature loved me to distraction jealous father high souled daughter handsome englishman donna christina in despair prussic acid stomach pump in my portmanteau operation performed old bolaro in ecstasies consent to our union join hands and floods of tears romantic story very is the lady in england now sir inquired mr tupman on whom the description of her charms had produced a powerful impression dead sir dead said the stranger applying to his right eye the brief remnant of a very old cambric handkerchief never recovered the stomach pump undermined constitution fell a victim and her father inquired the poetic snodgrass remorse and misery replied the stranger sudden disappearance talk of the whole city search made everywhere without success public fountain in the great square suddenly ceased playing weeks elapsed still a stoppage workman employed to clean it water drawn off father in law discovered sticking head first in the main pipe with a full confession in his right boot took him out and the fountain played away again as well as ever will you allow me to note that little romance down sir said mr snodgrass deeply affected certainly sir certainly fifty more if you like to hear 'em strange life mine rather curious history not extraordinary but singular in this strain with an occasional glass of ale by way of parenthesis when the coach changed horses did the stranger proceed until they reached rochester bridge by which time the note books both of mr pickwick and mr snodgrass were completely filled with selections from his adventures magnificent ruin said mr augustus snodgrass with all the poetic fervour that distinguished him when they came in sight of the fine old castle what a study for an antiquarian were the very words which fell from mr pickwick's mouth as he applied his telescope to his eye ah fine place said the stranger glorious pile frowning walls tottering arches dark nooks crumbling staircases old cathedral too earthy smell pilgrims' feet worn away the old steps little saxon doors confessionals like money takers' boxes at theatres queer customers those monks popes and lord treasurers and all sorts of old fellows with great red faces and broken noses turning up every day buff jerkins too matchlocks sarcophagus fine place old legends too strange stories capital and the stranger continued to soliloquise until they reached the bull inn in the high street where the coach stopped do you remain here sir inquired mr nathaniel winkle here not i but you'd better good house nice beds wright's next house dear very dear half a crown in the bill if you look at the waiter charge you more if you dine at a friend's than they would if you dined in the coffee room rum fellows very mr winkle turned to mr pickwick and murmured a few words a whisper passed from mr pickwick to mr snodgrass from mr snodgrass to mr tupman and nods of assent were exchanged mr pickwick addressed the stranger you rendered us a very important service this morning sir said he will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner great pleasure not presume to dictate but broiled fowl and mushrooms capital thing what time let me see replied mr pickwick referring to his watch it is now nearly three shall we say five suit me excellently said the stranger five precisely till then care of yourselves and lifting the pinched up hat a few inches from his head and carelessly replacing it very much on one side the stranger with half the brown paper parcel sticking out of his pocket walked briskly up the yard and turned into the high street evidently a traveller in many countries and a close observer of men and things said mr pickwick i should like to see his poem said mr snodgrass i should like to have seen that dog said mr winkle mr tupman said nothing but he thought of donna christina the stomach pump and the fountain and his eyes filled with tears a private sitting room having been engaged bed rooms inspected and dinner ordered the party walked out to view the city and adjoining neighbourhood we do not find from a careful perusal of mr pickwick's notes on the four towns stroud rochester chatham and brompton that his impressions of their appearance differ in any material point from those of other travellers who have gone over the same ground his general description is easily abridged the principal productions of these towns says mr pickwick appear to be soldiers sailors jews chalk shrimps officers and dockyard men the commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are marine stores hard bake apples flat fish and oysters the streets present a lively and animated appearance occasioned chiefly by the conviviality of the military it is truly delightful to a philanthropic mind to see these gallant men staggering along under the influence of an overflow both of animal and ardent spirits more especially when we remember that the following them about and jesting with them affords a cheap and innocent amusement for the boy population nothing adds mr pickwick can exceed their good humour it was but the day before my arrival that one of them had been most grossly insulted in the house of a publican the bar maid had positively refused to draw him any more liquor in return for which he had merely in playfulness drawn his bayonet and wounded the girl in the shoulder and yet this fine fellow was the very first to go down to the house next morning and express his readiness to overlook the matter and forget what had occurred the consumption of tobacco in these towns continues mr pickwick must be very great and the smell which pervades the streets must be exceedingly delicious to those who are extremely fond of smoking a superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is truly gratifying punctual to five o'clock came the stranger and shortly afterwards the dinner he had divested himself of his brown paper parcel but had made no alteration in his attire and was if possible more loquacious than ever what's that he inquired as the waiter removed one of the covers soles sir soles ah capital fish all come from london stage coach proprietors get up political dinners carriage of soles dozens of baskets cunning fellows glass of wine sir with pleasure said mr pickwick and the stranger took wine first with him and then with mr snodgrass and then with mr tupman and then with mr winkle and then with the whole party together almost as rapidly as he talked devil of a mess on the staircase waiter said the stranger forms going up carpenters coming down lamps glasses harps what's going forward ball sir said the waiter assembly eh no sir not assembly sir ball for the benefit of a charity sir many fine women in this town do you know sir inquired mr tupman with great interest splendid capital kent sir everybody knows kent apples cherries hops and women glass of wine sir with great pleasure replied mr tupman the stranger filled and emptied i should very much like to go said mr tupman resuming the subject of the ball very much tickets at the bar sir interposed the waiter half a guinea each sir mr tupman again expressed an earnest wish to be present at the festivity but meeting with no response in the darkened eye of mr snodgrass or the abstracted gaze of mr pickwick he applied himself with great interest to the port wine and dessert which had just been placed on the table the waiter withdrew and the party were left to enjoy the cosy couple of hours succeeding dinner beg your pardon sir said the stranger bottle stands pass it round way of the sun through the button hole no heeltaps and he emptied his glass which he had filled about two minutes before and poured out another with the air of a man who was used to it the wine was passed and a fresh supply ordered the visitor talked the pickwickians listened mr tupman felt every moment more disposed for the ball mr pickwick's countenance glowed with an expression of universal philanthropy and mr winkle and mr snodgrass fell fast asleep they're beginning up stairs said the stranger hear the company fiddles tuning now the harp there they go the various sounds which found their way down stairs announced the commencement of the first quadrille how i should like to go said mr tupman again so should i said the stranger confounded luggage heavy smacks nothing to go in odd an't it now general benevolence was one of the leading features of the pickwickian theory and no one was more remarkable for the zealous manner in which he observed so noble a principle than mr tracy tupman the number of instances recorded on the transactions of the society in which that excellent man referred objects of charity to the houses of other members for left off garments or pecuniary relief is almost incredible i should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the purpose said mr tracy tupman but you are rather slim and i am rather fat grown up bacchus cut the leaves dismounted from the tub and adopted kersey eh not double distilled but double milled ha ha pass the wine whether mr tupman was somewhat indignant at the peremptory tone in which he was desired to pass the wine which the stranger passed so quickly away or whether he felt very properly scandalised at an influential member of the pickwick club being ignominiously compared to a dismounted bacchus is a fact not yet completely ascertained he passed the wine coughed twice and looked at the stranger for several seconds with a stern intensity as that individual however appeared perfectly collected and quite calm under his searching glance he gradually relaxed and reverted to the subject of the ball i was about to observe sir he said that though my apparel would be too large a suit of my friend mr winkle's would perhaps fit you better the stranger took mr winkle's measure with his eye and that feature glistened with satisfaction as he said just the thing mr tupman looked round him the wine which had exerted its somniferous influence over mr snodgrass and mr winkle had stolen upon the senses of mr pickwick that gentleman had gradually passed through the various stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner and its consequences he had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality like a gas lamp in the street with the wind in the pipe he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy then sunk so low as to be scarcely discernible after a short interval he had burst out again to enlighten for a moment then flickered with an uncertain staggering sort of light and then gone out altogether his head was sunk upon his bosom and perpetual snoring with a partial choke occasionally were the only audible indications of the great man's presence the temptation to be present at the ball and to form his first impressions of the beauty of the kentish ladies was strong upon mr tupman the temptation to take the stranger with him was equally great he was wholly unacquainted with the place and its inhabitants and the stranger seemed to possess as great a knowledge of both as if he had lived there from his infancy mr winkle was asleep and mr tupman had had sufficient experience in such matters to know that the moment he awoke he would in the ordinary course of nature roll heavily to bed he was undecided fill your glass and pass the wine said the indefatigable visitor mr tupman did as he was requested and the additional stimulus of the last glass settled his determination winkle's bedroom is inside mine said mr tupman i couldn't make him understand what i wanted if i woke him now but i know he has a dress suit in a carpet bag and supposing you wore it to the ball and took it off when we returned i could replace it without troubling him at all about the matter capital said the stranger famous plan damned odd situation fourteen coats in the packing cases and obliged to wear another man's very good notion that very we must purchase our tickets said mr tupman not worth while splitting a guinea said the stranger toss who shall pay for both i call you spin first time woman woman bewitching woman and down came the sovereign with the dragon called by courtesy a woman uppermost mr tupman rang the bell purchased the tickets and ordered chamber candlesticks in another quarter of an hour the stranger was completely arrayed in a full suit of mr nathaniel winkle's it's a new coat said mr tupman as the stranger surveyed himself with great complacency in a cheval glass the first that's been made with our club button and he called his companion's attention to the large gilt button which displayed a bust of mr pickwick in the centre and the letters p c on either side p c said the stranger queer set out old fellow's likeness and 'p c' what does 'p c' stand for peculiar coat eh mr tupman with rising indignation and great importance explained the mystic device rather short in the waist an't it said the stranger screwing himself round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons which were half way up his back like a general postman's coat queer coats those made by contract no measuring mysterious dispensations of providence all the short men get long coats all the long men short ones running on in this way mr tupman's new companion adjusted his dress or rather the dress of mr winkle and accompanied by mr tupman ascended the staircase leading to the ball room what names sir said the man at the door mr tracy tupman was stepping forward to announce his own titles when the stranger prevented him no names at all and then he whispered mr tupman names won't do not known very good names in their way but not great ones capital names for a small party but won't make an impression in public assemblies incog the thing gentlemen from london distinguished foreigners anything the door was thrown open and mr tracy tupman and the stranger entered the ball room it was a long room with crimson covered benches and wax candles in glass chandeliers the musicians were securely confined in an elevated den and quadrilles were being systematically got through by two or three sets of dancers two card tables were made up in the adjoining card room and two pair of old ladies and a corresponding number of stout gentlemen were executing whist therein the finale concluded the dancers promenaded the room and mr tupman and his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the company charming women said mr tupman wait a minute said the stranger fun presently nobs not come yet queer place dock yard people of upper rank don't know dock yard people of lower rank dock yard people of lower rank don't know small gentry small gentry don't know tradespeople commissioner don't know anybody who's that little boy with the light hair and pink eyes in a fancy dress inquired mr tupman hush pray pink eyes fancy dress little boy nonsense ensign th honourable wilmot snipe great family snipes very sir thomas clubber lady clubber and the miss clubbers shouted the man at the door in a stentorian voice a great sensation was created throughout the room by the entrance of a tall gentleman in a blue coat and bright buttons a large lady in blue satin and two young ladies on a similar scale in fashionably made dresses of the same hue commissioner head of the yard great man remarkably great man whispered the stranger in mr tupman's ear as the charitable committee ushered sir thomas clubber and family to the top of the room the honourable wilmot snipe and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to render homage to the miss clubbers and sir thomas clubber stood bolt upright and looked majestically over his black neckerchief at the assembled company mr smithie mrs smithie and the misses smithie was the next announcement what's mr smithie inquired mr tracy tupman something in the yard replied the stranger mr smithie bowed deferentially to sir thomas clubber and sir thomas clubber acknowledged the salute with conscious condescension lady clubber took a telescopic view of mrs smithie and family through her eye glass and mrs smithie stared in her turn at mrs somebody else whose husband was not in the dock yard at all colonel bulder mrs colonel bulder and miss bulder were the next arrivals head of the garrison said the stranger in reply to mr tupman's inquiring look miss bulder was warmly welcomed by the miss clubbers the greeting between mrs colonel bulder and lady clubber was of the most affectionate description colonel bulder and sir thomas clubber exchanged snuff boxes and looked very much like a pair of alexander selkirks monarchs of all they surveyed while the aristocracy of the place the bulders and clubbers and snipes were thus preserving their dignity at the upper end of the room the other classes of society were imitating their example in other parts of it the less aristocratic officers of the th devoted themselves to the families of the less important functionaries from the dock yard the solicitors' wives and the wine merchant's wife headed another grade the brewer's wife visited the bulders and mrs tomlinson the post office keeper seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader of the trade party one of the most popular personages in his own circle present was a little fat man with a ring of upright black hair round his head and an extensive bald plain on the top of it doctor slammer surgeon to the th the doctor took snuff with everybody chatted with everybody laughed danced made jokes played whist did everything and was everywhere to these pursuits multifarious as they were the little doctor added a more important one than any he was indefatigable in paying the most unremitting and devoted attention to a little old widow whose rich dress and profusion of ornament bespoke her a most desirable addition to a limited income upon the doctor and the widow the eyes of both mr tupman and his companion had been fixed for some time when the stranger broke silence lots of money old girl pompous doctor not a bad idea good fun were the intelligible sentences which issued from his lips mr tupman looked inquisitively in his face i'll dance with the widow said the stranger who is she inquired mr tupman don't know never saw her in all my life cut out the doctor here goes and the stranger forthwith crossed the room and leaning against a mantelpiece commenced gazing with an air of respectful and melancholy admiration on the fat countenance of the little old lady mr tupman looked on in mute astonishment the stranger progressed rapidly the little doctor danced with another lady the widow dropped her fan the stranger picked it up and presented it a smile a bow a curtsey a few words of conversation the stranger walked boldly up to and returned with the master of ceremonies a little introductory pantomime and the stranger and mrs budger took their places in a quadrille the surprise of mr tupman at this summary proceeding great as it was was immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor the stranger was young and the widow was flattered the doctor's attentions were unheeded by the widow and the doctor's indignation was wholly lost on his imperturbable rival doctor slammer was paralysed he doctor slammer of the th to be extinguished in a moment by a man whom nobody had ever seen before and whom nobody knew even now doctor slammer doctor slammer of the th rejected impossible it could not be yes it was there they were what introducing his friend could he believe his eyes he looked again and was under the painful necessity of admitting the veracity of his optics mrs budger was dancing with mr tracy tupman there was no mistaking the fact there was the widow before him bouncing bodily here and there with unwonted vigour and mr tracy tupman hopping about with a face expressive of the most intense solemnity dancing as a good many people do as if a quadrille were not a thing to be laughed at but a severe trial to the feelings which it requires inflexible resolution to encounter silently and patiently did the doctor bear all this and all the handings of negus and watching for glasses and darting for biscuits and coquetting that ensued but a few seconds after the stranger had disappeared to lead mrs budger to her carriage he darted swiftly from the room with every particle of his hitherto bottled up indignation effervescing from all parts of his countenance in a perspiration of passion the stranger was returning and mr tupman was beside him he spoke in a low tone and laughed the little doctor thirsted for his life he was exulting he had triumphed sir said the doctor in an awful voice producing a card and retiring into an angle of the passage my name is slammer doctor slammer sir th regiment chatham barracks my card sir my card he would have added more but his indignation choked him ah replied the stranger coolly slammer much obliged polite attention not ill now slammer but when i am knock you up you you're a shuffler sir gasped the furious doctor a poltroon a coward a liar a a will nothing induce you to give me your card sir oh i see said the stranger half aside negus too strong here liberal landlord very foolish very lemonade much better hot rooms elderly gentlemen suffer for it in the morning cruel cruel and he moved on a step or two you are stopping in this house sir said the indignant little man you are intoxicated now sir you shall hear from me in the morning sir i shall find you out sir i shall find you out rather you found me out than found me at home replied the unmoved stranger doctor slammer looked unutterable ferocity as he fixed his hat on his head with an indignant knock and the stranger and mr tupman ascended to the bed room of the latter to restore the borrowed plumage to the unconscious winkle that gentleman was fast asleep the restoration was soon made the stranger was extremely jocose and mr tracy tupman being quite bewildered with wine negus lights and ladies thought the whole affair an exquisite joke his new friend departed and after experiencing some slight difficulty in finding the orifice in his night cap originally intended for the reception of his head and finally overturning his candlestick in his struggles to put it on mr tracy tupman managed to get into bed by a series of complicated evolutions and shortly afterwards sank into repose seven o'clock had hardly ceased striking on the following morning when mr pickwick's comprehensive mind was aroused from the state of unconsciousness in which slumber had plunged it by a loud knocking at his chamber door who's there said mr pickwick starting up in bed boots sir what do you want please sir can you tell me which gentleman of your party wears a bright blue dress coat with a gilt button with p c on it it's been given out to brush thought mr pickwick and the man has forgotten whom it belongs to mr winkle he called out next room but two on the right hand thank'ee sir said the boots and away he went what's the matter cried mr tupman as a loud knocking at his door aroused him from his oblivious repose can i speak to mr winkle sir replied the boots from the outside winkle winkle shouted mr tupman calling into the inner room hallo replied a faint voice from within the bed clothes you're wanted some one at the door and having exerted himself to articulate thus much mr tracy tupman turned round and fell fast asleep again wanted said mr winkle hastily jumping out of bed and putting on a few articles of clothing wanted at this distance from town who on earth can want me gentleman in the coffee room sir replied the boots as mr winkle opened the door and confronted him gentleman says he'll not detain you a moment sir but he can take no denial very odd said mr winkle i'll be down directly he hurriedly wrapped himself in a travelling shawl and dressing gown and proceeded down stairs an old woman and a couple of waiters were cleaning the coffee room and an officer in undress uniform was looking out of the window he turned round as mr winkle entered and made a stiff inclination of the head having ordered the attendants to retire and closed the door very carefully he said mr winkle i presume my name is winkle sir illustration my name is winkle sir you will not be surprised sir when i inform you that i have called here this morning on behalf of my friend dr slammer of the ninety seventh doctor slammer said mr winkle dr slammer he begged me to express his opinion that your conduct of last evening was of a description which no gentleman could endure and he added which no one gentleman would pursue towards another mr winkle's astonishment was too real and too evident to escape the observation of dr slammer's friend he therefore proceeded my friend doctor slammer requested me to add that he was firmly persuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening and possibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of he commissioned me to say that should this be pleaded as an excuse for your behaviour he will consent to accept a written apology to be penned by you from my dictation a written apology repeated mr winkle in the most emphatic tone of amazement possible of course you know the alternative replied the visitor coolly were you entrusted with this message to me by name inquired mr winkle whose intellects were hopelessly confused by this extraordinary conversation i was not present myself replied the visitor and in consequence of your firm refusal to give your card to doctor slammer i was desired by that gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat a bright blue dress coat with a gilt button displaying a bust and the letters 'p c' mr winkle actually staggered with astonishment as he heard his own costume thus minutely described doctor slammer's friend proceeded from the inquiries i made at the bar just now i was convinced that the owner of the coat in question arrived here with three gentlemen yesterday afternoon i immediately sent up to the gentleman who was described as appearing the head of the party and he at once referred me to you if the principal tower of rochester castle had suddenly walked from its foundation and stationed itself opposite the coffee room window mr winkle's surprise would have been as nothing compared with the profound astonishment with which he had heard this address his first impression was that his coat had been stolen will you allow me to detain you one moment said he certainly replied the unwelcome visitor mr winkle ran hastily up stairs and with a trembling hand opened the bag there was the coat in its usual place but exhibiting on a close inspection evident tokens of having been worn on the preceding night it must be so said mr winkle letting the coat fall from his hands i took too much wine after dinner and have a very vague recollection of walking about the streets and smoking a cigar afterwards the fact is i was very drunk i must have changed my coat gone somewhere and insulted somebody i have no doubt of it and this message is the terrible consequence saying which mr winkle retraced his steps in the direction of the coffee room with the gloomy and dreadful resolve of accepting the challenge of the warlike dr slammer and abiding by the worst consequences that might ensue to this determination mr winkle was urged by a variety of considerations the first of which was his reputation with the club he had always been looked up to as a high authority on all matters of amusement and dexterity whether offensive defensive or inoffensive and if on this very first occasion of being put to the test he shrunk back from the trial beneath his leader's eye his name and standing were lost for ever besides he remembered to have heard it frequently surmised by the uninitiated in such matters that by an understood arrangement between the seconds the pistols were seldom loaded with ball and furthermore he reflected that if he applied to mr snodgrass to act as his second and depicted the danger in glowing terms that gentleman might possibly communicate the intelligence to mr pickwick who would certainly lose no time in transmitting it to the local authorities and thus prevent the killing or maiming of his follower such were his thoughts when he returned to the coffee room and intimated his intention of accepting the doctor's challenge will you refer me to a friend to arrange the time and place of meeting said the officer quite unnecessary replied mr winkle name them to me and i can procure the attendance of a friend afterwards shall we say sunset this evening inquired the officer in a careless tone very good replied mr winkle thinking in his heart it was very bad you know fort pitt yes i saw it yesterday if you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders the trench take the foot path to the left when you arrive at an angle of the fortification and keep straight on till you see me i will precede you to a secluded place where the affair can be conducted without fear of interruption fear of interruption thought mr winkle nothing more to arrange i think said the officer i am not aware of anything more replied mr winkle good morning good morning and the officer whistled a lively air as he strode away that morning's breakfast passed heavily off mr tupman was not in a condition to rise after the unwonted dissipation of the previous night mr snodgrass appeared to labour under a poetical depression of spirits and even mr pickwick evinced an unusual attachment to silence and soda water mr winkle eagerly watched his opportunity it was not long wanting mr snodgrass proposed a visit to the castle and as mr winkle was the only other member of the party disposed to walk they went out together snodgrass said mr winkle when they had turned out of the public street snodgrass my dear fellow can i rely upon your secrecy as he said this he most devoutly and earnestly hoped he could not you can replied mr snodgrass hear me swear no no interrupted winkle terrified at the idea of his companion's unconsciously pledging himself not to give information don't swear don't swear it's quite unnecessary mr snodgrass dropped the hand which he had in the spirit of poesy raised towards the clouds as he made the above appeal and assumed an attitude of attention i want your assistance my dear fellow in an affair of honour said mr winkle you shall have it replied mr snodgrass clasping his friend's hand with a doctor doctor slammer of the ninety seventh said mr winkle wishing to make the matter appear as solemn as possible an affair with an officer seconded by another officer at sunset this evening in a lonely field beyond fort pitt i will attend you said mr snodgrass he was astonished but by no means dismayed it is extraordinary how cool any party but the principal can be in such cases mr winkle had forgotten this he had judged of his friend's feelings by his own the consequences may be dreadful said mr winkle i hope not said mr snodgrass the doctor i believe is a very good shot said mr winkle most of these military men are observed mr snodgrass calmly but so are you an't you mr winkle replied in the affirmative and perceiving that he had not alarmed his companion sufficiently changed his ground snodgrass he said in a voice tremulous with emotion if i fall you will find in a packet which i shall place in your hands a note for my for my father this attack was a failure also mr snodgrass was affected but he undertook the delivery of the note as readily as if he had been a twopenny postman if i fall said mr winkle or if the doctor falls you my dear friend will be tried as an accessory before the fact shall i involve my friend in transportation possibly for life mr snodgrass winced a little at this but his heroism was invincible in the cause of friendship he fervently exclaimed i would brave all dangers how mr winkle cursed his companion's devoted friendship internally as they walked silently along side by side for some minutes each immersed in his own meditations the morning was wearing away he grew desperate snodgrass he said stopping suddenly do not let me be baulked in this matter do not give information to the local authorities do not obtain the assistance of several peace officers to take either me or doctor slammer of the ninety seventh regiment at present quartered in chatham barracks into custody and thus prevent this duel i say do not mr snodgrass seized his friend's hand warmly as he enthusiastically replied not for worlds a thrill passed over mr winkle's frame as the conviction that he had nothing to hope from his friend's fears and that he was destined to become an animated target rushed forcibly upon him the state of the case having been formally explained to mr snodgrass and a case of satisfaction pistols with the satisfactory accompaniments of powder ball and caps having been hired from a manufacturer in rochester the two friends returned to their inn mr winkle to ruminate on the approaching struggle and mr snodgrass to arrange the weapons of war and put them into proper order for immediate use it was a dull and heavy evening when they again sallied forth on their awkward errand mr winkle was muffled up in a huge cloak to escape observation and mr snodgrass bore under his the instruments of destruction have you got everything said mr winkle in an agitated tone everything replied mr snodgrass plenty of ammunition in case the shots don't take effect there's a quarter of a pound of powder in the case and i have got two newspapers in my pocket for the loadings these were instances of friendship for which any man might reasonably feel most grateful the presumption is that the gratitude of mr winkle was too powerful for utterance as he said nothing but continued to walk on rather slowly we are in excellent time said mr snodgrass as they climbed the fence of the first field the sun is just going down mr winkle looked up at the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability of his going down himself before long there's the officer exclaimed mr winkle after a few minutes' walking where said mr snodgrass there the gentleman in the blue cloak mr snodgrass looked in the direction indicated by the forefinger of his friend and observed a figure muffled up as he had described the officer evinced his consciousness of their presence by slightly beckoning with his hand and the two friends followed him at a little distance as he walked away the evening grew more dull every moment and a melancholy wind sounded through the deserted fields like a distant giant whistling for his house dog the sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the feelings of mr winkle he started as they passed the angle of the trench it looked like a colossal grave the officer turned suddenly from the path and after climbing a paling and scaling a hedge entered a secluded field two gentlemen were waiting in it one was a little fat man with black hair and the other a portly personage in a braided surtout was sitting with perfect equanimity on a camp stool the other party and a surgeon i suppose said mr snodgrass take a drop of brandy mr winkle seized the wicker bottle which his friend proffered and took a lengthened pull at the exhilarating liquid my friend sir mr snodgrass said mr winkle as the officer approached doctor slammer's friend bowed and produced a case similar to that which mr snodgrass carried we have nothing farther to say sir i think he coldly remarked as he opened the case an apology has been resolutely declined nothing sir said mr snodgrass who began to feel rather uncomfortable himself will you step forward said the officer certainly replied mr snodgrass the ground was measured and preliminaries arranged you will find these better than your own said the opposite second producing his pistols you saw me load them do you object to use them certainly not replied mr snodgrass the offer relieved him from considerable embarrassment for his previous notions of loading a pistol were rather vague and undefined we may place our men then i think observed the officer with as much indifference as if the principals were chess men and the seconds players i think we may replied mr snodgrass who would have assented to any proposition because he knew nothing about the matter the officer crossed to doctor slammer and mr snodgrass went up to mr winkle it's all ready he said offering the pistol give me your cloak you have got the packet my dear fellow said poor winkle all right said mr snodgrass be steady and wing him it occurred to mr winkle that this advice was very like that which bystanders invariably give to the smallest boy in a street fight namely go in and win an admirable thing to recommend if you only know how to do it he took off his cloak however in silence it always took a long time to undo that cloak and accepted the pistol the seconds retired the gentleman on the camp stool did the same and the belligerents approached each other mr winkle was always remarkable for extreme humanity it is conjectured that his unwillingness to hurt a fellow creature intentionally was the cause of his shutting his eyes when he arrived at the fatal spot and that the circumstance of his eyes being closed prevented his observing the very extraordinary and unaccountable demeanour of doctor slammer that gentleman started stared retreated rubbed his eyes stared again and finally shouted stop stop what's all this said doctor slammer as his friend and mr snodgrass came running up that's not the man not the man said dr slammer's second not the man said mr snodgrass not the man said the gentleman with the camp stool in his hand certainly not replied the little doctor that's not the person who insulted me last night very extraordinary exclaimed the officer very said the gentleman with the camp stool the only question is whether the gentleman being on the ground must not be considered as a matter of form to be the individual who insulted our friend dr slammer yesterday evening whether he is really that individual or not and having delivered this suggestion with a very sage and mysterious air the man with the camp stool took a large pinch of snuff and looked profoundly round with the air of an authority in such matters now mr winkle had opened his eyes and his ears too when he heard his adversary call out for a cessation of hostilities and perceiving by what he had afterwards said that there was beyond all question some mistake in the matter he at once foresaw the increase of reputation he should inevitably acquire by concealing the real motive of his coming out he therefore stepped boldly forward and said i am not the person i know it then that said the man with the camp stool is an affront to dr slammer and a sufficient reason for proceeding immediately pray be quiet payne said the doctor's second why did you not communicate this fact to me this morning sir to be sure to be sure said the man with the camp stool indignantly i entreat you to be quiet payne said the other may i repeat my question sir because sir replied mr winkle who had had time to deliberate upon his answer because sir you described an intoxicated and ungentlemanly person as wearing a coat which i have the honour not only to wear but to have invented the proposed uniform sir of the pickwick club in london the honour of that uniform i feel bound to maintain and i therefore without inquiry accepted the challenge which you offered me my dear sir said the good humoured little doctor advancing with extended hand i honour your gallantry permit me to say sir that i highly admire your conduct and extremely regret having caused you the inconvenience of this meeting to no purpose i beg you won't mention it sir said mr winkle i shall feel proud of your acquaintance sir said the little doctor it will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you sir replied mr winkle thereupon the doctor and mr winkle shook hands and then mr winkle and lieutenant tappleton the doctor's second and then mr winkle and the man with the camp stool and finally mr winkle and mr snodgrass the last named gentleman in an excess of admiration at the noble conduct of his heroic friend i think we may adjourn said lieutenant tappleton certainly added the doctor unless interposed the man with the camp stool unless mr winkle feels himself aggrieved by the challenge in which case i submit he has a right to satisfaction mr winkle with great self denial expressed himself quite satisfied already or possibly said the man with the camp stool the gentleman's second may feel himself affronted with some observations which fell from me at an early period of this meeting if so i shall be happy to give him satisfaction immediately mr snodgrass hastily professed himself very much obliged with the handsome offer of the gentleman who had spoken last which he was only induced to decline by his entire contentment with the whole proceedings the two seconds adjusted the cases and the whole party left the ground in a much more lively manner than they had proceeded to it do you remain long here inquired dr slammer of mr winkle as they walked on most amicably together i think we shall leave here the day after to morrow was the reply i trust i shall have the pleasure of seeing you and your friend at my rooms and of spending a pleasant evening with you after this awkward mistake said the little doctor are you disengaged this evening we have some friends here replied mr winkle and i should not like to leave them to night perhaps you and your friend will join us at the bull with great pleasure said the little doctor will ten o'clock be too late to look in for half an hour oh dear no said mr winkle i shall be most happy to introduce you to my friends mr pickwick and mr tupman it will give me great pleasure i am sure replied dr slammer little suspecting who mr tupman was you will be sure to come said mr snodgrass oh certainly by this time they had reached the road cordial farewells were exchanged and the party separated doctor slammer and his friends repaired to the barracks and mr winkle accompanied by mr snodgrass returned to their inn chapter iii illustration a new acquaintance the stroller's tale a disagreeable interruption and an unpleasant encounter mr pickwick had felt some apprehensions in consequence of the unusual absence of his two friends which their mysterious behaviour during the whole morning had by no means tended to diminish it was therefore with more than ordinary pleasure that he rose to greet them when they again entered and with more than ordinary interest that he inquired what had occurred to detain them from his society in reply to his questions on this point mr snodgrass was about to offer an historical account of the circumstances just now detailed when he was suddenly checked by observing that there were present not only mr tupman and their stage coach companion of the preceding day but another stranger of equally singular appearance it was a care worn looking man whose sallow face and deeply sunken eyes were rendered still more striking than nature had made them by the straight black hair which hung in matted disorder half way down his face his eyes were almost unnaturally bright and piercing his cheek bones were high and prominent and his jaws were so long and lank that an observer would have supposed that he was drawing the flesh of his face in for a moment by some contraction of the muscles if his half opened mouth and immovable expression had not announced that it was his ordinary appearance round his neck he wore a green shawl with the large ends straggling over his chest and making their appearance occasionally beneath the worn buttonholes of his old waistcoat his upper garment was a long black surtout and below it he wore wide drab trousers and large boots running rapidly to seed it was on this uncouth looking person that mr winkle's eye rested and it was towards him that mr pickwick extended his hand when he said a friend of our friend's here we discovered this morning that our friend was connected with the theatre in this place though he is not desirous to have it generally known and this gentleman is a member of the same profession he was about to favour us with a little anecdote connected with it when you entered lots of anecdote said the green coated stranger of the day before advancing to mr winkle and speaking in a low and confidential tone rum fellow does the heavy business no actor strange man all sorts of miseries dismal jemmy we call him on the circuit mr winkle and mr snodgrass politely welcomed the gentleman elegantly designated as dismal jemmy and calling for brandy and water in imitation of the remainder of the company seated themselves at the table now sir said mr pickwick will you oblige us by proceeding with what you were going to relate the dismal individual took a dirty roll of paper from his pocket and turning to mr snodgrass who had just taken out his note book said in a hollow voice perfectly in keeping with his outward man are you the poet i i do a little in that way replied mr snodgrass rather taken aback by the abruptness of the question ah poetry makes life what lights and music do the stage strip the one of its false embellishments and the other of its illusions and what is there real in either to live or care for very true sir replied mr snodgrass to be before the footlights continued the dismal man is like sitting at a grand court show and admiring the silken dresses of the gaudy throng to be behind them is to be the people who make that finery uncared for and unknown and left to sink or swim to starve or live as fortune wills it certainly said mr snodgrass for the sunken eye of the dismal man rested on him and he felt it necessary to say something go on jemmy said the spanish traveller like black eyed susan all in the downs no croaking speak out look lively will you make another glass before you begin sir said mr pickwick the dismal man took the hint and having mixed a glass of brandy and water and slowly swallowed half of it opened the roll of paper and proceeded partly to read and partly to relate the following incident which we find recorded on the transactions of the club as the stroller's tale the stroller's tale there is nothing of the marvellous in what i am going to relate said the dismal man there is nothing even uncommon in it want and sickness are too common in many stations of life to deserve more notice than is usually bestowed on the most ordinary vicissitudes of human nature i have thrown these few notes together because the subject of them was well known to me for many years i traced his progress downwards step by step until at last he reached that excess of destitution from which he never rose again the man of whom i speak was a low pantomime actor and like many people of his class an habitual drunkard in his better days before he had become enfeebled by dissipation and emaciated by disease he had been in the receipt of a good salary which if he had been careful and prudent he might have continued to receive for some years not many because these men either die early or by unnaturally taxing their bodily energies lose prematurely those physical powers on which alone they can depend for subsistence his besetting sin gained so fast upon him however that it was found impossible to employ him in the situations in which he really was useful to the theatre the public house had a fascination for him which he could not resist neglected disease and hopeless poverty were as certain to be his portion as death itself if he persevered in the same course yet he did persevere and the result may be guessed he could obtain no engagement and he wanted bread everybody who is at all acquainted with theatrical matters knows what a host of shabby poverty stricken men hang about the stage of a large establishment not regularly engaged actors but ballet people procession men tumblers and so forth who are taken on during the run of a pantomime or an easter piece and are then discharged until the production of some heavy spectacle occasions a new demand for their services to this mode of life the man was compelled to resort and taking the chair every night at some low theatrical house at once put him in possession of a few more shillings weekly and enabled him to gratify his old propensity even this resource shortly failed him his irregularities were too great to admit of his earning the wretched pittance he might thus have procured and he was actually reduced to a state bordering on starvation only procuring a trifle occasionally by borrowing it of some old companion or by obtaining an appearance at one or other of the commonest of the minor theatres and when he did earn anything it was spent in the old way about this time and when he had been existing for upwards of a year no one knew how i had a short engagement at one of the theatres on the surrey side of the water and here i saw this man whom i had lost sight of for some time for i had been travelling in the provinces and he had been skulking in the lanes and alleys of london i was dressed to leave the house and was crossing the stage on my way out when he tapped me on the shoulder never shall i forget the repulsive sight that met my eye when i turned round he was dressed for the pantomime in all the absurdity of a clown's costume the spectral figures in the dance of death the most frightful shapes that the ablest painter ever portrayed on canvas never presented an appearance half so ghastly his bloated body and shrunken legs their deformity enhanced a hundred fold by the fantastic dress the glassy eyes contrasting fearfully with the thick white paint with which the face was besmeared the grotesquely ornamented head trembling with paralysis and the long skinny hands rubbed with white chalk all gave him a hideous and unnatural appearance of which no description could convey an adequate idea and which to this day i shudder to think of his voice was hollow and tremulous as he took me aside and in broken words recounted a long catalogue of sickness and privations terminating as usual with an urgent request for the loan of a trifling sum of money i put a few shillings in his hand and as i turned away i heard the roar of laughter which followed his first tumble on the stage a few nights afterwards a boy put a dirty scrap of paper in my hand on which were scrawled a few words in pencil intimating that the man was dangerously ill and begging me after the performance to see him at his lodging in some street i forget the name of it now at no great distance from the theatre i promised to comply as soon as i could get away and after the curtain fell sallied forth on my melancholy errand it was late for i had been playing in the last piece and as it was a benefit night the performances had been protracted to an unusual length it was a dark cold night with a chill damp wind which blew the rain heavily against the windows and house fronts pools of water had collected in the narrow and little frequented streets and as many of the thinly scattered oil lamps had been blown out by the violence of the wind the walk was not only a comfortless but most uncertain one i had fortunately taken the right course however and succeeded after a little difficulty in finding the house to which i had been directed a coal shed with one storey above it in the back room of which lay the object of my search a wretched looking woman the man's wife met me on the stairs and telling me that he had just fallen into a kind of doze led me softly in and placed a chair for me at the bedside the sick man was lying with his face turned towards the wall and as he took no heed of my presence i had leisure to observe the place in which i found myself he was lying on an old bedstead which turned up during the day the tattered remains of a checked curtain were drawn round the bed's head to exclude the wind which however made its way into the comfortless room through the numerous chinks in the door and blew it to and fro every instant there was a low cinder fire in a rusty unfixed grate and an old three cornered stained table with some medicine bottles a broken glass and a few other domestic articles was drawn out before it a little child was sleeping on a temporary bed which had been made for it on the floor and the woman sat on a chair by its side there were a couple of shelves with a few plates and cups and saucers and a pair of stage shoes and a couple of foils hung beneath them with the exception of little heaps of rags and bundles which had been carelessly thrown into the corners of the room these were the only things in the apartment i had had time to note these little particulars and to mark the heavy breathing and feverish startings of the sick man before he was aware of my presence in the restless attempts to procure some easy resting place for his head he tossed his hand out of the bed and it fell on mine he started up and stared eagerly in my face 'mr hutley john' said his wife 'mr hutley that you sent for to night you know' 'ah' said the invalid passing his hand across his forehead 'hutley hutley let me see' he seemed endeavouring to collect his thoughts for a few seconds and then grasping me tightly by the wrist said 'don't leave me don't leave me old fellow she'll murder me i know she will' 'has he been long so' said i addressing his weeping wife 'since yesterday night' she replied 'john john don't you know me' 'don't let her come near me' said the man with a shudder as she stooped over him 'drive her away i can't bear her near me' he stared wildly at her with a look of deadly apprehension and then whispered in my ear 'i beat her jem i beat her yesterday and many times before i have starved her and the boy too and now i am weak and helpless jem she'll murder me for it i know she will if you'd seen her cry as i have you'd know it too keep her off' he relaxed his grasp and sank back exhausted on the pillow i knew but too well what all this meant if i could have entertained any doubt of it for an instant one glance at the woman's pale face and wasted form would have sufficiently explained the real state of the case 'you had better stand aside' said i to the poor creature 'you can do him no good perhaps he will be calmer if he does not see you' she retired out of the man's sight he opened his eyes after a few seconds and looked anxiously round 'is she gone' he eagerly inquired 'yes yes' said i 'she shall not hurt you' 'i'll tell you what jem' said the man in a low voice 'she does hurt me there's something in her eyes wakes such a dreadful fear in my heart that it drives me mad all last night her large staring eyes and pale face were close to mine wherever i turned they turned and whenever i started up from my sleep she was at the bedside looking at me' he drew me closer to him as he said in a deep alarmed whisper 'jem she must be an evil spirit a devil hush i know she is if she had been a woman she would have died long ago no woman could have borne what she has' i sickened at the thought of the long course of cruelty and neglect which must have occurred to produce such an impression on such a man i could say nothing in reply for who could offer hope or consolation to the abject being before me i sat there for upwards of two hours during which he tossed about murmuring exclamations of pain or impatience restlessly throwing his arms here and there and turning constantly from side to side at length he fell into that state of partial unconsciousness in which the mind wanders uneasily from scene to scene and from place to place without the control of reason but still without being able to divest itself of an indescribable sense of present suffering finding from his incoherent wanderings that this was the case and knowing that in all probability the fever would not grow immediately worse i left him promising his miserable wife that i would repeat my visit next evening and if necessary sit up with the patient during the night i kept my promise the last four and twenty hours had produced a frightful alteration the eyes though deeply sunk and heavy shone with a lustre frightful to behold the lips were parched and cracked in many places the hard dry skin glowed with a burning heat and there was an almost unearthly air of wild anxiety in the man's face indicating even more strongly the ravages of the disease the fever was at its height i took the seat i had occupied the night before and there i sat for hours listening to sounds which must strike deep to the heart of the most callous among human beings the awful ravings of a dying man from what i had heard of the medical attendant's opinion i knew there was no hope for him i was sitting by his death bed i saw the wasted limbs which a few hours before had been distorted for the amusement of a boisterous gallery writhing under the tortures of a burning fever i heard the clown's shrill laugh blending with the low murmurings of the dying man it is a touching thing to hear the mind reverting to the ordinary occupations and pursuits of health when the body lies before you weak and helpless but when those occupations are of a character the most strongly opposed to anything we associate with grave and solemn ideas the impression produced is infinitely more powerful the theatre and the public house were the chief themes of the wretched man's wanderings it was evening he fancied he had a part to play that night it was late and he must leave home instantly why did they hold him and prevent his going he should lose the money he must go no they would not let him he hid his face in his burning hands and feebly bemoaned his own weakness and the cruelty of his persecutors a short pause and he shouted out a few doggrel rhymes the last he had ever learnt he rose in bed drew up his withered limbs and rolled about in uncouth positions he was acting he was at the theatre a minute's silence and he murmured the burden of some roaring song he had reached the old house at last how hot the room was he had been ill very ill but he was well now and happy fill up his glass who was that that dashed it from his lips it was the same persecutor that had followed him before he fell back upon his pillow and moaned aloud a short period of oblivion and he was wandering through a tedious maze of low arched rooms so low sometimes that he must creep upon his hands and knees to make his way along it was so close and dark and every way he turned some obstacle impeded his progress there were insects too hideous crawling things with eyes that stared upon him and filled the very air around glistening horribly amidst the thick darkness of the place the walls and ceiling were alive with reptiles the vault expanded to an enormous size frightful figures flitted to and fro and the faces of men he knew rendered hideous by gibing and mouthing peered out from among them they were searing him with heated irons and binding his head with cords till the blood started and he struggled madly for life at the close of one of these paroxysms when i had with great difficulty held him down in his bed he sank into what appeared to be a slumber overpowered with watching and exertion i had closed my eyes for a few minutes when i felt a violent clutch on my shoulder i awoke instantly he had raised himself up so as to seat himself in bed a dreadful change had come over his face but consciousness had returned for he evidently knew me the child who had been long since disturbed by his ravings rose from its little bed and ran towards its father screaming with fright the mother hastily caught it in her arms lest he should injure it in the violence of his insanity but terrified by the alteration of his features stood transfixed by the bedside he grasped my shoulder convulsively and striking his breast with the other hand made a desperate attempt to articulate it was unavailing he extended his arm towards them and made another violent effort there was a rattling noise in the throat a glare of the eye a short stifled groan and he fell back dead it would afford us the highest gratification to be enabled to record mr pickwick's opinion of the foregoing anecdote we have little doubt that we should have been enabled to present it to our readers but for a most unfortunate occurrence mr pickwick had replaced on the table the glass which during the last few sentences of the tale he had retained in his hand and had just made up his mind to speak indeed we have the authority of mr snodgrass's note book for stating that he had actually opened his mouth when the waiter entered the room and said some gentlemen sir it has been conjectured that mr pickwick was on the point of delivering some remarks which would have enlightened the world if not the thames when he was thus interrupted for he gazed sternly on the waiter's countenance and then looked round on the company generally as if seeking for information relative to the new comers oh said mr winkle rising some friends of mine show them in very pleasant fellows added mr winkle after the waiter had retired officers of the th whose acquaintance i made rather oddly this morning you will like them very much mr pickwick's equanimity was at once restored the waiter returned and ushered three gentlemen into the room lieutenant tappleton said mr winkle lieutenant tappleton mr pickwick doctor payne mr pickwick mr snodgrass you have seen before my friend mr tupman doctor payne dr slammer mr pickwick mr tupman doctor slam here mr winkle suddenly paused for strong emotion was visible on the countenance of mr tupman and the doctor i have met this gentleman before said the doctor with marked emphasis indeed said mr winkle and and that person too if i am not mistaken said the doctor bestowing a scrutinising glance on the green coated stranger i think i gave that person a very pressing invitation last night which he thought proper to decline saying which the doctor scowled magnanimously on the stranger and whispered his friend lieutenant tappleton you don't say so said that gentleman at the conclusion of the whisper i do indeed replied dr slammer you are bound to kick him on the spot murmured the owner of the camp stool with great importance do be quiet payne interposed the lieutenant will you allow me to ask you sir he said addressing mr pickwick who was considerably mystified by this very unpolite by play will you allow me to ask you sir whether that person belongs to your party no sir replied mr pickwick he is a guest of ours he is a member of your club or i am mistaken said the lieutenant inquiringly certainly not responded mr pickwick and never wears your club button said the lieutenant no never replied the astonished mr pickwick lieutenant tappleton turned round to his friend dr slammer with a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulder as if implying some doubt of the accuracy of his recollection the little doctor looked wrathful but confounded and mr payne gazed with a ferocious aspect on the beaming countenance of the unconscious pickwick sir said the doctor suddenly addressing mr tupman in a tone which made that gentleman start as perceptibly as if a pin had been cunningly inserted in the calf of his leg you were at the ball here last night mr tupman gasped a faint affirmative looking very hard at mr pickwick all the while that person was your companion said the doctor pointing to the still unmoved stranger mr tupman admitted the fact now sir said the doctor to the stranger i ask you once again in the presence of these gentlemen whether you choose to give me your card and to receive the treatment of a gentleman or whether you impose upon me the necessity of personally chastising you on the spot stay sir said mr pickwick i really cannot allow this matter to go any further without some explanation tupman recount the circumstances mr tupman thus solemnly adjured stated the case in a few words touched slightly on the borrowing of the coat expatiated largely on its having been done after dinner wound up with a little penitence on his own account and left the stranger to clear himself as best he could he was apparently about to proceed to do so when lieutenant tappleton who had been eyeing him with great curiosity said with considerable scorn haven't i seen you at the theatre sir certainly replied the unabashed stranger he is a strolling actor said the lieutenant contemptuously turning to dr slammer he acts in the piece that the officers of the nd get up at the rochester theatre to morrow night you cannot proceed in this affair slammer impossible sorry to have placed you in this disagreeable situation said lieutenant tappleton addressing mr pickwick allow me to suggest that the best way of avoiding a recurrence of such scenes in future will be to be more select in the choice of your companions good evening sir and the lieutenant bounced out of the room and allow me to say sir said the irascible doctor payne that if i had been tappleton or if i had been slammer i would have pulled your nose sir and the nose of every man in this company i would sir every man payne is my name sir doctor payne of the rd good evening sir having concluded this speech and uttered the three last words in a loud key he stalked majestically after his friend closely followed by doctor slammer who said nothing but contented himself by withering the company with a look rising rage and extreme bewilderment had swelled the noble breast of mr pickwick almost to the bursting of his waistcoat during the delivery of the above defiance he stood transfixed to the spot gazing on vacancy the closing of the door recalled him to himself he rushed forward with fury in his looks and fire in his eye his hand was upon the lock of the door in another instant it would have been on the throat of doctor payne of the rd had not mr snodgrass seized his revered leader by the coat tail and dragged him backwards restrain him cried mr snodgrass winkle tupman he must not peril his distinguished life in such a cause as this let me go said mr pickwick hold him tight shouted mr snodgrass and by the united efforts of the whole company mr pickwick was forced into an arm chair leave him alone said the green coated stranger brandy and water jolly old gentleman lots of pluck swallow this ah capital stuff having previously tested the virtues of a bumper which had been mixed by the dismal man the stranger applied the glass to mr pickwick's mouth and the remainder of its contents rapidly disappeared there was a short pause the brandy and water had done its work the amiable countenance of mr pickwick was fast recovering its customary expression they are not worth your notice said the dismal man you are right sir replied mr pickwick they are not i am ashamed to have been betrayed into this warmth of feeling draw your chair up to the table sir the dismal man readily complied a circle was again formed round the table and harmony once more prevailed some lingering irritability appeared to find a resting place in mr winkle's bosom occasioned possibly by the temporary abstraction of his coat though it is scarcely reasonable to suppose that so slight a circumstance can have excited even a passing feeling of anger in a pickwickian breast with this exception their good humour was completely restored and the evening concluded with the conviviality with which it had begun chapter iv illustration a field day and bivouac more new friends an invitation to the country many authors entertain not only a foolish but a really dishonest objection to acknowledge the sources from whence they derive much valuable information we have no such feeling we are merely endeavouring to discharge in an upright manner the responsible duties of our editorial functions and whatever ambition we might have felt under other circumstances to lay claim to the authorship of these adventures a regard for truth forbids us to do more than claim the merit of their judicious arrangement and impartial narration the pickwick papers are our new river head and we may be compared to the new river company the labours of others have raised for us an immense reservoir of important facts we merely lay them on and communicate them in a clear and gentle stream through the medium of these numbers to a world thirsting for pickwickian knowledge acting in this spirit and resolutely proceeding on our determination to avow our obligations to the authorities we have consulted we frankly say that to the note book of mr snodgrass are we indebted for the particulars recorded in this and the succeeding chapter particulars which now that we have disburdened our conscience we shall proceed to detail without further comment the whole population of rochester and the adjoining towns rose from their beds at an early hour of the following morning in a state of the utmost bustle and excitement a grand review was to take place upon the lines the manoeuvres of half a dozen regiments were to be inspected by the eagle eye of the commander in chief temporary fortifications had been erected the citadel was to be attacked and taken and a mine was to be sprung mr pickwick was as our readers may have gathered from the slight extract we gave from his description of chatham an enthusiastic admirer of the army nothing could have been more delightful to him nothing could have harmonised so well with the peculiar feeling of each of his companions as this sight accordingly they were soon a foot and walking in the direction of the scene of action towards which crowds of people were already pouring from a variety of quarters the appearance of everything on the lines denoted that the approaching ceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance there were sentries posted to keep the ground for the troops and servants on the batteries keeping places for the ladies and sergeants running to and fro with vellum covered books under their arms and colonel bulder in full military uniform on horseback galloping first to one place and then to another and backing his horse among the people and prancing and curvetting and shouting in a most alarming manner and making himself very hoarse in the voice and very red in the face without any assignable cause or reason whatever officers were running backwards and forwards first communicating with colonel bulder and then ordering the sergeants and then running away altogether and even the very privates themselves looked from behind their glazed stocks with an air of mysterious solemnity which sufficiently bespoke the special nature of the occasion mr pickwick and his three companions stationed themselves in the front rank of the crowd and patiently awaited the commencement of the proceedings the throng was increasing every moment and the efforts they were compelled to make to retain the position they had gained sufficiently occupied their attention during the two hours that ensued at one time there was a sudden pressure from behind and then mr pickwick was jerked forward for several yards with a degree of speed and elasticity highly inconsistent with the general gravity of his demeanour at another moment there was a request to keep back from the front and then the butt end of a musket was either dropped upon mr pickwick's toe to remind him of the demand or thrust into his chest to ensure its being complied with then some facetious gentlemen on the left after pressing sideways in a body and squeezing mr snodgrass into the very last extreme of human torture would request to know vere he vos a shovin' to and when mr winkle had done expressing his excessive indignation at witnessing this unprovoked assault some person behind would knock his hat over his eyes and beg the favour of his putting his head in his pocket these and other practical witticisms coupled with the unaccountable absence of mr tupman who had suddenly disappeared and was nowhere to be found rendered their situation upon the whole rather more uncomfortable than pleasing or desirable at length that low roar of many voices ran through the crowd which usually announces the arrival of whatever they have been waiting for all eyes were turned in the direction of the sally port a few moments of eager expectation and colours were seen fluttering gaily in the air arms glistened brightly in the sun column after column poured on to the plain the troops halted and formed the word of command rung through the line there was a general clash of muskets as arms were presented and the commander in chief attended by colonel bulder and numerous officers cantered to the front the military bands struck up all together the horses stood upon two legs each cantered backwards and whisked their tails about in all directions the dogs barked the mob screamed the troops recovered and nothing was to be seen on either side as far as the eye could reach but a long perspective of red coats and white trousers fixed and motionless mr pickwick had been so fully occupied in falling about and disentangling himself miraculously from between the legs of horses that he had not enjoyed sufficient leisure to observe the scene before him until it assumed the appearance we have just described when he was at last enabled to stand firmly on his legs his gratification and delight were unbounded can anything be finer or more delightful he inquired of mr winkle nothing replied that gentleman who had had a short man standing on each of his feet for the quarter of an hour immediately preceding it is indeed a noble and a brilliant sight said mr snodgrass in whose bosom a blaze of poetry was rapidly bursting forth to see the gallant defenders of their country drawn up in brilliant array before its peaceful citizens their faces beaming not with warlike ferocity but with civilised gentleness their eyes flashing not with the rude fire of rapine or revenge but with the soft light of humanity and intelligence mr pickwick fully entered into the spirit of this eulogium but he could not exactly re echo its terms for the soft light of intelligence burnt rather feebly in the eyes of the warriors inasmuch as the command eyes front had been given and all the spectator saw before him was several thousand pair of optics staring straight forward wholly divested of any expression whatever we are in a capital situation now said mr pickwick looking round him the crowd had gradually dispersed in their immediate vicinity and they were nearly alone capital echoed both mr snodgrass and mr winkle what are they doing now inquired mr pickwick adjusting his spectacles i i rather think said mr winkle changing colour i rather think they're going to fire nonsense said mr pickwick hastily i i really think they are urged mr snodgrass somewhat alarmed impossible replied mr pickwick he had hardly uttered the word when the whole half dozen regiments levelled their muskets as if they had but one common object and that object the pickwickians and burst forth with the most awful and tremendous discharge that ever shook the earth to its centre or an elderly gentleman off his it was in this trying situation exposed to a galling fire of blank cartridges and harassed by the operations of the military a fresh body of whom had begun to fall in on the opposite side that mr pickwick displayed that perfect coolness and self possession which are the indispensable accompaniments of a great mind he seized mr winkle by the arm and placing himself between that gentleman and mr snodgrass earnestly besought them to remember that beyond the possibility of being rendered deaf by the noise there was no immediate danger to be apprehended from the firing but but suppose some of the men should happen to have ball cartridges by mistake remonstrated mr winkle pallid at the supposition he was himself conjuring up i heard something whistle through the air just now so sharp close to my ear we had better throw ourselves on our faces hadn't we said mr snodgrass no no it's over now said mr pickwick his lip might quiver and his cheek might blanch but no expression of fear or concern escaped the lips of that immortal man mr pickwick was right the firing ceased but he had scarcely time to congratulate himself on the accuracy of his opinion when a quick movement was visible in the line the hoarse shout of the word of command ran along it and before either of the party could form a guess at the meaning of this new manoeuvre the whole of the half dozen regiments with fixed bayonets charged at double quick time down upon the very spot on which mr pickwick and his friends were stationed man is but mortal and there is a point beyond which human courage cannot extend mr pickwick gazed through his spectacles for an instant on the advancing mass and then fairly turned his back and we will not say fled firstly because it is an ignoble term and secondly because mr pickwick's figure was by no means adapted for that mode of retreat he trotted away at as quick a rate as his legs would convey him so quickly indeed that he did not perceive the awkwardness of his situation to the full extent until too late the opposite troops whose falling in had perplexed mr pickwick a few seconds before were drawn up to repel the mimic attack of the sham besiegers of the citadel and the consequence was that mr pickwick and his two companions found themselves suddenly inclosed between two lines of great length the one advancing at a rapid pace and the other firmly waiting the collision in hostile array hoi shouted the officers of the advancing line get out of the way cried the officers of the stationary one where are we to go to screamed the agitated pickwickians hoi hoi hoi was the only reply there was a moment of intense bewilderment a heavy tramp of footsteps a violent concussion a smothered laugh the half dozen regiments were half a thousand yards off and the soles of mr pickwick's boots were elevated in air mr snodgrass and mr winkle had each performed a compulsory somerset with remarkable agility when the first object that met the eyes of the latter as he sat on the ground staunching with a yellow silk handkerchief the stream of life which issued from his nose was his venerated leader at some distance off running after his own hat which was gamboling playfully away in perspective there are very few moments in a man's existence when he experiences so much ludicrous distress or meets with so little charitable commiseration as when he is in pursuit of his own hat a vast deal of coolness and a peculiar degree of judgment are requisite in catching a hat a man must not be precipitate or he runs over it he must not rush into the opposite extreme or he loses it altogether the best way is to keep gently up with the object of pursuit to be wary and cautious to watch your opportunity well get gradually before it then make a rapid dive seize it by the crown and stick it firmly on your head smiling pleasantly all the time as if you thought it as good a joke as anybody else there was a fine gentle wind and mr pickwick's hat rolled sportively before it the wind puffed and mr pickwick puffed and the hat rolled over and over as merrily as a lively porpoise in a strong tide and on it might have rolled far beyond mr pickwick's reach had not its course been providentially stopped just as that gentleman was on the point of resigning it to its fate mr pickwick we say was completely exhausted and about to give up the chase when the hat was blown with some violence against the wheel of a carriage which was drawn up in a line with half a dozen other vehicles on the spot to which his steps had been directed mr pickwick perceiving his advantage darted briskly forward secured his property planted it on his head and paused to take breath he had not been stationary half a minute when he heard his own name eagerly pronounced by a voice which he at once recognised as mr tupman's and looking upwards he beheld a sight which filled him with surprise and pleasure in an open barouche the horses of which had been taken out the better to accommodate it to the crowded place stood a stout old gentleman in a blue coat and bright buttons corduroy breeches and top boots two young ladies in scarfs and feathers a young gentleman apparently enamoured of one of the young ladies in scarfs and feathers a lady of doubtful age probably the aunt of the aforesaid and mr tupman as easy and unconcerned as if he had belonged to the family from the first moments of his infancy fastened up behind the barouche was a hamper of spacious dimensions one of those hampers which always awakens in a contemplative mind associations connected with cold fowls tongues and bottles of wine and on the box sat a fat and red faced boy in a state of somnolency whom no speculative observer could have regarded for an instant without setting down as the official dispenser of the contents of the before mentioned hamper when the proper time for their consumption should arrive mr pickwick had bestowed a hasty glance on these interesting objects when he was again greeted by his faithful disciple pickwick pickwick said mr tupman come up here make haste come along sir pray come up said the stout gentleman joe damn that boy he's gone to sleep again joe let down the steps the fat boy rolled slowly off the box let down the steps and held the carriage door invitingly open mr snodgrass and mr winkle came up at the moment room for you all gentlemen said the stout man two inside and one out joe make room for one of these gentlemen on the box now sir come along and the stout gentleman extended his arm and pulled first mr pickwick and then mr snodgrass into the barouche by main force mr winkle mounted to the box the fat boy waddled to the same perch and fell fast asleep instantly illustration damn that boy he's gone to sleep again well gentlemen said the stout man very glad to see you know you very well gentlemen though you mayn't remember me i spent some ev'nins at your club last winter picked up my friend mr tupman here this morning and very glad i was to see him well sir and how are you you do look uncommon well to be sure mr pickwick acknowledged the compliment and cordially shook hands with the stout gentleman in the top boots well and how are you sir said the stout gentleman addressing mr snodgrass with paternal anxiety charming eh well that's right that's right and how are you sir to mr winkle well i am glad to hear you say you are well very glad i am to be sure my daughters gentlemen my gals these are and that's my sister miss rachael wardle she's a miss she is and yet she an't a miss eh sir eh and the stout gentleman playfully inserted his elbow between the ribs of mr pickwick and laughed very heartily lor brother said miss wardle with a deprecating smile true true said the stout gentleman no one can deny it gentlemen i beg your pardon this is my friend mr trundle and now you all know each other let's be comfortable and happy and see what's going forward that's what i say so the stout gentleman put on his spectacles and mr pickwick pulled out his glass and everybody stood up in the carriage and looked over somebody else's shoulder at the evolutions of the military astounding evolutions they were one rank firing over the heads of another rank and then running away and then the other rank firing over the heads of another rank and running away in their turn and then forming squares with officers in the centre and then descending the trench on one side with scaling ladders and ascending it on the other again by the same means and knocking down barricades of baskets and behaving in the most gallant manner possible then there was such a ramming down of the contents of enormous guns on the battery with instruments like magnified mops such a preparation before they were let off and such an awful noise when they did go that the air resounded with the screams of ladies the young miss wardles were so frightened that mr trundle was actually obliged to hold one of them up in the carriage while mr snodgrass supported the other and mr wardle's sister suffered under such a dreadful state of nervous alarm that mr tupman found it indispensably necessary to put his arm round her waist to keep her up at all everybody was excited except the fat boy and he slept as soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his ordinary lullaby joe joe said the stout gentleman when the citadel was taken and the besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner damn that boy he's gone to sleep again be good enough to pinch him sir in the leg if you please nothing else wakes him thank you undo the hamper joe the fat boy who had been effectually roused by the compression of a portion of his leg between the finger and thumb of mr winkle rolled off the box once again and proceeded to unpack the hamper with more expedition than could have been expected from his previous inactivity now we must sit close said the stout gentleman after a great many jokes about squeezing the ladies' sleeves and a vast quantity of blushing at sundry jocose proposals that the ladies should sit in the gentlemen's laps the whole party were stowed down in the barouche and the stout gentleman proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy who had mounted up behind for the purpose into the carriage now joe knives and forks the knives and forks were handed in and the ladies and gentlemen inside and mr winkle on the box were each furnished with those useful instruments plates joe plates a similar process employed in the distribution of the crockery now joe the fowls damn that boy he's gone to sleep again joe joe sundry taps on the head with a stick and the fat boy with some difficulty roused from his lethargy come hand in the eatables there was something in the sound of the last word which roused the unctuous boy he jumped up and the leaden eyes which twinkled behind his mountainous cheeks leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it from the basket now make haste said mr wardle for the fat boy was hanging fondly over a capon which he seemed wholly unable to part with the boy sighed deeply and bestowing an ardent gaze upon its plumpness unwillingly consigned it to his master that's right look sharp now the tongue now the pigeon pie take care of that veal and ham mind the lobsters take the salad out of the cloth give me the dressing such were the hurried orders which issued from the lips of mr wardle as he handed in the different articles described and placed dishes in everybody's hands and on everybody's knees in endless number now an't this capital inquired that jolly personage when the work of destruction had commenced capital said mr winkle who was carving a fowl on the box glass of wine with the greatest pleasure you'd better have a bottle to yourself up there hadn't you you're very good joe yes sir he wasn't asleep this time having just succeeded in abstracting a veal patty bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box glad to see you sir thankee mr winkle emptied his glass and placed the bottle on the coach box by his side will you permit me to have the pleasure sir said mr trundle to mr winkle with great pleasure replied mr winkle to mr trundle and then the two gentlemen took wine after which they took a glass of wine round ladies and all how dear emily is flirting with the strange gentleman whispered the spinster aunt with true spinster aunt like envy to her brother mr wardle oh i don't know said the jolly old gentleman all very natural i dare say nothing unusual mr pickwick some wine sir mr pickwick who had been deeply investigating the interior of the pigeon pie readily assented emily my dear said the spinster aunt with a patronising air don't talk so loud love lor aunt aunt and the little old gentleman want to have it all to themselves i think whispered miss isabella wardle to her sister emily the young ladies laughed very heartily and the old one tried to look amiable but couldn't manage it young girls have such spirits said miss wardle to mr tupman with an air of gentle commiseration as if animal spirits were contraband and their possession without a permit a high crime and misdemeanour oh they have replied mr tupman not exactly making the sort of reply that was expected from him it's quite delightful hem said miss wardle rather dubiously will you permit me said mr tupman in his blandest manner touching the enchanting rachael's wrist with one hand and gently elevating the bottle with the other will you permit me oh sir mr tupman looked most impressive and rachael expressed her fear that more guns were going off in which case of course she would have required support again do you think my dear nieces pretty whispered their affectionate aunt to mr tupman i should if their aunt wasn't here replied the ready pickwickian with a passionate glance oh you naughty man but really if their complexions were a little better don't you think they would be nice looking girls by candle light yes i think they would said mr tupman with an air of indifference oh you quiz i know what you were going to say what inquired mr tupman who had not precisely made up his mind to say anything at all you were going to say that isabel stoops i know you were you men are such observers well so she does it can't be denied and certainly if there is one thing more than another that makes a girl look ugly it is stooping i often tell her that when she gets a little older she'll be quite frightful well you are a quiz mr tupman had no objection to earning the reputation at so cheap a rate so he looked very knowing and smiled mysteriously what a sarcastic smile said the admiring rachael i declare i'm quite afraid of you afraid of me oh you can't disguise anything from me i know what that smile means very well what said mr tupman who had not the slightest notion himself you mean said the amiable aunt sinking her voice still lower you mean that you don't think isabella's stooping is as bad as emily's boldness well she is bold you cannot think how wretched it makes me sometimes i'm sure i cry about it for hours together my dear brother is so good and so unsuspicious that he never sees it if he did i'm quite certain it would break his heart i wish i could think it was only manner i hope it may be here the affectionate relative heaved a deep sigh and shook her head despondingly i'm sure aunt's talking about us whispered miss emily wardle to her sister i'm quite certain of it she looks so malicious is she replied isabella hem aunt dear yes my dear love i'm so afraid you'll catch cold aunt have a silk handkerchief to tie round your dear old head you really should take care of yourself consider your age however well deserved this piece of retaliation might have been it was as vindictive a one as could well have been resorted to there is no guessing in what form of reply the aunt's indignation would have vented itself had not mr wardle unconsciously changed the subject by calling emphatically for joe damn that boy said the old gentleman he's gone to sleep again very extraordinary boy that said mr pickwick does he always sleep in this way sleep said the old gentleman he's always asleep goes on errands fast asleep and snores as he waits at table how very odd said mr pickwick ah odd indeed returned the old gentleman i'm proud of that boy wouldn't part with him on any account he's a natural curiosity here joe joe take these things away and open another bottle d'ye hear the fat boy rose opened his eyes swallowed the huge piece of pie he had been in the act of masticating when he last fell asleep and slowly obeyed his master's orders gloating languidly over the remains of the feast as he removed the plates and deposited them in the hamper the fresh bottle was produced and speedily emptied the hamper was made fast in its old place the fat boy once more mounted the box the spectacles and pocket glass were again adjusted and the evolutions of the military recommenced there was a great fizzing and banging of guns and starting of ladies and then a mine was sprung to the gratification of everybody and when the mine had gone off the military and the company followed its example and went off too now mind said the old gentleman as he shook hands with mr pickwick at the conclusion of a conversation which had been carried on at intervals during the conclusion of the proceedings we shall see you all to morrow most certainly replied mr pickwick you have got the address manor farm dingley dell said mr pickwick consulting his pocket book that's it said the old gentleman i don't let you off mind under a week and undertake that you shall see everything worth seeing if you've come down for a country life come to me and i'll give you plenty of it joe damn that boy he's gone to sleep again joe help tom put in the horses the horses were put in the driver mounted the fat boy clambered up by his side farewells were exchanged and the carriage rattled off as the pickwickians turned round to take a last glimpse of it the setting sun cast a rich glow on the faces of their entertainers and fell upon the form of the fat boy his head was sunk upon his bosom and he slumbered again chapter v illustration a short one showing among other matters how mr pickwick undertook to drive and mr winkle to ride and how they both did it bright and pleasant was the sky balmy the air and beautiful the appearance of every object around as mr pickwick leant over the balustrades of rochester bridge contemplating nature and waiting for breakfast the scene was indeed one which might well have charmed a far less reflective mind than that to which it was presented on the left of the spectator lay the ruined wall broken in many places and in some overhanging the narrow beach below in rude and heavy masses huge knots of sea weed hung upon the jagged and pointed stones trembling in every breath of wind and the green ivy clung mournfully round the dark and ruined battlements behind it rose the ancient castle its towers roofless and its massive walls crumbling away but telling us proudly of its own might and strength as when seven hundred years ago it rang with the clash of arms or resounded with the noise of feasting and revelry on either side the banks of the medway covered with corn fields and pastures with here and there a windmill or a distant church stretched away as far as the eye could see presenting a rich and varied landscape rendered more beautiful by the changing shadows which passed swiftly across it as the thin and half formed clouds skimmed away in the light of the morning sun the river reflecting the clear blue of the sky glistened and sparkled as it flowed noiselessly on and the oars of the fishermen dipped into the water with a clear and liquid sound as the heavy but picturesque boats glided slowly down the stream mr pickwick was roused from the agreeable reverie into which he had been led by the objects before him by a deep sigh and a touch on his shoulder he turned round and the dismal man was at his side contemplating the scene inquired the dismal man i was said mr pickwick and congratulating yourself on being up so soon mr pickwick nodded assent ah people need to rise early to see the sun in all his splendour for his brightness seldom lasts the day through the morning of day and the morning of life are but too much alike you speak truly sir said mr pickwick how common the saying continued the dismal man 'the morning's too fine to last' how well might it be applied to our every day existence god what would i forfeit to have the days of my childhood restored or to be able to forget them for ever you have seen much trouble sir said mr pickwick compassionately i have said the dismal man hurriedly i have more than those who see me now would believe possible he paused for an instant and then said abruptly did it ever strike you on such a morning as this that drowning would be happiness and peace god bless me no replied mr pickwick edging a little from the balustrade as the possibility of the dismal man's tipping him over by way of experiment occurred to him rather forcibly i have thought so often said the dismal man without noticing the action the calm cool water seems to me to murmur an invitation to repose and rest a bound a splash a brief struggle there is an eddy for an instant it gradually subsides into a gentle ripple the waters have closed above your head and the world has closed upon your miseries and misfortunes for ever the sunken eye of the dismal man flashed brightly as he spoke but the momentary excitement quickly subsided and he turned calmly away as he said there enough of that i wish to see you on another subject you invited me to read that paper the night before last and listened attentively while i did so i did replied mr pickwick and i certainly thought i asked for no opinion said the dismal man interrupting him and i want none you are travelling for amusement and instruction suppose i forwarded you a curious manuscript observe not curious because wild or improbable but curious as a leaf from the romance of real life would you communicate it to the club of which you have spoken so frequently certainly replied mr pickwick if you wished it and it would be entered on their transactions you shall have it replied the dismal man your address and mr pickwick having communicated their probable route the dismal man carefully noted it down in a greasy pocket book and resisting mr pickwick's pressing invitation to breakfast left that gentleman at his inn and walked slowly away mr pickwick found that his three companions had risen and were waiting his arrival to commence breakfast which was ready laid in tempting display they sat down to the meal and broiled ham eggs tea coffee and sundries began to disappear with a rapidity which at once bore testimony to the excellence of the fare and the appetites of its consumers now about manor farm said mr pickwick how shall we go we had better consult the waiter perhaps said mr tupman and the waiter was summoned accordingly dingley dell gentlemen fifteen miles gentlemen cross road post chaise sir post chaise won't hold more than two said mr pickwick true sir beg your pardon sir very nice four wheeled chaise sir seat for two behind one in front for the gentleman that drives oh beg your pardon sir that'll only hold three what's to be done said mr snodgrass perhaps one of the gentlemen would like to ride sir suggested the waiter looking towards mr winkle very good saddle horses sir any of mr wardle's men coming to rochester bring 'em back sir the very thing said mr pickwick winkle will you go on horseback mr winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the very lowest recesses of his own heart relative to his equestrian skill but as he would not have them even suspected on any account he at once replied with great hardihood certainly i should enjoy it of all things mr winkle had rushed upon his fate there was no resource let them be at the door by eleven said mr pickwick very well sir replied the waiter the waiter retired the breakfast concluded and the travellers ascended to their respective bedrooms to prepare a change of clothing to take with them on their approaching expedition mr pickwick had made his preliminary arrangements and was looking over the coffee room blinds at the passengers in the street when the waiter entered and announced that the chaise was ready an announcement which the vehicle itself confirmed by forthwith appearing before the coffee room blinds aforesaid it was a curious little green box on four wheels with a low place like a wine bin for two behind and an elevated perch for one in front drawn by an immense brown horse displaying great symmetry of bone an hostler stood near holding by the bridle another immense horse apparently a near relative to the animal in the chaise ready saddled for mr winkle bless my soul said mr pickwick as they stood upon the pavement while the coats were being put in bless my soul who's to drive i never thought of that oh you of course said mr tupman of course said mr snodgrass i exclaimed mr pickwick not the slightest fear sir interposed the hostler warrant him quiet sir a hinfant in arms might drive him he don't shy does he inquired mr pickwick shy sir he wouldn't shy if he was to meet a vaggin load of monkeys with their tails burnt off the last recommendation was indisputable mr tupman and mr snodgrass got into the bin mr pickwick ascended to his perch and deposited his feet on a floor clothed shelf erected beneath it for that purpose now shiny villiam said the hostler to the deputy hostler give the gen'lm'n the ribbins shiny villiam so called probably from his sleek hair and oily countenance placed the reins in mr pickwick's left hand and the upper hostler thrust a whip into his right wo o cried mr pickwick as the tall quadruped evinced a decided inclination to back into the coffee room window wo o echoed mr tupman and mr snodgrass from the bin only his playfulness gen'lm'n said the head hostler encouragingly jist kitch hold on him villiam the deputy restrained the animal's impetuosity and the principal ran to assist mr winkle in mounting t'other side sir if you please blowed if the gen'lm'n worn't gettin' up on the wrong side whispered a grinning post boy to the inexpressibly gratified waiter mr winkle thus instructed climbed into his saddle with about as much difficulty as he would have experienced in getting up the side of a first rate man of war all right inquired mr pickwick with an inward presentiment that it was all wrong all right replied mr winkle faintly let 'em go cried the hostler hold him in sir and away went the chaise and the saddle horse with mr pickwick on the box of the one and mr winkle on the back of the other to the delight and gratification of the whole inn yard what makes him go sideways said mr snodgrass in the bin to mr winkle in the saddle i can't imagine replied mr winkle his horse was drifting up the street in the most mysterious manner side first with his head toward one side of the way and his tail towards the other illustration wo o cried mr pickwick wo o echoed mr tupman and mr snodgrass from the bin mr pickwick had no leisure to observe either this or any other particular the whole of his faculties being concentrated in the management of the animal attached to the chaise who displayed various peculiarities highly interesting to a bystander but by no means equally amusing to any one seated behind him besides constantly jerking his head up in a very unpleasant and uncomfortable manner and tugging at the reins to an extent which rendered it a matter of great difficulty for mr pickwick to hold them he had a singular propensity for darting suddenly every now and then to the side of the road then stopping short and then rushing forward for some minutes at a speed which it was wholly impossible to control illustration t'other side sir if you please what can he mean by this said mr snodgrass when the horse had executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time i don't know replied mr tupman it looks very like shying don't it mr snodgrass was about to reply when he was interrupted by a shout from mr pickwick wo o said that gentleman i have dropped my whip winkle said mr snodgrass as the equestrian came trotting up on the tall horse with his hat over his ears and shaking all over as if he would shake to pieces with the violence of the exercise pick up the whip there's a good fellow mr winkle pulled at the bridle of the tall horse till he was black in the face and having at length succeeded in stopping him dismounted handed the whip to mr pickwick and grasping the reins prepared to remount now whether the tall horse in the natural playfulness of his disposition was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with mr winkle or whether it occurred to him that he could perform the journey as much to his own satisfaction without a rider as with one are points upon which of course we can arrive at no definite and distinct conclusion by whatever motives the animal was actuated certain it is that mr winkle had no sooner touched the reins than he slipped them over his head and darted backwards to their full length poor fellow said mr winkle soothingly poor fellow good old horse the poor fellow was proof against flattery the more mr winkle tried to get nearer him the more he sidled away and notwithstanding all kinds of coaxing and wheedling there were mr winkle and the horse going round and round each other for ten minutes at the end of which time each was at precisely the same distance from the other as when they first commenced an unsatisfactory sort of thing under any circumstances but particularly so in a lonely road where no assistance can be procured what am i to do shouted mr winkle after the dodging had been prolonged for a considerable time what am i to do i can't get on him illustration mr pickwick ran to his assistance you had better lead him till we come to a turnpike replied mr pickwick from the chaise but he won't come roared mr winkle do come and hold him mr pickwick was the very personation of kindness and humanity he threw the reins on the horse's back and having descended from his seat carefully drew the chaise into the hedge lest anything should come along the road and stepped back to the assistance of his distressed companion leaving mr tupman and mr snodgrass in the vehicle the horse no sooner beheld mr pickwick advancing towards him with the chaise whip in his hand than he exchanged the rotatory motion in which he had previously indulged for a retrograde movement of so very determined a character that it at once drew mr winkle who was still at the end of the bridle at a rather quicker rate than fast walking in the direction from which they had just come mr pickwick ran to his assistance but the faster mr pickwick ran forward the faster the horse ran backward there was a great scraping of feet and kicking up of the dust and at last mr winkle his arms being nearly pulled out of their sockets fairly let go his hold the horse paused stared shook his head turned round and quietly trotted home to rochester leaving mr winkle and mr pickwick gazing on each other with countenances of blank dismay a rattling noise at a little distance attracted their attention they looked up bless my soul exclaimed the agonised mr pickwick there's the other horse running away it was but too true the animal was startled by the noise and the reins were on his back the result may be guessed he tore off with the four wheeled chaise behind him and mr tupman and mr snodgrass in the four wheeled chaise the heat was a short one mr tupman threw himself into the hedge mr snodgrass followed his example the horse dashed the four wheeled chaise against a wooden bridge separated the wheels from the body and the bin from the perch and finally stood stock still to gaze upon the ruin he had made the first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate their unfortunate companions from their bed of quickset a process which gave them the unspeakable satisfaction of discovering that they had sustained no injury beyond sundry rents in their garments and various lacerations from the brambles the next thing to be done was to unharness the horse this complicated process having been effected the party walked slowly forward leading the horse among them and abandoning the chaise to its fate an hour's walking brought the travellers to a little road side public house with two elm trees a horse trough and a sign post in front one or two deformed hay ricks behind a kitchen garden at the side and rotten sheds and mouldering out houses jumbled in strange confusion all about it a red headed man was working in the garden and to him mr pickwick called lustily hallo there the red headed man raised his body shaded his eyes with his hand and stared long and coolly at mr pickwick and his companions hallo there repeated mr pickwick hallo was the red headed man's reply how far is it to dingley dell better er seven mile is it a good road no 'tan't having uttered this brief reply and apparently satisfied himself with another scrutiny the red headed man resumed his work we want to put this horse up here said mr pickwick i suppose we can can't we want to put that ere horse up do ee repeated the red headed man leaning on his spade of course replied mr pickwick who had by this time advanced horse in hand to the garden rails missus roared the man with the red head emerging from the garden and looking very hard at the horse missus a tall bony woman straight all the way down in a coarse blue pelisse with the waist an inch or two below her armpits responded to the call can we put this horse up here my good woman said mr tupman advancing and speaking in his most seductive tones the woman looked very hard at the whole party and the red headed man whispered something in her ear no replied the woman after a little consideration i'm afeered on it afraid exclaimed mr pickwick what's the woman afraid of it got us into trouble last time said the woman turning into the house i woant have nothin' to say to 'un most extraordinary thing i ever met with in my life said the astonished mr pickwick i i really believe whispered mr winkle as his friends gathered round him that they think we have come by this horse in some dishonest manner what exclaimed mr pickwick in a storm of indignation mr winkle modestly repeated his suggestion hallo you fellow said the angry mr pickwick do you think we stole this horse i'm sure ye did replied the red headed man with a grin which agitated his countenance from one auricular organ to the other saying which he turned into the house and banged the door after him it's like a dream ejaculated mr pickwick a hideous dream the idea of a man's walking about all day with a dreadful horse that he can't get rid of the depressed pickwickians turned moodily away with a tall quadruped for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust following slowly at their heels it was late in the afternoon when the four friends and their four footed companion turned into the lane leading to manor farm and even when they were so near their place of destination the pleasure they would have otherwise experienced was materially damped as they reflected on the singularity of their appearance and the absurdity of their situation torn clothes lacerated faces dusty shoes exhausted looks and above all the horse oh how mr pickwick cursed that horse he had eyed the noble animal from time to time with looks expressive of hatred and revenge more than once he had calculated the probable amount of the expense he would incur by cutting his throat and now the temptation to destroy him or to cast him loose upon the world rushed upon his mind with tenfold force he was roused from a meditation on these dire imaginings by the sudden appearance of two figures at a turn of the lane it was mr wardle and his faithful attendant the fat boy why where have you been said the hospitable old gentleman i've been waiting for you all day well you do look tired what scratches not hurt i hope eh well i am glad to hear that very so you've been spilt eh never mind common accident in these parts joe he's asleep again joe take that horse from the gentleman and lead it into the stable the fat boy sauntered heavily behind them with the animal and the old gentleman condoling with his guests in homely phrase on so much of the day's adventures as they thought proper to communicate led the way to the kitchen we'll have you put to rights here said the old gentleman and then i'll introduce you to the people in the parlour emma bring out the cherry brandy now jane a needle and thread here towels and water mary come girls bustle about three or four buxom girls speedily dispersed in search of the different articles in requisition while a couple of large headed circular visaged males rose from their seats in the chimney corner for although it was a may evening their attachment to the wood fire appeared as cordial as if it were christmas and dived into some obscure recesses from which they speedily produced a bottle of blacking and some half dozen brushes bustle said the old gentleman again but the admonition was quite unnecessary for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy and another brought in the towels and one of the men suddenly seizing mr pickwick by the leg at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance brushed away at his foot till his corns were red hot while the other shampoo'd mr winkle with a heavy clothes brush indulging during the operation in that hissing sound which hostlers are wont to produce when engaged in rubbing down a horse mr snodgrass having concluded his ablutions took a survey of the room while standing with his back to the fire sipping his cherry brandy with heartfelt satisfaction he describes it as a large apartment with a red brick floor and a capacious chimney the ceiling garnished with hams sides of bacon and ropes of onions the walls were decorated with several hunting whips two or three bridles a saddle and an old rusty blunderbuss with an inscription below it intimating that it was loaded as it had been on the same authority for half a century at least an old eight day clock of solemn and sedate demeanour ticked gravely in one corner and a silver watch of equal antiquity dangled from one of the many hooks which ornamented the dresser ready said the old gentleman inquiringly when his guests had been washed mended brushed and brandied quite replied mr pickwick come along then and the party having traversed several dark passages and being joined by mr tupman who had lingered behind to snatch a kiss from emma for which he had been duly rewarded with sundry pushings and scratchings arrived at the parlour door welcome said their hospitable host throwing it open and stepping forward to announce them welcome gentlemen to manor farm chapter vi illustration an old fashioned card party the clergyman's verses the story of the convict's return several guests who were assembled in the old parlour rose to greet mr pickwick and his friends upon their entrance and during the performance of the ceremony of introduction with all due formalities mr pickwick had leisure to observe the appearance and speculate upon the characters and pursuits of the persons by whom he was surrounded a habit in which he in common with many other great men delighted to indulge a very old lady in a lofty cap and faded silk gown no less a personage than mr wardle's mother occupied the post of honour on the right hand corner of the chimney piece and various certificates of her having been brought up in the way she should go when young and of her not having departed from it when old ornamented the walls in the form of samplers of ancient date worsted landscapes of equal antiquity and crimson silk tea kettle holders of a more modern period the aunt the two young ladies and mr wardle each vying with the other in paying zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lady crowded round her easy chair one holding her ear trumpet another an orange and a third a smelling bottle while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support on the opposite side sat a bald headed old gentleman with a good humoured benevolent face the clergyman of dingley dell and next him sat his wife a stout blooming old lady who looked as if she were well skilled not only in the art and mystery of manufacturing home made cordials greatly to other people's satisfaction but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own a little hard headed ribston pippin faced man was conversing with a fat old gentleman in one corner and two or three more old gentlemen and two or three more old ladies sat bolt upright and motionless on their chairs staring very hard at mr pickwick and his fellow voyagers mr pickwick mother said mr wardle at the very top of his voice ah said the old lady shaking her head i can't hear you mr pickwick grandma screamed both the young ladies together ah exclaimed the old lady well it don't much matter he don't care for an old 'ooman like me i dare say i assure you ma'am said mr pickwick grasping the old lady's hand and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance i assure you ma'am that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family and looking so young and well ah said the old lady after a short pause it's all very fine i dare say but i can't hear him grandma's rather put out now said miss isabella wardle in a low tone but she'll talk to you presently mr pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle delightful situation this said mr pickwick delightful echoed messrs snodgrass tupman and winkle well i think it is said mr wardle there an't a better spot o' ground in all kent sir said the hard headed man with the pippin face there an't indeed sir i'm sure there an't sir the hard headed man looked triumphantly round as if he had been very much contradicted by somebody but had got the better of him at last there an't a better spot o' ground in all kent said the hard headed man again after a pause 'cept mullins's meadows observed the fat man solemnly mullins's meadows ejaculated the other with profound contempt ah mullins's meadows repeated the fat man reg'lar good land that interposed another fat man and so it is sure ly said a third fat man everybody knows that said the corpulent host the hard headed man looked dubiously round but finding himself in the minority assumed a compassionate air and said no more what are they talking about inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters in a very audible voice for like many deaf people she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself about the land grandma what about the land nothing the matter is there no no mr miller was saying our land was better than mullins's meadows how should he know anything about it inquired the old lady indignantly miller's a conceited coxcomb and you may tell him i said so saying which the old lady quite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper drew herself up and looked carving knives at the hard headed delinquent come come said the bustling host with a natural anxiety to change the conversation what say you to a rubber mr pickwick i should like it of all things replied that gentleman but pray don't make up one on my account oh i assure you mother's very fond of a rubber said mr wardle an't you mother the old lady who was much less deaf on this subject than on any other replied in the affirmative joe joe said the old gentleman joe damn that oh here he is put out the card tables the lethargic youth contrived without any additional rousing to set out two card tables the one for pope joan and the other for whist the whist players were mr pickwick and the old lady mr miller and the fat gentleman the round game comprised the rest of the company the rubber was conducted with all that gravity of deportment and sedateness of demeanour which befit the pursuit entitled whist a solemn observance to which as it appears to us the title of game has been very irreverently and ignominiously applied the round game table on the other hand was so boisterously merry as materially to interrupt the contemplations of mr miller who not being quite so much absorbed as he ought to have been contrived to commit various high crimes and misdemeanours which excited the wrath of the fat gentleman to a very great extent and called forth the good humour of the old lady in a proportionate degree there said the criminal miller triumphantly as he took up the odd trick at the conclusion of a hand that could not have been played better i flatter myself impossible to have made another trick miller ought to have trumped the diamond oughtn't he sir said the old lady mr pickwick nodded assent ought i though said the unfortunate with a doubtful appeal to his partner you ought sir said the fat gentleman in an awful voice very sorry said the crestfallen miller much use that growled the fat gentleman two by honours makes us eight said mr pickwick another hand can you one inquired the old lady i can replied mr pickwick double single and the rub never was such luck said mr miller never was such cards said the fat gentleman a solemn silence mr pickwick humorous the old lady serious the fat gentleman captious and mr miller timorous another double said the old lady triumphantly making a memorandum of the circumstance by placing one sixpence and a battered halfpenny under the candlestick a double sir said mr pickwick quite aware of the fact sir replied the fat gentleman sharply another game with a similar result was followed by a revoke from the unlucky miller on which the fat gentleman burst into a state of high personal excitement which lasted until the conclusion of the game when he retired into a corner and remained perfectly mute for one hour and twenty seven minutes at the end of which time he emerged from his retirement and offered mr pickwick a pinch of snuff with the air of a man who had made up his mind to a christian forgiveness of injuries sustained the old lady's hearing decidedly improved and the unlucky miller felt as much out of his element as a dolphin in a sentry box meanwhile the round game proceeded right merrily isabella wardle and mr trundle went partners and emily wardle and mr snodgrass did the same and even mr tupman and the spinster aunt established a joint stock company of fish and flattery old mr wardle was in the very height of his jollity and he was so funny in his management of the board and the old ladies were so sharp after their winnings that the whole table was in a perpetual roar of merriment and laughter there was one old lady who always had about half a dozen cards to pay for at which everybody laughed regularly every round and when the old lady looked cross at having to pay they laughed louder than ever on which the old lady's face gradually brightened up till at last she laughed louder than any of them then when the spinster aunt got matrimony the young ladies laughed afresh and the spinster aunt seemed disposed to be pettish till feeling mr tupman squeezing her hand under the table she brightened up too and looked rather knowing as if matrimony in reality were not quite so far off as some people thought for whereupon everybody laughed again and especially old mr wardle who enjoyed a joke as much as the youngest as to mr snodgrass he did nothing but whisper poetical sentiments into his partner's ear which made one old gentleman facetiously sly about partnerships at cards and partnerships for life and caused the aforesaid old gentleman to make some remarks thereupon accompanied with divers winks and chuckles which made the company very merry and the old gentleman's wife especially so and mr winkle came out with jokes which are very well known in town but are not at all known in the country and as everybody laughed at them very heartily and said they were very capital mr winkle was in a state of great honour and glory and the benevolent clergyman looked pleasantly on for the happy faces which surrounded the table made the good old man feel happy too and though the merriment was rather boisterous still it came from the heart and not from the lips and this is the right sort of merriment after all the evening glided swiftly away in these cheerful recreations and when the substantial though homely supper had been despatched and the little party formed a social circle round the fire mr pickwick thought he had never felt so happy in his life and at no time so much disposed to enjoy and make the most of the passing moment now this said the hospitable host who was sitting in great state next the old lady's arm chair with her hand fast clasped in his this is just what i like the happiest moments of my life have been passed at this old fire side and i am so attached to it that i keep up a blazing fire here every evening until it actually grows too hot to bear it why my poor old mother here used to sit before this fire place upon that little stool when she was a girl didn't you mother the tear which starts unbidden to the eye when the recollection of old times and the happiness of many years ago is suddenly recalled stole down the old lady's face as she shook her head with a melancholy smile you must excuse my talking about this old place mr pickwick resumed the host after a short pause for i love it dearly and know no other the old houses and fields seem like living friends to me and so does our little church with the ivy about which by the by our excellent friend there made a song when he first came amongst us mr snodgrass have you anything in your glass plenty thank you replied that gentleman whose poetic curiosity had been greatly excited by the last observations of his entertainer i beg your pardon but you were talking about the song of the ivy you must ask our friend opposite about that said the host knowingly indicating the clergyman by a nod of his head may i say that i should like to hear you repeat it sir said mr snodgrass why really replied the clergyman it's a very slight affair and the only excuse i have for having ever perpetrated it is that i was a young man at the time such as it is however you shall hear it if you wish a murmur of curiosity was of course the reply and the old gentleman proceeded to recite with the aid of sundry promptings from his wife the lines in question i call them said he the ivy green oh a dainty plant is the ivy green that creepeth o'er ruins old of right choice food are his meals i ween in his cell so lone and cold the wall must be crumbled the stone decayed to pleasure his dainty whim and the mouldering dust that years have made is a merry meal for him creeping where no life is seen a rare old plant is the ivy green fast he stealeth on though he wears no wings and a staunch old heart has he how closely he twineth how tight he clings to his friend the huge oak tree and slyly he traileth along the ground and his leaves he gently waves and he joyously hugs and crawleth round the rich mould of dead men's graves creeping where grim death has been a rare old plant is the ivy green whole ages have fled and their works decayed and nations have scattered been but the stout old ivy shall never fade from its hale and hearty green the brave old plant in its lonely days shall fatten upon the past for the stateliest building man can raise is the ivy's food at last creeping on where time has been a rare old plant is the ivy green while the old gentleman repeated these lines a second time to enable mr snodgrass to note them down mr pickwick perused the lineaments of his face with an expression of great interest the old gentleman having concluded his dictation and mr snodgrass having returned his note book to his pocket mr pickwick said excuse me sir for making the remark on so short an acquaintance but a gentleman like yourself cannot fail i should think to have observed many scenes and incidents worth recording in the course of your experience as a minister of the gospel i have witnessed some certainly replied the old gentleman but the incidents and characters have been of a homely and ordinary nature my sphere of action being so very limited you did make some notes i think about john edmunds did you not inquired mr wardle who appeared very desirous to draw his friend out for the edification of his new visitors the old gentleman slightly nodded his head in token of assent and was proceeding to change the subject when mr pickwick said i beg your pardon sir but pray if i may venture to inquire who was john edmunds the very thing i was about to ask said mr snodgrass eagerly you are fairly in for it said the jolly host you must satisfy the curiosity of these gentlemen sooner or later so you had better take advantage of this favourable opportunity and do so at once the old gentleman smiled good humouredly as he drew his chair forward the remainder of the party drew their chairs closer together especially mr tupman and the spinster aunt who were possibly rather hard of hearing and the old lady's ear trumpet having been duly adjusted and mr miller who had fallen asleep during the recital of the verses roused from his slumbers by an admonitory pinch administered beneath the table by his ex partner the solemn fat man the old gentleman without farther preface commenced the following tale to which we have taken the liberty of prefixing the title of the convict's return when i first settled in this village said the old gentleman which is now just five and twenty years ago the most notorious person among my parishioners was a man of the name of edmunds who leased a small farm near this spot he was a morose savage hearted bad man idle and dissolute in his habits cruel and ferocious in his disposition beyond the few lazy and reckless vagabonds with whom he sauntered away his time in the fields or sotted in the ale house he had not a single friend or acquaintance no one cared to speak to the man whom many feared and every one detested and edmunds was shunned by all this man had a wife and one son who when i first came here was about twelve years old of the acuteness of that woman's sufferings of the gentle and enduring manner in which she bore them of the agony of solicitude with which she reared that boy no one can form an adequate conception heaven forgive me the supposition if it be an uncharitable one but i do firmly and in my soul believe that the man systematically tried for many years to break her heart but she bore it all for her child's sake and however strange it may seem to many for his father's too for brute as he was and cruelly as he had treated her she had loved him once and the recollection of what he had been to her awakened feelings of forbearance and meekness under suffering in her bosom to which all god's creatures but women are strangers they were poor they could not be otherwise when the man pursued such courses but the woman's unceasing and unwearied exertions early and late morning noon and night kept them above actual want those exertions were but ill repaid people who passed the spot in the evening sometimes at a late hour of the night reported that they had heard the moans and sobs of a woman in distress and the sound of blows and more than once when it was past midnight the boy knocked softly at the door of a neighbour's house whither he had been sent to escape the drunken fury of his unnatural father during the whole of this time and when the poor creature often bore about her marks of ill usage and violence which she could not wholly conceal she was a constant attendant at our little church regularly every sunday morning and afternoon she occupied the same seat with the boy at her side and though they were both poorly dressed much more so than many of their neighbours who were in a lower station they were always neat and clean every one had a friendly nod and a kind word for 'poor mrs edmunds' and sometimes when she stopped to exchange a few words with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service in the little row of elm trees which leads to the church porch or lingered behind to gaze with a mother's pride and fondness upon her healthy boy as he sported before her with some little companions her care worn face would lighten up with an expression of heartfelt gratitude and she would look if not cheerful and happy at least tranquil and contented five or six years passed away the boy had become a robust and well grown youth the time that had strengthened the child's slight frame and knit his weak limbs into the strength of manhood had bowed his mother's form and enfeebled her steps but the arm that should have supported her was no longer locked in hers the face that should have cheered her no more looked upon her own she occupied her old seat but there was a vacant one beside her the bible was kept as carefully as ever the places were found and folded down as they used to be but there was no one to read it with her and the tears fell thick and fast upon the book and blotted the words from her eyes neighbours were as kind as they were wont to be of old but she shunned their greetings with averted head there was no lingering among the old elm trees now no cheering anticipations of happiness yet in store the desolate woman drew her bonnet closer over her face and walked hurriedly away shall i tell you that the young man who looking back to the earliest of his childhood's days to which memory and consciousness extended and carrying his recollection down to that moment could remember nothing which was not in some way connected with a long series of voluntary privations suffered by his mother for his sake with ill usage and insult and violence and all endured for him shall i tell you that he with a reckless disregard for her breaking heart and a sullen wilful forgetfulness of all she had done and borne for him had linked himself with depraved and abandoned men and was madly pursuing a headlong career which must bring death to him and shame to her alas for human nature you have anticipated it long since the measure of the unhappy woman's misery and misfortune was about to be completed numerous offences had been committed in the neighbourhood the perpetrators remained undiscovered and their boldness increased a robbery of a daring and aggravated nature occasioned a vigilance of pursuit and a strictness of search they had not calculated on young edmunds was suspected with three companions he was apprehended committed tried condemned to die the wild and piercing shriek from a woman's voice which resounded through the court when the solemn sentence was pronounced rings in my ears at this moment that cry struck a terror to the culprit's heart which trial condemnation the approach of death itself had failed to awaken the lips which had been compressed in dogged sullenness throughout quivered and parted involuntarily the face turned ashy pale as the cold perspiration broke forth from every pore the sturdy limbs of the felon trembled and he staggered in the dock in the first transports of her mental anguish the suffering mother threw herself upon her knees at my feet and fervently besought the almighty being who had hitherto supported her in all her troubles to release her from a world of woe and misery and to spare the life of her only child a burst of grief and a violent struggle such as i hope i may never have to witness again succeeded i knew that her heart was breaking from that hour but i never once heard complaint or murmur escape her lips it was a piteous spectacle to see that woman in the prison yard from day to day eagerly and fervently attempting by affection and entreaty to soften the hard heart of her obdurate son it was in vain he remained moody obstinate and unmoved not even the unlooked for commutation of his sentence to transportation for fourteen years softened for an instant the sullen hardihood of his demeanour but the spirit of resignation and endurance that had so long upheld her was unable to contend against bodily weakness and infirmity she fell sick she dragged her tottering limbs from the bed to visit her son once more but her strength failed her and she sunk powerless on the ground and now the boasted coldness and indifference of the young man were tested indeed and the retribution that fell heavily upon him nearly drove him mad a day passed away and his mother was not there another flew by and she came not near him a third evening arrived and yet he had not seen her and in four and twenty hours he was to be separated from her perhaps for ever oh how the long forgotten thoughts of former days rushed upon his mind as he almost ran up and down the narrow yard as if intelligence would arrive the sooner for his hurrying and how bitterly a sense of his helplessness and desolation rushed upon him when he heard the truth his mother the only parent he had ever known lay ill it might be dying within one mile of the ground he stood on were he free and unfettered a few minutes would place him by her side he rushed to the gate and grasping the iron rail with the energy of desperation shook it till it rang again and threw himself against the thick wall as if to force a passage through the stone but the strong building mocked his feeble efforts and he beat his hands together and wept like a child i bore the mother's forgiveness and blessing to her son in prison and i carried his solemn assurance of repentance and his fervent supplication for pardon to her sick bed i heard with pity and compassion the repentant man devise a thousand little plans for her comfort and support when he returned but i knew that many months before he could reach his place of destination his mother would be no longer of this world he was removed by night a few weeks afterwards the poor woman's soul took its flight i confidently hope and solemnly believe to a place of eternal happiness and rest i performed the burial service over her remains she lies in our little churchyard there is no stone at her grave's head her sorrows were known to man her virtues to god it had been arranged previously to the convict's departure that he should write to his mother as soon as he could obtain permission and that the letter should be addressed to me the father had positively refused to see his son from the moment of his apprehension and it was a matter of indifference to him whether he lived or died many years passed over without any intelligence of him and when more than half his term of transportation had expired and i had received no letter i concluded him to be dead as indeed i almost hoped he might be edmunds however had been sent a considerable distance up the country on his arrival at the settlement and to this circumstance perhaps may be attributed the fact that though several letters were despatched none of them ever reached my hands he remained in the same place during the whole fourteen years at the expiration of the term steadily adhering to his old resolution and the pledge he gave his mother he made his way back to england amidst innumerable difficulties and returned on foot to his native place on a fine sunday evening in the month of august john edmunds set foot in the village he had left with shame and disgrace seventeen years before his nearest way lay through the churchyard the man's heart swelled as he crossed the stile the tall old elms through whose branches the declining sun cast here and there a rich ray of light upon the shady path awakened the associations of his earliest days he pictured himself as he was then clinging to his mother's hand and walking peacefully to church he remembered how he used to look up into her pale face and how her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she gazed upon his features tears which fell hot upon his forehead as she stooped to kiss him and made him weep too although he little knew then what bitter tears hers were he thought how often he had run merrily down that path with some childish playfellow looking back ever and again to catch his mother's smile or hear her gentle voice and then a veil seemed lifted from his memory and words of kindness unrequited and warnings despised and promises broken thronged upon his recollection till his heart failed him and he could bear it no longer he entered the church the evening service was concluded and the congregation had dispersed but it was not yet closed his steps echoed through the low building with a hollow sound and he almost feared to be alone it was so still and quiet he looked round him nothing was changed the place seemed smaller than it used to be but there were the old monuments on which he had gazed with childish awe a thousand times the little pulpit with its faded cushion the communion table before which he had so often repeated the commandments he had reverenced as a child and forgotten as a man he approached the old seat it looked cold and desolate the cushion had been removed and the bible was not there perhaps his mother now occupied a poorer seat or possibly she had grown infirm and could not reach the church alone he dared not think of what he feared a cold feeling crept over him and he trembled violently as he turned away an old man entered the porch just as he reached it edmunds started back for he knew him well many a time he had watched him digging graves in the churchyard what would he say to the returned convict the old man raised his eyes to the stranger's face bid him 'good evening' and walked slowly on he had forgotten him he walked down the hill and through the village the weather was warm and the people were sitting at their doors or strolling in their little gardens as he passed enjoying the serenity of the evening and their rest from labour many a look was turned towards him and many a doubtful glance he cast on either side to see whether any knew and shunned him there were strange faces in almost every house in some he recognised the burly form of some old schoolfellow a boy when he last saw him surrounded by a troop of merry children in others he saw seated in an easy chair at a cottage door a feeble and infirm old man whom he only remembered as a hale and hearty labourer but they had all forgotten him and he passed on unknown the last soft light of the setting sun had fallen on the earth casting a rich glow on the yellow corn sheaves and lengthening the shadows of the orchard trees as he stood before the old house the home of his infancy to which his heart had yearned with an intensity of affection not to be described through long and weary years of captivity and sorrow the paling was low though he well remembered the time when it had seemed a high wall to him and he looked over into the old garden there were more seeds and gayer flowers than there used to be but there were the old trees still the very tree under which he had lain a thousand times when tired of playing in the sun and felt the soft mild sleep of happy boyhood steal gently upon him there were voices within the house he listened but they fell strangely upon his ear he knew them not they were merry too and he well knew that his poor old mother could not be cheerful and he away the door opened and a group of little children bounded out shouting and romping the father with a little boy in his arms appeared at the door and they crowded round him clapping their tiny hands and dragging him out to join their joyous sports the convict thought on the many times he had shrunk from his father's sight in that very place he remembered how often he had buried his trembling head beneath the bed clothes and heard the harsh word and the hard stripe and his mother's wailing and though the man sobbed aloud with agony of mind as he left the spot his fist was clenched and his teeth were set in fierce and deadly passion and such was the return to which he had looked through the weary perspective of many years and for which he had undergone so much suffering no face of welcome no look of forgiveness no house to receive no hand to help him and this too in the old village what was his loneliness in the wild thick woods where man was never seen to this he felt that in the distant land of his bondage and infamy he had thought of his native place as it was when he left it not as it would be when he returned the sad reality struck coldly at his heart and his spirit sank within him he had not courage to make inquiries or to present himself to the only person who was likely to receive him with kindness and compassion he walked slowly on and shunning the road side like a guilty man turned into a meadow he well remembered and covering his face with his hands threw himself upon the grass he had not observed that a man was lying on the bank beside him his garments rustled as he turned round to steal a look at the new comer and edmunds raised his head the man had moved into a sitting posture his body was much bent and his face was wrinkled and yellow his dress denoted him an inmate of the workhouse he had the appearance of being very old but it looked more the effect of dissipation or disease than length of years he was staring hard at the stranger and though his eyes were lustreless and heavy at first they appeared to glow with an unnatural and alarmed expression after they had been fixed upon him for a short time until they seemed to be staring from their sockets edmunds gradually raised himself to his knees and looked more and more earnestly upon the old man's face they gazed upon each other in silence the old man was ghastly pale he shuddered and tottered to his feet edmunds sprang to his he stepped back a pace or two edmunds advanced 'let me hear you speak' said the convict in a thick broken voice 'stand off' cried the old man with a dreadful oath the convict drew closer to him 'stand off' shrieked the old man furious with terror he raised his stick and struck edmunds a heavy blow across the face 'father devil' murmured the convict between his set teeth he rushed wildly forward and clenched the old man by the throat but he was his father and his arm fell powerless by his side the old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields like the howl of an evil spirit his face turned black the gore rushed from his mouth and nose and dyed the grass a deep dark red as he staggered and fell he had ruptured a blood vessel and he was a dead man before his son could raise him in that corner of the churchyard said the old gentleman after a silence of a few moments in that corner of the churchyard of which i have spoken before there lies buried a man who was in my employment for three years after this event and who was truly contrite penitent and humbled if ever man was no one save myself knew in that man's lifetime who he was or whence he came it was john edmunds the returned convict chapter vii illustration how mr winkle instead of shooting at the pigeon and killing the crow shot at the crow and wounded the pigeon how the dingley dell cricket club played all muggleton and how all muggleton dined at the dingley dell expense with other interesting and instructive matters the fatiguing adventures of the day or the somniferous influence of the clergyman's tale operated so strongly on the drowsy tendencies of mr pickwick that in less than five minutes after he had been shown to his comfortable bedroom he fell into a sound and dreamless sleep from which he was only awakened by the morning sun darting his bright beams reproachfully into the apartment mr pickwick was no sluggard and he sprang like an ardent warrior from his tent bedstead pleasant pleasant country sighed the enthusiastic gentleman as he opened his lattice window who could live to gaze from day to day on bricks and slates who had once felt the influence of a scene like this who could continue to exist where there are no cows but the cows on the chimney pots nothing redolent of pan but pan tiles no crop but stone crop who could bear to drag out a life in such a spot who i ask could endure it and having cross examined solitude after the most approved precedents at considerable length mr pickwick thrust his head out of the lattice and looked around him the rich sweet smell of the hay ricks rose to his chamber window the hundred perfumes of the little flower garden beneath scented the air around the deep green meadows shone in the morning dew that glistened on every leaf as it trembled in the gentle air and the birds sang as if every sparkling drop were a fountain of inspiration to them mr pickwick fell into an enchanting and delicious reverie hallo was the sound that roused him he looked to the right but he saw nobody his eyes wandered to the left and pierced the prospect he stared into the sky but he wasn't wanted there and then he did what a common mind would have done at once looked into the garden and there saw mr wardle how are you said that good humoured individual out of breath with his own anticipations of pleasure beautiful morning an't it glad to see you up so early make haste down and come out i'll wait for you here mr pickwick needed no second invitation ten minutes sufficed for the completion of his toilet and at the expiration of that time he was by the old gentleman's side hallo said mr pickwick in his turn seeing that his companion was armed with a gun and that another lay ready on the grass what's going forward why your friend and i replied the host are going out rook shooting before breakfast he's a very good shot an't he i've heard him say he's a capital one replied mr pickwick but i never saw him aim at anything well said the host i wish he'd come joe joe the fat boy who under the exciting influence of the morning did not appear to be more than three parts and a fraction asleep emerged from the house go up and call the gentleman and tell him he'll find me and mr pickwick in the rookery show the gentleman the way there d'ye hear the boy departed to execute his commission and the host carrying both guns like a second robinson crusoe led the way from the garden this is the place said the old gentleman pausing after a few minutes' walking in an avenue of trees the information was unnecessary for the incessant cawing of the unconscious rooks sufficiently indicated their whereabout the old gentleman laid one gun on the ground and loaded the other here they are said mr pickwick and as he spoke the forms of mr tupman mr snodgrass and mr winkle appeared in the distance the fat boy not being quite certain which gentleman he was directed to call had with peculiar sagacity and to prevent the possibility of any mistake called them all come along shouted the old gentleman addressing mr winkle a keen hand like you ought to have been up long ago even to such poor work as this mr winkle responded with a forced smile and took up the spare gun with an expression of countenance which a metaphysical rook impressed with a foreboding of his approaching death by violence may be supposed to assume it might have been keenness but it looked remarkably like misery the old gentleman nodded and two ragged boys who had been marshalled to the spot under the direction of the infant lambert forthwith commenced climbing up two of the trees what are those lads for inquired mr pickwick abruptly he was rather alarmed for he was not quite certain but that the distress of the agricultural interest about which he had often heard a great deal might have compelled the small boys attached to the soil to earn a precarious and hazardous subsistence by making marks of themselves for inexperienced sportsmen only to start the game replied mr wardle laughing to what inquired mr pickwick why in plain english to frighten the rooks oh is that all you are satisfied quite very well shall i begin if you please said mr winkle glad of any respite stand aside then now for it the boy shouted and shook a branch with a nest on it half a dozen young rooks in violent conversation flew out to ask what the matter was the old gentleman fired by way of reply down fell one bird and off flew the others take him up joe said the old gentleman there was a smile upon the youth's face as he advanced indistinct visions of rook pie floated through his imagination he laughed as he retired with the bird it was a plump one now mr winkle said the host reloading his own gun fire away mr winkle advanced and levelled his gun mr pickwick and his friends cowered involuntarily to escape damage from the heavy fall of rooks which they felt quite certain would be occasioned by the devastating barrel of their friend there was a solemn pause a shout a flapping of wings a faint click hallo said the old gentleman won't it go inquired mr pickwick missed fire said mr winkle who was very pale probably from disappointment odd said the old gentleman taking the gun never knew one of them miss fire before why i don't see anything of the cap bless my soul said mr winkle i declare i forgot the cap the slight omission was rectified mr pickwick crouched again mr winkle stepped forward with an air of determination and resolution and mr tupman looked out from behind a tree the boy shouted four birds flew out mr winkle fired there was a scream as of an individual not a rook in corporeal anguish mr tupman had saved the lives of innumerable unoffending birds by receiving a portion of the charge in his left arm to describe the confusion that ensued would be impossible to tell how mr pickwick in the first transports of his emotion called mr winkle wretch how mr tupman lay prostrate on the ground and how mr winkle knelt horror stricken beside him how mr tupman called distractedly upon some feminine christian name and then opened first one eye and then the other and then fell back and shut them both all this would be as difficult to describe in detail as it would be to depict the gradual recovering of the unfortunate individual the binding up of his arm with pocket handkerchiefs and the conveying him back by slow degrees supported by the arms of his anxious friends illustration bless my soul said mr winkle i declare i forgot the cap they drew near the house the ladies were at the garden gate waiting for their arrival and their breakfast the spinster aunt appeared she smiled and beckoned them to walk quicker 'twas evident she knew not of the disaster poor thing there are times when ignorance is bliss indeed they approached nearer why what is the matter with the little old gentleman said isabella wardle the spinster aunt heeded not the remark she thought it applied to mr pickwick in her eyes tracy tupman was a youth she viewed his years through a diminishing glass don't be frightened called out the old host fearful of alarming his daughters the little party had crowded so completely round mr tupman that they could not yet clearly discern the nature of the accident don't be frightened said the host what's the matter screamed the ladies mr tupman has met with a little accident that's all the spinster aunt uttered a piercing scream burst into an hysteric laugh and fell backwards in the arms of her nieces throw some cold water over her said the old gentleman no no murmured the spinster aunt i am better now bella emily a surgeon is he wounded is he dead is he ha ha ha here the spinster aunt burst into fit number two of hysteric laughter interspersed with screams calm yourself said mr tupman affected almost to tears by this expression of sympathy with his sufferings dear dear madam calm yourself it is his voice exclaimed the spinster aunt and strong symptoms of fit number three developed themselves forthwith do not agitate yourself i entreat you dearest madam said mr tupman soothingly i am very little hurt i assure you then you are not dead ejaculated the hysterical lady oh say you are not dead don't be a fool rachael interposed mr wardle rather more roughly than was quite consistent with the poetic nature of the scene what the devil's the use of his saying he isn't dead no no i am not said mr tupman i require no assistance but yours let me lean on your arm he added in a whisper oh miss rachael the agitated female advanced and offered her arm they turned into the breakfast parlour mr tracy tupman pressed her hand to his lips and sank upon the sofa are you faint inquired the anxious rachael no said mr tupman it is nothing i shall be better presently he closed his eyes he sleeps murmured the spinster aunt his organs of vision had been closed nearly twenty seconds dear dear mr tupman mr tupman jumped up oh say those words again he exclaimed the lady started surely you did not hear them she said bashfully oh yes i did replied mr tupman repeat them if you would have me recover repeat them hush said the lady my brother mr tracy tupman resumed his former position and mr wardle accompanied by a surgeon entered the room the arm was examined the wound dressed and pronounced to be a very slight one and the minds of the company having been thus satisfied they proceeded to satisfy their appetites with countenances to which an expression of cheerfulness was again restored mr pickwick alone was silent and reserved doubt and distrust were exhibited in his countenance his confidence in mr winkle had been shaken greatly shaken by the proceedings of the morning are you a cricketer inquired mr wardle of the marksman at any other time mr winkle would have replied in the affirmative he felt the delicacy of the situation and modestly replied no are you sir inquired mr snodgrass i was once upon a time replied the host but i have given it up now i subscribe to the club here but i don't play the grand match is played to day i believe said mr pickwick it is replied the host of course you would like to see it i sir replied mr pickwick am delighted to view any sport which may be safely indulged in and in which the impotent effects of unskilful people do not endanger human life mr pickwick paused and looked steadily on mr winkle who quailed beneath his leader's searching glance the great man withdrew his eyes after a few minutes and added shall we be justified in leaving our wounded friend to the care of the ladies you cannot leave me in better hands said mr tupman quite impossible said mr snodgrass it was therefore settled that mr tupman should be left at home in charge of the females and that the remainder of the guests under the guidance of mr wardle should proceed to the spot where was to be held that trial of skill which had roused all muggleton from its torpor and inoculated dingley dell with a fever of excitement as their walk which was not above two miles long lay through shady lanes and sequestered footpaths and as their conversation turned upon the delightful scenery by which they were on every side surrounded mr pickwick was almost inclined to regret the expedition they had used when he found himself in the main street of the town of muggleton everybody whose genius has a topographical bent knows perfectly well that muggleton is a corporate town with a mayor burgesses and freemen and anybody who has consulted the addresses of the mayor to the freemen or the freemen to the mayor or both to the corporation or all three to parliament will learn from thence what they ought to have known before that muggleton is an ancient and loyal borough mingling a zealous advocacy of christian principles with a devoted attachment to commercial rights in demonstration whereof the mayor corporation and other inhabitants have presented at divers times no fewer than one thousand four hundred and twenty petitions against the continuance of negro slavery abroad and an equal number against any interference with the factory system at home sixty eight in favour of the sale of livings in the church and eighty six for abolishing sunday trading in the street mr pickwick stood in the principal street of this illustrious town and gazed with an air of curiosity not unmixed with interest on the objects around him there was an open square for the market place and in the centre of it a large inn with a sign post in front displaying an object very common in art but rarely met with in nature to wit a blue lion with three bow legs in the air balancing himself on the extreme point of the centre claw of his fourth foot there were within sight an auctioneer's and fire agency office a corn factor's a linen draper's a saddler's a distiller's a grocer's and a shoe shop the last mentioned warehouse being also appropriated to the diffusion of hats bonnets wearing apparel cotton umbrellas and useful knowledge there was a red brick house with a small paved court yard in front which anybody might have known belonged to the attorney and there was moreover another red brick house with venetian blinds and a large brass door plate with a very legible announcement that it belonged to the surgeon a few boys were making their way to the cricket field and two or three shop keepers who were standing at their doors looked as if they should like to be making their way to the same spot as indeed to all appearance they might have done without losing any great amount of custom thereby mr pickwick having paused to make these observations to be noted down at a more convenient period hastened to rejoin his friends who had turned out of the main street and were already within sight of the field of battle the wickets were pitched and so were a couple of marquees for the rest and refreshment of the contending parties the game had not yet commenced two or three dingley dellers and all muggletonians were amusing themselves with a majestic air by throwing the ball carelessly from hand to hand and several other gentlemen dressed like them in straw hats flannel jackets and white trousers a costume in which they looked very much like amateur stone masons were sprinkled about the tents towards one of which mr wardle conducted the party several dozen of how are you's hailed the old gentleman's arrival and a general raising of the straw hats and bending forward of the flannel jackets followed his introduction of his guests as gentlemen from london who were extremely anxious to witness the proceedings of the day with which he had no doubt they would be greatly delighted you had better step into the marquee i think sir said one very stout gentleman whose body and legs looked like half a gigantic roll of flannel elevated on a couple of inflated pillow cases you'll find it much pleasanter sir urged another stout gentleman who strongly resembled the other half of the roll of flannel aforesaid you're very good said mr pickwick this way said the first speaker they notch in here it's the best place in the whole field and the cricketer panting on before preceded them to the tent capital game smart sport fine exercise very were the words which fell upon mr pickwick's ear as he entered the tent and the first object that met his eyes was his green coated friend of the rochester coach holding forth to the no small delight and edification of a select circle of the chosen of all muggleton his dress was slightly improved and he wore boots but there was no mistaking him the stranger recognised his friends immediately and darting forward and seizing mr pickwick by the hand dragged him to a seat with his usual impetuosity talking all the while as if the whole of the arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction this way this way capital fun lots of beer hogsheads rounds of beef bullocks mustard cart loads glorious day down with you make yourself at home glad to see you very mr pickwick sat down as he was bid and mr winkle and mr snodgrass also complied with the directions of their mysterious friend mr wardle looked on in silent wonder mr wardle a friend of mine said mr pickwick friend of yours my dear sir how are you friend of my friend's give me your hand sir and the stranger grasped mr wardle's hand with all the fervour of a close intimacy of many years and then stepped back a pace or two as if to take a full survey of his face and figure and then shook hands with him again if possible more warmly than before well and how came you here said mr pickwick with a smile in which benevolence struggled with surprise come replied the stranger stopping at the crown crown at muggleton met a party flannel jackets white trousers anchovy sandwiches devilled kidneys splendid fellows glorious mr pickwick was sufficiently versed in the stranger's system of stenography to infer from this rapid and disjointed communication that he had somehow or other contracted an acquaintance with the all muggletons which he had converted by a process peculiar to himself into that extent of good fellowship on which a general invitation may be easily founded his curiosity was therefore satisfied and putting on his spectacles he prepared himself to watch the play which was just commencing all muggleton had the first innings and the interest became intense when mr dumkins and mr podder two of the most renowned members of that most distinguished club walked bat in hand to their respective wickets mr luffey the highest ornament of dingley dell was pitched to bowl against the redoubtable dumkins and mr struggles was selected to do the same kind office for the hitherto unconquered podder several players were stationed to look out in different parts of the field and each fixed himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on each knee and stooping very much as if he were making a back for some beginner at leap frog all the regular players do this sort of thing indeed it's generally supposed that it is quite impossible to look out properly in any other position the umpires were stationed behind the wickets the scorers were prepared to notch the runs a breathless silence ensued mr luffey retired a few paces behind the wicket of the passive podder and applied the ball to his right eye for several seconds dumkins confidently awaited its coming with his eyes fixed on the motions of luffey play suddenly cried the bowler the ball flew from his hand straight and swift towards the centre stump of the wicket the wary dumkins was on the alert it fell upon the tip of the bat and bounded far away over the heads of the scouts who had just stooped low enough to let it fly over them run run another now then throw her up up with her stop there another no yes no throw her up throw her up such were the shouts which followed the stroke and at the conclusion of which all muggleton had scored two nor was podder behindhand in earning laurels wherewith to garnish himself and muggleton he blocked the doubtful balls missed the bad ones took the good ones and sent them flying to all parts of the field the scouts were hot and tired the bowlers were changed and bowled till their arms ached but dumkins and podder remained unconquered did an elderly gentleman essay to stop the progress of the ball it rolled between his legs or slipped between his fingers did a slim gentleman try to catch it it struck him on the nose and bounded pleasantly off with redoubled violence while the slim gentleman's eyes filled with water and his form writhed with anguish was it thrown straight up to the wicket dumkins had reached it before the ball in short when dumkins was caught out and podder stumped out all muggleton had notched some fifty four while the score of the dingley dellers was as blank as their faces the advantage was too great to be recovered in vain did the eager luffey and the enthusiastic struggles do all that skill and experience could suggest to regain the ground dingley dell had lost in the contest it was of no avail and in an early period of the winning game dingley dell gave in and allowed the superior prowess of all muggleton the stranger meanwhile had been eating drinking and talking without cessation at every good stroke he expressed his satisfaction and approval of the player in a most condescending and patronising manner which could not fail to have been highly gratifying to the party concerned while at every bad attempt at a catch and every failure to stop the ball he launched his personal displeasure at the head of the devoted individual in such denunciations as ah ah stupid now butter fingers muff humbug and so forth ejaculations which seemed to establish him in the opinion of all around as a most excellent and undeniable judge of the whole art and mystery of the noble game of cricket capital game well played some strokes admirable said the stranger as both sides crowded into the tent at the conclusion of the game you have played it sir inquired mr wardle who had been much amused by his loquacity played it think i have thousands of times not here west indies exciting thing hot work very it must be rather a warm pursuit in such a climate observed mr pickwick warm red hot scorching glowing played a match once single wicket friend the colonel sir thomas blazo who should get the greatest number of runs won the toss first innings seven o'clock am six natives to look out went in kept in heat intense natives all fainted taken away fresh half dozen ordered fainted also blazo bowling supported by two natives couldn't bowl me out fainted too cleared away the colonel wouldn't give in faithful attendant quanko samba last man left sun so hot bat in

name sir inquired an old gentleman blazo no the other gentleman quanko samba yes sir poor quanko never recovered it bowled on on my account bowled off on his own died sir here the stranger buried his countenance in a brown jug but whether to hide his emotion or imbibe its contents we cannot distinctly affirm we only know that he paused suddenly drew a long and deep breath and looked anxiously on as two of the principal members of the dingley dell club approached mr pickwick and said we are about to partake of a plain dinner at the blue lion sir we hope you and your friends will join us of course said mr wardle among our friends we include mr and he looked towards the stranger jingle said that versatile gentleman taking the hint at once jingle alfred jingle esq of no hall nowhere i shall be very happy i am sure said mr pickwick so shall i said mr alfred jingle drawing one arm through mr pickwick's and another through mr wardle's as he whispered confidentially in the ear of the former gentleman devilish good dinner cold but capital peeped into the room this morning fowls and pies and all that sort of thing pleasant fellows these well behaved too very there being no further preliminaries to arrange the company straggled into the town in little knots of twos and threes and within a quarter of an hour were all seated in the great room of the blue lion inn muggleton mr dumkins acting as chairman and mr luffey officiating as vice there was a vast deal of talking and rattling of knives and forks and plates a great running about of three ponderous headed waiters and a rapid disappearance of the substantial viands on the table to each and every of which item of confusion the facetious mr jingle lent the aid of half a dozen ordinary men at least when everybody had eaten as much as possible the cloth was removed bottles glasses and dessert were placed on the table and the waiters withdrew to clear away or in other words to appropriate to their own private use and emolument whatever remnants of the eatables and drinkables they could contrive to lay their hands on amidst the general hum of mirth and conversation that ensued there was a little man with a puffy say nothing to me or i'll contradict you sort of countenance who remained very quiet occasionally looking round him when the conversation slackened as if he contemplated putting in something very weighty and now and then bursting into a short cough of inexpressible grandeur at length during a moment of comparative silence the little man called out in a very loud solemn voice mr luffey everybody was hushed into a profound stillness as the individual addressed replied sir i wish to address a few words to you sir if you will entreat the gentlemen to fill their glasses mr jingle uttering a patronising hear hear which was responded to by the remainder of the company and the glasses having been filled the vice president assumed an air of wisdom in a state of profound attention and said mr staple sir said the little man rising i wish to address what i have to say to you and not to our worthy chairman because our worthy chairman is in some measure i may say in a great degree the subject of what i have to say or i may say to to state suggested mr jingle yes to state said the little man i thank my honourable friend if he will allow me to call him so four hears and one certainly from mr jingle for the suggestion sir i am a deller a dingley deller cheers i cannot lay claim to the honour of forming an item in the population of muggleton nor sir i will frankly admit do i covet that honour and i will tell you why sir hear to muggleton i will readily concede all those honours and distinctions to which it can fairly lay claim they are too numerous and too well known to require aid or recapitulation from me but sir while we remember that muggleton has given birth to a dumkins and a podder let us never forget that dingley dell can boast a luffey and a struggles vociferous cheering let me not be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former gentlemen sir i envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this occasion cheers every gentleman who hears me is probably acquainted with the reply made by an individual who to use an ordinary figure of speech 'hung out' in a tub to the emperor alexander 'if i were not diogenes' said he 'i would be alexander' i can well imagine these gentlemen to say 'if i were not dumkins i would be luffey if i were not podder i would be struggles' enthusiasm but gentlemen of muggleton is it in cricket alone that your fellow townsmen stand pre eminent have you never heard of dumkins and determination have you never been taught to associate podder with property great applause have you never when struggling for your rights your liberties and your privileges been reduced if only for an instant to misgiving and despair and when you have been thus depressed has not the name of dumkins laid afresh within your breast the fire which had just gone out and has not a word from that man lighted it again as brightly as if it had never expired great cheering gentlemen i beg to surround with a rich halo of enthusiastic cheering the united names of 'dumkins and podder' here the little man ceased and here the company commenced a raising of voices and thumping of tables which lasted with little intermission during the remainder of the evening other toasts were drunk mr luffey and mr struggles mr pickwick and mr jingle were each in his turn the subject of unqualified eulogium and each in due course returned thanks for the honour enthusiastic as we are in the noble cause to which we have devoted ourselves we should have felt a sensation of pride which we cannot express and a consciousness of having done something to merit immortality of which we are now deprived could we have laid the faintest outline of these addresses before our ardent readers mr snodgrass as usual took a great mass of notes which would no doubt have afforded most valuable and useful information had not the burning eloquence of the words or the feverish influence of the wine made that gentleman's hand so extremely unsteady as to render his writing nearly unintelligible and his style wholly so by dint of patient investigation we have been enabled to trace some characters bearing a faint resemblance to the names of the speakers and we can also discern an entry of a song supposed to have been sung by mr jingle in which the words bowl sparkling ruby bright and wine are frequently repeated at short intervals we fancy too that we can discern at the very end of the notes some indistinct reference to broiled bones and then the words cold without occur but as any hypothesis we could found upon them must necessarily rest upon mere conjecture we are not disposed to indulge in any of the speculations to which they may give rise we will therefore return to mr tupman merely adding that within some few minutes before twelve o'clock that night the convocation of worthies of dingley dell and muggleton were heard to sing with great feeling and emphasis the beautiful and pathetic national air of we won't go home 'till morning we won't go home 'till morning we won't go home 'till morning 'till daylight doth appear chapter viii illustration strongly illustrative of the position that the course of true love is not a railway the quiet seclusion of dingley dell the presence of so many of the gentler sex and the solicitude and anxiety they evinced in his behalf were all favourable to the growth and development of those softer feelings which nature had implanted deep in the bosom of mr tracy tupman and which now appeared destined to centre in one lovely object the young ladies were pretty their manners winning their dispositions unexceptionable but there was a dignity in the air a touch me not ishness in the walk a majesty in the eye of the spinster aunt to which at their time of life they could lay no claim which distinguished her from any female on whom mr tupman had ever gazed that there was something kindred in their nature something congenial in their souls something mysteriously sympathetic in their bosoms was evident her name was the first that rose to mr tupman's lips as he lay wounded on the grass and her hysteric laughter was the first sound that fell upon his ear when he was supported to the house but had her agitation arisen from an amiable and feminine sensibility which would have been equally irrepressible in any case or had it been called forth by a more ardent and passionate feeling which he of all men living could alone awaken these were the doubts which racked his brain as he lay extended on the sofa these were the doubts which he determined should be at once and for ever resolved it was evening isabella and emily had strolled out with mr trundle the deaf old lady had fallen asleep in her chair the snoring of the fat boy penetrated in a low and monotonous sound from the distant kitchen the buxom servants were lounging at the side door enjoying the pleasantness of the hour and the delights of a flirtation on first principles with certain unwieldy animals attached to the farm and there sat the interesting pair uncared for by all caring for none and dreaming only of themselves there they sat in short like a pair of carefully folded kid gloves bound up in each other i have forgotten my flowers said the spinster aunt water them now said mr tupman in accents of persuasion you will take cold in the evening air urged the spinster aunt affectionately no no said mr tupman rising it will do me good let me accompany you the lady paused to adjust the sling in which the left arm of the youth was placed and taking his right arm led him to the garden there was a bower at the further end with honeysuckle jessamine and creeping plants one of those sweet retreats which humane men erect for the accommodation of spiders the spinster aunt took up a large watering pot which lay in one corner and was about to leave the arbour mr tupman detained her and drew her to a seat beside him miss wardle said he the spinster aunt trembled till some pebbles which had accidentally found their way into the large watering pot shook like an infant's rattle miss wardle said mr tupman you are an angel mr tupman exclaimed rachael blushing as red as the watering pot itself nay said the eloquent pickwickian i know it but too well all women are angels they say murmured the lady playfully then what can you be or to what without presumption can i compare you replied mr tupman where was the woman ever seen who resembled you where else could i hope to find so rare a combination of excellence and beauty where else could i seek to oh here mr tupman paused and pressed the hand which clasped the handle of the happy watering pot the lady turned aside her head men are such deceivers she softly whispered they are they are ejaculated mr tupman but not all men there lives at least one being who can never change one being who would be content to devote his whole existence to your happiness who lives but in your eyes who breathes but in your smiles who bears the heavy burden of life itself only for you could such an individual be found said the lady but he can be found said the ardent mr tupman interposing he is found he is here miss wardle and ere the lady was aware of his intention mr tupman had sunk upon his knees at her feet mr tupman rise said rachael never was the valorous reply oh rachael he seized her passive hand and the watering pot fell to the ground as he pressed it to his lips oh rachael say you love me mr tupman said the spinster aunt with averted head i can hardly speak the words but but you are not wholly indifferent to me mr tupman no sooner heard this avowal than he proceeded to do what his enthusiastic emotions prompted and what for aught we know for we are but little acquainted with such matters people so circumstanced always do he jumped up and throwing his arm round the neck of the spinster aunt imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses which after a due show of struggling and resistance she received so passively that there is no telling how many more mr tupman might have bestowed if the lady had not given a very unaffected start and exclaimed in an affrighted tone mr tupman we are observed we are discovered mr tupman looked round there was the fat boy perfectly motionless with his large circular eyes staring into the arbour but without the slightest expression on his face that the most expert physiognomist could have referred to astonishment curiosity or any other known passion that agitates the human breast mr tupman gazed on the fat boy and the fat boy stared at him and the longer mr tupman observed the utter vacancy of the fat boy's countenance the more convinced he became that he either did not know or did not understand anything that had been going forward under this impression he said with great firmness what do you want here sir supper's ready sir was the prompt reply have you just come here sir inquired mr tupman with a piercing look just replied the fat boy mr tupman looked at him very hard again but there was not a wink in his eye or a curve in his face mr tupman took the arm of the spinster aunt and walked towards the house the fat boy followed behind he knows nothing of what has happened he whispered nothing said the spinster aunt there was a sound behind them as of an imperfectly suppressed chuckle mr tupman turned sharply round no it could not have been the fat boy there was not a gleam of mirth or anything but feeding in his whole visage he must have been fast asleep whispered mr tupman i have not the least doubt of it replied the spinster aunt they both laughed heartily mr tupman was wrong the fat boy for once had not been fast asleep he was awake wide awake to what had been going forward the supper passed off without any attempt at a general conversation the old lady had gone to bed isabella wardle devoted herself exclusively to mr trundle the spinster's attentions were reserved for mr tupman and emily's thoughts appeared to be engrossed by some distant object possibly they were with the absent snodgrass illustration he must have been fast asleep whispered mr tupman eleven twelve one o'clock had struck and the gentlemen had not arrived consternation sat on every face could they have been waylaid and robbed should they send men and lanterns in every direction by which they could be supposed likely to have travelled home or should they hark there they were what could have made them so late a strange voice too to whom could it belong they rushed into the kitchen whither the truants had repaired and at once obtained rather more than a glimmering of the real state of the case mr pickwick with his hands in his pockets and his hat cocked completely over his left eye was leaning against the dresser shaking his head from side to side and producing a constant succession of the blandest and most benevolent smiles without being moved thereunto by any discernible cause or pretence whatsoever old mr wardle with a highly inflamed countenance was grasping the hand of a strange gentleman muttering protestations of eternal friendship mr winkle supporting himself by the eight day clock was feebly invoking destruction upon the head of any member of the family who should suggest the propriety of his retiring for the night and mr snodgrass had sunk into a chair with an expression of the most abject and hopeless misery that the human mind can imagine portrayed in every lineament of his expressive face is anything the matter inquired the three ladies nothing the matter replied mr pickwick we we're all right i say wardle we're all right an't we i should think so replied the jolly host my dears here's my friend mr jingle mr pickwick's friend mr jingle come 'pon little visit is anything the matter with mr snodgrass sir inquired emily with great anxiety nothing the matter ma'am replied the stranger cricket dinner glorious party capital songs old port claret good very good wine ma'am wine it wasn't the wine murmured mr snodgrass in a broken voice it was the salmon somehow or other it never is the wine in these cases hadn't they better go to bed ma'am inquired emma two of the boys will carry the gentlemen up stairs i won't go to bed said mr winkle firmly no living boy shall carry me said mr pickwick stoutly and he went on smiling as before hurrah gasped mr winkle faintly hurrah echoed mr pickwick taking off his hat and dashing it on the floor and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen at this humorous feat he laughed outright let's have 'nother bottle cried mr winkle commencing in a very loud key and ending in a very faint one his head dropped upon his breast and muttering his invincible determination not to go to his bed and a sanguinary regret that he had not done for old tupman in the morning he fell fast asleep in which condition he was borne to his apartment by two young giants under the personal superintendence of the fat boy to whose protecting care mr snodgrass shortly afterwards confided his own person mr pickwick accepted the proffered arm of mr tupman and quietly disappeared smiling more than ever and mr wardle after taking as affectionate a leave of the whole family as if he were ordered for immediate execution consigned to mr trundle the honour of conveying him up stairs and retired with a very futile attempt to look impressively solemn and dignified what a shocking scene said the spinster aunt dis gusting ejaculated both the young ladies dreadful dreadful said jingle looking very grave he was about a bottle and a half ahead of any of his companions horrid spectacle very what a nice man whispered the spinster aunt to mr tupman good looking too whispered emily wardle oh decidedly observed the spinster aunt mr tupman thought of the widow at rochester and his mind was troubled the succeeding half hour's conversation was not of a nature to calm his perturbed spirit the new visitor was very talkative and the number of his anecdotes was only to be exceeded by the extent of his politeness mr tupman felt that as jingle's popularity increased he tupman retired further into the shade his laughter was forced his merriment feigned and when at last he laid his aching temples between the sheets he thought with horrid delight on the satisfaction it would afford him to have jingle's head at that moment between the feather bed and the mattress the indefatigable stranger rose betimes next morning and although his companions remained in bed overpowered with the dissipation of the previous night exerted himself most successfully to promote the hilarity of the breakfast table so successful were his efforts that even the deaf old lady insisted on having one or two of his best jokes retailed through the trumpet and even she condescended to observe to the spinster aunt that he meaning jingle was an impudent young fellow a sentiment in which all her relations then and there present thoroughly coincided it was the old lady's habit on the fine summer mornings to repair to the arbour in which mr tupman had already signalised himself in form and manner following first the fat boy fetched from a peg behind the old lady's bed room door a close black satin bonnet a warm cotton shawl and a thick stick with a capacious handle and the old lady having put on the bonnet and shawl at her leisure would lean one hand on the stick and the other on the fat boy's shoulder and walk leisurely to the arbour where the fat boy would leave her to enjoy the fresh air for the space of half an hour at the expiration of which time he would return and reconduct her to the house the old lady was very precise and very particular and as this ceremony had been observed for three successive summers without the slightest deviation from the accustomed form she was not a little surprised on this particular morning to see the fat boy instead of leaving the arbour walk a few paces out of it look carefully round him in every direction and return towards her with great stealth and an air of the most profound mystery the old lady was timorous most old ladies are and her first impression was that the bloated lad was about to do her some grievous bodily harm with the view of possessing himself of her loose coin she would have cried for assistance but age and infirmity had long ago deprived her of the power of screaming she therefore watched his motions with feelings of intense terror which were in no degree diminished by his coming close up to her and shouting in her ear in an agitated and as it seemed to her a threatening tone missus now it so happened that mr jingle was walking in the garden close to the arbour at this moment he too heard the shout of missus and stopped to hear more there were three reasons for his doing so in the first place he was idle and curious secondly he was by no means scrupulous thirdly and lastly he was concealed from view by some flowering shrubs so there he stood and there he listened missus shouted the fat boy well joe said the trembling old lady i'm sure i have been a good mistress to you joe you have invariably been treated very kindly you have never had too much to do and you have always had enough to eat this last was an appeal to the fat boy's most sensitive feelings he seemed touched as he replied emphatically i knows i has then what can you want to do now said the old lady gaining courage i wants to make your flesh creep replied the boy this sounded like a very bloodthirsty mode of showing one's gratitude and as the old lady did not precisely understand the process by which such a result was to be attained all her former horrors returned what do you think i see in this very arbour last night inquired the boy bless us what exclaimed the old lady alarmed at the solemn manner of the corpulent youth the strange gentleman him as had his arm hurt a kissin' and huggin' who joe none of the servants i hope worser than that roared the fat boy in the old lady's ear not one of my grand da'aters worser than that worse than that joe said the old lady who had thought this the extreme limit of human atrocity who was it joe i insist upon knowing the fat boy looked cautiously round and having concluded his survey shouted in the old lady's ear miss rachael what said the old lady in a shrill tone speak louder miss rachael roared the fat boy my da'ater the train of nods which the fat boy gave by way of assent communicated a blanc mange like motion to his fat cheeks and she suffered him exclaimed the old lady a grin stole over the fat boy's features as he said i see her a kissin' of him agin if mr jingle from his place of concealment could have beheld the expression which the old lady's face assumed at this communication the probability is that a sudden burst of laughter would have betrayed his close vicinity to the summer house he listened attentively fragments of angry sentences such as without my permission at her time of life miserable old 'ooman like me might have waited till i was dead and so forth reached his ears and then he heard the heels of the fat boy's boots crunching the gravel as he retired and left the old lady alone it was a remarkable coincidence perhaps but it was nevertheless a fact that mr jingle within five minutes after his arrival at manor farm on the preceding night had inwardly resolved to lay siege to the heart of the spinster aunt without delay he had observation enough to see that his off hand manner was by no means disagreeable to the fair object of his attack and he had more than a strong suspicion that she possessed that most desirable of all requisites a small independence the imperative necessity of ousting his rival by some means or other flashed quickly upon him and he immediately resolved to adopt certain proceedings tending to that end and object without a moment's delay fielding tells us that man is fire and woman tow and the prince of darkness sets a light to 'em mr jingle knew that young men to spinster aunts are as lighted gas to gunpowder and he determined to essay the effect of an explosion without loss of time full of reflections upon this important decision he crept from his place of concealment and under cover of the shrubs before mentioned approached the house fortune seemed determined to favour his design mr tupman and the rest of the gentlemen left the garden by the side gate just as he obtained a view of it and the young ladies he knew had walked out alone soon after breakfast the coast was clear the breakfast parlour door was partially open he peeped in the spinster aunt was knitting he coughed she looked up and smiled hesitation formed no part of mr alfred jingle's character he laid his finger on his lips mysteriously walked in and closed the door miss wardle said mr jingle with affected earnestness forgive intrusion short acquaintance no time for ceremony all discovered sir said the spinster aunt rather astonished by the unexpected apparition and somewhat doubtful of mr jingle's sanity hush said mr jingle in a stage whisper large boy dumpling face round eyes rascal here he shook his head expressively and the spinster aunt trembled with agitation i presume you allude to joseph sir said the lady making an effort to appear composed yes ma'am damn that joe treacherous dog joe told the old lady old lady furious wild raving arbour tupman kissing and hugging all that sort of thing eh ma'am eh mr jingle said the spinster aunt if you come here sir to insult me not at all by no means replied the unabashed mr jingle overheard the tale came to warn you of your danger tender my services prevent the hubbub never mind think it an insult leave the room and he turned as if to carry the threat into execution what shall i do said the poor spinster bursting into tears my brother will be furious of course he will said mr jingle pausing outrageous oh mr jingle what can i say exclaimed the spinster aunt in another flood of despair say he dreamt it replied mr jingle coolly a ray of comfort darted across the mind of the spinster aunt at this suggestion mr jingle perceived it and followed up his advantage pooh pooh nothing more easy blackguard boy lovely woman fat boy horsewhipped you believed end of the matter all comfortable whether the probability of escaping from the consequences of this ill timed discovery was delightful to the spinster's feelings or whether the hearing herself described as a lovely woman softened the asperity of her grief we know not she blushed slightly and cast a grateful look on mr jingle that insinuating gentleman sighed deeply fixed his eyes on the spinster aunt's face for a couple of minutes started melodramatically and suddenly withdrew them you seem unhappy mr jingle said the lady in a plaintive voice may i show my gratitude for your kind interference by inquiring into the cause with a view if possible to its removal ha exclaimed mr jingle with another start removal remove my unhappiness and your love bestowed upon a man who is insensible to the blessing who even now contemplates a design upon the affections of the niece of the creature who but no he is my friend i will not expose his vices miss wardle farewell at the conclusion of this address the most consecutive he was ever known to utter mr jingle applied to his eyes the remnant of a handkerchief before noticed and turned towards the door stay mr jingle said the spinster aunt emphatically you have made an allusion to mr tupman explain it never exclaimed jingle with a professional ie theatrical air never and by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned further he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat down mr jingle said the aunt i entreat i implore you if there is any dreadful mystery connected with mr tupman reveal it can i said mr jingle fixing his eyes on the aunt's face can i see lovely creature sacrificed at the shrine heartless avarice he appeared to be struggling with various conflicting emotions for a few seconds and then said in a low deep voice tupman only wants your money the wretch exclaimed the spinster with energetic indignation mr jingle's doubts were resolved she had money more than that said jingle loves another another ejaculated the spinster who short girl black eyes niece emily there was a pause now if there were one individual in the whole world of whom the spinster aunt entertained a mortal and deeply rooted jealousy it was this identical niece the colour rushed over her face and neck and she tossed her head in silence with an air of ineffable contempt at last biting her thin lips and bridling up she said it can't be i won't believe it watch 'em said jingle i will said the aunt watch his looks i will his whispers i will he'll sit next her at table let him he'll flatter her let him he'll pay her every possible attention let him and he'll cut you cut me screamed the spinster aunt he cut me will he and she trembled with rage and disappointment you will convince yourself said jingle i will you'll show your spirit i will you'll not have him afterwards never you'll take somebody else yes you shall mr jingle fell on his knees remained thereupon for five minutes thereafter and rose the accepted lover of the spinster aunt conditionally upon mr tupman's perjury being made clear and manifest the burden of proof lay with mr alfred jingle and he produced his evidence that very day at dinner the spinster aunt could hardly believe her eyes mr tracy tupman was established at emily's side ogling whispering and smiling in opposition to mr snodgrass not a word not a look not a glance did he bestow upon his heart's pride of the evening before damn that boy thought old mr wardle to himself he had heard the story from his mother damn that boy he must have been asleep it's all imagination traitor thought the spinster aunt dear mr jingle was not deceiving me ugh how i hate the wretch the following conversation may serve to explain to our readers this apparently unaccountable alteration of deportment on the part of mr tracy tupman the time was evening the scene the garden there were two figures walking in the side path one was rather short and stout the other rather tall and slim they were mr tupman and mr jingle the stout figure commenced the dialogue how did i do it he inquired splendid capital couldn't act better myself you must repeat the part to morrow every evening till further notice does rachael still wish it of course she don't like it but must be done avert suspicion afraid of her brother says there's no help for it only a few days more when old folks blinded crown your happiness any message love best love kindest regards unalterable affection can i say anything for you my dear fellow replied the unsuspicious mr tupman fervently grasping his friend's hand carry my best love say how hard i find it to dissemble say anything that's kind but add how sensible i am of the necessity of the suggestion she made to me through you this morning say i applaud her wisdom and admire her discretion i will anything more nothing only add how ardently i long for the time when i may call her mine and all dissimulation may be unnecessary certainly certainly anything more oh my friend said poor mr tupman again grasping the hand of his companion receive my warmest thanks for your disinterested kindness and forgive me if i have ever even in thought done you the injustice of supposing that you could stand in my way my dear friend can i ever repay you don't talk of it replied mr jingle he stopped short as if suddenly recollecting something and said by the bye can't spare ten pounds can you very particular purpose pay you in three days i dare say i can replied mr tupman in the fulness of his heart three days you say only three days all over then no more difficulties mr tupman counted the money into his companion's hand and he dropped it piece by piece into his pocket as they walked towards the house be careful said mr jingle not a look not a wink said mr tupman not a syllable not a whisper all your attentions to the niece rather rude than otherwise to the aunt only way of deceiving the old ones i'll take care said mr tupman aloud and i'll take care said mr jingle internally and they entered the house the scene of that afternoon was repeated that evening and on the three afternoons and evenings next ensuing on the fourth the host was in high spirits for he had satisfied himself that there was no ground for the charge against mr tupman so was mr tupman for mr jingle had told him that his affair would soon be brought to a crisis so was mr pickwick for he was seldom otherwise so was not mr snodgrass for he had grown jealous of mr tupman so was the old lady for she had been winning at whist so were mr jingle and miss wardle for reasons of sufficient importance in this eventful history to be narrated in another chapter chapter ix illustration a discovery and a chase the supper was ready laid the chairs were drawn round the table bottles jugs and glasses were arranged upon the sideboard and everything betokened the approach of the most convivial period in the whole four and twenty hours where's rachael said mr wardle ay and jingle added mr pickwick dear me said the host i wonder i haven't missed him before why i don't think i have heard his voice for two hours at least emily my dear ring the bell the bell was rung and the fat boy appeared where's miss rachael he couldn't say where's mr jingle then he didn't know everybody looked surprised it was late past eleven o'clock mr tupman laughed in his sleeve they were loitering somewhere talking about him ha ha capital notion that funny never mind said wardle after a short pause they'll turn up presently i dare say i never wait supper for anybody excellent rule that said mr pickwick admirable pray sit down said the host certainly said mr pickwick and down they sat there was a gigantic round of cold beef on the table and mr pickwick was supplied with a plentiful portion of it he had raised his fork to his lips and was on the very point of opening his mouth for the reception of a piece of beef when the hum of many voices suddenly arose in the kitchen he paused and laid down his fork mr wardle paused too and insensibly released his hold of the carving knife which remained inserted in the beef he looked at mr pickwick mr pickwick looked at him heavy footsteps were heard in the passage the parlour door was suddenly burst open and the man who had cleaned mr pickwick's boots on his first arrival rushed into the room followed by the fat boy and all the domestics what the devil's the meaning of all this exclaimed the host the kitchen chimney a'n't a fire is it emma inquired the old lady lor grandma no screamed both the young ladies what's the matter roared the master of the house the man gasped for breath and faintly ejaculated they ha' gone mas'r gone right clean off sir at this juncture mr tupman was observed to lay down his knife and fork and to turn very pale illustration here i am but i han't a willin who's gone said mr wardle fiercely mus'r jingle and miss rachael in a po' chay from blue lion muggleton i was there but i couldn't stop 'em so i run off to tell'ee i paid his expenses said mr tupman jumping up frantically he's got ten pounds of mine stop him he's swindled me i won't bear it i'll have justice pickwick i won't stand it and with sundry incoherent exclamations of the like nature the unhappy gentleman spun round and round the apartment in a transport of frenzy lord preserve us ejaculated mr pickwick eyeing the extraordinary gestures of his friend with terrified surprise he's gone mad what shall we do do said the stout old host who regarded only the last words of the sentence put the horse in the gig i'll get a chaise at the lion and follow 'em instantly where he exclaimed as the man ran out to execute the commission where's that villain joe here i am but i han't a willin replied a voice it was the fat boy's let me get at him pickwick cried wardle as he rushed at the ill starred youth he was bribed by that scoundrel jingle to put me on a wrong scent by telling a cock and a bull story of my sister and your friend tupman here mr tupman sunk into a chair let me get at him don't let him screamed all the women above whose exclamations the blubbering of the fat boy was distinctly audible i won't be held cried the old man mr winkle take your hands off mr pickwick let me go sir it was a beautiful sight in that moment of turmoil and confusion to behold the placid and philosophical expression of mr pickwick's face albeit somewhat flushed with exertion as he stood with his arms firmly clasped round the extensive waist of their corpulent host thus restraining the impetuosity of his passion while the fat boy was scratched and pulled and pushed from the room by all the females congregated therein he had no sooner released his hold than the man entered to announce that the gig was ready don't let him go alone screamed the females he'll kill somebody i'll go with him said mr pickwick you're a good fellow pickwick said the host grasping his hand emma give mr pickwick a shawl to tie round his neck make haste look after your grandmother girls she has fainted away now then are you ready mr pickwick's mouth and chin having been hastily enveloped in a large shawl his hat having been put on his head and his great coat thrown over his arm he replied in the affirmative they jumped into the gig give her her head tom cried the host and away they went down the narrow lanes jolting in and out of the cart ruts and bumping up against the hedges on either side as if they would go to pieces every moment how much are they ahead shouted wardle as they drove up to the door of the blue lion round which a little crowd had collected late as it was not above three quarters of an hour was everybody's reply chaise and four directly out with 'em put up the gig afterwards now boys cried the landlord chaise and four out make haste look alive there away ran the hostlers and the boys the lanterns glimmered as the men ran to and fro the horses' hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach house and all was noise and bustle now then is that chaise coming out to night cried wardle coming down the yard now sir replied the hostler out came the chaise in went the horses on sprung the boys in got the travellers mind the seven mile stage in less than half an hour shouted wardle off with you the boys applied whip and spur the waiter shouted the hostlers cheered and away they went fast and furious pretty situation thought mr pickwick when he had had a moment's time for reflection pretty situation for the general chairman of the pickwick club damp chaise strange horses fifteen miles an hour and twelve o'clock at night for the first three or four miles not a word was spoken by either of the gentlemen each being too much immersed in his own reflections to address any observations to his companion when they had gone over that much ground however and the horses getting thoroughly warmed began to do their work in really good style mr pickwick became too much exhilarated with the rapidity of the motion to remain any longer perfectly mute we're sure to catch them i think said he hope so replied his companion fine night said mr pickwick looking up at the moon which was shining brightly so much the worse returned wardle for they'll have had all the advantage of the moonlight to get the start of us and we shall lose it it will have gone down in another hour it will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark won't it inquired mr pickwick i daresay it will replied his friend drily mr pickwick's temporary excitement began to sober down a little as he reflected upon the inconveniences and dangers of the expedition in which he had so thoughtlessly embarked he was roused by a loud shouting of the post boy on the leader yo yo yo yo yoe went the first boy yo yo yo yoe went the second yo yo yo yoe chimed in old wardle himself most lustily with his head and half his body out of the coach window yo yo yo yoe shouted mr pickwick taking up the burden of the cry though he had not the slightest notion of its meaning or object and amidst the yo yoing of the whole four the chaise stopped what's the matter inquired mr pickwick there's a gate here replied old wardle we shall hear something of the fugitives after a lapse of five minutes consumed in incessant knocking and shouting an old man in his shirt and trousers emerged from the turnpike house and opened the gate how long is it since a post chaise went through here inquired mr wardle how long ah why i don't rightly know it worn't a long time ago nor it worn't a short time ago just between the two perhaps has any chaise been by at all oh yes there's been a shay by how long ago my friend interposed mr pickwick an hour ah i daresay it might be replied the man or two hours inquired the post boy on the wheeler well i shouldn't wonder if it was returned the old man doubtfully drive on boys cried the testy old gentleman don't waste any more time with that old idiot idiot exclaimed the old man with a grin as he stood in the middle of the road with the gate half closed watching the chaise which rapidly diminished in the increasing distance no not much o' that either you've lost ten minutes here and gone away as wise as you came arter all if every man on the line as has a guinea give him earns it half as well you won't catch t'other shay this side mich'lmas old short and fat and with another prolonged grin the old man closed the gate re entered his house and bolted the door after him meanwhile the chaise proceeded without any slackening of pace towards the conclusion of the stage the moon as wardle had foretold was rapidly on the wane large tiers of dark heavy clouds which had been gradually overspreading the sky for some time past now formed one black mass over head and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then against the windows of the chaise seemed to warn the travellers of the rapid approach of a stormy night the wind too which was directly against them swept in furious gusts down the narrow road and howled dismally through the trees which skirted the pathway mr pickwick drew his coat closer about him coiled himself more snugly up into the corner of the chaise and fell into a sound sleep from which he was only awakened by the stopping of the vehicle the sound of the hostler's bell and a loud cry of horses on directly but here another delay occurred the boys were sleeping with such mysterious soundness that it took five minutes apiece to wake them the hostler had somehow or other mislaid the key of the stable and even when that was found two sleepy helpers put the wrong harness on the wrong horses and the whole process of harnessing had to be gone through afresh had mr pickwick been alone these multiplied obstacles would have completely put an end to the pursuit at once but old wardle was not to be so easily daunted and he laid about him with such hearty good will cuffing this man and pushing that strapping a buckle here and taking in a link there that the chaise was ready in a much shorter time than could reasonably have been expected under so many difficulties they resumed their journey and certainly the prospect before them was by no means encouraging the stage was fifteen miles long the night was dark the wind high and the rain pouring in torrents it was impossible to make any great way against such obstacles united it was hard upon one o'clock already and nearly two hours were consumed in getting to the end of the stage here however an object presented itself which rekindled their hopes and reanimated their drooping spirits when did this chaise come in cried old wardle leaping out of his own vehicle and pointing to one covered with wet mud which was standing in the yard not a quarter of an hour ago sir replied the hostler to whom the question was addressed lady and gentleman inquired wardle almost breathless with impatience yes sir tall gentleman dress coat long legs thin body yes sir elderly lady thin face rather skinny eh yes sir by heavens it's the couple pickwick exclaimed the old gentleman would have been here before said the hostler but they broke a trace it is said wardle it is by jove chaise and four instantly we shall catch them yet before they reach the next stage a guinea a piece boys be alive there bustle about there's good fellows and with such admonitions as these the old gentleman ran up and down the yard and bustled to and fro in a state of excitement which communicated itself to mr pickwick also and under the influence of which that gentleman got himself into complicated entanglements with harness and mixed up with horses and wheels of chaises in the most surprising manner firmly believing that by so doing he was materially forwarding the preparations for their resuming their journey jump in jump in cried old wardle climbing into the chaise pulling up the steps and slamming the door after him come along make haste and before mr pickwick knew precisely what he was about he felt himself forced in at the other door by one pull from the old gentleman and one push from the hostler and off they were again ah we are moving now said the old gentleman exultingly they were indeed as was sufficiently testified to mr pickwick by his constant collisions either with the hard woodwork of the chaise or the body of his companion hold up said the stout old mr wardle as mr pickwick dived head foremost into his capacious waistcoat i never did feel such a jolting in my life said mr pickwick never mind replied his companion it will soon be over steady steady mr pickwick planted himself into his own corner as firmly as he could and on whirled the chaise faster than ever they had travelled in this way about three miles when mr wardle who had been looking out of the window for two or three minutes suddenly drew in his face covered with splashes and exclaimed in breathless eagerness here they are mr pickwick thrust his head out of his window yes there was a chaise and four a short distance before them dashing along at full gallop go on go on almost shrieked the old gentleman two guineas a piece boys don't let 'em gain on us keep it up keep it up the horses in the first chaise started on at their utmost speed and those in mr wardle's galloped furiously behind them i see his head exclaimed the choleric old man damme i see his head so do i said mr pickwick that's he mr pickwick was not mistaken the countenance of mr jingle completely coated with the mud thrown up by the wheels was plainly discernible at the window of his chaise and the motion of his arm which he was waving violently towards the postilions denoted that he was encouraging them to increased exertion the interest was intense fields trees and hedges seemed to rush past them with the velocity of a whirlwind so rapid was the pace at which they tore along they were close by the side of the first chaise jingle's voice could be plainly heard even above the din of the wheels urging on the boys old mr wardle foamed with rage and excitement he roared out scoundrels and villains by the dozen clenched his fist and shook it expressively at the object of his indignation but mr jingle only answered with a contemptuous smile and replied to his menaces by a shout of triumph as his horses answering the increased application of whip and spur broke into a faster gallop and left the pursuers behind mr pickwick had just drawn in his head and mr wardle exhausted with shouting had done the same when a tremendous jolt threw them forward against the front of the vehicle there was a sudden bump a loud crash away rolled a wheel and over went the chaise after a few seconds of bewilderment and confusion in which nothing but the plunging of horses and breaking of glass could be made out mr pickwick felt himself violently pulled out from among the ruins of the chaise and as soon as he had gained his feet extricated his head from the skirts of his great coat which materially impeded the usefulness of his spectacles the full disaster of the case met his view old mr wardle without a hat and his clothes torn in several places stood by his side and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at their feet the post boys who had succeeded in cutting the traces were standing disfigured with mud and disordered by hard riding by the horses' heads about a hundred yards in advance was the other chaise which had pulled up on hearing the crash the postilions each with a broad grin convulsing his countenance were viewing the adverse party from their saddles and mr jingle was contemplating the wreck from the coach window with evident satisfaction the day was just breaking and the whole scene was rendered perfectly visible by the grey light of the morning hallo shouted the shameless jingle anybody damaged elderly gentlemen no light weights dangerous work very illustration love to tuppy won't you get up behind drive on boys replied jingle you're a rascal roared wardle ha ha replied jingle and then he added with a knowing wink and a jerk of the thumb towards the interior of the chaise i say she's very well desires her compliments begs you won't trouble yourself love to tuppy won't you get up behind drive on boys the postilions resumed their proper attitudes and away rattled the chaise mr jingle fluttering in derision a white handkerchief from the coach window nothing in the whole adventure not even the upset had disturbed the calm and equable current of mr pickwick's temper the villainy however which could first borrow money of his faithful follower and then abbreviate his name to tuppy was more than he could patiently bear he drew his breath hard and coloured up to the very tips of his spectacles as he said slowly and emphatically if ever i meet that man again i'll yes yes interrupted wardle that's all very well but while we stand talking here they'll get their licence and be married in london mr pickwick paused bottled up his vengeance and corked it down how far is it to the next stage inquired mr wardle of one of the boys six mile an't it tom rayther better rayther better nor six mile sir can't be helped said wardle we must walk it pickwick no help for it replied that truly great man so sending forward one of the boys on horseback to procure a fresh chaise and horses and leaving the other behind to take care of the broken one mr pickwick and mr wardle set manfully forward on the walk first tying their shawls round their necks and slouching down their hats to escape as much as possible from the deluge of rain which after a slight cessation had again begun to pour heavily down chapter x illustration clearing up all doubts if any existed of the disinterestedness of mr jingle's character there are in london several old inns once the headquarters of celebrated coaches in the days when coaches performed their journeys in a graver and more solemn manner than they do in these times but which have now degenerated into little more than the abiding and booking places of country waggons the reader would look in vain for any of these ancient hostelries among the golden crosses and bull and mouths which rear their stately fronts in the improved streets of london if he would light upon any of these old places he must direct his steps to the obscurer quarters of the town and there in some secluded nooks he will find several still standing with a kind of gloomy sturdiness amidst the modern innovations which surround them in the borough especially there still remain some half dozen old inns which have preserved their external features unchanged and which have escaped alike the rage for public improvement and the encroachments of private speculation great rambling queer old places they are with galleries and passages and staircases wide enough and antiquated enough to furnish materials for a hundred ghost stories supposing we should ever be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any and that the world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable veracious legends connected with old london bridge and its adjacent neighbourhood on the surrey side it was in the yard of one of these inns of no less celebrated a one than the white hart that a man was busily employed in brushing the dirt off a pair of boots early on the morning succeeding the events narrated in the last chapter he was habited in a coarse striped waistcoat with black calico sleeves and blue glass buttons drab breeches and leggings a bright red handkerchief was wound in a very loose and unstudied style round his neck and an old white hat was carelessly thrown on one side of his head there were two rows of boots before him one cleaned and the other dirty and at every addition he made to the clean row he paused from his work and contemplated its results with evident satisfaction the yard presented none of that bustle and activity which are the usual characteristics of a large coach inn three or four lumbering waggons each with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy about the height of the second floor window of an ordinary house were stowed away beneath a lofty roof which extended over one end of the yard and another which was probably to commence its journey that morning was drawn out into the open space a double tier of bed room galleries with old clumsy balustrades ran round two sides of the straggling area and a double row of bells to correspond sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof hung over the door leading to the bar and coffee room two or three gigs and chaise carts were wheeled up under different little sheds and pent houses and the occasional heavy tread of a cart horse or rattling of a chain at the further end of the yard announced to anybody who cared about the matter that the stable lay in that direction when we add that a few boys in smock frocks were lying asleep on heavy packages woolpacks and other articles that were scattered about on heaps of straw we have described as fully as need be the general appearance of the yard of the white hart inn high street borough on the particular morning in question a loud ringing of one of the bells was followed by the appearance of a smart chambermaid in the upper sleeping gallery who after tapping at one of the doors and receiving a request from within called over the balustrades sam hallo replied the man with the white hat number twenty two wants his boots ask number twenty two vether he'll have 'em now or wait till he gets 'em was the reply come don't be a fool sam said the girl coaxingly the gentleman wants his boots directly well you are a nice young 'ooman for a musical party you are said the boot cleaner look at these here boots eleven pair o' boots and one shoe as b'longs to number six with the wooden leg the eleven boots is to be called at half past eight and the shoe at nine who's number twenty two that's to put all the others out no no reg'lar rotation as jack ketch said ven he tied the men up sorry to keep you a waitin' sir but i'll attend to you directly saying which the man in the white hat set to work upon a top boot with increased assiduity there was another loud ring and the bustling old landlady of the white hart made her appearance in the opposite gallery sam cried the landlady where's that lazy idle why sam oh there you are why don't you answer wouldn't be gen teel to answer 'till you'd done talking replied sam gruffly here clean them shoes for number seventeen directly and take 'em to private sitting room number five first floor the landlady flung a pair of lady's shoes into the yard and bustled away number five said sam as he picked up the shoes and taking a piece of chalk from his pocket made a memorandum of their destination on the soles lady's shoes and private sittin' room i suppose she didn't come in the vaggin she came in early this morning cried the girl who was still leaning over the railing of the gallery with a gentleman in a hackney coach and it's him as wants his boots and you'd better do 'em that's all about it vy didn't you say so before said sam with great indignation singling out the boots in question from the heap before him for all i know'd he vas one o' the regular threepennies private room and a lady too if he's anything of a gen'lm'n he's vorth a shillin' a day let alone the arrands stimulated by this inspiring reflection mr samuel brushed away with such hearty good will that in a few minutes the boots and shoes with a polish which would have struck envy to the soul of the amiable mr warren for they used day and martin at the white hart had arrived at the door of number five come in said a man's voice in reply to sam's rap at the door sam made his best bow and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast having officiously deposited the gentleman's boots right and left at his feet and the lady's shoes right and left at hers he backed towards the door boots said the gentleman sir said sam closing the door and keeping his hand on the knob of the lock do you know what's a name doctors' commons yes sir where is it paul's churchyard sir low archway on the carriage side bookseller's at one corner hot el on the other and two porters in the middle as touts for licences touts for licences said the gentleman touts for licences replied sam two coves in vhite aprons touches their hats ven you walk in 'licence sir licence' queer sort them and their mas'rs too sir old bailey proctors and no mistake what do they do inquired the gentleman do you sir that an't the wost on it neither they puts things into old gen'lm'n's heads as they never dreamed of my father sir vos a coachman a widower he vos and fat enough for anything uncommon fat to be sure his missis dies and leaves him four hundred pound down he goes to the commons to see the lawyer and draw the blunt very smart top boots on nosegay in his button hole broad brimmed tile green shawl quite the gen'lm'n goes through the archvay thinking how he should inwest the money up comes the touter touches his hat 'licence sir licence' 'what's that' says my father 'licence sir' says he 'what licence' says my father 'marriage licence' says the touter 'dash my veskit' says my father 'i never thought o' that' 'i think you wants one sir' says the touter my father pulls up and thinks a bit 'no' says he 'damme i'm too old b'sides i'm a many sizes too large' says he 'not a bit on it sir' says the touter 'think

this vay' and sure enough my father walks arter him like a tame monkey behind a horgan into a little back office vere a feller sat among dirty papers and tin boxes making believe he was busy 'pray take a seat vile i makes out the affidavit sir' says the lawyer 'thankee sir' says my father and down he sat and stared with all his eyes and his mouth vide open at the names on the boxes 'what's your name sir' says the lawyer 'tony weller' says my father 'parish' says the lawyer 'belle savage' says my father for he stopped there wen he drove up and he know'd nothing about parishes he didn't 'and what's the lady's name' says the lawyer my father was struck all of a heap 'blessed if i know' says he 'not know' says the lawyer 'no more nor you do' says my father 'can't i put that in arterwards' 'impossible' says the lawyer 'wery well' says my father after he'd thought a moment 'put down mrs clarke' 'what clarke' says the lawyer dipping his pen in the ink 'susan clarke markis o' granby dorking' says my father 'she'll have me if i ask i des say i never said nothing to her but she'll have me i know' the licence was made out and she did have him and what's more she's got him now and i never had any of the four hundred pound worse luck beg your pardon sir said sam when he had concluded but wen i gets on this here grievance i runs on like a new barrow vith the vheel greased having said which and having paused for an instant to see whether he was wanted for anything more sam left the room half past nine just the time off at once said the gentleman whom we need hardly introduce as mr jingle time for what said the spinster aunt coquettishly licence dearest of angels give notice at the church call you mine to morrow said mr jingle and he squeezed the spinster aunt's hand the licence said rachael blushing the licence repeated mr jingle 'in hurry post haste for a licence in hurry ding dong i come back' how you run on said rachael run on nothing to the hours days weeks months years when we're united run on they'll fly on bolt mizzle steam engine thousand horse power nothing to it can't can't we be married before to morrow morning inquired rachael impossible can't be notice at the church leave the licence to day ceremony come off to morrow i am so terrified lest my brother should discover us said rachael discover nonsense too much shaken by the break down besides extreme caution gave up the post chaise walked on took a hackney coach came to the borough last place in the world that he'd look in ha ha capital notion that very don't be long said the spinster affectionately as mr jingle stuck the pinched up hat on his head long away from you cruel charmer and mr jingle skipped playfully up to the spinster aunt imprinted a chaste kiss upon her lips and danced out of the room dear man said the spinster as the door closed after him rum old girl said mr jingle as he walked down the passage it is painful to reflect upon the perfidy of our species and we will not therefore pursue the thread of mr jingle's meditations as he wended his way to doctors' commons it will be sufficient for our purpose to relate that escaping the snares of the dragons in white aprons who guard the entrance to that enchanted region he reached the vicar general's office in safety and having procured a highly flattering address on parchment from the archbishop of canterbury to his trusty and well beloved alfred jingle and rachael wardle greeting he carefully deposited the mystic document in his pocket and retraced his steps in triumph to the borough he was yet on his way to the white hart when two plump gentlemen and one thin one entered the yard and looked round in search of some authorised person of whom they could make a few inquiries mr samuel weller happened to be at that moment engaged in burnishing a pair of painted tops the personal property of a farmer who was refreshing himself with a slight lunch of two or three pounds of cold beef and a pot or two of porter after the fatigues of the borough market and to him the thin gentleman straightway advanced my friend said the thin gentleman you're one o' the adwice gratis order thought sam or you wouldn't be so werry fond o' me all at once but he only said well sir my friend said the thin gentleman with a conciliatory hem have you got many people stopping here now pretty busy eh sam stole a look at the inquirer he was a little high dried man with a dark squeezed up face and small restless black eyes that kept winking and twinkling on each side of his little inquisitive nose as if they were playing a perpetual game of peep bo with that feature he was dressed all in black with boots as shiny as his eyes a low white neckcloth and a clean shirt with a frill to it a gold watch chain and seals depended from his fob he carried his black kid gloves in his hands not on them and as he spoke thrust his wrists beneath his coat tails with the air of a man who was in the habit of propounding some regular posers pretty busy eh said the little man illustration sam at the white hart oh werry well sir replied sam we shan't be bankrupts and we shan't make our fort'ns we eats our biled mutton without capers and don't care for horse radish ven ve can get beef ah said the little man you're a wag an't you my eldest brother was troubled with that complaint said sam it may be catching i used to sleep with him this is a curious old house of yours said the little man looking around him if you'd sent word you was coming we'd ha' had it repaired replied the imperturbable sam the little man seemed rather baffled by these several repulses and a short consultation took place between him and the two plump gentlemen at its conclusion the little man took a pinch of snuff from an oblong silver box and was apparently on the point of renewing the conversation when one of the plump gentlemen who in addition to a benevolent countenance possessed a pair of spectacles and a pair of black gaiters interfered the fact of the matter is said the benevolent gentleman that my friend here pointing to the other plump gentleman will give you half a guinea if you'll answer one or two now my dear sir my dear sir said the little man pray allow me my dear sir the very first principle to be observed in these cases is this if you place a matter in the hands of a professional man you must in no way interfere in the progress of the business you must repose implicit confidence in him really mr he turned to the other plump gentleman and said i forget your friend's name pickwick said mr wardle for it was no other than that jolly personage ah pickwick really mr pickwick my dear sir excuse me i shall be happy to receive any private suggestions of yours as amicus curi but you must see the impropriety of your interfering with my conduct in this case with such an ad captandum argument as the offer of half a guinea really my dear sir really and the little man took an argumentative pinch of snuff and looked very profound my only wish sir said mr pickwick was to bring this very unpleasant matter to as speedy a close as possible quite right quite right said the little man with which view continued mr pickwick i made use of the argument which my experience of men has taught me is the most likely to succeed in any case ay ay said the little man very good very good indeed but you should have suggested it to me my dear sir i'm quite certain you cannot be ignorant of the extent of confidence which must be placed in professional men if any authority can be necessary on such a point my dear sir let me refer you to the well known case in barnwell and never mind george barnwell interrupted sam who had remained a wondering listener during this short colloquy everybody knows vhat sort of a case his was tho' it's always been my opinion mind you that the young 'ooman deserved scragging a precious sight more than he did hows'ever that's neither here nor there you want me to except of half a guinea werry well i'm agreeable i can't say no fairer than that can i sir mr pickwick smiled then the next question is what the devil do you want with me as the man said ven he see the ghost we want to know said mr wardle now my dear sir my dear sir interposed the busy little man mr wardle shrugged his shoulders and was silent we want to know said the little man solemnly and we ask the question of you in order that we may not awaken apprehensions inside we want to know who you've got in this house at present who there is in the house said sam in whose mind the inmates were always represented by that particular article of their costume which came under his immediate superintendence there's a vooden leg in number six there's a pair of hessians in thirteen there's two pair of halves in the commercial there's these here painted tops in the snuggery inside the bar and five more tops in the coffee room nothing more said the little man stop a bit replied sam suddenly recollecting himself yes there's a pair of vellingtons a good deal worn and a pair o' lady's shoes in number five what sort of shoes hastily inquired wardle who together with mr pickwick had been lost in bewilderment at the singular catalogue of visitors country make replied sam any maker's name brown where of muggleton it is them exclaimed wardle by heavens we've found them hush said sam the vellingtons has gone to doctors' commons no said the little man yes for a licence we're in time exclaimed wardle show us the room not a moment is to be lost pray my dear sir pray said the little man caution caution he drew from his pocket a red silk purse and looked very hard at sam as he drew out a sovereign sam grinned expressively show us into the room at once without announcing us said the little man and it's yours sam threw the painted tops into a corner and led the way through a dark passage and up a wide staircase he paused at the end of a second passage and held out his hand here it is whispered the attorney as he deposited the money in the hand of their guide the man stepped forward for a few paces followed by the two friends and their legal adviser he stopped at a door is this the room murmured the little gentleman sam nodded assent old wardle opened the door and the whole three walked into the room just as mr jingle who had that moment returned had produced the licence to the spinster aunt the spinster uttered a loud shriek and throwing herself in a chair covered her face with her hands mr jingle crumpled up the licence and thrust it into his coat pocket the unwelcome visitors advanced into the middle of the room you you are a nice rascal aren't you exclaimed wardle breathless with passion my dear sir my dear sir said the little man laying his hat on the table pray consider pray defamation of character action for damages calm yourself my dear sir pray how dare you drag my sister from my house said the old man ay ay very good said the little gentleman you may ask that how dare you sir eh sir who the devil are you inquired mr jingle in so fierce a tone that the little gentleman involuntarily fell back a step or two who is he you scoundrel interposed wardle he's my lawyer mr perker of gray's inn perker i'll have this fellow prosecuted indicted i'll i'll i'll ruin him and you continued mr wardle turning abruptly round to his sister you rachael at a time of life when you ought to know better what do you mean by running away with a vagabond disgracing your family and making yourself miserable get on your bonnet and come back call a hackney coach there directly and bring this lady's bill d'ye hear d'ye hear cert'nly sir replied sam who had answered wardle's violent ringing of the bell with a degree of celerity which must have appeared marvellous to anybody who didn't know that his eye had been applied to the outside of the keyhole during the whole interview illustration get on your bonnet repeated wardle do nothing of the kind said jingle leave the room sir no business here lady's free to act as she pleases more than one and twenty more than one and twenty ejaculated wardle contemptuously more than one and forty i an't said the spinster aunt her indignation getting the better of her determination to faint you are replied wardle you're fifty if you're an hour here the spinster aunt uttered a loud shriek and became senseless a glass of water said the humane mr pickwick summoning the landlady a glass of water said the passionate wardle bring a bucket and throw it over her it'll do her good and she richly deserves it ugh you brute ejaculated the kind hearted landlady poor dear and with sundry ejaculations of come now there's a dear drink a little of this it'll do you good don't give way so there's a love c c the landlady assisted by a chambermaid proceeded to vinegar the forehead beat the hands titillate the nose and unlace the stays of the spinster aunt and to administer such other restoratives as are usually applied by compassionate females to ladies who are endeavouring to ferment themselves into hysterics coach is ready sir said sam appearing at the door come along cried wardle i'll carry her downstairs at this proposition the hysterics came on with redoubled violence the landlady was about to enter a very violent protest against this proceeding and had already given vent to an indignant inquiry whether mr wardle considered himself a lord of the creation when mr jingle interposed boots said he get me an officer stay stay said little mr perker consider sir consider i'll not consider replied jingle she's her own mistress see who dares to take her away unless she wishes it i won't be taken away murmured the spinster aunt i don't wish it here there was a frightful relapse my dear sir said the little man in a low tone taking mr wardle and mr pickwick apart my dear sir we're in a very awkward situation it's a distressing case very i never knew one more so but really my dear sir really we have no power to control this lady's actions i warned you before we came my dear sir that there was nothing to look to but a compromise there was a short pause what kind of compromise would you recommend inquired mr pickwick why my dear sir our friend's in an unpleasant position very much so we must be content to suffer some pecuniary loss i'll suffer any rather than submit to this disgrace and let her fool as she is be made miserable for life said wardle i rather think it can be done said the bustling little man mr jingle will you step with us into the next room for a moment mr jingle assented and the quartette walked into an empty apartment now sir said the little man as he carefully closed the door is there no way of accommodating this matter step this way sir for a moment into this window sir where we can be alone there sir there pray sit down sir now my dear sir between you and i we know very well my dear sir that you have run off with this lady for the sake of her money don't frown sir don't frown i say between you and i we know it we are both men of the world and we know very well that our friends here are not eh mr jingle's face gradually relaxed and something distantly resembling a wink quivered for an instant in his left eye very good very good said the little man observing the impression he had made now the fact is that beyond a few hundreds the lady has little or nothing till the death of her mother fine old lady my dear sir old said mr jingle briefly but emphatically why yes said the attorney with a slight cough you are right my dear sir she is rather old she comes of an old family though my dear sir old in every sense of the word the founder of that family came into kent when julius csar invaded britain only one member of it since who hasn't lived to eighty five and he was beheaded by one of the henrys the old lady is not seventy three now my dear sir the little man paused and took a pinch of snuff well cried mr jingle well my dear sir you don't take snuff ah so much the better expensive habit well my dear sir you're a fine young man man of the world able to push your fortune if you had capital eh well said mr jingle again do you comprehend me not quite don't you think now my dear sir i put it to you don't you think that fifty pounds and liberty would be better than miss wardle and expectation won't do not half enough said mr jingle rising nay nay my dear sir remonstrated the little attorney seizing him by the button good round sum a man like you could treble it in no time great deal to be done with fifty pounds my dear sir more to be done with a hundred and fifty replied mr jingle coolly well my dear sir we won't waste time in splitting straws resumed the little man say say seventy won't do said mr jingle don't go away my dear sir pray don't hurry said the little man eighty come i'll write you a cheque at once won't do said mr jingle well my dear sir well said the little man still detaining him just tell me what will do expensive affair said mr jingle money out of pocket posting nine pounds licence three that's twelve compensation a hundred hundred and twelve breach of honour and loss of the lady yes my dear sir yes said the little man with a knowing look never mind the last two items that's a hundred and twelve say a hundred come and twenty said mr jingle come come i'll write you a cheque said the little man and down he sat at the table for that purpose i'll make it payable the day after to morrow said the little man with a look towards mr wardle and we can get the lady away meanwhile mr wardle sullenly nodded assent a hundred said the little man and twenty said mr jingle my dear sir remonstrated the little man give it him interposed mr wardle and let him go the cheque was written by the little gentleman and pocketed by mr jingle now leave this house instantly said wardle starting up my dear sir urged the little man and mind said mr wardle that nothing should have induced me to make this compromise not even a regard for my family if i had not known that the moment you got any money in that pocket of yours you'd go to the devil faster if possible than you would without it my dear sir urged the little man again be quiet perker resumed wardle leave the room sir off directly said the unabashed jingle bye bye pickwick if any dispassionate spectator could have beheld the countenance of the illustrious man whose name forms the leading feature of the title of this work during the latter part of this conversation he would have been almost induced to wonder that the indignant fire which flashed from his eyes did not melt the glasses of his spectacles so majestic was his wrath his nostrils dilated and his fists clenched involuntarily as he heard himself addressed by the villain but he restrained himself again he did not pulverise him here continued the hardened traitor tossing the licence at mr pickwick's feet get the name altered take home the lady do for tuppy mr pickwick was a philosopher but philosophers are only men in armour after all the shaft had reached him penetrated through his philosophical harness to his very heart in the frenzy of his rage he hurled the inkstand madly forward and followed it up himself but mr jingle had disappeared and he found himself caught in the arms of sam hallo said that eccentric functionary furniter's cheap vere you come from sir self acting ink that 'ere it's wrote your mark upon the wall old gen'lm'n hold still sir wot's the use o' runnin' arter a man as has made his lucky and got to t'other end of the borough by this time mr pickwick's mind like those of all truly great men was open to conviction he was a quick and powerful reasoner and a moment's reflection sufficed to remind him of the impotency of his rage it subsided as quickly as it had been roused he panted for breath and looked benignantly round upon his friends shall we tell the lamentations that ensued when miss wardle found herself deserted by the faithless jingle shall we extract mr pickwick's masterly description of that heart rending scene his note book blotted with the tears of sympathising humanity lies open before us one word and it is in the printer's hands but no we will be resolute we will not wring the public bosom with the delineation of such suffering slowly and sadly did the two friends and the deserted lady return next day in the muggleton heavy coach dimly and darkly had the sombre shadows of a summer's night fallen upon all around when they again reached dingley dell and stood within the entrance to manor farm chapter xi illustration involving another journey and an antiquarian discovery recording mr pickwick's determination to be present at an election and containing a manuscript of the old clergyman's a night of quiet and repose in the profound silence of dingley dell and an hour's breathing of its fresh and fragrant air on the ensuing morning completely recovered mr pickwick from the effects of his late fatigue of body and anxiety of mind that illustrious man had been separated from his friends and followers for two whole days and it was with a degree of pleasure and delight which no common imagination can adequately conceive that he stepped forward to greet mr winkle and mr snodgrass as he encountered those gentlemen on his return from his early walk the pleasure was mutual for who could ever gaze on mr pickwick's beaming face without experiencing the sensation but still a cloud seemed to hang over his companions which that great man could not but be sensible of and was wholly at a loss to account for there was a mysterious air about them both as unusual as it was alarming and how said mr pickwick when he had grasped his followers by the hand and exchanged warm salutations of welcome how is tupman mr winkle to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed made no reply he turned away his head and appeared absorbed in melancholy reflection snodgrass said mr pickwick earnestly how is our friend he is not ill no replied mr snodgrass and a tear trembled on his sentimental eyelid like a rain drop on a window frame no he is not ill mr pickwick stopped and gazed on each of his friends in turn winkle snodgrass said mr pickwick what does this mean where is our friend what has happened speak i conjure i entreat nay i command you speak there was a solemnity a dignity in mr pickwick's manner not to be withstood he is gone said mr snodgrass gone exclaimed mr pickwick gone gone repeated mr snodgrass where ejaculated mr pickwick we can only guess from that communication replied mr snodgrass taking a letter from his pocket and placing it in his friend's hand yesterday morning when a letter was received from mr wardle stating that you would be home with his sister at night the melancholy which had hung over our friend during the whole of the previous day was observed to increase he shortly afterwards disappeared he was missing during the whole day and in the evening this letter was brought by the hostler from the crown at muggleton it had been left in his charge in the morning with a strict injunction that it should not be delivered until night mr pickwick opened the epistle it was in his friend's hand writing and these were its contents my dear pickwick you my dear friend are placed far beyond the reach of many mortal frailties and weaknesses which ordinary people cannot overcome you do not know what it is at one blow to be deserted by a lovely and fascinating creature and to fall a victim to the artifices of a villain who hid the grin of cunning beneath the mask of friendship i hope you never may any letter addressed to me at the leather bottle cobham kent will be forwarded supposing i still exist i hasten from the sight of that world which has become odious to me should i hasten from it altogether pity forgive me life my dear pickwick has become insupportable to me the spirit which burns within us is a porter's knot on which to rest the heavy load of worldly cares and troubles and when that spirit fails us the burden is too heavy to be borne we sink beneath it you may tell rachael ah that name tracy tupman we must leave this place directly said mr pickwick as he refolded the note it would not have been decent for us to remain here under any circumstances after what has happened and now we are bound to follow in search of our friend and so saying he led the way to the house his intention was rapidly communicated the entreaties to remain were pressing but mr pickwick was inflexible business he said required his immediate attendance the old clergyman was present you are not really going said he taking mr pickwick aside mr pickwick reiterated his former determination then here said the old gentleman is a little manuscript which i had hoped to have the pleasure of reading to you myself i found it on the death of a friend of mine a medical man engaged in our county lunatic asylum among a variety of papers which i had the option of destroying or preserving as i thought proper i can hardly believe that the manuscript is genuine though it certainly is not in my friend's hand however whether it be the genuine production of a maniac or founded upon the ravings of some unhappy being which i think more probable read it and judge for yourself mr pickwick received the manuscript and parted from the benevolent old gentleman with many expressions of good will and esteem it was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of manor farm from which they had received so much hospitality and kindness mr pickwick kissed the young ladies we were going to say as if they were his own daughters only as he might possibly have infused a little more warmth into the salutation the comparison would not be quite appropriate hugged the old lady with filial cordiality and patted the rosy cheeks of the female servants in a most patriarchal manner as he slipped into the hands of each some more substantial expression of his approval the exchange of cordialities with their fine old host and mr trundle was even more hearty and prolonged and it was not until mr snodgrass had been several times called for and at last emerged from a dark passage followed soon after by emily whose bright eyes looked unusually dim that the three friends were enabled to tear themselves from their friendly entertainers many a backward look they gave at the farm as they walked slowly away and many a kiss did mr snodgrass waft in the air in acknowledgment of something very like a lady's handkerchief which was waved from one of the upper windows until a turn in the lane hid the old house from their sight at muggleton they procured a conveyance to rochester by the time they reached the last named place the violence of their grief had sufficiently abated to admit of their making a very excellent early dinner and having procured the necessary information relative to the road the three friends set forward again in the afternoon to walk to cobham a delightful walk it was for it was a pleasant afternoon in june and their way lay through a deep and shady wood cooled by the light wind which gently rustled the thick foliage and enlivened by the songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs the ivy and the moss crept in thick clusters over the old trees and the soft green turf overspread the ground like a silken mat they emerged upon an open park with an ancient hall displaying the quaint and picturesque architecture of elizabeth's time long vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on every side large herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass and occasionally a startled hare scoured along the ground with the speed of the shadows thrown by the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a passing breath of summer if this said mr pickwick looking about him if this were the place to which all who are troubled with our friend's complaint came i fancy their old attachment to this world would very soon return i think so too said mr winkle and really added mr pickwick after half an hour's walking had brought them to the village really for a misanthrope's choice this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places of residence i ever met with in this opinion also both mr winkle and mr snodgrass expressed their concurrence and having been directed to the leather bottle a clean and commodious village ale house the three travellers entered and at once inquired for a gentleman of the name of tupman show the gentlemen into the parlour tom said the landlady a stout country lad opened a door at the end of the passage and the three friends entered a long low roofed room furnished with a large number of high backed leather cushioned chairs of fantastic shapes and embellished with a great variety of old portraits and roughly coloured prints of some antiquity at the upper end of the room was a table with a white cloth upon it well covered with a roast fowl bacon ale and et ceteras and at the table sat mr tupman looking as unlike a man who had taken his leave of the world as possible on the entrance of his friends that gentleman laid down his knife and fork and with a mournful air advanced to meet them i did not expect to see you here he said as he grasped mr pickwick's hand it's very kind ah said mr pickwick sitting down and wiping from his forehead the perspiration which the walk had engendered finish your dinner and walk out with me i wish to speak to you alone mr tupman did as he was desired and mr pickwick having refreshed himself with a copious draught of ale waited his friend's leisure the dinner was quickly despatched and they walked out together illustration at the table sat mr tupman looking as unlike a man who had taken his leave of this world as possible for half an hour their forms might have been seen pacing the churchyard to and fro while mr pickwick was engaged in combating his companion's resolution any repetition of his arguments would be useless for what language could convey to them that energy and force which their great originator's manner communicated whether mr tupman was already tired of retirement or whether he was wholly unable to resist the eloquent appeal which was made to him matters not he did not resist it at last it mattered little to him he said where he dragged out the miserable remainder of his days and since his friend laid so much stress upon his humble companionship he was willing to share his adventures mr pickwick smiled they shook hands and walked back to rejoin their companions it was at this moment that mr pickwick made that immortal discovery which has been the pride and boast of his friends and the envy of every antiquarian in this or any other country they had passed the door of their inn and walked a little way down the village before they recollected the precise spot in which it stood as they turned back mr pickwick's eye fell upon a small broken stone partially buried in the ground in front of a cottage door he paused this is very strange said mr pickwick what is strange inquired mr tupman staring eagerly at every object near him but the right one god bless me what's the matter this last was an ejaculation of irrepressible astonishment occasioned by seeing mr pickwick in his enthusiasm for discovery fall on his knees before the little stone and commence wiping the dust off it with his pocket handkerchief there is an inscription here said mr pickwick is it possible said mr tupman i can discern continued mr pickwick rubbing away with all his might and gazing intently through his spectacles i can discern a cross and a b and then a t this is important continued mr pickwick starting up this is some very old inscription existing perhaps long before the ancient almshouses in this place it must not be lost he tapped at the cottage door a labouring man opened it do you know how this stone came here my friend inquired the benevolent mr pickwick no i doan't sir replied the man civilly it was here long afor i war born or any on us mr pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion you you are not particularly attached to it i dare say said mr pickwick trembling with anxiety you wouldn't mind selling it now illustration there is an inscription here said mr pickwick ah but who'd buy it inquired the man with an expression of face which he probably meant to be very cunning i'll give you ten shillings for it at once said mr pickwick if you would take it up for me the astonishment of the village may be easily imagined when the little stone having been raised with one wrench of a spade mr pickwick by dint of great personal exertion bore it with his own hands to the inn and after having carefully washed it deposited it on the table the exultation and joy of the pickwickians knew no bounds when their patience and assiduity their washing and scraping were crowned with success the stone was uneven and broken and the letters were straggling and irregular but the following fragment of an inscription was clearly to be deciphered b i l s t u m p s h i s m a r k mr pickwick's eyes sparkled with delight as he sat and gloated over the treasure he had discovered he had attained one of the greatest objects of his ambition in a county known to abound in remains of the early ages in a village in which there still existed some memorials of the olden time he he the chairman of the pickwick club had discovered a strange and curious inscription of unquestionable antiquity which had wholly escaped the observation of the many learned men who had preceded him he could hardly trust the evidence of his senses this this said he determines me we return to town to morrow to morrow exclaimed his admiring followers to morrow said mr pickwick this treasure must be at once deposited where it can be thoroughly investigated and properly understood i have another reason for this step in a few days an election is to take place for the borough of eatanswill at which mr perker a gentleman whom i lately met is the agent of one of the candidates we will behold and minutely examine a scene so interesting to every englishman we will was the animated cry of three voices mr pickwick looked round him the attachment and fervour of his followers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him he was their leader and he felt it let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass said he this proposition like the other was received with unanimous applause having himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box purchased from the landlady for the purpose he placed himself in an arm chair at the head of the table and the evening was devoted to festivity and conversation it was past eleven o'clock a late hour for the little village of cobham when mr pickwick retired to the bed room which had been prepared for his reception he threw open the lattice window and setting his light upon the table fell into a train of meditation on the hurried events of the two preceding days the hour and the place were both favourable to contemplation mr pickwick was roused by the church clock striking twelve the first stroke of the hour sounded solemnly in his ear but when the bell ceased the stillness seemed insupportable he almost felt as if he had lost a companion he was nervous and excited and hastily undressing himself and placing his light in the chimney got into bed every one has experienced that disagreeable state of mind in which a sensation of bodily weariness in vain contends against an inability to sleep it was mr pickwick's condition at this moment he tossed first on one side and then on the other and perseveringly closed his eyes as if to coax himself to slumber it was of no use whether it was the unwonted exertion he had undergone or the heat or the brandy and water or the strange bed whatever it was his thoughts kept reverting very uncomfortably to the grim pictures downstairs and the old stories to which they had given rise in the course of the evening after half an hour's tumbling about he came to the unsatisfactory conclusion that it was of no use trying to sleep so he got up and partially dressed himself anything he thought was better than lying there fancying all kinds of horrors he looked out of the window it was very dark he walked about the room it was very lonely he had taken a few turns from the door to the window and from the window to the door when the clergyman's manuscript for the first time entered his head it was a good thought if it failed to interest him it might send him to sleep he took it from his coat pocket and drawing a small table towards his bedside trimmed the light put on his spectacles and composed himself to read it was a strange hand writing and the paper was much soiled and blotted the title gave him a sudden start too and he could not avoid casting a wistful glance round the room reflecting on the absurdity of giving way to such feelings however he trimmed the light again and read as follows a madman's manuscript yes a madman's how that word would have struck to my heart many years ago how it would have roused the terror that used to come upon me sometimes sending the blood hissing and tingling through my veins till the cold dew of fear stood in large drops upon my skin and my knees knocked together with fright i like it now though it's a fine name show me the monarch whose angry frown was ever feared like the glare of a madman's eye whose cord and axe were ever half so sure as a madman's grip ho ho it's a grand thing to be mad to be peeped at like a wild lion through the iron bars to gnash one's teeth and howl through the long still night to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to roll and twine among the straw transported with such brave music hurrah for the madhouse oh it's a rare place i remember days when i was afraid of being mad when i used to start from my sleep and fall upon my knees and pray to be spared from the curse of my race when i rushed from the sight of merriment or happiness to hide myself in some lonely place and spend the weary hours in watching the progress of the fever that was to consume my brain i knew that madness was mixed up with my very blood and the marrow of my bones that one generation had passed away without the pestilence appearing among them and that i was the first in whom it would revive i knew it must be so that so it always had been and so it ever would be and when i cowered in some obscure corner of a crowded room and saw men whisper and point and turn their eyes towards me i knew they were telling each other of the doomed madman and i slunk away again to mope in solitude i did this for years long long years they were the nights here are long sometimes very long but they are nothing to the restless nights and dreadful dreams i had at that time it makes me cold to remember them large dusky forms with sly and jeering faces crouched in the corners of the room and bent over my bed at night tempting me to madness they told me in low whispers that the floor of the old house in which my father's father died was stained with his own blood shed by his own hand in raging madness i drove my fingers into my ears but they screamed into my head till the room rang with it that in one generation before him the madness slumbered but that his grandfather had lived for years with his hands fettered to the ground to prevent his tearing himself to pieces i knew they told the truth i knew it well i had found it out years before though they had tried to keep it from me ha ha i was too cunning for them madman as they thought me at last it came upon me and i wondered how i could ever have feared it i could go into the world now and laugh and shout with the best among them i knew i was mad but they did not even suspect it how i used to hug myself with delight when i thought of the fine trick i was playing them after their old pointing and leering when i was not mad but only dreading that i might one day become so and how i used to laugh for joy when i was alone and thought how well i kept my secret and how quickly my kind friends would have fallen from me if they had known the truth i could have screamed with ecstasy when i dined alone with some fine roaring fellow to think how pale he would have turned and how fast he would have run if he had known that the dear friend who sat close to him sharpening a bright glittering knife was a madman with all the power and half the will to plunge it in his heart oh it was a merry life riches became mine wealth poured in upon me and i rioted in pleasures enhanced a thousand fold to me by the consciousness of my well kept secret i inherited an estate the law the eagle eyed law itself had been deceived and had handed over disputed thousands to a madman's hands where was the wit of the sharp sighted men of sound mind where the dexterity of the lawyers eager to discover a flaw the madman's cunning had over reached them all i had money how i was courted i spent it profusely how i was praised how those three proud overbearing brothers humbled themselves before me the old white headed father too such deference such respect such devoted friendship he worshipped me the old man had a daughter and the young men a sister and all the five were poor i was rich and when i married the girl i saw a smile of triumph play upon the faces of her needy relatives as they thought of their well planned scheme and their fine prize it was for me to smile to smile to laugh outright and tear my hair and roll upon the ground with shrieks of merriment they little thought they had married her to a madman stay if they had known it would they have saved her a sister's happiness against her husband's gold the lightest feather i blow into the air against the gay chain that ornaments my body in one thing i was deceived with all my cunning if i had not been mad for though we madmen are sharp witted enough we get bewildered sometimes i should have known that the girl would rather have been placed stiff and cold in a dull leaden coffin than borne an envied bride to my rich glittering house i should have known that her heart was with the dark eyed boy whose name i once heard her breathe in her troubled sleep and that she had been sacrificed to me to relieve the poverty of the old white headed man and the haughty brothers i don't remember forms or faces now but i know the girl was beautiful i know she was for in the bright moonlight nights when i start up from my sleep and all is quiet about me i see standing still and motionless in one corner of this cell a slight and wasted figure with long black hair which streaming down her back stirs with no earthly wind and eyes that fix their gaze on me and never wink or close hush the blood chills at my heart as i write it down that form is hers the face is very pale and the eyes are glassy bright but i know them well that figure never moves it never frowns and mouths as others do that fill this place sometimes but it is much more dreadful to me even than the spirits that tempted me many years ago it comes fresh from the grave and is so very death like for nearly a year i saw that face grow paler for nearly a year i saw the tears steal down the mournful cheeks and never knew the cause i found it out at last though they could not keep it from me long she had never liked me i had never thought she did she despised my wealth and hated the splendour in which she lived i had not expected that she loved another this i had never thought of strange feelings came over me and thoughts forced upon me by some secret power whirled round and round my brain i did not hate her though i hated the boy she still wept for i pitied yes i pitied the wretched life to which her cold and selfish relations had doomed her i knew that she could not live long but the thought that before her death she might give birth to some ill fated being destined to hand down madness to its offspring determined me i resolved to kill her for many weeks i thought of poison and then of drowning and then of fire a fine sight the grand house in flames and the madman's wife smouldering away to cinders think of the jest of a large reward too and of some sane man swinging in the wind for a deed he never did and all through a madman's cunning i thought often of this but i gave it up at last oh the pleasure of stropping the razor day after day feeling the sharp edge and thinking of the gash one stroke of its thin bright edge would make at last the old spirits who had been with me so often before whispered in my ear that the time was come and thrust the open razor into my hand i grasped it firmly rose softly from the bed and leaned over my sleeping wife her face was buried in her hands i withdrew them softly and they fell listlessly on her bosom she had been weeping for the traces of the tears were still wet upon her cheek her face was calm and placid and even as i looked upon it a tranquil smile lighted up her pale features i laid my hand softly on her shoulder she started it was only a passing dream i leant forward again she screamed and woke one motion of my hand and she would never again have uttered cry or sound but i was startled and drew back her eyes were fixed on mine i know not how it was but they cowed and frightened me and i quailed beneath them she rose from the bed still gazing fixedly and steadily on me i trembled the razor was in my hand but i could not move she made towards the door as she neared it she turned and withdrew her eyes from my face the spell was broken i bounded forward and clutched her by the arm uttering shriek upon shriek she sunk upon the ground now i could have killed her without a struggle but the house was alarmed i heard the tread of footsteps on the stairs i replaced the razor in its usual drawer unfastened the door and called loudly for assistance they came and raised her and placed her on the bed she lay bereft of animation for hours and when life look and speech returned her senses had deserted her and she raved wildly and furiously doctors were called in great men who rolled up to my door in easy carriages with fine horses and gaudy servants they were at her bedside for weeks they had a great meeting and consulted together in low and solemn voices in another room one the cleverest and most celebrated among them took me aside and bidding me prepare for the worst told me me the madman that my wife was mad he stood close beside me at an open window his eyes looking in my face and his hand laid upon my arm with one effort i could have hurled him into the street beneath it would have been rare sport to have done it but my secret was at stake and i let him go a few days after they told me i must place her under some restraint i must provide a keeper for her i i went into the open fields where none could hear me and laughed till the air resounded with my shouts she died next day the white headed old man followed her to the grave and the proud brothers dropped a tear over the insensible corpse of her whose sufferings they had regarded in her lifetime with muscles of iron all this was food for my secret mirth and i laughed behind the white handkerchief which i held up to my face as we rode home till the tears came into my eyes but though i had carried my object and killed her i was restless and disturbed and i felt that before long my secret must be known i could not hide the wild mirth and joy which boiled within me and made me when i was alone at home jump up and beat my hands together and dance round and round and roar aloud when i went out and saw the busy crowd hurrying about the streets or to the theatre and heard the sound of music and beheld the people dancing i felt such glee that i could have rushed among them and torn them to pieces limb from limb and howled in transport but i ground my teeth and struck my feet upon the floor and drove my sharp nails into my hands i kept it down and no one knew i was a madman yet i remember though it's one of the last things i can remember for now i mix up realities with my dreams and having so much to do and being always hurried here have no time to separate the two from some strange confusion in which they get involved i remember how i let it out at last ha ha i think i see their frightened looks now and feel the ease with which i flung them from me and dashed my clenched fist into their white faces and then flew like the wind and left them screaming and shouting far behind the strength of a giant comes upon me when i think of it there see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench i could snap it like a twig only there are long galleries here with many doors i don't think i could find my way along them and even if i could i know there are iron gates below which they keep locked and barred they know what a clever madman i have been and they are proud to have me here to show let me see yes i had been out it was late at night when i reached home and found the proudest of the three proud brothers waiting to see me urgent business he said i recollect it well i hated that man with all a madman's hate many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him they told me he was there i ran swiftly up stairs he had a word to say to me i dismissed the servants it was late and we were alone together for the first time i kept my eyes carefully from him at first for i knew what he little thought and i gloried in the knowledge that the light of madness gleamed from them like fire we sat in silence for a few minutes he spoke at last my recent dissipation and strange remarks made so soon after his sister's death were an insult to her memory coupling together many circumstances which had at first escaped his observation he thought i had not treated her well he wished to know whether he was right in inferring that i meant to cast a reproach upon her memory and a disrespect upon her family it was due to the uniform he wore to demand this explanation this man had a commission in the army a commission purchased with my money and his sister's misery this was the man who had been foremost in the plot to ensnare me and grasp my wealth this was the man who had been the main instrument in forcing his sister to wed me well knowing that her heart was given to that puling boy due to his uniform the livery of his degradation i turned my eyes upon him i could not help it but i spoke not a word i saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze he was a bold man but the colour faded from his face and he drew back his chair i dragged mine nearer to him and as i laughed i was very merry then i saw him shudder i felt the madness rising within me he was afraid of me 'you were very fond of your sister when she was alive' i said 'very' he looked uneasily round him and i saw his hand grasp the back of his chair but he said nothing 'you villain' said i 'i found you out i discovered your hellish plots against me i know her heart was fixed on some one else before you compelled her to marry me i know it i know it' he jumped suddenly from his chair brandished it aloft and bid me stand back for i took care to be getting closer to him all the time i spoke i screamed rather than talked for i felt tumultuous passions eddying through my veins and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear his heart out 'damn you' said i starting up and rushing upon him 'i killed her i am a madman down with you blood blood i will have it' i turned aside with one blow the chair he hurled at me in his terror and closed with him and with a heavy crash we rolled upon the floor together it was a fine struggle that for he was a tall strong man fighting for his life and i a powerful madman thirsting to destroy him i knew no strength could equal mine and i was right right again though a madman his struggles grew fainter i knelt upon his chest and clasped his brawny throat firmly with both hands his face grew purple his eyes were starting from his head and with protruded tongue he seemed to mock me i squeezed the tighter the door was suddenly burst open with a loud noise and a crowd of people rushed forward crying aloud to each other to secure the madman my secret was out and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom i gained my feet before a hand was on me threw myself among my assailants and cleared my way with my strong arm as if i bore a hatchet in my hand and hewed them down before me i gained the door dropped over the banisters and in an instant was in the street straight and swift i ran and no one dared to stop me i heard the noise of feet behind and redoubled my speed it grew fainter and fainter in the distance and at length died away altogether but on i bounded through marsh and rivulet over fence and wall with a wild shout which was taken up by the strange beings that flocked around me on every side and swelled the sound till it pierced the air i was borne upon the arms of demons who swept along upon the wind and bore down bank and hedge before them and spun me round and round with a rustle and speed that made my head swim until at last they threw me from them with a violent shock and i fell heavily upon the earth when i woke i found myself here here in this gay cell where the sunlight seldom comes and the moon steals in in rays which only serve to show the dark shadows about me and that silent figure in its old corner when i lie awake i can sometimes hear strange shrieks and cries from distant parts of this large place what they are i know not but they neither come from that pale form nor does it regard them for from the first shades of dusk till the earliest light of morning it still stands motionless in the same place listening to the music of my iron chain and watching my gambols on my straw bed at the end of the manuscript was written in another hand this note the unhappy man whose ravings are recorded above was a melancholy instance of the baneful results of energies misdirected in early life and excesses prolonged until their consequences could never be repaired the thoughtless riot dissipation and debauchery of his younger days produced fever and delirium the first effects of the latter was the strange delusion founded upon a well known medical theory strongly contended for by some and as strongly contested by others that an hereditary madness existed in his family this produced a settled gloom which in time developed a morbid insanity and finally terminated in raving madness there is every reason to believe that the events he detailed though distorted in the description by his diseased imagination really happened it is only matter of wonder to those who were acquainted with the vices of his early career that his passions when no longer controlled by reason did not lead him to the commission of still more frightful deeds mr pickwick's candle was just expiring in the socket as he concluded the perusal of the old clergyman's manuscript and when the light went suddenly out without any previous flicker by way of warning it communicated a very considerable start to his excited frame hastily throwing off such articles of clothing as he had put on when he rose from his uneasy bed and casting a fearful glance around he once more scrambled hastily between the sheets and soon fell fast asleep the sun was shining brilliantly into his chamber when he awoke and the morning was far advanced the gloom which had oppressed him on the previous night had disappeared with the dark shadows which shrouded the landscape and his thoughts and feelings were as light and gay as the morning itself after a hearty breakfast the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk to gravesend followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box they reached that town about one o'clock their luggage they had directed to be forwarded to the city from rochester and being fortunate enough to secure places on the outside of a coach arrived in london in sound health and spirits on that same afternoon the next three or four days were occupied with the preparations which were necessary for their journey to the borough of eatanswill as any reference to that most important undertaking demands a separate chapter we may devote the few lines which remain at the close of this to narrate with great brevity the history of the antiquarian discovery it appears from the transactions of the club then that mr pickwick lectured upon the discovery at the general club meeting convened on the night succeeding their return and entered into a variety of ingenious and erudite speculations on the meaning of the inscription it also appears that a skilful artist executed a faithful delineation of the curiosity which was engraved on the stone and presented to the royal antiquarian society and other learned bodies that heart burnings and jealousies without number were created by rival controversies which were penned upon the subject and that mr pickwick himself wrote a pamphlet containing ninety six pages of very small print and twenty seven different readings of the inscription that three old gentlemen cut off their eldest sons with a shilling a piece for presuming to doubt the antiquity of the fragment and that one enthusiastic individual cut himself off prematurely in despair at being unable to fathom its meaning that mr pickwick was elected an honorary member of seventeen native and foreign societies for making the discovery that none of the seventeen could make anything of it but that all the seventeen agreed it was very extraordinary mr blotton indeed and the name will be doomed to the undying contempt of those who cultivate the mysterious and the sublime mr blotton we say with the doubt and cavilling peculiar to vulgar minds presumed to state a view of the case as degrading as ridiculous mr blotton with a mean desire to tarnish the lustre of the immortal name of pickwick actually undertook a journey to cobham in person and on his return sarcastically observed in an oration at the club that he had seen the man from whom the stone was purchased that the man presumed the stone to be ancient but solemnly denied the antiquity of the inscription inasmuch as he represented it to have been rudely carved by himself in an idle mood and to display letters intended to bear neither more nor less than the simple construction of bill stumps his mark and that mr stumps being little in the habit of original composition and more accustomed to be guided by the sound of words than by the strict rules of orthography had omitted the concluding l of his christian name the pickwick club as might have been expected from so enlightened an institution received this statement with the contempt it deserved expelled the presumptuous and ill conditioned blotton and voted mr pickwick a pair of gold spectacles in token of their confidence and approbation in return for which mr pickwick caused a portrait of himself to be painted and hung up in the club room mr blotton though ejected was not conquered he also wrote a pamphlet addressed to the seventeen learned societies native and foreign containing a repetition of the statement he had already made and rather more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned societies were so many humbugs hereupon the virtuous indignation of the seventeen learned societies native and foreign being roused several fresh pamphlets appeared the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native learned societies the native learned societies translated the pamphlets of the foreign learned societies into english the foreign learned societies translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into all sorts of languages and thus commenced that celebrated scientific discussion so well known to all men as the pickwick controversy but this base attempt to injure mr pickwick recoiled upon the head of its calumnious author the seventeen learned societies unanimously voted the presumptuous blotton an ignorant meddler and forthwith set to work upon more treatises than ever and to this day the stone remains an illegible monument of mr pickwick's greatness and a lasting trophy of the littleness of his enemies chapter xii illustration descriptive of a very important proceeding on the part of mr pickwick no less an epoch in his life than in this history mr pickwick's apartments in goswell street although on a limited scale were not only of a very neat and comfortable description but peculiarly adapted for the residence of a man of his genius and observation his sitting room was the first floor front his bed room the second floor front and thus whether he were sitting at his desk in his parlour or standing before the dressing glass in his dormitory he had an equal opportunity of contemplating human nature in all the numerous phases it exhibits in that not more populous than popular thoroughfare his landlady mrs bardell the relict and sole executrix of a deceased custom house officer was a comely woman of bustling manners and agreeable appearance with a natural genius for cooking improved by study and long practice into an exquisite talent there were no children no servants no fowls the only other inmates of the house were a large man and a small boy the first a lodger the second a production of mrs bardell's the large man was always home precisely at ten o'clock at night at which hour he regularly condensed himself into the limits of a dwarfish french bedstead in the back parlour and the infantine sports and gymnastic exercises of master bardell were exclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house and in it mr pickwick's will was law to any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the establishment and conversant with the admirable regulation of mr pickwick's mind his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to that which had been fixed upon for the journey to eatanswill would have been most mysterious and unaccountable he paced the room to and fro with hurried steps popped his head out of the window at intervals of about three minutes each constantly referred to his watch and exhibited many other manifestations of impatience very unusual with him it was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation but what that something was not even mrs bardell herself had been enabled to discover mrs bardell said mr pickwick at last as that amiable female approached the termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment sir said mrs bardell your little boy is a very long time gone why it's a good long way to the borough sir remonstrated mrs bardell ah said mr pickwick very true so it is mr pickwick relapsed into silence and mrs bardell resumed her dusting mrs bardell said mr pickwick at the expiration of a few minutes sir said mrs bardell again do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people than to keep one la mr pickwick said mrs bardell colouring up to the very border of her cap as she fancied she observed a species of matrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger la mr pickwick what a question well but do you inquired mr pickwick that depends said mrs bardell approaching the duster very near to mr pickwick's elbow which was planted on the table that depends a good deal upon the person you know mr pickwick and whether it's a saving and careful person sir that's very true said mr pickwick but the person i have in my eye here he looked very hard at mrs bardell i think possesses these qualities and has moreover a considerable knowledge of the world and a great deal of sharpness mrs bardell which may be of material use to me la mr pickwick said mrs bardell the crimson rising to her cap border again i do said mr pickwick growing energetic as was his wont in speaking of a subject which interested him i do indeed and to tell you the truth mrs bardell i have made up my mind dear me sir exclaimed mrs bardell you'll think it very strange now said the amiable mr pickwick with a good humoured glance at his companion that i never consulted you about this matter and never even mentioned it till i sent your little boy out this morning eh mrs bardell could only reply by a look she had long worshipped mr pickwick at a distance but here she was all at once raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared to aspire mr pickwick was going to propose a deliberate plan too sent her little boy to the borough to get him out of the way how thoughtful how considerate well said mr pickwick what do you think oh mr pickwick said mrs bardell trembling with agitation you are very kind sir it'll save you a good deal of trouble won't it said mr pickwick oh i never thought anything of the trouble sir replied mrs bardell and of course i should take more trouble to please you then than ever but it is so kind of you mr pickwick to have so much consideration for my loneliness ah to be sure said mr pickwick i never thought of that when i am in town you'll always have somebody to sit with you to be sure so you will i'm sure i ought to be a very happy woman said mrs bardell and your little boy said mr pickwick bless his heart interposed mrs bardell with a maternal sob he too will have a companion resumed mr pickwick a lively one who'll teach him i'll be bound more tricks in a week than he would ever learn in a year and mr pickwick smiled placidly oh you dear said mrs bardell mr pickwick started illustration oh you kind good playful dear oh you kind good playful dear said mrs bardell and without more ado she rose from her chair and flung her arms round mr pickwick's neck with a cataract of tears and a chorus of sobs bless my soul cried the astonished mr pickwick mrs bardell my good woman dear me what a situation pray consider mrs bardell don't if anybody should come oh let them come exclaimed mrs bardell frantically i'll never leave you dear kind good soul and with these words mrs bardell clung the tighter mercy upon me said mr pickwick struggling violently i hear somebody coming up the stairs don't don't there's a good creature don't but entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing for mrs bardell had fainted in mr pickwick's arms and before he could gain time to deposit her on a chair master bardell entered the room ushering in mr tupman mr winkle and mr snodgrass mr pickwick was struck motionless and speechless he stood with his lovely burden in his arms gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation they in their turn stared at him and master bardell in his turn stared at everybody the astonishment of the pickwickians was so absorbing and the perplexity of mr pickwick was so extreme that they might have remained in exactly the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was restored had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son clad in a tight suit of corduroy spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size he at first stood at the door astounded and uncertain but by degrees the impression that his mother must have suffered some personal damage pervaded his partially developed mind and considering mr pickwick as the aggressor he set up an appalling and semi earthly kind of howling and butting forward with his head commenced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs with such blows and pinches as the strength of his arm and the violence of his excitement allowed take this little villain away said the agonised mr pickwick he's mad what is the matter said the three tongue tied pickwickians i don't know replied mr pickwick pettishly take away the boy here mr winkle carried the interesting boy screaming and struggling to the further end of the apartment now help me lead this woman downstairs oh i am better now said mrs bardell faintly let me lead you downstairs said the ever gallant mr tupman thank you sir thank you exclaimed mrs bardell hysterically and downstairs she was led accordingly accompanied by her affectionate son i cannot conceive said mr pickwick when his friend returned i cannot conceive what has been the matter with that woman i had merely announced to her my intention of keeping a man servant when she fell into the extraordinary paroxysm in which you found her very extraordinary thing very said his three friends placed me in such an extremely awkward situation continued mr pickwick very was the reply of his followers as they coughed slightly and looked dubiously at each other this behaviour was not lost upon mr pickwick he remarked their incredulity they evidently suspected him there is a man in the passage now said mr tupman it's the man i spoke to you about said mr pickwick i sent for him to the borough this morning have the goodness to call him up snodgrass mr snodgrass did as he was desired and mr samuel weller forthwith presented himself oh you remember me i suppose said mr pickwick i should think so replied sam with a patronising wink queer start that 'ere but he was one too many for you warn't he up to snuff and a pinch or two over eh never mind that matter now said mr pickwick hastily i want to speak to you about something else sit down thank'ee sir said sam and down he sat without farther bidding having previously deposited his old white hat on the landing outside the door 'tan't a wery good 'un to look at said sam but it's an astonishin' 'un to wear and afore the brim went it was a wery handsome tile hows'ever it's lighter without it that's one thing and every hole lets in some air that's another wentilation gossamer i calls it on the delivery of this sentiment mr weller smiled agreeably upon the assembled pickwickians now with regard to the matter on which i with the concurrence of these gentlemen sent for you said mr pickwick that's the pint sir interposed sam out vith it as the father said to the child ven he swallowed a farden we want to know in the first place said mr pickwick whether you have any reason to be discontented with your present situation afore i answers that 'ere question gen'lm'n replied mr weller i should like to know in the first place whether you're a goin' to purwide me with a better a sunbeam of placid benevolence played on mr pickwick's features as he said i have half made up my mind to engage you myself have you though said sam mr pickwick nodded in the affirmative wages inquired sam twelve pounds a year replied mr pickwick clothes two suits work to attend upon me and travel about with me and these gentlemen here take the bill down said sam emphatically i'm let to a single gentleman and the terms is agreed upon you accept the situation inquired mr pickwick cert'nly replied sam if the clothes fits me half as well as the place they'll do you can get a character of course said mr pickwick ask the landlady o' the white hart about that sir replied sam can you come this evening i'll get into the clothes this minute if they're here said sam with great alacrity call at eight this evening said mr pickwick and if the inquiries are satisfactory they shall be provided with the single exception of one amiable indiscretion in which an assistant housemaid had equally participated the history of mr weller's conduct was so very blameless that mr pickwick felt fully justified in closing the engagement that very evening with the promptness and energy which characterised not only the public proceedings but all the private actions of this extraordinary man he at once led his new attendant to one of those convenient emporiums where gentlemen's new and second hand clothes are provided and the troublesome and inconvenient formality of measurement dispensed with and before night had closed in mr weller was furnished with a grey coat with the p c button a black hat with a cockade to it a pink striped waistcoat light breeches and gaiters and a variety of other necessaries too numerous to recapitulate well said that suddenly transformed individual as he took his seat on the outside of the eatanswill coach next morning i wonder whether i'm meant to be a footman or a groom or a gamekeeper or a seedsman i looks like a sort of compo of every one on 'em never mind there's change of air plenty to see and little to do and all this suits my complaint uncommon so long life to the pickvicks says i chapter xiii illustration some account of eatanswill of the state of parties therein and of the election of a member to serve in parliament for that ancient loyal and patriotic borough we will frankly acknowledge that up to the period of our being first immersed in the voluminous papers of the pickwick club we had never heard of eatanswill we will with equal candour admit that we have in vain searched for proof of the actual existence of such a place at the present day knowing the deep reliance to be placed on every note and statement of mr pickwick's and not presuming to set up our recollection against the recorded declarations of that great man we have consulted every authority bearing upon the subject to which we could possible refer we have traced every name in schedules a and b without meeting with that of eatanswill we have minutely examined every corner of the pocket county maps issued for the benefit of society by our distinguished publishers and the same result has attended our investigation we are therefore led to believe that mr pickwick with that anxious desire to abstain from giving offence to any and with those delicate feelings for which all who knew him well know he was so eminently remarkable purposely substituted a fictitious designation for the real name of the place in which his observations were made we are confirmed in this belief by a little circumstance apparently slight and trivial in itself but when considered in this point of view not undeserving of notice in mr pickwick's note book we can just trace an entry of the fact that the places of himself and followers were booked by the norwich coach but this entry was afterwards lined through as if for the purpose of concealing even the direction in which the borough is situated we will not therefore hazard a guess upon the subject but will at once proceed with this history content with the materials which its characters have provided for us it appears then that the eatanswill people like the people of many other small towns considered themselves of the utmost and most mighty importance and that every man in eatanswill conscious of the weight that attached to his example felt himself bound to unite heart and soul with one of the two great parties that divided the town the blues and the buffs now the blues lost no opportunity of opposing the buffs and the buffs lost no opportunity of opposing the blues and the consequence was that whenever the buffs and blues met together at public meeting town hall fair or market disputes and high words arose between them with these dissensions it is almost superfluous to say that everything in eatanswill was made a party question if the buffs proposed to new skylight the market place the blues got up public meetings and denounced the proceeding if the blues proposed the erection of an additional pump in the high street the buffs rose as one man and stood aghast at the enormity there were blue shops and buff shops blue inns and buff inns there was a blue aisle and a buff aisle in the very church itself of course it was essentially and indispensably necessary that each of these powerful parties should have its chosen organ and representative and accordingly there were two newspapers in the town the eatanswill gazette and the eatanswill independent the former advocating blue principles and the latter conducted on grounds decidedly buff fine newspapers they were such leading articles and such spirited attacks our worthless contemporary the gazette that disgraceful and dastardly journal the independent that false and scurrilous print the independent that vile and slanderous calumniator the gazette these and other spirit stirring denunciations were strewn plentifully over the columns of each in every number and excited feelings of the most intense delight and indignation in the bosoms of the townspeople mr pickwick with his usual foresight and sagacity had chosen a peculiarly desirable moment for his visit to the borough never was such a contest known the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall was the blue candidate and horatio fizkin esq of fizkin lodge near eatanswill had been prevailed upon by his friends to stand forward in the buff interest the gazette warned the electors of eatanswill that the eyes not only of england but of the whole civilised world were upon them and the independent imperatively demanded to know whether the constituency of eatanswill were the grand fellows they had always taken them for or base and servile tools undeserving alike of the name of englishmen and the blessings of freedom never had such a commotion agitated the town before it was late in the evening when mr pickwick and his companions assisted by sam dismounted from the roof of the eatanswill coach large blue silk flags were flying from the windows of the town arms inn and bills were posted in every sash intimating in gigantic letters that the honourable samuel slumkey's committee sat there daily a crowd of idlers were assembled in the road looking at a hoarse man in the balcony who was apparently talking himself very red in the face in mr slumkey's behalf but the force and point of whose arguments were somewhat impaired by the perpetual beating of four large drums which mr fizkin's committee had stationed at the street corner there was a busy little man beside him though who took off his hat at intervals and motioned to the people to cheer which they regularly did most enthusiastically and as the red faced gentleman went on talking till he was redder in the face than ever it seemed to answer his purpose quite as well as if anybody had heard him the pickwickians had no sooner dismounted than they were surrounded by a branch mob of the honest and independent who forthwith set up three deafening cheers which being responded to by the main body for it's not at all necessary for a crowd to know what they are cheering about swelled into a tremendous roar of triumph which stopped even the red faced man in the balcony hurrah shouted the mob in conclusion one cheer more screamed the little fugleman in the balcony and out shouted the mob again as if lungs were cast iron with steel works slumkey for ever roared the honest and independent slumkey for ever echoed mr pickwick taking off his hat no fizkin roared the crowd certainly not shouted mr pickwick hurrah and then there was another roaring like that of a whole menagerie when the elephant has rung the bell for the cold meat who is slumkey whispered mr tupman i don't know replied mr pickwick in the same tone hush don't ask any questions it's always best on these occasions to do what the mob do but suppose there are two mobs suggested mr snodgrass shout with the largest replied mr pickwick volumes could not have said more they entered the house the crowd opening right and left to let them pass and cheering vociferously the first object of consideration was to secure quarters for the night can we have beds here inquired mr pickwick summoning the waiter don't know sir replied the man afraid we're full sir i'll inquire sir away he went for that purpose and presently returned to ask whether the gentlemen were blue as neither mr pickwick nor his companions took any vital interest in the cause of either candidate the question was rather a difficult one to answer in this dilemma mr pickwick bethought himself of his new friend mr perker do you know a gentleman of the name of mr perker inquired mr pickwick certainly sir honourable mr samuel slumkey's agent he is blue i think oh yes sir then we are blue said mr pickwick but observing that the man looked rather doubtful at this accommodating announcement he gave him his card and desired him to present it to mr perker forthwith if he should happen to be in the house the waiter retired and reappearing almost immediately with a request that mr pickwick would follow him led the way to a large room on the first floor where seated at a long table covered with books and papers was mr perker ah ah my dear sir said the little man advancing to meet him very happy to see you my dear sir very pray sit down so you have carried your intention into effect you have come down here to see an election eh mr pickwick replied in the affirmative spirited contest my dear sir said the little man i am delighted to hear it said mr pickwick rubbing his hands i like to see sturdy patriotism on whatever side it is called forth and so it's a spirited contest oh yes said the little man very much so indeed we have opened all the public houses in the place and left our adversary nothing but the beer shops masterly stroke of policy that my dear sir eh the little man smiled complacently and took a large pinch of snuff and what are the probabilities as to the result of the contest inquired mr pickwick why doubtful my dear sir rather doubtful as yet replied the little man fizkin's people have got three and thirty voters in the lock up coach house at the white hart in the coach house said mr pickwick considerably astonished by this second stroke of policy they keep 'em locked up there till they want 'em resumed the little man the effect of that is you see to prevent our getting at them and even if we could it would be of no use for they keep them very drunk on purpose smart fellow fizkin's agent very smart fellow indeed mr pickwick stared but said nothing we are pretty confident though said mr perker sinking his voice almost to a whisper we had a little tea party here last night five and forty women my dear sir and gave every one of 'em a green parasol when she went away a parasol said mr pickwick fact my dear sir fact five and forty green parasols at seven and sixpence a piece all women like finery extraordinary the effect of those parasols secured all their husbands and half their brothers beats stockings and flannel and all that sort of thing hollow my idea my dear sir entirely hail rain or sunshine you can't walk half a dozen yards up the street without encountering half a dozen green parasols here the little man indulged in a convulsion of mirth which was only checked by the entrance of a third party this was a tall thin man with a sandy coloured head inclined to baldness and a face in which solemn importance was blended with a look of unfathomable profundity he was dressed in a long brown surtout with a black cloth waistcoat and drab trousers a double eye glass dangled at his waistcoat and on his head he wore a very low crowned hat with a broad brim the new comer was introduced to mr pickwick as mr pott the editor of the eatanswill gazette after a few preliminary remarks mr pott turned round to mr pickwick and said with solemnity this contest excites great interest in the metropolis sir i believe it does said mr pickwick to which i have reason to know said pott looking towards mr perker for information to which i have reason to know that my article of last saturday in some degree contributed not the least doubt of it said the little man the press is a mighty engine sir said pott mr pickwick yielded his fullest assent to the proposition but i trust sir said pott that i have never abused the enormous power i wield i trust sir that i have never pointed the noble instrument which is placed in my hands against the sacred bosom of private life or the tender breast of individual reputation i trust sir that i have devoted my energies to to endeavours humble they may be humble i know they are to instil those principles of which are here the editor of the eatanswill gazette appearing to ramble mr pickwick came to his relief and said certainly and what sir said pott what sir let me ask you as an impartial man is the state of the public mind in london with reference to my contest with the independent greatly excited no doubt interposed mr perker with a look of slyness which was very likely accidental the contest said pott shall be prolonged so long as i have health and strength and that portion of talent with which i am gifted from that contest sir although it may unsettle men's minds and excite their feelings and render them incapable for the discharge of the every day duties of ordinary life from that contest sir i will never shrink till i have set my heel upon the eatanswill independent i wish the people of london and the people of this country to know sir that they may rely upon me that i will not desert them that i am resolved to stand by them sir to the last your conduct is most noble sir said mr pickwick and he grasped the hand of the magnanimous pott you are sir i perceive a man of sense and talent said mr pott almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration i am most happy sir to make the acquaintance of such a man and i said mr pickwick feel deeply honoured by this expression of your opinion allow me sir to introduce you to my fellow travellers the other corresponding members of the club i am proud to have founded i shall be delighted said mr pott mr pickwick withdrew and returning with his friends presented them in due form to the editor of the eatanswill gazette now my dear pott said little mr perker the question is what are we to do with our friends here we can stop in this house i suppose said mr pickwick not a spare bed in the house my dear sir not a single bed extremely awkward said mr pickwick very said his fellow voyagers i have an idea upon this subject said mr pott which i think may be very successfully adopted they have two beds at the peacock and i can boldly say on behalf of mrs pott that she will be delighted to accommodate mr pickwick and any of his friends if the other two gentlemen and their servant do not object to shifting as they best can at the peacock after repeated pressings on the part of mr pott and repeated protestations on that of mr pickwick that he could not think of incommoding or troubling his amiable wife it was decided that it was the only feasible arrangement that could be made so it was made and after dining together at the town arms the friends separated mr tupman and mr snodgrass repairing to the peacock and mr pickwick and mr winkle proceeding to the mansion of mr pott it having been previously arranged that they should all reassemble at the town arms in the morning and accompany the honourable samuel slumkey's procession to the place of nomination mr pott's domestic circle was limited to himself and his wife all men whom mighty genius has raised to a proud eminence in the world have usually some little weakness which appears the more conspicuous from the contrast it presents to their general character if mr pott had a weakness it was perhaps that he was rather too submissive to the somewhat contemptuous control and sway of his wife we do not feel justified in laying any particular stress upon the fact because on the present occasion all mrs pott's most winning ways were brought into requisition to receive the two gentlemen my dear said mr pott mr pickwick mr pickwick of london mrs pott received mr pickwick's paternal grasp of the hand with enchanting sweetness and mr winkle who had not been announced at all slided and bowed unnoticed in an obscure corner p my dear said mrs pott my life said mr pott pray introduce the other gentleman i beg a thousand pardons said mr pott permit me mrs pott mr winkle said mr pickwick winkle echoed mr pott and the ceremony of introduction was complete we owe you many apologies ma'am said mr pickwick for disturbing your domestic arrangements at so short a notice i beg you won't mention it sir replied the feminine pott with vivacity it is a high treat to me i assure you to see any new faces living as i do from day to day and week to week in this dull place and seeing nobody nobody my dear exclaimed mr pott archly nobody but you retorted mrs pott with asperity you see mr pickwick said the host in explanation of his wife's lament that we are in some measure cut off from many enjoyments and pleasures of which we might otherwise partake my public station as editor of the eatanswill gazette the position which that paper holds in the country my constant immersion in the vortex of politics p my dear interposed mrs pott my life said the editor i wish my dear you would endeavour to find some topic of conversation in which these gentlemen might take some rational interest but my love said mr pott with great humility mr pickwick does take an interest in it it's well for him if he can said mrs pott emphatically i am wearied out of my life with your politics and quarrels with the independent and nonsense i am quite astonished p at your making such an exhibition of your absurdity but my dear said mr pott oh nonsense don't talk to me said mrs pott do you play cart sir i shall be very happy to learn under your tuition replied mr winkle well then draw that little table into this window and let me get out of hearing of those prosy politics jane said mr pott to the servant who brought in candles go down into the office and bring me up the file of the gazette for eighteen hundred and twenty eight i'll read you added the editor turning to mr pickwick i'll just read you a few of the leaders i wrote at that time upon the buff job of appointing a new tollman to the turnpike here i rather think they'll amuse you i should like to hear them very much indeed said mr pickwick up came the file and down sat the editor with mr pickwick at his side we have in vain pored over the leaves of mr pickwick's note book in the hope of meeting with a general summary of these beautiful compositions we have every reason to believe that he was perfectly enraptured with the vigour and freshness of the style indeed mr winkle has recorded the fact that his eyes were closed as if with excess of pleasure during the whole time of their perusal the announcement of supper put a stop both to the game at cart and the recapitulation of the beauties of the eatanswill gazette mrs pott was in the highest spirits and the most agreeable humour mr winkle had already made considerable progress in her good opinion and she did not hesitate to inform him confidentially that mr pickwick was a delightful old dear these terms convey a familiarity of expression in which few of those who were intimately acquainted with that colossal minded man would have presumed to indulge we have preserved them nevertheless as affording at once a touching and convincing proof of the estimation in which he was held by every class of society and the ease with which he made his way to their hearts and feelings it was a late hour of the night long after mr tupman and mr snodgrass had fallen asleep in the inmost recesses of the peacock when the two friends retired to rest slumber soon fell upon the senses of mr winkle but his feelings had been excited and his admiration roused and for many hours after sleep had rendered him insensible to earthly objects the face and figure of the agreeable mrs pott presented themselves again and again to his wandering imagination the noise and bustle which ushered in the morning were sufficient to dispel from the mind of the most romantic visionary in existence any associations but those which were immediately connected with the rapidly approaching election the beating of drums the blowing of horns and trumpets the shouting of men and tramping of horses echoed and re echoed through the streets from the earliest dawn of day and an occasional fight between the light skirmishers of either party at once enlivened the preparations and agreeably diversified their character well sam said mr pickwick as his valet appeared at his bed room door just as he was concluding his toilet all alive to day i suppose reg'lar game sir replied mr weller our people's a col lecting down at the town arms and they're a hollering themselves hoarse already ah said mr pickwick do they seem devoted to their party sam never see such dewotion in my life sir energetic eh said mr pickwick uncommon replied sam i never see men eat and drink so much afore i wonder they an't afeer'd o' bustin' that's the mistaken kindness of the gentry here said mr pickwick wery likely replied sam briefly fine fresh hearty fellows they seem said mr pickwick glancing from the window wery fresh replied sam me and the two waiters at the peacock has been a pumpin' over the independent woters as supped there last night pumping over independent voters exclaimed mr pickwick yes said his attendant every man slept vere he fell down we dragged 'em out one by one this mornin' and put 'em under the pump and they're in reg'lar fine order now shillin' a head the committee paid for that 'ere job can such things be exclaimed the astonished mr pickwick lord bless your heart sir said sam why where was you half baptized that's nothin' that an't nothing said mr pickwick nothin' at all sir replied his attendant the night afore the last day o' the last election here the opposite party bribed the barmaid at the town arms to hocus the brandy and water of fourteen unpolled electors as was a stoppin' in the house what do you mean by 'hocussing' brandy and water inquired mr pickwick puttin' laud'num in it replied sam blessed if she didn't send 'em all to sleep till twelve hours arter the election was over they took one man up to the booth in a truck fast asleep by way of experiment but it was no go they wouldn't poll him so they brought him back and put him to bed again strange practices these said mr pickwick half speaking to himself and half addressing sam not half so strange as a miraculous circumstance as happened to my own father at an election time in this wery place sir replied sam what was that inquired mr pickwick why he drove a coach down here once said sam 'lection time came on and he was engaged by vun party to bring down woters from london night afore he was a going to drive up committee on t'other side sends for him quietly and away he goes vith the messenger who shows him in large room lots of gen'l'm'n heaps of paper pens and ink and all that 'ere 'ah mr weller' says the gen'l'm'n in the chair 'glad to see you sir how are you' 'wery well thank'ee sir' says my father 'i hope you're pretty middlin' says he 'pretty well thank'ee sir' says the gen'l'm'n 'sit down mr weller pray sit down sir' so my father sits down and he and the gen'l'm'n looks wery hard at each other 'you don't remember me' says the gen'l'm'n 'can't say i do' says my father 'oh i know you' says the gen'l'm'n 'know'd you when you was a boy' says he 'well i don't remember you' says my father 'that's wery odd' says the gen'l'm'n 'wery' says my father 'you must have a bad mem'ry mr weller' says the gen'l'm'n 'well it is a wery bad 'un' says my father 'i thought so' says the gen'l'm'n so then they pours him out a glass of wine and gammons him about his driving and gets him into a reg'lar good humour and at last shoves a twenty pound note in his hand 'it's a wery bad road between this and london' says the gen'l'm'n 'here and there it is a heavy road' says my father ' 'specially near the canal i think' says the gen'l'm'n 'nasty bit that 'ere' says my father 'well mr weller' says the gen'l'm'n 'you're a wery good whip and can do what you like with your horses we know we're all wery fond o' you mr weller so in case you should have an accident when you're a bringing these here woters down and should tip 'em over into the canal vithout hurtin' of 'em this is for yourself' says he 'gen'l'm'n you're wery kind' says my father 'and i'll drink your health in another glass of wine' says he wich he did and then buttons up the money and bows himself out you wouldn't believe sir continued sam with a look of inexpressible impudence at his master that on the wery day as he came down with them woters his coach was upset on that 'ere wery spot and ev'ry man on 'em was turned into the canal and got out again inquired mr pickwick hastily why replied sam very slowly i rather think one old gen'l'm'n was missin' i know his hat was found but i an't quite certain whether his head was in it or not but what i look at is the hex traordinary and wonderful coincidence that arter what that gen'l'm'n said my father's coach should be upset in that wery place and on that wery day it is no doubt a very extraordinary circumstance indeed said mr pickwick but brush my hat sam for i hear mr winkle calling me to breakfast with these words mr pickwick descended to the parlour where he found breakfast laid and the family already assembled the meal was hastily despatched each of the gentlemen's hats was decorated with an enormous blue favour made up by the fair hands of mrs pott herself and as mr winkle had undertaken to escort that lady to a house top in the immediate vicinity of the hustings mr pickwick and mr pott repaired alone to the town arms from the back window of which one of mr slumkey's committee was addressing six small boys and one girl whom he dignified at every second sentence with the imposing title of men of eatanswill whereat the six small boys aforesaid cheered prodigiously the stable yard exhibited unequivocal symptoms of the glory and strength of the eatanswill blues there was a regular army of blue flags some with one handle and some with two exhibiting appropriate devices in golden characters four feet high and stout in proportion there was a grand band of trumpets bassoons and drums marshalled four abreast and earning their money if ever men did especially the drum beaters who were very muscular there were bodies of constables with blue staves twenty committee men with blue scarfs and a mob of voters with blue cockades there were electors on horseback and electors a foot there was an open carriage and four for the honourable samuel slumkey and there were four carriages and pairs for his friends and supporters and the flags were rustling and the band was playing and the constables were swearing and the twenty committee men were squabbling and the mob was shouting and the horses were backing and the post boys perspiring and everybody and everything then and there assembled was for the special use behoof honour and renown of the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall one of the candidates for the representation of the borough of eatanswill in the commons house of parliament of the united kingdom loud and long were the cheers and mighty was the rustling of one of the blue flags with liberty of the press inscribed thereon when the sandy head of mr pott was discerned in one of the windows by the mob beneath and tremendous was the enthusiasm when the honourable samuel slumkey himself in top boots and a blue neckerchief advanced and seized the hand of the said pott and melodramatically testified by gestures to the crowd his ineffaceable obligations to the eatanswill gazette is everything ready said the honourable samuel slumkey to mr perker everything my dear sir was the little man's reply nothing has been omitted i hope said the honourable samuel slumkey nothing has been left undone my dear sir nothing whatever there are twenty washed men at the street door for you to shake hands with and six children in arms that you're to pat on the head and inquire the age of be particular about the children my dear sir it has always a great effect that sort of thing i'll take care said the honourable samuel slumkey and perhaps my dear sir said the cautious little man perhaps if you could i don't mean to say it's indispensable but if you could manage to kiss one of 'em it would produce a very great impression on the crowd wouldn't it have as good an effect if the proposer or seconder did that said the honourable samuel slumkey why i am afraid it wouldn't replied the agent if it were done by yourself my dear sir i think it would make you very popular very well said the honourable samuel slumkey with a resigned air then it must be done that's all arrange the procession cried the twenty committee men amidst the cheers of the assembled throng the band and the constables and the committee men and the voters and the horse men and the carriages took their places each of the two horse vehicles being closely packed with as many gentlemen as could manage to stand upright in it and that assigned to mr perker containing mr pickwick mr tupman mr snodgrass and about half a dozen of the committee beside there was a moment of awful suspense as the procession waited for the honourable samuel slumkey to step into his carriage suddenly the crowd set up a great cheering he has come out said little mr perker greatly excited the more so as their position did not enable them to see what was going forward another cheer much louder he has shaken hands with the men cried the little agent another cheer far more vehement he has patted the babies on the head said mr perker trembling with anxiety a roar of applause that rent the air he has kissed one of 'em exclaimed the delighted little man a second roar he has kissed another gasped the excited manager a third roar he's kissing 'em all screamed the enthusiastic little gentleman and hailed by the deafening shouts of the multitude the procession moved on illustration he has patted the babies on the head how or by what means it became mixed up with the other procession and how it was ever extricated from the confusion consequent thereupon is more than we can undertake to describe inasmuch as mr pickwick's hat was knocked over his eyes nose and mouth by one poke of a buff flag staff very early in the proceedings he describes himself as being surrounded on every side when he could catch a glimpse of the scene by angry and ferocious countenances by a vast cloud of dust and by a dense crowd of combatants he represents himself as being forced from the carriage by some unseen power and being personally engaged in a pugilistic encounter but with whom or how or why he is wholly unable to state he then felt himself forced up some wooden steps by the persons from behind and on removing his hat found himself surrounded by his friends in the very front of the left hand side of the hustings the right was reserved for the buff party and the centre for the mayor and his officers one of whom the fat crier of eatanswill was ringing an enormous bell by way of commanding silence while mr horatio fizkin and the honourable samuel slumkey with their hands upon their hearts were bowing with the utmost affability to the troubled sea of heads that inundated the open space in front and from whence arose a storm of groans and shouts and yells and hootings that would have done honour to an earthquake there's winkle said mr tupman pulling his friend by the sleeve where said mr pickwick putting on his spectacles which he had fortunately kept in his pocket hitherto there said mr tupman on the top of that house and there sure enough in the leaden gutter of a tiled roof were mr winkle and mrs pott comfortably seated in a couple of chairs waving their handkerchiefs in token of recognition a compliment which mr pickwick returned by kissing his hand to the lady the proceedings had not yet commenced and as an inactive crowd is generally disposed to be jocose this very innocent action was sufficient to awaken their facetiousness oh you wicked old rascal cried one voice looking arter the girls are you oh you wenerable sinner cried another putting on his spectacles to look at a married 'ooman said a third i see him a winkin' at her with his wicked old eye shouted a fourth look arter your wife pott bellowed a fifth and then there was a roar of laughter as these taunts were accompanied with invidious comparisons between mr pickwick and an aged ram and several witticisms of the like nature and as they moreover rather tended to convey reflections upon the honour of an innocent lady mr pickwick's indignation was excessive but as silence was proclaimed at the moment he contented himself by scorching the mob with a look of pity for their misguided minds at which they laughed more boisterously than ever silence roared the mayor's attendants whiffin proclaim silence said the mayor with an air of pomp befitting his lofty station in obedience to this command the crier performed another concerto on the bell whereupon a gentleman in the crowd called out muffins which occasioned another laugh gentlemen said the mayor at as loud a pitch as he could possibly force his voice to gentlemen brother electors of the borough of eatanswill we are met here to day for the purpose of choosing a representative in the room of our late here the mayor was interrupted by a voice in the crowd suc cess to the mayor cried the voice and may he never desert the nail and sarspan business as he got his money by this allusion to the professional pursuits of the orator was received with a storm of delight which with a bell accompaniment rendered the remainder of his speech inaudible with the exception of the concluding sentence in which he thanked the meeting for the patient attention with which they had heard him throughout an expression of gratitude which elicited another burst of mirth of about a quarter of an hour's duration next a tall thin gentleman in a very stiff white neckerchief after being repeatedly desired by the crowd to send a boy home to ask whether he hadn't left his voice under the pillow begged to nominate a fit and proper person to represent them in parliament and when he said it was horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge near eatanswill the fizkinites applauded and the slumkeyites groaned so long and so loudly that both he and the seconder might have sung comic songs in lieu of speaking without anybody's being a bit the wiser the friends of horatio fizkin esquire having had their innings a little choleric pink faced man stood forward to propose another fit and proper person to represent the electors of eatanswill in parliament and very swimmingly the pink faced gentleman would have got on if he had not been rather too choleric to entertain a sufficient perception of the fun of the crowd but after a very few sentences of figurative eloquence the pink faced gentleman got from denouncing those who interrupted him in the mob to exchanging defiances with the gentlemen on the hustings whereupon arose an uproar which reduced him to the necessity of expressing his feelings by serious pantomime which he did and then left the stage to his seconder who delivered a written speech of half an hour's length and wouldn't be stopped because he had sent it all to the eatanswill gazette and the eatanswill gazette had already printed it every word then horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge near eatanswill presented himself for the purpose of addressing the electors which he no sooner did than the band employed by the honourable samuel slumkey commenced performing with a power to which their strength in the morning was a trifle in return for which the buff crowd belaboured the heads and shoulders of the blue crowd on which the blue crowd endeavoured to dispossess themselves of their very unpleasant neighbours the buff crowd and a scene of struggling and pushing and fighting succeeded to which we can no more do justice than the mayor could although he issued imperative orders to twelve constables to seize the ringleaders who might amount in number to two hundred and fifty or thereabouts at all these encounters horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge and his friends waxed fierce and furious until at last horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge begged to ask his opponent the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall whether that band played by his consent which question the honourable samuel slumkey declining to answer horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge shook his fist in the countenance of the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall upon which the honourable samuel slumkey his blood being up defied horatio fizkin esquire to mortal combat at this violation of all known rules and precedents of order the mayor commanded another fantasia on the bell and declared that he would bring before himself both horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge and the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall and bind them over to keep the peace upon this terrific denunciation the supporters of the two candidates interfered and after the friends of each party had quarrelled in pairs for three quarters of an hour horatio fizkin esquire touched his hat to the honourable samuel slumkey the honourable samuel slumkey touched his to horatio fizkin esquire the band was stopped the crowd were partially quieted and horatio fizkin esquire was permitted to proceed the speeches of the two candidates though differing in every other respect afforded a beautiful tribute to the merit and high worth of the electors of eatanswill both expressed their opinion that a more independent a more enlightened a more public spirited a more noble minded a more disinterested set of men than those who had promised to vote for him never existed on earth each darkly hinted his suspicions that the electors in the opposite interest had certain swinish and besotted infirmities which rendered them unfit for the exercise of the important duties they were called upon to discharge fizkin expressed his readiness to do anything he was wanted slumkey his determination to do nothing that was asked of him both said that the trade the manufactures the commerce the prosperity of eatanswill would ever be dearer to their hearts than any earthly object and each had it in his power to state with the utmost confidence that he was the man who would eventually be returned there was a show of hands the mayor decided in favour of the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge demanded a poll and a poll was fixed accordingly then a vote of thanks was moved to the mayor for his able conduct in the chair and the mayor devoutly wishing that he had had a chair to display his able conduct in for he had been standing during the whole proceedings returned thanks the processions re formed the carriages rolled slowly through the crowd and its members screeched and shouted after them as their feelings or caprice dictated during the whole time of the polling the town was in a perpetual fever of excitement everything was conducted on the most liberal and delightful scale excisable articles were remarkably cheap at all the public houses and spring vans paraded the streets for the accommodation of voters who were seized with any temporary dizziness in the head an epidemic which prevailed among the electors during the contest to a most alarming extent and under the influence of which they might frequently be seen lying on the pavements in a state of utter insensibility a small body of electors remained unpolled on the very last day they were calculating and reflecting persons who had not yet been convinced by the arguments of either party although they had had frequent conferences with each one hour before the close of the poll mr perker solicited the honour of a private interview with these intelligent these noble these patriotic men it was granted his arguments were brief but satisfactory they went in a body to the poll and when they returned the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall was returned also chapter xiv illustration comprising a brief description of the company at the peacock assembled and a tale told by a bagman it is pleasant to turn from contemplating the strife and turmoil of political existence to the peaceful repose of private life although in reality no great partisan of either side mr pickwick was sufficiently fired with mr pott's enthusiasm to apply his whole time and attention to the proceedings of which the last chapter affords a description compiled from his own memoranda nor while he was thus occupied was mr winkle idle his whole time being devoted to pleasant walks and short country excursions with mrs pott who never failed when such an opportunity presented itself to seek some relief from the tedious monotony she so constantly complained of the two gentlemen being thus completely domesticated in the editor's house mr tupman and mr snodgrass were in a great measure cast upon their own resources taking but little interest in public affairs they beguiled their time chiefly with such amusements as the peacock afforded which were limited to a bagatelle board in the first floor and a sequestered skittle ground in the back yard in the science and nicety of both these recreations which are far more abstruse than ordinary men suppose they were gradually initiated by mr weller who possessed a perfect knowledge of such pastimes thus notwithstanding that they were in a great measure deprived of the comfort and advantage of mr pickwick's society they were still enabled to beguile the time and to prevent its hanging heavily on their hands it was in the evening however that the peacock presented attractions which enabled the two friends to resist even the invitations of the gifted though prosy pott it was in the evening that the commercial room was filled with a social circle whose characters and manners it was the delight of mr tupman to observe whose sayings and doings it was the habit of mr snodgrass to note down most people know what sort of places commercial rooms usually are that of the peacock differed in no material respect from the generality of such apartments that is to say it was a large bare looking room the furniture of which had no doubt been better when it was newer with a spacious table in the centre and a variety of smaller dittos in the corners an extensive assortment of variously shaped chairs and an old turkey carpet bearing about the same relative proportion to the size of the room as a lady's pocket handkerchief might to the floor of a watch box the walls were garnished with one or two large maps and several weather beaten rough great coats with complicated capes dangled from a long row of pegs in one corner the mantelshelf was ornamented with a wooden inkstand containing one stump of a pen and half a wafer a road book and directory a county history minus the cover and the mortal remains of a trout in a glass coffin the atmosphere was redolent of tobacco smoke the fumes of which had communicated a rather dingy hue to the whole room and more especially to the dusty red curtains which shaded the windows on the sideboard a variety of miscellaneous articles were huddled together the most conspicuous of which were some very cloudy fish sauce cruets a couple of driving boxes two or three whips and as many travelling shawls a tray of knives and forks and the mustard here it was that mr tupman and mr snodgrass were seated on the evening after the conclusion of the election with several other temporary inmates of the house smoking and drinking well gents said a stout hale personage of about forty with only one eye a very bright black eye which twinkled with a roguish expression of fun and good humour our noble selves gents i always propose that toast to the company and drink mary to myself eh mary get along with you you wretch said the handmaiden obviously not ill pleased with the compliment however don't go away mary said the black eyed man let me alone imperence said the young lady never mind said the one eyed man calling after the girl as she left the room i'll step out by and by mary keep your spirits up dear here he went through the not very difficult process of winking upon the company with his solitary eye to the enthusiastic delight of an elderly personage with a dirty face and a clay pipe rum creeters is women said the dirty faced man after a pause ah no mistake about that said a very red faced man behind a cigar after this little bit of philosophy there was another pause there's rummer things than women in this world though mind you said the man with the black eye slowly filling a large dutch pipe with a most capacious bowl are you married inquired the dirty faced man can't say i am i thought not here the dirty faced man fell into fits of mirth at his own retort in which he was joined by a man of bland voice and placid countenance who always made it a point to agree with everybody women after all gentlemen said the enthusiastic mr snodgrass are the great props and comforts of our existence so they are said the placid gentleman when they're in a good humour interposed the dirty faced man and that's very true said the placid one i repudiate that qualification said mr snodgrass whose thoughts were fast reverting to emily wardle i repudiate it with disdain with indignation show me the man who says anything against women as women and i boldly declare he is not a man and mr snodgrass took his cigar from his mouth and struck the table violently with his clenched fist that's good sound argument said the placid man containing a position which i deny interrupted he of the dirty countenance and there's certainly a very great deal of truth in what you observe too sir said the placid gentleman your health sir said the bagman with the lonely eye bestowing an approving nod on mr snodgrass mr snodgrass acknowledged the compliment i always like to hear a good argument continued the bagman a sharp one like this it's very improving but this little argument about women brought to my mind a story i have heard an old uncle of mine tell the recollection of which just now made me say there were rummer things than women to be met with sometimes i should like to hear that same story said the red faced man with the cigar should you was the only reply of the bagman who continued to smoke with great vehemence so should i said mr tupman speaking for the first time he was always anxious to increase his stock of experience should you well then i'll tell it no i won't i know you won't believe it said the man with the roguish eye making that organ look more roguish than ever if you say it's true of course i shall said mr tupman well upon that understanding i'll tell you replied the traveller did you ever hear of the great commercial house of bilson and slum but it doesn't matter though whether you did or not because they retired from business long since it's eighty years ago since the circumstance happened to a traveller for that house but he was a particular friend of my uncle's and my uncle told the story to me it's a queer name but he used to call it the bagman's story and he used to tell it something in this way one winter's evening about five o'clock just as it began to grow dusk a man in a gig might have been seen urging his tired horse along the road which leads across marlborough downs in the direction of bristol i say he might have been seen and i have no doubt he would have been if anybody but a blind man had happened to pass that way but the weather was so bad and the night so cold and wet that nothing was out but the water and so the traveller jogged along in the middle of the road lonesome and dreary enough if any bagman of that day could have caught sight of the little neck or nothing sort of gig with a clay coloured body and red wheels and the vixenish ill tempered fast going bay mare that looked like a cross between a butcher's horse and a two penny post office pony he would have known at once that this traveller could have been no other than tom smart of the great house of bilson and slum cateaton street city however as there was no bagman to look on nobody knew anything at all about the matter and so tom smart and his clay coloured gig with the red wheels and the vixenish mare with the fast pace went on together keeping the secret among them and nobody was a bit the wiser there are many pleasanter places even in this dreary world than marlborough downs when it blows hard and if you throw in beside a gloomy winter's evening a miry and sloppy road and a pelting fall of heavy rain and try the effect by way of experiment in your own proper person you will experience the full force of this observation the wind blew not up the road or down it though that's bad enough but sheer across it sending the rain slanting down like the lines they used to rule in the copybooks at school to make the boys slope well for a moment it would die away and the traveller would begin to delude himself into the belief that exhausted with its previous fury it had quietly lain itself down to rest when whoo he would hear it growling and whistling in the distance and on it would come rushing over the hill tops and sweeping along the plain gathering sound and strength as it drew nearer until it dashed with a heavy gust against horse and man driving the sharp rain into their ears and its cold damp breath into their very bones and past them it would scour far far away with a stunning roar as if in ridicule of their weakness and triumphant in the consciousness of its own strength and power illustration no other than tom smart the bay mare splashed away through the mud and water with drooping ears now and then tossing her head as if to express her disgust at this very ungentlemanly behaviour of the elements but keeping a good pace notwithstanding until a gust of wind more furious than any that had yet assailed them caused her to stop suddenly and plant her four feet firmly against the ground to prevent her being blown over it's a special mercy that she did this for if she had been blown over the vixenish mare was so light and the gig was so light and tom smart such a light weight into the bargain that they must infallibly have all gone rolling over and over together until they reached the confines of earth or until the wind fell and in either case the probability is that neither the vixenish mare nor the clay coloured gig with the red wheels nor tom smart would ever have been fit for service again 'well damn my straps and whiskers' says tom smart tom sometimes had an unpleasant knack of swearing 'damn my straps and whiskers' says tom 'if this an't pleasant blow me' you'll very likely ask me why as tom smart had been pretty well blown already he expressed this wish to be submitted to the same process again i can't say all i know is that tom smart said so or at least he always told my uncle he said so and it's just the same thing 'blow me' says tom smart and the mare neighed as if she were precisely of the same opinion 'cheer up old girl' said tom patting the bay mare on the neck with the end of his whip 'it won't do pushing on such a night as this the first house we come to we'll put up at so the faster you go the sooner it's over soho old girl gently gently' whether the vixenish mare was sufficiently well acquainted with the tones of tom's voice to comprehend his meaning or whether she found it colder standing still than moving on of course i can't say but i can say that tom had no sooner finished speaking than she pricked up her ears and started forward at a speed which made the clay coloured gig rattle till you would have supposed every one of the red spokes was going to fly out on the turf of marlborough downs and even tom whip as he was couldn't stop or check her pace until she drew up of her own accord before a roadside inn on the right hand side of the way about half a quarter of a mile from the end of the downs tom cast a hasty glance at the upper part of the house as he threw the reins to the hostler and stuck the whip in the box it was a strange old place built of a kind of shingle inlaid as it were with cross beams with gable topped windows projecting completely over the pathway and a low door with a dark porch and a couple of steep steps leading down into the house instead of the modern fashion of half a dozen shallow ones leading up to it it was a comfortable looking place though for there was a strong cheerful light in the bar window which shed a bright ray across the road and even lighted up the hedge on the other side and there was a red flickering light in the opposite window one moment but faintly discernible and the next gleaming strongly through the drawn curtains which intimated that a rousing fire was blazing within marking these little evidences with the eye of an experienced traveller tom dismounted with as much agility as his half frozen limbs would permit and entered the house in less than five minutes' time tom was ensconced in the room opposite the bar the very room where he had imagined the fire blazing before a substantial matter of fact roaring fire composed of something short of a bushel of coals and wood enough to make half a dozen decent gooseberry bushes piled half way up the chimney and roaring and crackling with a sound that of itself would have warmed the heart of any reasonable man this was comfortable but this was not all for a smartly dressed girl with a bright eye and a neat ankle was laying a very clean white cloth on the table and as tom sat with his slippered feet on the fender and his back to the open door he saw a charming prospect of the bar reflected in the glass over the chimney piece with delightful rows of green bottles and gold labels together with jars of pickles and preserves and cheeses and boiled hams and rounds of beef arranged on shelves in the most tempting and delicious array well this was comfortable too but even this was not all for in the bar seated at tea at the nicest possible little table drawn close up before the brightest possible little fire was a buxom widow of somewhere about eight and forty or thereabouts with a face as comfortable as the bar who was evidently the landlady of the house and the supreme ruler over all these agreeable possessions there was only one drawback to the beauty of the whole picture and that was a tall man a very tall man in a brown coat and bright basket buttons and black whiskers and wavy black hair who was seated at tea with the widow and who it required no great penetration to discover was in a fair way of persuading her to be a widow no longer but to confer upon him the privilege of sitting down in that bar for and during the whole remainder of the term of his natural life tom smart was by no means of an irritable or envious disposition but somehow or other the tall man with the brown coat and the bright basket buttons did rouse what little gall he had in his composition and did make him feel extremely indignant the more especially as he could now and then observe from his seat before the glass certain little affectionate familiarities passing between the tall man and the widow which sufficiently denoted that the tall man was as high in favour as he was in size tom was fond of hot punch i may venture to say he was very fond of hot punch and after he had seen the vixenish mare well fed and well littered down and had eaten every bit of the nice little hot dinner which the widow tossed up for him with her own hands he just ordered a tumbler of it by way of experiment now if there was one thing in the whole range of domestic art which the widow could manufacture better than another it was this identical article and the first tumbler was adapted to tom smart's taste with such peculiar nicety that he ordered a second with the least possible delay hot punch is a pleasant thing gentlemen an extremely pleasant thing under any circumstances but in that snug old parlour before the roaring fire with the wind blowing outside till every timber in the old house creaked again tom smart found it perfectly delightful he ordered another tumbler and then another i am not quite certain whether he didn't order another after that but the more he drank of the hot punch the more he thought of the tall man 'confound his impudence' said tom to himself 'what business has he in that snug bar such an ugly villain too' said tom 'if the widow had any taste she might surely pick up some better fellow than that' here tom's eyes wandered from the glass on the chimney piece to the glass on the table and as he felt himself becoming gradually sentimental he emptied the fourth tumbler of punch and ordered a fifth tom smart gentlemen had always been very much attached to the public line it had long been his ambition to stand in a bar of his own in a green coat knee cords and tops he had a great notion of taking the chair at convivial dinners and he had often thought how well he could preside in a room of his own in the talking way and what a capital example he could set to his customers in the drinking department all these things passed rapidly through tom's mind as he sat drinking the hot punch by the roaring fire and he felt very justly and properly indignant that the tall man should be in a fair way of keeping such an excellent house while he tom smart was as far off from it as ever so after deliberating over the two last tumblers whether he hadn't a perfect right to pick a quarrel with the tall man for having contrived to get into the good graces of the buxom widow tom smart at last arrived at the satisfactory conclusion that he was a very ill used and persecuted individual and had better go to bed up a wide and ancient staircase the smart girl preceded tom shading the chamber candle with her hand to protect it from the currents of air which in such a rambling old place might have found plenty of room to disport themselves in without blowing the candle out but which did blow it out nevertheless thus affording tom's enemies an opportunity of asserting that it was he and not the wind who extinguished the candle and that while he pretended to be blowing it alight again he was in fact kissing the girl be this as it may another light was obtained and tom was conducted through a maze of rooms and a labyrinth of passages to the apartment which had been prepared for his reception where the girl bade him good night and left him alone it was a good large room with big closets and a bed which might have served for a whole boarding school to say nothing of a couple of oaken presses that would have held the baggage of a small army but what struck tom's fancy most was a strange grim looking high backed chair carved in the most fantastic manner with a flowered damask cushion and the round knobs at the bottom of the legs carefully tied up in red cloth as if it had got the gout in its toes of any other queer chair tom would only have thought it was a queer chair and there would have been an end of the matter but there was something about this particular chair and yet he couldn't tell what it was so odd and so unlike any other piece of furniture he had ever seen that it seemed to fascinate him he sat down before the fire and stared at the old chair for half an hour deuce take the chair it was such a strange old thing he couldn't take his eyes off it 'well' said tom slowly undressing himself and staring at the old chair all the while which stood with a mysterious aspect by the bedside 'i never saw such a rum concern as that in my days very odd' said tom who had got rather sage with the hot punch 'very odd' tom shook his head with an air of profound wisdom and looked at the chair again he couldn't make anything of it though so he got into bed covered himself up warm and fell asleep in about half an hour tom woke up with a start from a confused dream of tall men and tumblers of punch and the first object that presented itself to his waking imagination was the queer chair 'i won't look at it any more' said tom to himself and he squeezed his eyelids together and tried to persuade himself he was going to sleep again no use nothing but queer chairs danced before his eyes kicking up their legs jumping over each other's backs and playing all kinds of antics 'i may as well see one real chair as two or three complete sets of false ones' said tom bringing out his head from under the bed clothes there it was plainly discernible by the light of the fire looking as provoking as ever tom gazed at the chair and suddenly as he looked at it a most extraordinary change seemed to come over it the carving of the back gradually assumed the lineaments and expression of an old shrivelled human face the damask cushion became an antique flapped waistcoat the round knobs grew into a couple of feet encased in red cloth slippers and the old chair looked like a very ugly old man of the previous century with his arms a kimbo tom sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes to dispel the illusion no the chair was an ugly old gentleman and what was more he was winking at tom smart tom was naturally a headlong careless sort of dog and he had had five tumblers of hot punch into the bargain so although he was a little startled at first he began to grow rather indignant when he saw the old gentleman winking and leering at him with such an impudent air at length he resolved that he wouldn't stand it and as the old face still kept winking away as fast as ever tom said in a very angry tone 'what the devil are you winking at me for' 'because i like it tom smart' said the chair or the old gentleman whichever you like to call him he stopped winking though when tom spoke and began grinning like a superannuated monkey 'how do you know my name old nut cracker face' inquired tom smart rather staggered though he pretended to carry it off so well 'come come tom' said the old gentleman 'that's not the way to address solid spanish mahogany damme you couldn't treat me with less respect if i was veneered' when the old gentleman said this he looked so fierce that tom began to grow frightened 'i didn't mean to treat you with any disrespect sir' said tom in a much humbler tone than he had spoken in at first 'well well' said the old fellow 'perhaps not perhaps not tom ' 'sir ' 'i know everything about you tom everything you're very poor tom' 'i certainly am' said tom smart 'but how came you to know that' 'never mind that' said the old gentleman 'you're much too fond of punch tom' tom smart was just on the point of protesting that he hadn't tasted a drop since his last birthday but when his eye encountered that of the old gentleman he looked so knowing that tom blushed and was silent 'tom' said the old gentleman 'the widow's a fine woman remarkably fine woman eh tom' here the old fellow screwed up his eyes cocked up one of his wasted little legs and looked altogether so unpleasantly amorous that tom was quite disgusted with the levity of his behaviour at his time of life too 'i am her guardian tom' said the old gentleman 'are you' inquired tom smart 'i knew her mother tom' said the old fellow 'and her grandmother she was very fond of me made me this waistcoat tom' 'did she' said tom smart 'and these shoes' said the old fellow lifting up one of the red cloth mufflers 'but don't mention it tom i shouldn't like to have it known that she was so much attached to me it might occasion some unpleasantness in the family' when the old rascal said this he looked so extremely impertinent that as tom smart afterwards declared he could have sat upon him without remorse 'i have been a great favourite among the women in my time tom' said the profligate old debauchee 'hundreds of fine women have sat in my lap for hours together what do you think of that you dog eh' the old gentleman was proceeding to recount some other exploits of his youth when he was seized with such a violent fit of creaking that he was unable to proceed 'just serves you right old boy' thought tom smart but he didn't say anything 'ah' said the old fellow 'i am a good deal troubled with this now i am getting old tom and have lost nearly all my rails i have had an operation performed too a small piece let into my back and i found it a severe trial tom' 'i dare say you did sir' said tom smart 'however' said the old gentleman 'that's not the point tom i want you to marry the widow' 'me sir' said tom 'you' said the old gentleman 'bless your reverend locks' said tom he had a few scattered horse hairs left 'bless your reverend locks she wouldn't have me' and tom sighed involuntarily as he thought of the bar 'wouldn't she' said the old gentleman firmly 'no no' said tom 'there's somebody else in the wind a tall man a confoundedly tall man with black whiskers' 'tom' said the old gentleman 'she will never have him' 'won't she' said tom 'if you stood in the bar old gentleman you'd tell another story' 'pooh pooh' said the old gentleman 'i know all about that' 'about what' said tom 'the kissing behind the door and all that sort of thing tom' said the old gentleman and here he gave another impudent look which made tom very wroth because as you all know gentlemen to hear an old fellow who ought to know better talking about these things is very unpleasant nothing more so 'i know all about that tom' said the old gentleman 'i have seen it done very often in my time tom between more people than i should like to mention to you but it never came to anything after all' 'you must have seen some queer things' said tom with an inquisitive look 'you may say that tom' replied the old fellow with a very complicated wink 'i am the last of my family tom' said the old gentleman with a melancholy sigh 'was it a large one' inquired tom smart 'there were twelve of us tom' said the old gentleman 'fine straight backed handsome fellows as you'd wish to see none of your modern abortions all with arms and with a degree of polish though i say it that should not which would have done your heart good to behold' 'and what's become of the others sir' asked tom smart the old gentleman applied his elbow to his eye as he replied 'gone tom gone we had hard service tom and they hadn't all my constitution they got rheumatic about the legs and arms and went into kitchens and other hospitals and one of 'em with long service and hard usage positively lost his senses he got so crazy that he was obliged to be burnt shocking thing that tom' 'dreadful' said tom smart the old fellow paused for a few minutes apparently struggling with his feelings of emotion and then said 'however tom i am wandering from the point this tall man tom is a rascally adventurer the moment he married the widow he would sell off all the furniture and run away what would be the consequence she would be deserted and reduced to ruin and i should catch my death of cold in some broker's shop' 'yes but ' 'don't interrupt me' said the old gentleman 'of you tom i entertain a very different opinion for i well know that if you once settled yourself in a public house you would never leave it as long as there was anything to drink within its walls' 'i am very much obliged to you for your good opinion sir' said tom smart 'therefore' resumed the old gentleman in a dictatorial tone 'you shall have her and he shall not' 'what is to prevent it' said tom smart eagerly 'this disclosure' replied the old gentleman 'he is already married' 'how can i prove it' said tom starting half out of bed the old gentleman untucked his arm from his side and having pointed to one of the oaken presses immediately replaced it in its old position 'he little thinks' said the old gentleman 'that in the right hand pocket of a pair of trousers in that press he has left a letter entreating him to return to his disconsolate wife with six mark me tom six babes and all of them small ones' as the old gentleman solemnly uttered these words his features grew less and less distinct and his figure more shadowy a film came over tom smart's eyes the old man seemed gradually blending into the chair the damask waistcoat to resolve into a cushion the red slippers to shrink into little red cloth bags the light faded gently away and tom smart fell back on his pillow and dropped asleep morning aroused tom from the lethargic slumber into which he had fallen on the disappearance of the old man he sat up in bed and for some minutes vainly endeavoured to recall the events of the preceding night suddenly they rushed upon him he looked at the chair it was a fantastic and grim looking piece of furniture certainly but it must have been a remarkably ingenious and lively imagination that could have discovered any resemblance between it and an old man 'how are you old boy' said tom he was bolder in the daylight most men are the chair remained motionless and spoke not a word 'miserable morning' said tom no the chair would not be drawn into conversation 'which press did you point to you can tell me that' said tom devil a word gentlemen the chair would say 'it's not much trouble to open it anyhow' said tom getting out of bed very deliberately he walked up to one of the presses the key was in the lock he turned it and opened the door there was a pair of trousers there he put his hand into the pocket and drew forth the identical letter the old gentleman had described 'queer sort of thing this' said tom smart looking first at the chair and then at the press and then at the letter and then at the chair again 'very queer' said tom but as there was nothing in either to lessen the queerness he thought he might as well dress himself and settle the tall man's business at once just to put him out of his misery tom surveyed the rooms he passed through on his way down stairs with the scrutinising eye of a landlord thinking it not impossible that before long they and their contents would be his property the tall man was standing in the snug little bar with his hands behind him quite at home he grinned vacantly at tom a casual observer might have supposed he did it only to show his white teeth but tom smart thought that a consciousness of triumph was passing through the place where the tall man's mind would have been if he had had any tom laughed in his face and summoned the landlady 'good morning ma'am' said tom smart closing the door of the little parlour as the widow entered 'good morning sir' said the widow 'what will you take for breakfast sir' tom was thinking how he should open the case so he made no answer 'there's a very nice ham' said the widow 'and a beautiful cold larded fowl shall i send 'em in sir' these words roused tom from his reflections his admiration of the widow increased as she spoke thoughtful creature comfortable provider 'who is that gentleman in the bar ma'am' inquired tom 'his name is jinkins sir' replied the widow slightly blushing 'he's a tall man' said tom 'he is a very fine man sir' replied the widow 'and a very nice gentleman' 'ah' said tom 'is there anything more you want sir' inquired the widow rather puzzled by tom's manner 'why yes' said tom 'my dear ma'am will you have the kindness to sit down for one moment' the widow looked much amazed but she sat down and tom sat down too close beside her i don't know how it happened gentlemen indeed my uncle used to tell me that tom smart said he didn't know how it happened either but somehow or other the palm of tom's hand fell upon the back of the widow's hand and remained there while he spoke 'my dear ma'am' said tom smart he had always a great notion of committing the amiable 'my dear ma'am you deserve a very excellent husband you do indeed' 'lor sir' said the widow as well she might tom's mode of commencing the conversation being rather unusual not to say startling the fact of his never having set eyes upon her before the previous night being taken into consideration 'lor sir' 'i scorn to flatter my dear ma'am' said tom smart 'you deserve a very admirable husband and whoever he is he'll be a very lucky man' as tom said this his eye involuntarily wandered from the widow's face to the comforts around him the widow looked more puzzled than ever and made an effort to rise tom gently pressed her hand as if to detain her and she kept her seat widows gentlemen are not usually timorous as my uncle used to say 'i am sure i am very much obliged to you sir for your good opinion' said the buxom landlady half laughing 'and if ever i marry again ' 'if' said tom smart looking very shrewdly out of the right hand corner of his left eye 'if ' 'well' said the widow laughing outright this time 'when i do i hope i shall have as good a husband as you describe' 'jinkins to wit' said tom 'lor sir' exclaimed the widow 'oh don't tell me' said tom 'i know him' 'i am sure nobody who knows him knows anything bad of him' said the widow bridling up at the mysterious air with which tom had spoken 'hem' said tom smart the widow began to think it was high time to cry so she took out her handkerchief and inquired whether tom wished to insult her whether he thought it like a gentleman to take away the character of another gentleman behind his back why if he had got anything to say he didn't say it to the man like a man instead of terrifying a poor weak woman in that way and so forth 'i'll say it to him fast enough' said tom 'only i want you to hear it first' 'what is it' inquired the widow looking intently in tom's countenance 'i'll astonish you' said tom putting his hand in his pocket 'if it is that he wants money' said the widow 'i know that already and you needn't trouble yourself' 'pooh nonsense that's nothing' said tom smart 'i want money 'tan't that' 'oh dear what can it be' exclaimed the poor widow 'don't be frightened' said tom smart he slowly drew forth the letter and unfolded it 'you won't scream' said tom doubtfully 'no no' replied the widow 'let me see it' 'you won't go fainting away or any of that nonsense' said tom 'no no' returned the widow hastily 'and don't run out and blow him up' said tom 'because i'll do all that for you you had better not exert yourself' 'well well' said the widow 'let me see it' 'i will' replied tom smart and with these words he placed the letter in the widow's hand gentlemen i have heard my uncle say that tom smart said the widow's lamentations when she heard the disclosure would have pierced a heart of stone tom was certainly very tender hearted but they pierced his to the very core the widow rocked herself to and fro and wrung her hands 'oh the deception and villainy of man' said the widow 'frightful my dear ma'am but compose yourself' said tom smart 'oh i can't compose myself' shrieked the widow 'i shall never find any one else i can love so much' 'oh yes you will my dear soul' said tom smart letting fall a shower of the largest sized tears in pity for the widow's misfortunes tom smart in the energy of his compassion had put his arm round the widow's waist and the widow in a passion of grief had clasped tom's hand she looked up in tom's face and smiled through her tears tom looked down in hers and smiled through his i never could find out gentlemen whether tom did or did not kiss the widow at that particular moment he used to tell my uncle he didn't but i have my doubts about it between ourselves gentlemen i rather think he did at all events tom kicked the very tall man out at the front door half an hour after and married the widow a month after and he used to drive about the country with the clay coloured gig with red wheels and the vixenish mare with the fast pace till he gave up business many years afterwards and went to france with his wife and then the old house was pulled down will you allow me to ask you said the inquisitive old gentleman what became of the chair why replied the one eyed bagman it was observed to creak very much on the day of the wedding but tom smart couldn't say for certain whether it was with pleasure or bodily infirmity he rather thought it was the latter though for it never spoke afterwards illustration she looked up in tom's face and smiled through her tears everybody believed the story didn't they said the dirty faced man refilling his pipe except tom's enemies replied the bagman some of 'em said tom invented it altogether and others said he was drunk and fancied it and got hold of the wrong trousers by mistake before he went to bed but nobody ever minded what they said tom said it was all true every word and your uncle every letter they must have been very nice men both of 'em said the dirty faced man yes they were replied the bagman very nice men indeed chapter xv illustration in which is given a faithful portraiture of two distinguished persons and an accurate description of a public breakfast in their house and grounds which public breakfast leads to the recognition of an old acquaintance and the commencement of another chapter mr pickwick's conscience had been somewhat reproaching him for his recent neglect of his friends at the peacock and he was just on the point of walking forth in quest of them on the third morning after the election had terminated when his faithful valet put into his hand a card on which was engraved the following inscription mrs leo hunter the den eatanswill person's a waitin' said sam epigrammatically does the person want me sam inquired mr pickwick he wants you particklar and no one else'll do as the devil's private secretary said ven he fetched avay doctor faustus replied mr weller he is it a gentleman said mr pickwick a wery good imitation o' one if it an't replied mr weller but this is a lady's card said mr pickwick given me by a gen'lm'n hows'ever replied sam and he's a waitin' in the drawing room said he'd rather wait all day than not see you mr pickwick on hearing this determination descended to the drawing room where sat a grave man who started up on his entrance and said with an air of profound respect mr pickwick i presume the same allow me sir the honour of grasping your hand permit me sir to shake it said the grave man certainly said mr pickwick the stranger shook the extended hand and then continued we have heard of your fame sir the noise of your antiquarian discussion has reached the ears of mrs leo hunter my wife sir i am mr leo hunter the stranger paused as if he expected that mr pickwick would be overcome by the disclosure but seeing that he remained perfectly calm proceeded my wife sir mrs leo hunter is proud to number among her acquaintance all those who have rendered themselves celebrated by their works and talents permit me sir to place in a conspicuous part of the list the name of mr pickwick and his brother members of the club that derives its name from him i shall be extremely happy to make the acquaintance of such a lady sir replied mr pickwick you shall make it sir said the grave man to morrow morning sir we give a public breakfast a fte champtre to a great number of those who have rendered themselves celebrated by their works and talents permit mrs leo hunter sir to have the gratification of seeing you at the den with great pleasure replied mr pickwick mrs leo hunter has many of these breakfasts sir resumed the new acquaintance 'feasts of reason sir and flows of soul' as somebody who wrote a sonnet to mrs leo hunter on her breakfasts feelingly and originally observed was he celebrated for his works and talents inquired mr pickwick he was sir replied the grave man all mrs leo hunter's acquaintance are it is her ambition sir to have no other acquaintance it is a very noble ambition said mr pickwick when i inform mrs leo hunter that that remark fell from your lips sir she will indeed be proud said the grave man you have a gentleman in your train who has produced some beautiful little poems i think sir my friend mr snodgrass has a great taste for poetry replied mr pickwick so has mrs leo hunter sir she dotes on poetry sir she adores it i may say that her whole soul and mind are wound up and entwined with it she has produced some delightful pieces herself sir you may have met with her 'ode to an expiring frog' sir i don't think i have said mr pickwick you astonish me sir said mr leo hunter it created an immense sensation it was signed with an 'l' and eight stars and appeared originally in a lady's magazine it commenced 'can i view thee panting lying on thy stomach without sighing can i unmoved see thee dying on a log expiring frog' beautiful said mr pickwick fine said mr leo hunter so simple very said mr pickwick the next verse is still more touching shall i repeat it if you please said mr pickwick it runs thus said the grave man still more gravely 'say have fiends in shape of boys with wild halloo and brutal noise hunted thee from marshy joys with a dog expiring frog' finely expressed said mr pickwick all point sir said mr leo hunter but you shall hear mrs leo hunter repeat it she can do justice to it sir she will repeat it in character sir to morrow morning in character as minerva but i forgot it's a fancy dress breakfast dear me said mr pickwick glancing at his own figure i can't possibly can't sir can't exclaimed mr leo hunter solomon lucas the jew in the high street has thousands of fancy dresses consider sir how many appropriate characters are open for your selection plato zeno epicurus pythagoras all founders of clubs i know that said mr pickwick but as i cannot put myself in competition with those great men i cannot presume to wear their dresses the grave man considered deeply for a few seconds and then said on reflection sir i don't know whether it would not afford mrs leo hunter greater pleasure if her guests saw a gentleman of your celebrity in his own costume rather than in an assumed one i may venture to promise an exception in your case sir yes i am quite certain that on behalf of mrs leo hunter i may venture to do so in that case said mr pickwick i shall have great pleasure in coming but i waste your time sir said the grave man as if suddenly recollecting himself i know its value sir i will not detain you i may tell mrs leo hunter then that she may confidently expect you and your distinguished friends good morning sir i am proud to have beheld so eminent a personage not a step sir not a word and without giving mr pickwick time to offer remonstrance or denial mr leo hunter stalked gravely away mr pickwick took up his hat and repaired to the peacock but mr winkle had conveyed the intelligence of the fancy ball there before him mrs pott's going were the first words with which he saluted his leader is she said mr pickwick as apollo replied mr winkle only pott objects to the tunic he is right he is quite right said mr pickwick emphatically yes so she's going to wear a white satin gown with gold spangles they'll hardly know what she's meant for will they inquired mr snodgrass of course they will replied mr winkle indignantly they'll see her lyre won't they true i forgot that said mr snodgrass i shall go as a bandit interposed mr tupman what said mr pickwick with a sudden start as a bandit repeated mr tupman mildly you don't mean to say said mr pickwick gazing with solemn sternness at his friend you don't mean to say mr tupman that it is your intention to put yourself into a green velvet jacket with a two inch tail such is my intention sir replied mr tupman warmly and why not sir because sir said mr pickwick considerably excited because you are too old sir too old exclaimed mr tupman and if any further ground of objection be wanting continued mr pickwick you are too fat sir sir said mr tupman his face suffused with a crimson glow this is an insult sir replied mr pickwick in the same tone it is not half the insult to you that your appearance in my presence in a green velvet jacket with a two inch tail would be to me sir said mr tupman you're a fellow sir said mr pickwick you're another mr tupman advanced a step or two and glared at mr pickwick mr pickwick returned the glare concentrated into a focus by means of his spectacles and breathed a bold defiance mr snodgrass and mr winkle looked on petrified at beholding such a scene between two such men sir said mr tupman after a short pause speaking in a low deep voice you have called me old i have said mr pickwick and fat i reiterate the charge and a fellow so you are there was a fearful pause my attachment to your person sir said mr tupman speaking in a voice tremulous with emotion and tucking up his wristbands meanwhile is great very great but upon that person i must take summary vengeance come on sir replied mr pickwick stimulated by the exciting nature of the dialogue the heroic man actually threw himself into a paralytic attitude confidently supposed by the two by standers to have been intended as a posture of defence what exclaimed mr snodgrass suddenly recovering the power of speech of which intense astonishment had previously bereft him and rushing between the two at the imminent hazard of receiving an application on the temple from each what mr pickwick with the eyes of the world upon you mr tupman who in common with us all derives a lustre from his undying name for shame gentlemen for shame the unwonted lines which momentary passion had ruled in mr pickwick's clear and open brow gradually melted away as his young friend spoke like the marks of a black lead pencil beneath the softening influence of india rubber his countenance had resumed its usual benign expression ere he concluded i have been hasty said mr pickwick very hasty tupman your hand the dark shadow passed from mr tupman's face as he warmly grasped the hand of his friend i have been hasty too said he no no interrupted mr pickwick the fault was mine you will wear the green velvet jacket no no replied mr tupman to oblige me you will resumed mr pickwick very well i will said mr tupman it was accordingly settled that mr tupman mr winkle and mr snodgrass should all wear fancy dresses thus mr pickwick was led by the very warmth of his good feelings to give his consent to a proceeding from which his better judgment would have recoiled a more striking illustration of his amiable character could hardly have been conceived even if the events recorded in these pages had been wholly imaginary mr leo hunter had not exaggerated the resources of mr solomon lucas his wardrobe was extensive very extensive not strictly classical perhaps nor quite new nor did it contain any one garment made precisely after the fashion of any age or time but everything was more or less spangled and what can be prettier than spangles it may be objected that they are not adapted to the daylight but everybody knows that they would glitter if there were lamps and nothing can be clearer than that if people give fancy balls in the day time and the dresses do not show quite as well as they would by night the fault lies solely with the people who give the fancy balls and is in no wise chargeable on the spangles such was the convincing reasoning of mr solomon lucas and influenced by such arguments did mr tupman mr winkle and mr snodgrass engage to array themselves in costumes which his taste and experience induced him to recommend as admirably suited to the occasion a carriage was hired from the town arms for the accommodation of the pickwickians and a chariot was ordered from the same repository for the purpose of conveying mr and mrs pott to mrs leo hunter's grounds which mr pott as a delicate acknowledgment of having received an invitation had already confidently predicted in the eatanswill gazette would present a scene of varied and delicious enchantment a bewildering coruscation of beauty and talent a lavish and prodigal display of hospitality above all a degree of splendour softened by the most exquisite taste and adornment refined with perfect harmony and the chastest good keeping compared with which the fabled gorgeousness of eastern fairy land itself would appear to be clothed in as many dark and murky colours as must be the mind of the splenetic and unmanly being who could presume to taint with the venom of his envy the preparations making by the virtuous and highly distinguished lady at whose shrine this humble tribute of admiration was offered this last was a piece of biting sarcasm against the independent who in consequence of not having been invited at all had been through four numbers affecting to sneer at the whole affair in his very largest type with all the adjectives in capital letters the morning came it was a pleasant sight to behold mr tupman in full brigand's costume with a very tight jacket sitting like a pincushion over his back and shoulders the upper portion of his legs encased in the velvet shorts and the lower part thereof swathed in the complicated bandages to which all brigands are peculiarly attached it was pleasing to see his open and ingenuous countenance well mustachioed and corked looking out from an open shirt collar and to contemplate the sugar loaf hat decorated with ribbons of all colours which he was compelled to carry on his knee inasmuch as no known conveyance with a top to it would admit of any man's carrying it between his head and the roof equally humorous and agreeable was the appearance of mr snodgrass in blue satin trunks and cloak white silk tights and shoes and grecian helmet which everybody knows and if they do not mr solomon lucas did to have been the regular authentic every day costume of a troubadour from the earliest ages down to the time of their final disappearance from the face of the earth all this was pleasant but this was nothing compared with the shouting of the populace when the carriage drew up behind mr pott's chariot which chariot itself drew up at mr pott's door which door itself opened and displayed the great pott accoutred as a russian officer of justice with a tremendous knout in his hand tastefully typical of the stern and mighty power of the eatanswill gazette and the fearful lashings it bestowed on public offenders bravo shouted mr tupman and mr snodgrass from the passage when they beheld the walking allegory hoo roar pott shouted the populace amid these salutations mr pott smiling with that kind of bland dignity which sufficiently testified that he felt his power and knew how to exert it got into the chariot then there emerged from the house mrs pott who would have looked very like apollo if she hadn't had a gown on conducted by mr winkle who in his light red coat could not possibly have been mistaken for anything but a sportsman if he had not borne an equal resemblance to a general postman last of all came mr pickwick whom the boys applauded as loud as anybody probably under the impression that his tights and gaiters were some remnants of the dark ages and then the two vehicles proceeded towards mrs leo hunter's mr weller who was to assist in waiting being stationed on the box of that in which his master was seated illustration mr pickwick with the brigand on one arm and the troubadour on the other every one of the men women boys girls and babies who were assembled to see the visitors in their fancy dresses screamed with delight and ecstasy when mr pickwick with the brigand on one arm and the troubadour on the other walked solemnly up the entrance never were such shouts heard as those which greeted mr tupman's efforts to fix the sugar loaf hat on his head by way of entering the garden in style the preparations were on the most delightful scale fully realising the prophetic pott's anticipations about the gorgeousness of eastern fairyland and at once affording a sufficient contradiction to the malignant statements of the reptile independent the grounds were more than an acre and a quarter in extent and they were filled with people never was such a blaze of beauty and fashion and literature there was the young lady who did the poetry in the eatanswill gazette in the garb of a sultana leaning upon the arm of the young gentleman who did the review department and who was appropriately habited in a field marshal's uniform the boots excepted there were hosts of these geniuses and any reasonable person would have thought it honour enough to meet them but more than these there were half a dozen lions from london authors real authors who had written whole books and printed them afterwards and here you might see 'em walking about like ordinary men smiling and talking aye and talking pretty considerable nonsense too no doubt with the benign intention of rendering themselves intelligible to the common people about them moreover there was a band of music in pasteboard caps four something ean singers in the costume of their country and a dozen hired waiters in the costume of their country and very dirty costume too and above all there was mrs leo hunter in the character of minerva receiving the company and overflowing with pride and gratification at the notion of having called such distinguished individuals together mr pickwick ma'am said a servant as that gentleman approached the presiding goddess with his hat in his hand and the brigand and troubadour on either arm what where exclaimed mrs leo hunter starting up in an affected rapture of surprise here said mr pickwick is it possible that i have really the gratification of beholding mr pickwick himself ejaculated mrs leo hunter no other ma'am replied mr pickwick bowing very low permit me to introduce my friends mr tupman mr winkle mr snodgrass to the authoress of 'the expiring frog' very few people but those who have tried it know what a difficult process it is to bow in green velvet smalls and a tight jacket and high crowned hat or in blue satin trunks and white silks or knee cords and top boots that were never made for the wearer and have been fixed upon him without the remotest reference to the comparative dimensions of himself and the suit never were such distortions as mr tupman's frame underwent in his efforts to appear easy and graceful never was such ingenious posturing as his fancy dressed friends exhibited mr pickwick said mrs leo hunter i must make you promise not to stir from my side the whole day there are hundreds of people here that i must positively introduce you to you are very kind ma'am said mr pickwick in the first place here are my little girls i had almost forgotten them said minerva carelessly pointing towards a couple of full grown young ladies of whom one might be about twenty and the other a year or two older and who were dressed in very juvenile costumes whether to make them look young or their mamma younger mr pickwick does not distinctly inform us they are very beautiful said mr pickwick as the juveniles turned away after being presented they are very like their mamma sir said mr pott majestically oh you naughty man exclaimed mrs leo hunter playfully tapping the editor's arm with her fan minerva with a fan why now my dear mrs hunter said mr pott who was trumpeter in ordinary at the den you know that when your picture was in the exhibition at the royal academy last year everybody inquired whether it was intended for you or your youngest daughter for you were so much alike that there was no telling the difference between you well and if they did why need you repeat it before strangers said mrs leo hunter bestowing another tap on the slumbering lion of the eatanswill gazette count count screamed mrs leo hunter to a well whiskered individual in a foreign uniform who was passing by ah you want me said the count turning back i want to introduce two very clever people to each other said mrs leo hunter mr pickwick i have great pleasure in introducing you to count smorltork she added in a hurried whisper to mr pickwick the famous foreigner gathering materials for his great work on england hem count smorltork mr pickwick mr pickwick saluted the count with all the reverence due to so great a man and the count drew forth a set of tablets what you say mrs hunt inquired the count smiling graciously on the gratified mrs leo hunter pig vig or big vig what you call lawyer eh i see that is it big vig and the count was proceeding to enter mr pickwick in his tablets as a gentleman of the long robe who derived his name from the profession to which he belonged when mrs leo hunter interposed no no count said the lady pick wick ah ah i see replied the count peek christian name weeks surname good ver good peek weeks how you do weeks quite well i thank you replied mr pickwick with all his usual affability have you been long in england long ver long time fortnight more do you stay here long one week you will have enough to do said mr pickwick smiling to gather all the materials you want in that time eh they are gathered said the count indeed said mr pickwick they are here added the count tapping his forehead significantly large book at home full of notes music picture science potry poltic all tings the word politics sir said mr pickwick comprises in itself a difficult study of no inconsiderable magnitude ah said the count drawing out the tablets again ver good fine words to begin a chapter chapter forty seven poltics the word poltic surprises by himself and down went mr pickwick's remark in count smorltork's tablets with such variations and additions as the count's exuberant fancy suggested or his imperfect knowledge of the language occasioned count said mrs leo hunter mrs hunt replied the count this is mr snodgrass a friend of mr pickwick's and a poet stop exclaimed the count bringing out the tablets once more head potry chapter literary friends name snowgrass ver good introduced to snowgrass great poet friend of peek weeks by mrs hunt which wrote other sweet poem what is that name frog perspiring fog ver good ver good indeed and the count put up his tablets and with sundry bows and acknowledgments walked away thoroughly satisfied that he had made the most important and valuable additions to his stock of information wonderful man count smorltork said mrs leo hunter sound philosopher said mr pott clear headed strong minded person added mr snodgrass a chorus of bystanders took up the shout of count smorltork's praise shook their heads sagely and unanimously cried very as the enthusiasm in count smorltork's favour ran very high his praises might have been sung until the end of the festivities if the four something ean singers had not ranged themselves in front of a small apple tree to look picturesque and commenced singing their national songs which appeared by no means difficult of execution inasmuch as the grand secret seemed to be that three of the something ean singers should grunt while the fourth howled this interesting performance having concluded amidst the loud plaudits of the whole company a boy forthwith proceeded to entangle himself with the rails of a chair and to jump over it and crawl under it and fall down with it and do everything but sit upon it and then to make a cravat of his legs and tie them round his neck and then to illustrate the ease with which a human being can be made to look like a magnified toad all which feats yielded high delight and satisfaction to the assembled spectators after which the voice of mrs pott was heard to chirp faintly forth something which courtesy interpreted into a song which was all very classical and strictly in character because apollo was himself a composer and composers can very seldom sing their own music or anybody else's either this was succeeded by mrs leo hunter's recitation of her far famed ode to an expiring frog which was encored once and would have been encored twice if the major part of the guests who thought it was high time to get something to eat had not said that it was perfectly shameful to take advantage of mrs hunter's good nature so although mrs leo hunter professed her perfect willingness to recite the ode again her kind and considerate friends wouldn't hear of it on any account and the refreshment room being thrown open all the people who had ever been there before scrambled in with all possible despatch mrs leo hunter's usual course of proceeding being to issue cards for a hundred and breakfast for fifty or in other words to feed only the very particular lions and let the smaller animals take care of themselves where is mr pott said mrs leo hunter as she placed the aforesaid lions around her here i am said the editor from the remotest end of the room far beyond all hope of food unless something was done for him by the hostess won't you come up here oh pray don't mind him said mrs pott in the most obliging voice you give yourself a great deal of unnecessary trouble mrs hunter you'll do very well there won't you dear certainly love replied the unhappy pott with a grim smile alas for the knout the nervous arm that wielded it with such gigantic force on public characters was paralysed beneath the glance of the imperious mrs pott mrs leo hunter looked round her in triumph count smorltork was busily engaged in taking notes of the contents of the dishes mr tupman was doing the honours of the lobster salad to several lionesses with a degree of grace which no brigand ever exhibited before mr snodgrass having cut out the young gentleman who cut up the books for the eatanswill gazette was engaged in an impassioned argument with the young lady who did the poetry and mr pickwick was making himself universally agreeable nothing seemed wanting to render the select circle complete when mr leo hunter whose department on these occasions was to stand about in doorways and talk to the less important people suddenly called out my dear here's mr charles fitz marshall oh dear said mrs leo hunter how anxiously i have been expecting him pray make room to let mr fitz marshall pass tell mr fitz marshall my dear to come up to me directly to be scolded for coming so late coming my dear ma'am cried a voice as quick as i can crowds of people full room hard work very mr pickwick's knife and fork fell from his hand he stared across the table at mr tupman who had dropped his knife and fork and was looking as if he were about to sink into the ground without further notice ah cried the voice as its owner pushed his way among the last five and twenty turks officers cavaliers and charles the seconds that remained between him and the table regular mangle baker's patent not a crease in my coat after all this squeezing might have 'got up my linen' as i came along ha ha not a bad idea that queer thing to have it mangled when it's upon one though trying process very with these broken words a young man dressed as a naval officer made his way up to the table and presented to the astonished pickwickians the identical form and features of mr alfred jingle the offender had barely time to take mrs leo hunter's proffered hand when his eyes encountered the indignant orbs of mr pickwick hallo said jingle quite forgot no directions to postilion give 'em at once back in a minute the servant or mr hunter will do it in a moment mr fitz marshall said mrs leo hunter no no i'll do it shan't be long back in no time replied jingle with these words he disappeared among the crowd will you allow me to ask you ma'am said the excited mr pickwick rising from his seat who that young man is and where he resides he is a gentleman of fortune mr pickwick said mrs leo hunter to whom i very much want to introduce you the count will be delighted with him yes yes said mr pickwick hastily his residence is at present at the angel at bury at bury at bury st edmunds not many miles from here but dear me mr pickwick you are not going to leave us surely mr pickwick you cannot think of going so soon but long before mrs leo hunter had finished speaking mr pickwick had plunged through the throng and reached the garden whither he was shortly afterwards joined by mr tupman who had followed his friend closely it's of no use said mr tupman he has gone i know it said mr pickwick and i will follow him follow him where inquired mr tupman to the angel at bury replied mr pickwick speaking very quickly how do we know whom he is deceiving there he deceived a worthy man once and we were the innocent cause he shall not do it again if i can help it i'll expose him where's my servant here you are sir said mr weller emerging from a sequestered spot where he had been engaged in discussing a bottle of madeira which he had abstracted from the breakfast table an hour or two before here's your servant sir proud o' the title as the living skellinton said ven they show'd him follow me instantly said mr pickwick tupman if i stay at bury you can join me there when i write till then good bye remonstrances were useless mr pickwick was roused and his mind was made up mr tupman returned to his companions and in another hour had drowned all present recollection of mr alfred jingle or mr charles fitz marshall in an exhilarating quadrille and a bottle of champagne by that time mr pickwick and sam weller perched on the outside of a stage coach were every succeeding minute placing a less and less distance between themselves and the good old town of bury st edmunds chapter xvi illustration too full of adventure to be briefly described there is no month in the whole year in which nature wears a more beautiful appearance than in the month of august spring has many beauties and may is a fresh and blooming month but the charms of this time of the year are enhanced by their contrast with the winter season august has no such advantage it comes when we remember nothing but clear skies green fields and sweet smelling flowers when the recollection of snow and ice and bleak winds has faded from our minds as completely as they have disappeared from the earth and yet what a pleasant time it is orchards and corn fields ring with the hum of labour trees bend beneath the thick clusters of rich fruit which bow their branches to the ground and the corn piled in graceful sheaves or waving in every light breath that sweeps above it as if it wooed the sickle tinges the landscape with a golden hue a mellow softness appears to hang over the whole earth the influence of the season seems to extend itself to the very waggon whose slow motion across the well reaped field is perceptible only to the eye but strikes with no harsh sound upon the ear as the coach rolls swiftly past the fields and orchards which skirt the road groups of women and children piling the fruit in sieves or gathering the scattered ears of corn pause for an instant from their labour and shading the sun burnt face with a still browner hand gaze upon the passengers with curious eyes while some stout urchin too small to work but too mischievous to be left at home scrambles over the side of the basket in which he has been deposited for security and kicks and screams with delight the reaper stops in his work and stands with folded arms looking at the vehicle as it whirls past and the rough cart horses bestow a sleepy glance upon the smart coach team which says as plainly as a horse's glance can it's all very fine to look at but slow going over a heavy field is better than warm work like that upon a dusty road after all you cast a look behind you as you turn a corner of the road the women and children have resumed their labour the reaper once more stoops to his work the cart horses have moved on and all are again in motion the influence of a scene like this was not lost upon the well regulated mind of mr pickwick intent upon the resolution he had formed of exposing the real character of the nefarious jingle in any quarter in which he might be pursuing his fraudulent designs he sat at first taciturn and contemplative brooding over the means by which his purpose could be best attained by degrees his attention grew more and more attracted by the objects around him and at last he derived as much enjoyment from the ride as if it had been undertaken for the pleasantest reason in the world delightful prospect sam said mr pickwick beats the chimbley pots sir replied mr weller touching his hat i suppose you have hardly seen anything but chimney pots and bricks and mortar all your life sam said mr pickwick smiling i worn't always a boots sir said mr weller with a shake of the head i wos a vagginer's boy once when was that inquired mr pickwick when i wos first pitched neck and crop into the world to play at leap frog with its troubles replied sam i wos a carrier's boy at startin' then a vagginer's then a helper then a boots now i'm a gen'l'm'n's servant i shall be a gen'l'm'n myself one of these days perhaps with a pipe in my mouth and a summer house in the back garden who knows i shouldn't be surprised for one you are quite a philosopher sam said mr pickwick it runs in the family i b'lieve sir replied mr weller my father's wery much in that line now if my mother in law blows him up he whistles she flies in a passion and breaks his pipe he steps out and gets another then she screams wery loud and falls into 'sterics and he smokes very comfortably 'till she comes to agin that's philosophy sir an't it a very good substitute for it at all events replied mr pickwick laughing it must have been of great service to you in the course of your rambling life sam service sir exclaimed sam you may say that arter i run away from the carrier and afore i took up with the vagginer i had unfurnished lodgings for a fortnight unfurnished lodgings said mr pickwick yes the dry arches of waterloo bridge fine sleeping place within ten minutes' walk of all the public offices only if there is any objection to it it is that the sitivation's rayther too airy i see some queer sights there ah i suppose you did said mr pickwick with an air of considerable interest sights sir resumed mr weller as 'ud penetrate your benevolent heart and come out on the other side you don't see the reg'lar wagrants there trust 'em they knows better than that young beggars male and female as hasn't made a rise in their profession takes up their quarters there sometimes but it's generally the worn out starving houseless creeturs as rolls themselves in the dark corners o' them lonesome places poor creeturs as ain't up to the twopenny rope and pray sam what is the twopenny rope inquired mr pickwick the twopenny rope sir replied mr weller is just a cheap lodgin' house where the beds is twopence a night what do they call a bed a rope for said mr pickwick bless your innocence sir that an't it replied sam wen the lady and gen'l'm'n as keeps the hot el first begun business they used to make the beds on the floor but this wouldn't do at no price 'cos instead o' taking a moderate two penn'orth o' sleep the lodgers used to lie there half the day so now they has two ropes 'bout six foot apart and three from the floor which goes right down the room and the beds are made of slips of coarse sacking stretched across 'em well said mr pickwick well said mr weller the adwantage o' the plan's hobvious at six o'clock every mornin' they lets go the ropes at one end and down falls all the lodgers 'consequence is that being thoroughly waked they get up wery quietly and walk away beg your pardon sir said sam suddenly breaking off in his loquacious discourse is this bury st edmunds it is replied mr pickwick the coach rattled through the well paved streets of a handsome little town of thriving and cleanly appearance and stopped before a large inn situated in a wide open street nearly facing the old abbey and this said mr pickwick looking up is the angel we alight here sam but some caution is necessary order a private room and do not mention my name you understand right as a trivet sir replied mr weller with a wink of intelligence and having dragged mr pickwick's portmanteau from the hind boot into which it had been hastily thrown when they joined the coach at eatanswill mr weller disappeared on his errand a private room was speedily engaged and into it mr pickwick was ushered without delay now sam said mr pickwick the first thing to be done is to order dinner sir interposed mr weller it's very late sir ah so it is said mr pickwick looking at his watch you are right sam and if i might adwise sir added mr weller i'd just have a good night's rest arterwards and not begin inquiring arter this here deep 'un 'till the mornin' there's nothin' so refreshin' as sleep sir as the servant girl said afore she drank the egg cupful o' laudanum i think you are right sam said mr pickwick but i must first ascertain that he is in the house and not likely to go away leave that to me sir said sam let me order you a snug little dinner and make my inquiries below while it's a getting ready i could worm ev'ry secret out o' the boots's heart in five minutes sir do so said mr pickwick and mr weller at once retired in half an hour mr pickwick was seated at a very satisfactory dinner and in three quarters mr weller returned with the intelligence that mr charles fitz marshall had ordered his private room to be retained for him until further notice he was going to spend the evening at some private house in the neighbourhood had ordered the boots to sit up until his return and had taken his servant with him now sir argued mr weller when he had concluded his report if i can get a talk with this here servant in the mornin' he'll tell me all his master's concerns how do you know that interposed mr pickwick bless your heart sir servants always do replied mr weller oh ah i forgot that said mr pickwick well then you can arrange what's best to be done sir and we can act according as it appeared that this was the best arrangement that could be made it was finally agreed upon mr weller by his master's permission retired to spend the evening in his own way and was shortly afterwards elected by the unanimous voice of the assembled company into the tap room chair in which honourable post he acquitted himself so much to the satisfaction of the gentlemen frequenters that their roars of laughter and approbation penetrated to mr pickwick's bed room and shortened the term of his natural rest by at least three hours early on the ensuing morning mr weller was dispelling all the feverish remains of the previous evening's conviviality through the instrumentality of a halfpenny shower bath having induced a young gentleman attached to the stable department by the offer of that coin to pump over his head and face until he was perfectly restored when he was attracted by the appearance of a young fellow in mulberry coloured livery who was sitting on a bench in the yard reading what appeared to be a hymn book with an air of deep abstraction but who occasionally stole a glance at the individual under the pump as if he took some interest in his proceedings nevertheless you're a rum 'un to look at you are thought mr weller the first time his eyes encountered the glance of the stranger in the mulberry suit who had a large sallow ugly face very sunken eyes and a gigantic head from which depended a quantity of lank black hair you're a rum 'un thought mr weller and thinking this he went on washing himself and thought no more about him still the man kept glancing from his hymn book to sam and from sam to his hymn book as if he wanted to open a conversation so at last sam by way of giving him an opportunity said with a familiar nod how are you governor i am happy to say i am pretty well sir said the man speaking with great deliberation and closing the book i hope you are the same sir why if i felt less like a walking brandy bottle i shouldn't be quite so staggery this mornin' replied sam are you stoppin' in this house old 'un the mulberry man replied in the affirmative how was it you worn't one of us last night inquired sam scrubbing his face with the towel you seem one of the jolly sort looks as conwivial as a live trout in a lime basket added mr weller in an under tone i was out last night with my master replied the stranger what's his name inquired mr weller colouring up very red with sudden excitement and the friction of the towel combined fitz marshall said the mulberry man give us your hand said mr weller advancing i should like to know you i like your appearance old fellow well that is very strange said the mulberry man with great simplicity of manner i like yours so much that i wanted to speak to you from the very first moment i saw you under the pump did you though upon my word now isn't that curious illustration looks as conwivial as a live trout in a lime basket wery sing'ler said sam inwardly congratulating himself upon the softness of the stranger what's your name my patriarch job and a wery good name it is only one i know that an't got a nickname to it what's the other name trotter said the stranger what is yours sam bore in mind his master's caution and replied my name's walker my master's name's wilkins will you take a drop o' somethin' this mornin' mr trotter mr trotter acquiesced in this agreeable proposal and having deposited his book in his coat pocket accompanied mr weller to the tap where they were soon occupied in discussing an exhilarating compound formed by mixing together in a pewter vessel certain quantities of british hollands and the fragrant essence of the clove and what sort of a place have you got inquired sam as he filled his companion's glass for the second time bad said job smacking his lips very bad you don't mean that said sam i do indeed worse than that my master's going to be married no yes and worse than that too he's going to run away with an immense rich heiress from boarding school what a dragon said sam refilling his companion's glass it's some boarding school in this town i suppose an't it now although this question was put in the most careless tone imaginable mr job trotter plainly showed by gestures that he perceived his new friend's anxiety to draw forth an answer to it he emptied his glass looked mysteriously at his companion winked both of his small eyes one after the other and finally made a motion with his arm as if he were working an imaginary pump handle thereby intimating that he mr trotter considered himself as undergoing the process of being pumped by mr samuel weller no no said mr trotter in conclusion that's not to be told to everybody that is a secret a great secret mr walker as the mulberry man said this he turned his glass upside down as a means of reminding his companion that he had nothing left wherewith to slake his thirst sam observed the hint and feeling the delicate manner in which it was conveyed ordered the pewter vessel to be refilled whereat the small eyes of the mulberry man glistened and so it's a secret said sam i should rather suspect it was said the mulberry man sipping his liquor with a complacent face i suppose your mas'r's wery rich said sam mr trotter smiled and holding his glass in his left hand gave four distinct slaps on the pocket of his mulberry indescribables with his right as if to intimate that his master might have done the same without alarming anybody much by the chinking of coin ah said sam that's the game is it the mulberry man nodded significantly well and don't you think old feller remonstrated mr weller that if you let your master take in this here young lady you're a precious rascal i know that said job trotter turning upon his companion a countenance of deep contrition and groaning slightly i know that and that's what it is that preys upon my mind but what am i to do do said sam di wulge to the missis and give up your master who'd believe me replied job trotter the young lady's considered the very picture of innocence and discretion she'd deny it and so would my master who'd believe me i should lose my place and get indicted for a conspiracy or some such thing that's all i should take by my motion there's somethin' in that said sam ruminating there's somethin' in that if i knew any respectable gentleman who would take the matter up continued mr trotter i might have some hope of preventing the elopement but there's the same difficulty mr walker just the same i know no gentleman in this strange place and ten to one if i did whether he would believe my story come this way said sam suddenly jumping up and grasping the mulberry man by the arm my mas'r's the man you want i see and after a slight resistance on the part of job trotter sam led his newly found friend to the apartment of mr pickwick to whom he presented him together with a brief summary of the dialogue we have just repeated i am very sorry to betray my master sir said job trotter applying to his eyes a pink checked pocket handkerchief about six inches square the feeling does you a great deal of honour replied mr pickwick but it is your duty nevertheless i know it is my duty sir replied job with great emotion we should all try to discharge our duty sir and i humbly endeavour to discharge mine sir but it is a hard trial to betray a master sir whose clothes you wear and whose bread you eat even though he is a scoundrel sir you are a very good fellow said mr pickwick much affected an honest fellow come come interposed sam who had witnessed mr trotter's tears with considerable impatience blow this here water cart bis'ness it won't do no good this won't sam said mr pickwick reproachfully i am sorry to find that you have so little respect for this young man's feelings his feelin's is all wery well sir replied mr weller and as they're so wery fine and it's a pity he should lose 'em i think he'd better keep 'em in his own buzzum than let 'em ewaporate in hot water 'specially as they do no good tears never yet wound up a clock or worked a steam ingen' the next time you go out to a smoking party young fellow fill your pipe with that 'ere reflection and for the present just put that bit of pink gingham into your pocket 'tain't so handsome that you need keep waving it about as if you was a tight rope dancer my man is in the right said mr pickwick accosting job although his mode of expressing his opinion is somewhat homely and occasionally incomprehensible he is sir very right said mr trotter and i will give way no longer very well said mr pickwick now where is this boarding school it is a large old red brick house just outside the town sir replied job trotter and when said mr pickwick when is this villainous design to be carried into execution when is this elopement to take place to night sir replied job to night exclaimed mr pickwick this very night sir replied job trotter that is what alarms me so much instant measures must be taken said mr pickwick i will see the lady who keeps the establishment immediately i beg your pardon sir said job but that course of proceeding will never do why not inquired mr pickwick my master sir is a very artful man i know he is said mr pickwick and he has so wound himself round the old lady's heart sir resumed job that she would believe nothing to his prejudice if you went down on your bare knees and swore it especially as you have no proof but the word of a servant who for anything she knows and my master would be sure to say so was discharged for some fault and does this in revenge what had better be done then said mr pickwick nothing but taking him in the very fact of eloping will convince the old lady sir replied job all them old cats will run their heads agin mile stones observed mr weller in a parenthesis but this taking him in the very act of elopement would be a very difficult thing to accomplish i fear said mr pickwick i don't know sir said mr trotter after a few moments' reflection i think it might be very easily done how was mr pickwick's inquiry why replied mr trotter my master and i being in the confidence of the two servants will be secreted in the kitchen at ten o'clock when the family have retired to rest we shall come out of the kitchen and the young lady out of her bedroom a post chaise will be waiting and away we go well said mr pickwick well sir i have been thinking that if you were in waiting in the garden behind alone alone said mr pickwick why alone i thought it very natural replied job that the old lady wouldn't like such an unpleasant discovery to be made before more persons than can possibly be helped the young lady too sir consider her feelings you are very right said mr pickwick the consideration evinces your delicacy of feeling go on you are very right well sir i have been thinking that if you were waiting in the back garden alone and i was to let you in at the door which opens into it from the end of the passage at exactly half past eleven o'clock you would be just in the very moment of time to assist me in frustrating the designs of this bad man by whom i have been unfortunately ensnared here mr trotter sighed deeply don't distress yourself on that account said mr pickwick if he had one grain of the delicacy of feeling which distinguishes you humble as your station is i should have some hopes of him job trotter bowed low and in spite of mr weller's previous remonstrance the tears again rose to his eyes i never see such a feller said sam blessed if i don't think he's got a main in his head as is always turned on sam said mr pickwick with great severity hold your tongue wery well sir replied mr weller i don't like this plan said mr pickwick after deep meditation why cannot i communicate with the young lady's friends because they live one hundred miles from here sir responded job trotter that's a clincher said mr weller aside then this garden resumed mr pickwick how am i to get into it the wall is very low sir and your servant will give you a leg up my servant will give me a leg up repeated mr pickwick mechanically you will be sure to be near this door that you speak of you cannot mistake it sir it's the only one that opens into the garden tap at it when you hear the clock strike and i will open it instantly i don't like the plan said mr pickwick but as i see no other and as the happiness of this young lady's whole life is at stake i adopt it i shall be sure to be there thus for the second time did mr pickwick's innate good feeling involve him in an enterprise from which he would most willingly have stood aloof what is the name of the house inquired mr pickwick westgate house sir you turn a little to the right when you get to the end of the town it stands by itself some little distance off the high road with the name on a brass plate on the gate i know it said mr pickwick i observed it once before when i was in this town you may depend upon me mr trotter made another bow and turned to depart when mr pickwick thrust a guinea into his hand you're a fine fellow said mr pickwick and i admire your goodness of heart no thanks remember eleven o'clock there is no fear of my forgetting it sir replied job trotter with these words he left the room followed by sam i say said the latter not a bad notion that 'ere crying i'd cry like a rainwater spout in a shower on such good terms how do you do it it comes from the heart mr walker replied job solemnly good morning sir you're a soft customer you are we've got it all out o' you anyhow thought mr weller as job walked away we cannot state the precise nature of the thoughts which passed through mr trotter's mind because we don't know what they were the day wore on evening came and a little before ten o'clock sam weller reported that mr jingle and job had gone out together that their luggage was packed up and that they had ordered a chaise the plot was evidently in execution as mr trotter had foretold half past ten o'clock arrived and it was time for mr pickwick to issue forth on his delicate errand resisting sam's tender of his great coat in order that he might have no incumbrance in scaling the wall he set forth followed by his attendant there was a bright moon but it was behind the clouds it was a fine dry night but it was most uncommonly dark paths hedges fields houses and trees were enveloped in one deep shade the atmosphere was hot and sultry the summer lightning quivered faintly on the verge of the horizon and was the only sight that varied the dull gloom in which everything was wrapped sound there was none except the distant barking of some restless house dog they found the house read the brass plate walked round the wall and stopped at that portion of it which divided them from the bottom of the garden you will return to the inn sam when you have assisted me over said mr pickwick wery well sir and you will sit up till i return cert'nly sir take hold of my leg and when i say 'over' raise me gently all right sir having settled these preliminaries mr pickwick grasped the top of the wall and gave the word over which was very literally obeyed whether his body partook in some degree of the elasticity of his mind or whether mr weller's notions of a gentle push were of a somewhat rougher description than mr pickwick's the immediate effect of his assistance was to jerk that immortal gentleman completely over the wall on to the bed beneath where after crushing three gooseberry bushes and a rose tree he finally alighted at full length you ha'n't hurt yourself i hope sir said sam in a loud whisper as soon as he recovered from the surprise consequent upon the mysterious disappearance of his master i have not hurt myself sam certainly replied mr pickwick from the other side of the wall but i rather think that you have hurt me i hope not sir said sam never mind said mr pickwick rising it's nothing but a few scratches go away or we shall be overheard good bye sir good bye with stealthy step sam weller departed leaving mr pickwick alone in the garden lights occasionally appeared in the different windows of the house or glanced from the staircases as if the inmates were retiring to rest not caring to go too near the door until the appointed time mr pickwick crouched into an angle of the wall and awaited its arrival it was a situation which might well have depressed the spirits of many a man mr pickwick however felt neither depression nor misgiving he knew that his purpose was in the main a good one and he placed implicit reliance on the high minded job it was dull certainly not to say dreary but a contemplative man can always employ himself in meditation mr pickwick had meditated himself into a doze when he was roused by the chimes of the neighbouring church ringing out the hour half past eleven that is the time thought mr pickwick getting cautiously on his feet he looked up at the house the lights had disappeared and the shutters were closed all in bed no doubt he walked on tip toe to the door and gave a gentle tap two or three minutes passing without any reply he gave another tap rather louder and then another rather louder than that at length the sound of feet was audible upon the stairs and then the light of a candle shone through the key hole of the door there was a good deal of unchaining and unbolting and the door was slowly opened now the door opened outwards and as the door opened wider and wider mr pickwick receded behind it more and more what was his astonishment when he just peeped out by way of caution to see that the person who had opened it was not job trotter but a servant girl with a candle in her hand mr pickwick drew in his head again with the swiftness displayed by that admirable melodramatic performer punch when he lies in wait for the flat headed comedian with the tin box of music it must have been the cat sarah said the girl addressing herself to some one in the house puss puss puss tit tit tit but no animal being decoyed by these blandishments the girl slowly closed the door and re fastened it leaving mr pickwick drawn up straight against the wall this is very curious thought mr pickwick they are sitting up beyond their usual hour i suppose extremely unfortunate that they should have chosen this night of all others for such a purpose exceedingly and with these thoughts mr pickwick cautiously retired to the angle of the wall in which he had been before ensconced waiting until such time as he might deem it safe to repeat the signal he had not been here five minutes when a vivid flash of lightning was followed by a loud peal of thunder that crashed and rolled away in the distance with a terrific noise then came another flash of lightning brighter than the other and a second peal of thunder louder than the first and then down came the rain with a force and fury that swept everything before it mr pickwick was perfectly aware that a tree is a very dangerous neighbour in a thunderstorm he had a tree on his right a tree on his left a third before him and a fourth behind if he remained where he was he might fall the victim of an accident if he showed himself in the centre of the garden he might be consigned to a constable once or twice he tried to scale the wall but having no other legs this time than those with which nature had furnished him the only effect of his struggles was to inflict a variety of very unpleasant gratings on his knees and shins and to throw him into a state of the most profuse perspiration what a dreadful situation said mr pickwick pausing to wipe his brow after this exercise he looked up at the house all was dark they must be gone to bed now he would try the signal again he walked on tip toe across the moist gravel and tapped at the door he held his breath and listened at the key hole no reply very odd another knock he listened again there was a low whispering inside and then a voice cried who's there that's not job thought mr pickwick hastily drawing himself straight up against the wall again it's a woman he had scarcely had time to form this conclusion when a window above stairs was thrown up and three or four female voices repeated the query who's there illustration who's there screamed a numerous chorus of treble voices mr pickwick dared not move hand or foot it was clear that the whole establishment was roused he made up his mind to remain where he was until the alarm had subsided and then by a supernatural effort to get over the wall or perish in the attempt like all mr pickwick's determinations this was the best that could be made under the circumstances but unfortunately it was founded upon the assumption that they would not venture to open the door again what was his discomfiture when he heard the chain and bolts withdrawn and saw the door slowly opening wider and wider he retreated into the corner step by step but do what he would the interposition of his own person prevented its being opened to its utmost width who's there screamed a numerous chorus of treble voices from the staircase inside consisting of the spinster lady of the establishment three teachers five female servants and thirty boarders all half dressed and in a forest of curl papers of course mr pickwick didn't say who was there and then the burden of the chorus changed into lor' i am so frightened cook said the lady abbess who took care to be on the top stair the very last of the group cook why don't you go a little way into the garden please ma'am i don't like responded the cook lor' what a stupid thing that cook is said the thirty boarders cook said the lady abbess with great dignity don't answer me if you please i insist upon your looking into the garden immediately here the cook began to cry and the housemaid said it was a shame for which partisanship she received a month's warning on the spot do you hear cook said the lady abbess stamping her foot impatiently don't you hear your missis cook said the three teachers what an impudent thing that cook is said the thirty boarders the unfortunate cook thus strongly urged advanced a step or two and holding her candle just where it prevented her from seeing anything at all declared there was nothing there and it must have been the wind the door was just going to be closed in consequence when an inquisitive boarder who had been peeping between the hinges set up a fearful screaming which called back the cook and the housemaid and all the more adventurous in no time what is the matter with miss smithers said the lady abbess as the aforesaid miss smithers proceeded to go into hysterics of four young lady power lor' miss smithers dear said the other nine and twenty boarders oh the man the man behind the door screamed miss smithers the lady abbess no sooner heard this appalling cry than she retreated to her own bed room double locked the door and fainted away comfortably the boarders and the teachers and the servants fell back upon the stairs and upon each other and never was such a screaming and fainting and struggling beheld in the midst of the tumult mr pickwick emerged from his concealment and presented himself amongst them ladies dear ladies said mr pickwick oh he says we're dear cried the oldest and ugliest teacher oh the wretch ladies roared mr pickwick rendered desperate by the danger of his situation hear me i am no robber i want the lady of the house oh what a ferocious monster screamed another teacher he wants miss tomkins here there was a general scream ring the alarm bell somebody cried a dozen voices don't don't shouted mr pickwick look at me do i look like a robber my dear ladies you may bind me hand and leg or lock me up in a closet if you like only hear what i have got to say only hear me how did you come in our garden faltered the housemaid call the lady of the house and i'll tell her everything everything said mr pickwick exerting his lungs to the utmost pitch call her only be quiet and call her and you shall hear everything it might have been mr pickwick's appearance or it might have been his manner or it might have been the temptation irresistible to a female mind of hearing something at present enveloped in mystery that reduced the more reasonable portion of the establishment some four individuals to a state of comparative quiet by them it was proposed as a test of mr pickwick's sincerity that he should immediately submit to personal restraint and that gentleman having consented to hold a conference with miss tomkins from the interior of a closet in which the day boarders hung their bonnets and sandwich bags he at once stepped into it of his own accord and was securely locked in this revived the others and miss tomkins having been brought to and brought down the conference began what did you do in my garden man said miss tomkins in a faint voice i came to warn you that one of your young ladies was going to elope to night replied mr pickwick from the interior of the closet elope exclaimed miss tomkins the three teachers the thirty boarders and the five servants who with your friend mr charles fitz marshall my friend i don't know any such person well mr jingle then i never heard the name in my life then i have been deceived and deluded said mr pickwick i have been the victim of a conspiracy a foul and base conspiracy send to the angel my dear ma'am if you don't believe me send to the angel for mr pickwick's man servant i implore you ma'am he must be respectable he keeps a man servant said miss tomkins to the writing and ciphering governess it is my opinion miss tomkins said the writing and ciphering governess that his man servant keeps him i think he's a madman miss tomkins and the other's his keeper i think you are very right miss gwynn responded miss tomkins let two of the servants repair to the angel and let the others remain here to protect us so two of the servants were despatched to the angel in search of mr samuel weller and the remaining three stopped behind to protect miss tomkins and the three teachers and the thirty boarders and mr pickwick sat down in the closet beneath a grove of sandwich bags and awaited the return of the messengers with all the philosophy and fortitude he could summon to his aid an hour and a half elapsed before they came back and when they did come mr pickwick recognised in addition to the voice of mr samuel weller two other voices the tones of which struck familiarly on his ear but whose they were he could not for the life of him call to mind a very brief conversation ensued the door was unlocked mr pickwick stepped out of the closet and found himself in the presence of the whole establishment of westgate house mr samuel weller and old wardle and his destined son in law mr trundle my dear friend said mr pickwick running forward and grasping wardle's hand my dear friend pray for heaven's sake explain to this lady the unfortunate and dreadful situation in which i am placed you must have heard it from my servant say at all events my dear fellow that i am neither a robber nor a madman i have said so my dear friend i have said so already replied mr wardle shaking the right hand of his friend while mr trundle shook the left and whoever says or has said he is interposed mr weller stepping forward says that which is not the truth but so far from it on the contrary quite the rewerse and if there's any number o' men on these here premises as has said so i shall be wery happy to give 'em all a wery convincing proof o' their being mistaken in this here wery room if these wery respectable ladies 'll have the goodness to retire and order 'em up one at a time having delivered this defiance with great volubility mr weller struck his open palm emphatically with his clenched fist and winked pleasantly on miss tomkins the intensity of whose horror at his supposing it within the bounds of possibility that there could be any men on the premises of westgate house establishment for young ladies it is impossible to describe mr pickwick's explanation having already been partially made was soon concluded but neither in the course of his walk home with his friends nor afterwards when seated before a blazing fire at the supper he so much needed could a single observation be drawn from him he seemed bewildered and amazed once and only once he turned round to mr wardle and said how did you come here trundle and i came down here for some good shooting on the first replied wardle we arrived to night and were astonished to hear from your servant that you were here too but i am glad you are said the old fellow slapping him on the back i am glad you are we shall have a jovial party on the first and we'll give winkle another chance eh old boy mr pickwick made no reply he did not even ask after his friends at dingley dell and shortly afterwards retired for the night desiring sam to fetch his candle when he rung the bell did ring in due course and mr weller presented himself sam said mr pickwick looking out from under the bed clothes sir said mr weller mr pickwick paused and mr weller snuffed the candle sam said mr pickwick again as with a desperate effort sir said mr weller once more where is that trotter job sir yes gone sir with his master i suppose friend or master or whatever he is he's gone with him replied mr weller there's a pair on 'em sir jingle suspected my design and set that fellow on you with this story i suppose said mr pickwick half choking just that sir replied mr weller it was all false of course all sir replied mr weller reg'lar do sir artful dodge i don't think he'll escape us quite so easily the next time sam said mr pickwick i don't think he will sir whenever i meet that jingle again wherever it is said mr pickwick raising himself in bed and indenting his pillow with a tremendous blow i'll inflict personal chastisement on him in addition to the exposure he so richly merits i will or my name is not pickwick and venever i catches hold o' that there melan cholly chap with the black hair said sam if i don't bring some real water into his eyes for once in a way my name an't veller good night sir chapter xvii illustration showing that an attack of rheumatism in some cases acts as a quickener to inventive genius the constitution of mr pickwick though able to sustain a very considerable amount of exertion and fatigue was not proof against such a combination of attacks as he had undergone on the memorable night recorded in the last chapter the process of being washed in the night air and rough dried in a closet is as dangerous as it is peculiar mr pickwick was laid up with an attack of rheumatism but although the bodily powers of the great man were thus impaired his mental energies retained their pristine vigour his spirits were elastic his good humour was restored even the vexation consequent upon his recent adventure had vanished from his mind and he could join in the hearty laughter which any allusion to it excited in mr wardle without anger and without embarrassment nay more during the two days mr pickwick was confined to his bed sam was his constant attendant on the first he endeavoured to amuse his master by anecdote and conversation on the second mr pickwick demanded his writing desk and pen and ink and was deeply engaged during the whole day on the third being able to sit up in his bed chamber he despatched his valet with a message to mr wardle and mr trundle intimating that if they would take their wine there that evening they would greatly oblige him the invitation was most willingly accepted and when they were seated over their wine mr pickwick with sundry blushes produced the following little tale as having been edited by himself during his recent indisposition from his notes of mr weller's unsophisticated recital the parish clerk a tale of true love once upon a time in a very small country town at a considerable distance from london there lived a little man named nathaniel pipkin who was the parish clerk of the little town and lived in a little house in the little high street within ten minutes' walk of the little church and who was to be found every day from nine till four teaching a little learning to the little boys nathaniel pipkin was a harmless inoffensive good natured being with a turned up nose and rather turned in legs a cast in his eye and a halt in his gait and he divided his time between the church and his school verily believing that there existed not on the face of the earth so clever a man as the curate so imposing an apartment as the vestry room or so well ordered a seminary as his own once and only once in his life nathaniel pipkin had seen a bishop a real bishop with his arms in lawn sleeves and his head in a wig he had seen him walk and heard him talk at a confirmation on which momentous occasion nathaniel pipkin was so overcome with reverence and awe when the aforesaid bishop laid his hand on his head that he fainted right clean away and was borne out of church in the arms of the beadle this was a great event a tremendous era in nathaniel pipkin's life and it was the only one that had ever occurred to ruffle the smooth current of his quiet existence when happening one fine afternoon in a fit of mental abstraction to raise his eyes from the slate on which he was devising some tremendous problem in compound addition for an offending urchin to solve they suddenly rested on the blooming countenance of maria lobbs the only daughter of old lobbs the great saddler over the way now the eyes of mr pipkin had rested on the pretty face of maria lobbs many a time and oft before at church and elsewhere but the eyes of maria lobbs had never looked so bright the cheeks of maria lobbs had never looked so ruddy as upon this particular occasion no wonder then that nathaniel pipkin was unable to take his eyes from the countenance of miss lobbs no wonder that miss lobbs finding herself stared at by a young man withdrew her head from the window out of which she had been peeping and shut the casement and pulled down the blind no wonder that nathaniel pipkin immediately thereafter fell upon the young urchin who had previously offended and cuffed and knocked him about to his heart's content all this was very natural and there's nothing at all to wonder at about it it is matter of wonder though that any one of mr nathaniel pipkin's retiring disposition nervous temperament and most particularly diminutive income should from this day forth have dared to aspire to the hand and heart of the only daughter of the fiery old lobbs of old lobbs the great saddler who could have bought up the whole village at one stroke of his pen and never felt the outlay old lobbs who was well known to have heaps of money invested in the bank at the nearest market town old lobbs who was reported to have countless and inexhaustible treasures hoarded up in the little iron safe with the big key hole over the chimney piece in the back parlour old lobbs who it was well known on festive occasions garnished his board with a real silver tea pot cream ewer and sugar basin which he was wont in the pride of his heart to boast should be his daughter's property when she found a man to her mind i repeat it to be matter of profound astonishment and intense wonder that nathaniel pipkin should have had the temerity to cast his eyes in this direction but love is blind and nathaniel had a cast in his eye and perhaps these two circumstances taken together prevented his seeing the matter in its proper light now if old lobbs had entertained the most remote or distant idea of the state of the affections of nathaniel pipkin he would just have razed the school room to the ground or exterminated its master from the surface of the earth or committed some other outrage and atrocity of an equally ferocious and violent description for he was a terrible old fellow was lobbs when his pride was injured or his blood was up swear such trains of oaths would come rolling and pealing over the way sometimes when he was denouncing the idleness of the bony apprentice with the thin legs that nathaniel pipkin would shake in his shoes with horror and the hair of the pupils' heads would stand on end with fright well day after day when school was over and the pupils gone did nathaniel pipkin sit himself down at the front window and while he feigned to be reading a book throw sidelong glances over the way in search of the bright eyes of maria lobbs and he hadn't sat there many days before the bright eyes appeared at an upper window apparently deeply engaged in reading too this was delightful and gladdening to the heart of nathaniel pipkin it was something to sit there for hours together and look upon that pretty face when the eyes were cast down but when maria lobbs began to raise her eyes from her book and dart their rays in the direction of nathaniel pipkin his delight and admiration were perfectly boundless at last one day when he knew old lobbs was out nathaniel pipkin had the temerity to kiss his hand to maria lobbs and maria lobbs instead of shutting the window and pulling down the blind kissed hers to him and smiled upon which nathaniel pipkin determined that come what might he would develop the state of his feelings without further delay a prettier foot a gayer heart a more dimpled face or a smarter form never bounded so lightly over the earth they graced as did those of maria lobbs the old saddler's daughter there was a roguish twinkle in her sparkling eyes that would have made its way to far less susceptible bosoms than that of nathaniel pipkin and there was such a joyous sound in her merry laugh that the sternest misanthrope must have smiled to hear it even old lobbs himself in the very height of his ferocity couldn't resist the coaxing of his pretty daughter and when she and her cousin kate an arch impudent looking bewitching little person made a dead set upon the old man together as to say the truth they very often did he could have refused them nothing even had they asked for a portion of the countless and inexhaustible treasures which were hidden from the light in the iron safe nathaniel pipkin's heart beat high within him when he saw this enticing little couple some hundred yards before him one summer's evening in the very field in which he had many a time strolled about till night time and pondered on the beauty of maria lobbs but though he had often thought then how briskly he would walk up to maria lobbs and tell her of his passion if he could only meet her he felt now that she was unexpectedly before him all the blood in his body mounting to his face manifestly to the great detriment of his legs which deprived of their usual portion trembled beneath him when they stopped to gather a hedge flower or listen to a bird nathaniel pipkin stopped too and pretended to be absorbed in meditation as indeed he really was for he was thinking what on earth he should ever do when they turned back as they inevitably must in time and meet him face to face but though he was afraid to make up to them he couldn't bear to lose sight of them so when they walked faster he walked faster when they lingered he lingered and when they stopped he stopped and so they might have gone on until the darkness prevented them if kate had not looked slyly back and encouragingly beckoned nathaniel to advance there was something in kate's manner that was not to be resisted and so nathaniel pipkin complied with the invitation and after a great deal of blushing on his part and immoderate laughter on that of the wicked little cousin nathaniel pipkin went down on his knees on the dewy grass and declared his resolution to remain there for ever unless he were permitted to rise the accepted lover of maria lobbs upon this the merry laughter of maria lobbs rang through the calm evening air without seeming to disturb it though it had such a pleasant sound and the wicked little cousin laughed more immoderately than before and nathaniel pipkin blushed deeper than ever at length maria lobbs being more strenuously urged by the love worn little man turned away her head and whispered her cousin to say or at all events kate did say that she felt much honoured by mr pipkin's addresses that her hand and heart were at her father's disposal but that nobody could be insensible to mr pipkin's merits as all this was said with much gravity and as nathaniel pipkin walked home with maria lobbs and struggled for a kiss at parting he went to bed a happy man and dreamed all night long of softening old lobbs opening the strong box and marrying maria the next day nathaniel pipkin saw old lobbs go out upon his old grey pony and after a great many signs at the window from the wicked little cousin the object and meaning of which he could by no means understand the bony apprentice with the thin legs came over to say that his master wasn't coming home all night and that the ladies expected mr pipkin to tea at six o'clock precisely how the lessons were got through that day neither nathaniel pipkin nor his pupils knew any more than you do but they were got through somehow and after the boys had gone nathaniel pipkin took till full six o'clock to dress himself to his satisfaction not that it took long to select the garments he should wear inasmuch as he had no choice about the matter but the putting of them on to the best advantage and the touching of them up previously was a task of no inconsiderable difficulty or importance there was a very snug little party consisting of maria lobbs and her cousin kate and three or four romping good humoured rosy cheeked girls nathaniel pipkin had ocular demonstration of the fact that the rumours of old lobbs's treasures were not exaggerated there were the real solid silver tea pot cream ewer and sugar basin on the table and real silver spoons to stir the tea with and real china cups to drink it out of and plates of the same to hold the cakes and toast in the only eyesore in the whole place was another cousin of maria lobbs's and a brother of kate whom maria lobbs called 'henry' and who seemed to keep maria lobbs all to himself up in one corner of the table it's a delightful thing to see affection in families but it may be carried rather too far and nathaniel pipkin could not help thinking that maria lobbs must be very particularly fond of her relations if she paid as much attention to all of them as to this individual cousin after tea too when the wicked little cousin proposed a game at blindman's buff it somehow or other happened that nathaniel pipkin was nearly always blind and whenever he laid his hand upon the male cousin he was sure to find that maria lobbs was not far off and though the wicked little cousin and the other girls pinched him and pulled his hair and pushed chairs in his way and all sorts of things maria lobbs never seemed to come near him at all and once once nathaniel pipkin could have sworn he heard the sound of a kiss followed by a faint remonstrance from maria lobbs and a half suppressed laugh from her female friends all this was odd very odd and there is no saying what nathaniel pipkin might or might not have done in consequence if his thoughts had not been suddenly directed into a new channel the circumstance which directed his thoughts into a new channel was a loud knocking at the street door and the person who made this loud knocking at the street door was no other than old lobbs himself who had unexpectedly returned and was hammering away like a coffin maker for he wanted his supper the alarming intelligence was no sooner communicated by the bony apprentice with the thin legs than the girls tripped upstairs to maria lobbs's bed room and the male cousin and nathaniel pipkin were thrust into a couple of closets in the sitting room for want of any better places of concealment and when maria lobbs and the wicked little cousin had stowed them away and put the room to rights they opened the street door to old lobbs who had never left off knocking since he first began now it did unfortunately happen that old lobbs being very hungry was monstrous cross nathaniel pipkin could hear him growling away like an old mastiff with a sore throat and whenever the unfortunate apprentice with the thin legs came into the room so surely did old lobbs commence swearing at him in a most saracenic and ferocious manner though apparently with no other end or object than that of easing his bosom by the discharge of a few superfluous oaths at length some supper which had been warming up was placed on the table and then old lobbs fell to in regular style and having made clear work of it in no time kissed his daughter and demanded his pipe nature had placed nathaniel pipkin's knees in very close juxtaposition but when he heard old lobbs demand his pipe they knocked together as if they were going to reduce each other to powder for depending from a couple of hooks in the very closet in which he stood was a large brown stemmed silver bowled pipe which pipe he himself had seen in the mouth of old lobbs regularly every afternoon and evening for the last five years the two girls went downstairs for the pipe and upstairs for the pipe and everywhere but where they knew the pipe was and old lobbs stormed away meanwhile in the most wonderful manner at last he thought of the closet and walked up to it it was of no use a little man like nathaniel pipkin pulling the door inwards when a great strong fellow like old lobbs was pulling it outwards old lobbs gave it one tug and open it flew disclosing nathaniel pipkin standing bolt upright inside and shaking with apprehension from head to foot bless us what an appalling look old lobbs gave him as he dragged him out by the collar and held him at arm's length illustration open it flew disclosing nathaniel pipkin 'why what the devil do you want here' said old lobbs in a fearful voice nathaniel pipkin could make no reply so old lobbs shook him backwards and forwards for two or three minutes by way of arranging his ideas for him 'what do you want here' roared lobbs 'i suppose you have come after my daughter now' old lobbs merely said this as a sneer for he did not believe that mortal presumption could have carried nathaniel pipkin so far what was his indignation when that poor man replied 'yes i did mr lobbs i did come after your daughter i love her mr lobbs' 'why you snivelling wry faced puny villain' gasped old lobbs paralysed by the atrocious confession 'what do you mean by that say this to my face damme i'll throttle you' it is by no means improbable that old lobbs would have carried this threat into execution in the excess of his rage if his arm had not been stayed by a very unexpected apparition to wit the male cousin who stepping out of his closet and walking up to old lobbs said 'i cannot allow this harmless person sir who has been asked here in some girlish frolic to take upon himself in a very noble manner the fault if fault it is which i am guilty of and am ready to avow i love your daughter sir and i am here for the purpose of meeting her' old lobbs opened his eyes very wide at this but not wider than nathaniel pipkin 'you did' said lobbs at last finding breath to speak 'i did' 'and i forbade you this house long ago' 'you did or i should not have been here clandestinely to night' i am sorry to record it of old lobbs but i think he would have struck the cousin if his pretty daughter with her bright eyes swimming in tears had not clung to his arm 'don't stop him maria' said the young man 'if he has the will to strike me let him i would not hurt a hair of his grey head for the riches of the world' the old man cast down his eyes at this reproof and they met those of his daughter i have hinted once or twice before that they were very bright eyes and though they were tearful now their influence was by no means lessened old lobbs turned his head away as if to avoid being persuaded by them when as fortune would have it he encountered the face of the wicked little cousin who half afraid for her brother and half laughing at nathaniel pipkin presented as bewitching an expression of countenance with a touch of shyness in it too as any man old or young need look upon she drew her arm coaxingly through the old man's and whispered something in his ear and do what he would old lobbs couldn't help breaking out into a smile while a tear stole down his cheek at the same time five minutes after this the girls were brought down from the bed room with a great deal of giggling and modesty and while the young people were making themselves perfectly happy old lobbs got down the pipe and smoked it and it was a remarkable circumstance about that particular pipe of tobacco that it was the most soothing and delightful one he ever smoked nathaniel pipkin thought it best to keep his own counsel and by so doing gradually rose into high favour with old lobbs who taught him to smoke in time and they used to sit out in the garden on the fine evenings for many years afterwards smoking and drinking in great state he soon recovered the effects of his attachment for we find his name in the parish register as a witness to the marriage of maria lobbs to her cousin and it also appears by reference to other documents that on the night of the wedding he was incarcerated in the village cage for having in a state of extreme intoxication committed sundry excesses in the streets in all of which he was aided and abetted by the bony apprentice with the thin legs chapter xviii illustration briefly illustrative of two points first the power of hysterics and secondly the force of circumstances for two days after the breakfast at mrs hunter's the pickwickians remained at eatanswill anxiously awaiting the arrival of some intelligence from their revered leader mr tupman and mr snodgrass were once again left to their own means of amusement for mr winkle in compliance with a most pressing invitation continued to reside at mr pott's house and to devote his time to the companionship of his amiable lady nor was the occasional society of mr pott himself wanting to complete their felicity deeply immersed in the intensity of his speculations for the public weal and the destruction of the independent it was not the habit of that great man to descend from his mental pinnacle to the humble level of ordinary minds on this occasion however and as if expressly in compliment to any follower of mr pickwick's he unbent relaxed stepped down from his pedestal and walked upon the ground benignly adapting his remarks to the comprehension of the herd and seeming in outward form if not in spirit to be one of them such having been the demeanour of this celebrated public character towards mr winkle it will be readily imagined that considerable surprise was depicted on the countenance of the latter gentleman when as he was sitting alone in the breakfast room the door was hastily thrown open and as hastily closed on the entrance of mr pott who stalking majestically towards him and thrusting aside his proffered hand ground his teeth as if to put a sharper edge on what he was about to utter and exclaimed in a saw like voice serpent sir exclaimed mr winkle starting from his chair serpent sir repeated mr pott raising his voice and then suddenly depressing it i said serpent sir make the most of it when you have parted with a man at two o'clock in the morning on terms of the utmost good fellowship and he meets you again at half past nine and greets you as a serpent it is not unreasonable to conclude that something of an unpleasant nature has occurred meanwhile so mr winkle thought he returned mr pott's gaze of stone and in compliance with that gentleman's request proceeded to make the most he could of the serpent the most however was nothing at all so after a profound silence of some minutes' duration he said serpent sir serpent mr pott what can you mean sir this is pleasantry pleasantry sir exclaimed pott with a motion of the hand indicative of a strong desire to hurl the britannia metal teapot at the head of his visitor pleasantry sir but no i will be calm i will be calm sir in proof of his calmness mr pott flung himself into a chair and foamed at the mouth my dear sir interposed mr winkle dear sir replied pott how dare you address me as dear sir sir how dare you look me in the face and do it sir well sir if you come to that responded mr winkle how dare you look me in the face and call me a serpent sir because you are one replied mr pott prove it sir said mr winkle warmly prove it a malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor as he drew from his pocket the independent of that morning and laying his finger on a particular paragraph threw the journal across the table to mr winkle that gentleman took it up and read as follows our obscure and filthy contemporary in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life and to refer in a manner not to be misunderstood to the personal affairs of our late candidate ay and notwithstanding his base defeat we will add our future member mr fizkin what does our dastardly contemporary mean what would the ruffian say if we setting at naught like him the decencies of social intercourse were to raise the curtain which happily conceals his private life from general ridicule not to say from general execration what if we were even to point out and comment on facts and circumstances which are publicly notorious and beheld by every one but our mole eyed contemporary what if we were to print the following effusion which we received while we were writing the commencement of this article from a talented fellow townsman and correspondent 'lines to a brass pot 'oh pott if you'd known how false she'd have grown when you heard the marriage bells tinkle you'd have done then i vow what you cannot help now and handed her over to w' what said mr pott solemnly what rhymes to 'tinkle' villain what rhymes to 'tinkle' said mrs pott whose entrance at the moment forestalled the reply what rhymes to 'tinkle' why 'winkle' i should conceive saying this mrs pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed pickwickian and extended her hand towards him the agitated young man would have accepted it in his confusion had not pott indignantly interposed back ma'am back said the editor take his hand before my very face mr p said his astonished lady wretched woman look here exclaimed the husband look here ma'am 'lines to a brass pot' 'brass pot' that's me ma'am 'false she'd have grown' that's you ma'am you with this ebullition of rage which was not unaccompanied with something like a tremble at the expression of his wife's face mr pott dashed the current number of the eatanswill independent at her feet upon my word sir said the astonished mrs pott stooping to pick up the paper upon my word sir mr pott winced beneath the contemptuous gaze of his wife he had made a desperate struggle to screw up his courage but it was fast coming unscrewed again there appears nothing very tremendous in this little sentence upon my word sir when it comes to be read but the tone of voice in which it was delivered and the look that accompanied it both seeming to bear reference to some revenge to be thereafter visited upon the head of pott produced their full effect upon him the most unskilful observer could have detected in his troubled countenance a readiness to resign his wellington boots to any efficient substitute who would have consented to stand in them at that moment mrs pott read the paragraph uttered a loud shriek and threw herself at full length on the hearth rug screaming and tapping it with the heels of her shoes in a manner which could leave no doubt of the propriety of her feelings on the occasion my dear said the petrified pott i didn't say i believed it i but the unfortunate man's voice was drowned in the screaming of his partner mrs pott let me entreat you my dear ma'am to compose yourself said mr winkle but the shrieks and tappings were louder and more frequent than ever my dear said mr pott i'm very sorry if you won't consider your own health consider me my dear we shall have a crowd round the house but the more strenuously mr pott entreated the more vehemently the screams poured forth very fortunately however attached to mrs pott's person was a body guard of one a young lady whose ostensible employment was to preside over her toilet but who rendered herself useful in a variety of ways and in none more so than in the particular department of constantly aiding and abetting her mistress in every wish and inclination opposed to the desires of the unhappy pott the screams reached this young lady's ears in due course and brought her into the room with a speed which threatened to derange materially the very exquisite arrangement of her cap and ringlets oh my dear dear mistress exclaimed the body guard kneeling frantically by the side of the prostrate mrs pott oh my dear mistress what is the matter your master your brutal master murmured the patient pott was evidently giving way it's a shame said the body guard reproachfully i know he'll be the death of you ma'am poor dear thing he gave way more the opposite party followed up the attack oh don't leave me don't leave me goodwin murmured mrs pott clutching at the wrist of the said goodwin with an hysteric jerk you're the only person that's kind to me goodwin at this affecting appeal goodwin got up a little domestic tragedy of her own and shed tears copiously never ma'am never said goodwin oh sir you should be careful you should indeed you don't know what harm you may do missis you'll be sorry for it one day i know i've always said so the unlucky pott looked timidly on but said nothing goodwin said mrs pott in a soft voice ma'am said goodwin if you only knew how i have loved that man don't distress yourself by recollecting it ma'am said the body guard pott looked very frightened it was time to finish him and now sobbed mrs pott now after all to be treated in this way to be reproached and insulted in the presence of a third party and that party almost a stranger but i will not submit to it goodwin continued mrs pott raising herself in the arms of her attendant my brother the lieutenant shall interfere i'll be separated goodwin it would certainly serve him right ma'am said goodwin whatever thoughts the threat of a separation might have awakened in mr pott's mind he forebore to give utterance to them and contented himself by saying with great humility my dear will you hear me a fresh train of sobs was the only reply as mrs pott grew more hysterical requested to be informed why she was ever born and required sundry other pieces of information of a similar description my dear remonstrated mr pott do not give way to these sensitive feelings i never believed that the paragraph had any foundation my dear impossible i was only angry my dear i may say outrageous with the independent people for daring to insert it that's all mr pott cast an imploring look at the innocent cause of the mischief as if to entreat him to say nothing about the serpent and what steps sir do you mean to take to obtain redress inquired mr winkle gaining courage as he saw pott losing it oh goodwin observed mrs pott does he mean to horsewhip the editor of the independent does he goodwin hush hush ma'am pray keep yourself quiet replied the body guard i dare say he will if you wish it ma'am certainly said pott as his wife evinced decided symptoms of going off again of course i shall when goodwin when said mrs pott still undecided about the going off immediately of course said mr pott before the day is out oh goodwin resumed mrs pott it's the only way of meeting the slander and setting me right with the world certainly ma'am replied goodwin no man as is a man ma'am could refuse to do it so as the hysterics were still hovering about mr pott said once more that he would do it but mrs pott was so overcome at the bare idea of having ever been suspected that she was half a dozen times on the very verge of a relapse and most unquestionably would have gone off had it not been for the indefatigable efforts of the assiduous goodwin and repeated entreaties for pardon from the conquered pott and finally when that unhappy individual had been frightened and snubbed down to his proper level mrs pott recovered and they went to breakfast you will not allow this base newspaper slander to shorten your stay here mr winkle said mrs pott smiling through the traces of her tears i hope not said mr pott actuated as he spoke by a wish that his visitor would choke himself with the morsel of dry toast which he was raising to his lips at the moment and so terminate his stay effectually i hope not you are very good said mr winkle but a letter has been received from mr pickwick so i learn by a note from mr tupman which was brought up to my bed room door this morning in which he requests us to join him at bury to day and we are to leave by the coach at noon but you will come back said mrs pott oh certainly replied mr winkle you are quite sure said mrs pott stealing a tender look at her visitor quite responded mr winkle the breakfast passed off in silence for each member of the party was brooding over his or her own personal grievances mrs pott was regretting the loss of a beau mr pott his rash pledge to horsewhip the independent mr winkle his having innocently placed himself in so awkward a situation noon approached and after many adieux and promises to return he tore himself away if he ever comes back i'll poison him thought mr pott as he turned into the little back office where he prepared his thunderbolts if ever i do come back and mix myself up with these people again thought mr winkle as he wended his way to the peacock i shall deserve to be horsewhipped myself that's all his friends were ready the coach was nearly so and in half an hour they were proceeding on their journey along the road over which mr pickwick and sam had so recently travelled and of which as we have already said something we do not feel called upon to extract mr snodgrass's poetical and beautiful description mr weller was standing at the door of the angel ready to receive them and by that gentleman they were ushered to the apartment of mr pickwick where to the no small surprise of mr winkle and mr snodgrass and the no small embarrassment of mr tupman they found old wardle and trundle how are you said the old man grasping mr tupman's hand don't hang back or look sentimental about it it can't be helped old fellow for her sake i wish you'd had her for your own i'm very glad you have not a young fellow like you will do better one of these days eh with this consolation wardle slapped mr tupman on the back and laughed heartily well and how are you my fine fellows said the old gentleman shaking hands with mr winkle and mr snodgrass at the same time i have just been telling pickwick that we must have you all down at christmas we're going to have a wedding a real wedding this time a wedding exclaimed mr snodgrass turning very pale yes a wedding but don't be frightened said the good humoured old man it's only trundle there and bella oh is that all said mr snodgrass relieved from a painful doubt which had fallen heavily on his breast give you joy sir how is joe very well replied the old gentleman sleepy as ever and your mother and the clergyman and all of 'em quite well where said mr tupman with an effort where is she sir and he turned away his head and covered his eyes with his hand she said the old gentleman with a knowing shake of the head do you mean my single relative eh mr tupman by a nod intimated that his question applied to the disappointed rachael oh she's gone away said the old gentleman she's living at a relation's far enough off she couldn't bear to see the girls so i let her go but come here's the dinner you must be hungry after your ride i am without any ride at all so let us fall to ample justice was done to the meal and when they were seated round the table after it had been disposed of mr pickwick to the intense horror and indignation of his followers related the adventure he had undergone and the success which had attended the base artifices of the diabolical jingle and the attack of rheumatism which i caught in that garden said mr pickwick in conclusion renders me lame at this moment i too have had something of an adventure said mr winkle with a smile and at the request of mr pickwick he detailed the malicious libel of the eatanswill independent and the consequent excitement of their friend the editor mr pickwick's brow darkened during the recital his friends observed it and when mr winkle had concluded maintained a profound silence mr pickwick struck the table emphatically with his clenched fist and spoke as follows is it not a wonderful circumstance said mr pickwick that we seem destined to enter no man's house without involving him in some degree of trouble does it not i ask bespeak the indiscretion or worse than that the blackness of heart that i should say so of my followers that beneath whatever roof they locate they disturb the peace of mind and happiness of some confiding female is it not i say mr pickwick would in all probability have gone on for some time had not the entrance of sam with a letter caused him to break off in his eloquent discourse he passed the handkerchief across his forehead took off his spectacles wiped them and put them on again and his voice had recovered its wonted softness of tone when he said what have you there sam called at the post office just now and found this here letter as has laid there for two days replied mr weller it's sealed with a vafer and directed in round hand i don't know this hand said mr pickwick opening the letter mercy on us what's this it must be a jest it it can't be true what's the matter was the general inquiry nobody dead is there said wardle alarmed at the horror in mr pickwick's countenance mr pickwick made no reply but pushing the letter across the table and desiring mr tupman to read it aloud fell back in his chair with a look of vacant astonishment quite alarming to behold mr tupman with a trembling voice read the letter of which the following is a copy freeman's court cornhill august th bardell against pickwick sir having been instructed by mrs martha bardell to commence an action against you for a breach of promise of marriage for which the plaintiff lays her damages at fifteen hundred pounds we beg to inform you that a writ has been issued against you in this suit in the court of common pleas and request to know by return of post the name of your attorney in london who will accept service thereof we are sir your obedient servants dodson and fogg mr samuel pickwick there was something so impressive in the mute astonishment with which each man regarded his neighbour and every man regarded mr pickwick that all seemed afraid to speak the silence was at length broken by mr tupman dodson and fogg he repeated mechanically bardell and pickwick said mr snodgrass musing peace of mind and happiness of confiding females murmured mr winkle with an air of abstraction it's a conspiracy said mr pickwick at length recovering the power of speech a base conspiracy between these two grasping attorneys dodson and fogg mrs bardell would never do it she hasn't the heart to do it she hasn't the case to do it ridiculous ridiculous of her heart said wardle with a smile you should certainly be the best judge i don't wish to discourage you but i should certainly say that of her case dodson and fogg are far better judges than any of us can be it's a vile attempt to extort money said mr pickwick i hope it is said wardle with a short dry cough who ever heard me address her in any way but that in which a lodger would address his landlady continued mr pickwick with great vehemence who ever saw me with her not even my friends here except on one occasion said mr tupman mr pickwick changed colour ah said mr wardle well that's important there was nothing suspicious then i suppose mr tupman glanced timidly at his leader why said he there was nothing suspicious but i don't know how it happened mind she certainly was reclining in his arms gracious powers ejaculated mr pickwick as the recollection of the scene in question struck forcibly upon him what a dreadful instance of the force of circumstances so she was so she was and our friend was soothing her anguish said mr winkle rather maliciously so i was said mr pickwick i won't deny it so i was hallo said wardle for a case in which there's nothing suspicious this looks rather queer eh pickwick ah sly dog sly dog and he laughed till the glasses on the sideboard rang again what a dreadful conjunction of appearances exclaimed mr pickwick resting his chin upon his hands winkle tupman i beg your pardon for the observations i made just now we are all the victims of circumstances and i the greatest with this apology mr pickwick buried his head in his hands and ruminated while wardle measured out a regular circle of nods and winks addressed to the other members of the company i'll have it explained though said mr pickwick raising his head and hammering the table i'll see this dodson and fogg i'll go to london to morrow not to morrow said wardle you're too lame well then next day next day is the first of september and you're pledged to ride out with us as far as sir geoffrey manning's grounds at all events and to meet us at lunch if you don't take the field well then the day after said mr pickwick thursday sam sir replied mr weller take two places outside to london on thursday morning for yourself and me wery well sir mr weller left the room and departed slowly on his errand with his hands in his pocket and his eyes fixed on the ground rum feller the hemperor said mr weller as he walked slowly up the street think o' his making up to that 'ere mrs bardell vith a little boy too always the vay with these here old 'uns hows'ever as is such steady goers to look at i didn't think he'd ha' done it though i didn't think he'd ha' done it moralising in this strain mr samuel weller bent his steps towards the booking office chapter xix illustration a pleasant day with an unpleasant termination the birds who happily for their own peace of mind and personal comfort were in blissful ignorance of the preparations which had been making to astonish them on the first of september hailed it no doubt as one of the pleasantest mornings they had seen that season many a young partridge who strutted complacently among the stubble with all the finicking coxcombry of youth and many an older one who watched his levity out of his little round eye with the contemptuous air of a bird of wisdom and experience alike unconscious of their approaching doom basked in the fresh morning air with lively and blithesome feelings and a few hours afterwards were laid low upon the earth but we grow affecting let us proceed in plain commonplace matter of fact then it was a fine morning so fine that you would scarcely have believed that the few months of an english summer had yet flown by hedges fields and trees hill and moorland presented to the eye their ever varying shades of deep rich green scarce a leaf had fallen scarce a sprinkle of yellow mingled with the hues of summer warned you that autumn had begun the sky was cloudless the sun shone out bright and warm the songs of birds and hum of myriads of summer insects filled the air and the cottage gardens crowded with flowers of every rich and beautiful tint sparkled in the heavy dew like beds of glittering jewels everything bore the stamp of summer and none of its beautiful colours had yet faded from the dye such was the morning when an open carriage in which were three pickwickians mr snodgrass having preferred to remain at home mr wardle and mr trundle with sam weller on the box beside the driver pulled up by a gate at the roadside before which stood a tall raw boned gamekeeper and a half booted leather legginged boy each bearing a bag of capacious dimensions and accompanied by a brace of pointers i say whispered mr winkle to wardle as the man let down the steps they don't suppose we're going to kill game enough to fill those bags do they fill them exclaimed old wardle bless you yes you shall fill one and i the other and when we've done with them the pockets of our shooting jackets will hold as much more mr winkle dismounted without saying anything in reply to this observation but he thought within himself that if the party remained in the open air until he had filled one of the bags they stood a considerable chance of catching colds in their heads hi juno lass hi old girl down daph down said wardle caressing the dogs sir geoffrey still in scotland of course martin the tall gamekeeper replied in the affirmative and looked with some surprise from mr winkle who was holding his gun as if he wished his coat pocket to save him the trouble of pulling the trigger to mr tupman who was holding his as if he were afraid of it as there is no earthly reason to doubt he really was my friends are not much in the way of this sort of thing yet martin said wardle noticing the look live and learn you know they'll be good shots one of these days i beg my friend winkle's pardon though he has had some practice mr winkle smiled feebly over his blue neckerchief in acknowledgment of the compliment and got himself so mysteriously entangled with his gun in his modest confusion that if the piece had been loaded he must inevitably have shot himself dead upon the spot you mustn't handle your piece in that 'ere way when you come to have the charge in it sir said the tall gamekeeper gruffly or i'm damned if you won't make cold meat of some of us mr winkle thus admonished abruptly altered its position and in so doing contrived to bring the barrel into pretty sharp contact with mr weller's head hallo said sam picking up his hat which had been knocked off and rubbing his temple hallo sir if you comes it this vay you'll fill one o' them bags and something to spare at one fire here the leather legginged boy laughed very heartily and then tried to look as if it was somebody else whereat mr winkle frowned majestically where did you tell the boy to meet us with the snack martin inquired wardle side of one tree hill at twelve o'clock sir that's not sir geoffrey's land is it no sir but it's close by it it's captain boldwig's land but there'll be nobody to interrupt us and there's a fine bit of turf there very well said old wardle now the sooner we're off the better will you join us at twelve then pickwick mr pickwick was particularly desirous to view the sport the more especially as he was rather anxious in respect of mr winkle's life and limbs on so inviting a morning too it was very tantalising to turn back and leave his friends to enjoy themselves it was therefore with a very rueful air that he replied why i suppose i must an't the gentleman a shot sir inquired the long gamekeeper no replied wardle and he's lame besides i should very much like to go said mr pickwick very much there was a short pause of commiseration there's a barrow t'other side the hedge said the boy if the gentleman's servant would wheel along the paths he could keep nigh us and we could lift it over the stiles and that the wery thing said mr weller who was a party interested inasmuch as he ardently longed to see the sport the wery thing well said smallcheck i'll have it out in a minute but here a difficulty arose the long gamekeeper resolutely protested against the introduction into a shooting party of a gentleman in a barrow as a gross violation of all established rules and precedents it was a great objection but not an insurmountable one the gamekeeper having been coaxed and fee'd and having moreover eased his mind by punching the head of the inventive youth who had first suggested the use of the machine mr pickwick was placed in it and off the party set wardle and the long gamekeeper leading the way and mr pickwick in the barrow propelled by sam bringing up the rear stop sam said mr pickwick when they had got half across the first field what's the matter now said wardle i won't suffer this barrow to be moved another step said mr pickwick resolutely unless winkle carries that gun of his in a different manner how am i to carry it said the wretched winkle carry it with the muzzle to the ground replied mr pickwick it's so unsportsman like reasoned winkle i don't care whether it's unsportsman like or not replied mr pickwick i am not going to be shot in a wheelbarrow for the sake of appearances to please anybody i know the gentleman 'll put that 'ere charge into somebody afore he's done growled the long man well well i don't mind said poor winkle turning his gun stock uppermost there anythin' for a quiet life said mr weller and on they went again stop said mr pickwick after they had gone a few yards further what now said wardle that gun of tupman's is not safe i know it isn't said mr pickwick illustration i won't suffer this barrow to be moved another step unless winkle carries that gun of his in a different manner eh what not safe said mr tupman in a tone of great alarm not as you are carrying it said mr pickwick i am very sorry to make any further objection but i cannot consent to go on unless you carry it as winkle does his i think you had better sir said the long gamekeeper or you're quite as likely to lodge the charge in yourself as in anything else mr tupman with the most obliging haste placed his piece in the position required and the party moved on again the two amateurs marching with reversed arms like a couple of privates at a royal funeral the dogs suddenly came to a dead stop and the party advancing stealthily a single pace stopped too what's the matter with the dogs' legs whispered mr winkle how queer they're standing hush can't you replied wardle softly don't you see they're making a point making a point said mr winkle staring about him as if he expected to discover some particular beauty in the landscape which the sagacious animals were calling special attention to making a point what are they pointing at keep your eyes open said wardle not heeding the question in the excitement of the moment now then there was a sharp whirring noise that made mr winkle start back as if he had been shot himself bang bang went a couple of guns the smoke swept quickly away over the field and curled into the air where are they said mr winkle in a state of the highest excitement turning round and round in all directions where are they tell me when to fire where are they where are they where are they said wardle taking up a brace of birds which the dogs had deposited at his feet why here they are no no i mean the others said the bewildered winkle far enough off by this time replied wardle coolly re loading his gun we shall very likely be up with another covey in five minutes said the long gamekeeper if the gentleman begins to fire now perhaps he'll just get the shot out of the barrel by the time they rise ha ha ha roared mr weller sam said mr pickwick compassionating his follower's confusion and embarrassment sir don't laugh certainly not sir so by way of indemnification mr weller contorted his features from behind the wheelbarrow for the exclusive amusement of the boy with the leggings who thereupon burst into a boisterous laugh and was summarily cuffed by the long gamekeeper who wanted a pretext for turning round to hide his own merriment bravo old fellow said wardle to mr tupman you fired that time at all events oh yes replied mr tupman with conscious pride i let it off well done you'll hit something next time if you look sharp very easy an't it yes it's very easy said mr tupman how it hurts one's shoulder though it nearly knocked me backwards i had no idea that these small fire arms kicked so ah said the old gentleman smiling you'll get used to it in time now then all ready all right with the barrow there all right sir replied mr weller come along then hold hard sir said sam raising the barrow ay ay replied mr pickwick and on they went as briskly as need be keep that barrow back now cried wardle when it had been hoisted over a stile into another field and mr pickwick had been deposited in it once more all right sir replied mr weller pausing now winkle said the old gentleman follow me softly and don't be too late this time never fear said mr winkle are they pointing no no not now quietly now quietly on they crept and very quietly they would have advanced if mr winkle in the performance of some very intricate evolutions with his gun had not accidentally fired at the most critical moment over the boy's head exactly in the very spot where the tall man's brain would have been had he been there instead why what on earth did you do that for said old wardle as the birds flew unharmed away i never saw such a gun in my life replied poor mr winkle looking at the lock as if that would do any good it goes off of its own accord it will do it will do it echoed wardle with something of irritation in his manner i wish it would kill something of its own accord it'll do that afore long sir observed the tall man in a low prophetic voice what do you mean by that observation sir inquired mr winkle angrily never mind sir never mind replied the long gamekeeper i've no family myself sir and this here boy's mother will get something handsome from sir geoffrey if he's killed on his land load again sir load again take away his gun cried mr pickwick from the barrow horror stricken at the long man's dark insinuations take away his gun do you hear somebody nobody however volunteered to obey the command and mr winkle after darting a rebellious glance at mr pickwick reloaded his gun and proceeded onwards with the rest we are bound on the authority of mr pickwick to state that mr tupman's mode of proceeding evinced far more of prudence and deliberation than that adopted by mr winkle still this by no means detracts from the great authority of the latter gentleman on all matters connected with the field because as mr pickwick beautifully observes it has somehow or other happened from time immemorial that many of the best and ablest philosophers who have been perfect lights of science in matters of theory have been wholly unable to reduce them to practice mr tupman's process like many of our most sublime discoveries was extremely simple with the quickness and penetration of a man of genius he had once observed that the two great points to be obtained were first to discharge his piece without injury to himself and secondly to do so without danger to the by standers obviously the best thing to do after surmounting the difficulty of firing at all was to shut his eyes firmly and fire into the air on one occasion after performing this feat mr tupman on opening his eyes beheld a plump partridge in the act of falling wounded to the ground he was on the point of congratulating mr wardle on his invariable success when that gentleman advanced towards him and grasped him warmly by the hand tupman said the old gentleman you singled out that particular bird no said mr tupman no you did said wardle i saw you do it i observed you pick him out i noticed you as you raised your piece to take aim and i will say this that the best shot in existence could not have done it more beautifully you are an older hand at this than i thought you tupman you have been out before it was in vain for mr tupman to protest with a smile of self denial that he never had the very smile was taken as evidence to the contrary and from that time forth his reputation was established it is not the only reputation that has been acquired as easily nor are such fortunate circumstances confined to partridge shooting meanwhile mr winkle flashed and blazed and smoked away without producing any material results worthy of being noted down sometimes expending his charge in mid air and at others sending it skimming along so near the surface of the ground as to place the lives of the two dogs on a rather uncertain and precarious tenure as a display of fancy shooting it was extremely varied and curious as an exhibition of firing with any precise object it was upon the whole perhaps a failure it is an established axiom that every bullet has its billet if it apply in an equal degree to shot those of mr winkle were unfortunate foundlings deprived of their natural rights cast loose upon the world and billeted nowhere well said wardle walking up to the side of the barrow and wiping the streams of perspiration from his jolly red face smoking day isn't it it is indeed replied mr pickwick the sun is tremendously hot even to me i don't know how you must feel it why said the old gentleman pretty hot it's past twelve though you see that green hill there certainly that's the place where we are to lunch and by jove there's the boy with the basket punctual as clockwork so he is said mr pickwick brightening up good boy that i'll give him a shilling presently now then sam wheel away hold on sir said mr weller invigorated with the prospect of refreshments out of the way young leathers if you walley my precious life don't upset me as the gen'l'm'n said to the driver when they was a carryin' him to tyburn and quickening his pace to a sharp run mr weller wheeled his master nimbly to the green hill shot him dexterously out by the very side of the basket and proceeded to unpack it with the utmost despatch weal pie said mr weller soliloquising as he arranged the eatables on the grass wery good thing is weal pie when you know the lady as made it and is quite sure it an't kittens and arter all though where's the odds when they're so like weal that the wery piemen themselves don't know the difference don't they sam said mr pickwick not they sir replied mr weller touching his hat i lodged in the same house vith a pieman once sir and a wery nice man he was reg'lar clever chap too make pies out o' anything he could 'what a number o' cats you keep mr brooks' says i when i'd got intimate with him 'ah' says he 'i do a good many' says he 'you must be wery fond o' cats' says i 'other people is' says he a vinkin' at me 'they an't in season till the winter though' says he 'not in season' says i 'no' says he 'fruits is in cats is out' 'why what do you mean' says i 'mean' says he 'that i'll never be a party to the combination o' the butchers to keep up the prices o' meat' says he 'mr weller' says he a squeezing my hand wery hard and vispering in my ear 'don't mention this here agin but it's the seasonin' as does it they're all made o' them noble animals' says he a pointin' to a wery nice little tabby kitten 'and i seasons 'em for beef steak weal or kidney 'cordin' to the demand and more than that' says he 'i can make a weal a beef steak or a beef steak a kidney or any one on 'em a mutton at a minute's notice just as the market changes and appetites wary' he must have been a very ingenious young man that sam said mr pickwick with a slight shudder just was sir replied mr weller continuing his occupation of emptying the basket and the pies was beautiful tongue well that's a wery good thing when it an't a woman's bread knuckle o' ham reg'lar picter cold beef in slices wery good what's in them stone jars young touch and go beer in this one replied the boy taking from his shoulder a couple of large stone bottles fastened together by a leathern strap cold punch in t'other and a wery good notion of a lunch it is take it altogether said mr weller surveying his arrangement of the repast with great satisfaction now gen'l'm'n 'fall on' as the english said to the french when they fixed bagginets it needed no second invitation to induce the party to yield full justice to the meal and as little pressing did it require to induce mr weller the long gamekeeper and the two boys to station themselves on the grass at a little distance and do good execution upon a decent proportion of the viands an old oak afforded a pleasant shelter to the group and a rich prospect of arable and meadow land intersected with luxuriant hedges and richly ornamented with wood lay spread out below them this is delightful thoroughly delightful said mr pickwick the skin of whose expressive countenance was rapidly peeling off with exposure to the sun so it is so it is old fellow replied wardle come a glass of punch with great pleasure said mr pickwick the satisfaction of whose countenance after drinking it bore testimony to the sincerity of the reply good said mr pickwick smacking his lips very good i'll take another cool very cool come gentlemen continued mr pickwick still retaining his hold upon the jar a toast our friends at dingley dell the toast was drunk with loud acclamations i'll tell you what i shall do to get up my shooting again said mr winkle who was eating bread and ham with a pocket knife i'll put a stuffed partridge on the top of a post and practise at it beginning at a short distance and lengthening it by degrees i understand it's capital practice i know a gen'l'man sir said mr weller as did that and begun at two yards but he never tried it on agin for he blowed the bird right clean away at the first fire and nobody ever seed a feather on him arterwards sam said mr pickwick sir replied mr weller have the goodness to reserve your anecdotes till they are called for cert'nly sir here mr weller winked the eye which was not concealed by the beer can he was raising to his lips with such exquisiteness that the two boys went into spontaneous convulsions and even the long man condescended to smile well that certainly is most capital cold punch said mr pickwick looking earnestly at the stone bottle and the day is extremely warm and tupman my dear friend a glass of punch with the greatest delight replied mr tupman and having drank that glass mr pickwick took another just to see whether there was any orange peel in the punch because orange peel always disagreed with him and finding that there was not mr pickwick took another glass to the health of their absent friend and then felt himself imperatively called upon to propose another in honour of the punch compounder unknown this constant succession of glasses produced considerable effect upon mr pickwick his countenance beamed with the most sunny smiles laughter played around his lips and good humoured merriment twinkled in his eye yielding by degrees to the influence of the exciting liquid rendered more so by the heat mr pickwick expressed a strong desire to recollect a song which he had heard in his infancy and the attempt proving abortive sought to stimulate his memory with more glasses of punch which appeared to have quite a contrary effect for from forgetting the words of the song he began to forget how to articulate any words at all and finally after rising to his legs to address the company in an eloquent speech he fell into the barrow and fast asleep simultaneously the basket having been repacked and it being found perfectly impossible to awaken mr pickwick from his torpor some discussion took place whether it would be better for mr weller to wheel his master back again or to leave him where he was until they should all be ready to return the latter course was at length decided on and as the further expedition was not to exceed an hour's duration and as mr weller begged very hard to be one of the party it was determined to leave mr pickwick asleep in the barrow and to call for him on their return so away they went leaving mr pickwick snoring most comfortably in the shade that mr pickwick would have continued to snore in the shade until his friends came back or in default thereof until the shades of evening had fallen on the landscape there appears no reasonable cause to doubt always supposing that he had been suffered to remain there in peace but he was not suffered to remain there in peace and this was what prevented him captain boldwig was a little fierce man in a stiff black neckerchief and blue surtout who when he did condescend to walk about his property did it in company with a thick rattan stick with a brass ferule and a gardener and sub gardener with meek faces to whom the gardeners not the stick captain boldwig gave his orders with all due grandeur and ferocity for captain boldwig's wife's sister had married a marquis and the captain's house was a villa and his land grounds and it was all very high and mighty and great mr pickwick had not been asleep half an hour when little boldwig followed by the two gardeners came striding along as fast as his size and importance would let him and when he came near the oak tree captain boldwig paused and drew a long breath and looked at the prospect as if he thought the prospect ought to be highly gratified at having him to take notice of it and then he struck the ground emphatically with his stick and summoned the head gardener hunt said captain boldwig yes sir said the gardener roll this place to morrow morning do you hear hunt yes sir and take care that you keep me this place in good order do you hear hunt yes sir and remind me to have a board done about trespassers and spring guns and all that sort of thing to keep the common people out do you hear hunt do you hear i'll not forget it sir i beg your pardon sir said the other man advancing with his hand to his hat well wilkins what's the matter with you said captain boldwig i beg your pardon sir but i think there have been trespassers here to day ha said the captain scowling around him yes sir they have been dining here i think sir why confound their audacity so they have said captain boldwig as the crumbs and fragments that were strewn upon the grass met his eye they have actually been devouring their food here i wish i had the vagabonds here said the captain clenching the thick stick i wish i had the vagabonds here said the captain wrathfully beg your pardon sir said wilkins but but what eh roared the captain and following the timid glance of wilkins his eyes encountered the wheelbarrow and mr pickwick illustration who are you you rascal who are you you rascal said the captain administering several pokes to mr pickwick's body with the thick stick what's your name cold punch murmured mr pickwick as he sunk to sleep again what demanded captain boldwig no reply what did he say his name was asked the captain punch i think sir replied wilkins that's his impudence that's his confounded impudence said captain boldwig he's only feigning to be asleep now said the captain in a high passion he's drunk he's a drunken plebeian wheel him away wilkins wheel him away directly where shall i wheel him to sir inquired wilkins with great timidity wheel him to the devil replied captain boldwig very well sir said wilkins stay said the captain wilkins stopped accordingly wheel him said the captain wheel him to the pound and let us see whether he calls himself punch when he comes to himself he shall not bully me he shall not bully me wheel him away away mr pickwick was wheeled in compliance with this imperious mandate and the great captain boldwig swelling with indignation proceeded on his walk inexpressible was the astonishment of the little party when they returned to find that mr pickwick had disappeared and taken the wheelbarrow with him it was the most mysterious and unaccountable thing that was ever heard of for a lame man to have got upon his legs without any previous notice and walked off would have been most extraordinary but when it came to his wheeling a heavy barrow before him by way of amusement it grew positively miraculous they searched every nook and corner round together and separately they shouted whistled laughed called and all with the same result mr pickwick was not to be found after some hours of fruitless search they arrived at the unwelcome conclusion that they must go home without him meanwhile mr pickwick had been wheeled to the pound and safely deposited therein fast asleep in the wheelbarrow to the immeasurable delight and satisfaction not only of all the boys in the village but three fourths of the whole population who had gathered round in expectation of his waking if their most intense gratification had been excited by seeing him wheeled in how many hundredfold was their joy increased when after a few indistinct cries of sam he sat up in the barrow and gazed with indescribable astonishment on the faces before him a general shout was of course the signal of his having woke up and his involuntary inquiry of what's the matter occasioned another louder than the first if possible here's a game roared the populace where am i exclaimed mr pickwick in the pound replied the mob how came i here what was i doing where was i brought from boldwig captain boldwig was the only reply let me out cried mr pickwick where's my servant where are my friends you an't got no friends hurrah then there came a turnip then a potato and then an egg with a few other little tokens of the playful disposition of the many headed how long this scene might have lasted or how much mr pickwick might have suffered no one can tell had not a carriage which was driving swiftly by suddenly pulled up from whence there descended old wardle and sam weller the former of whom in far less time than it takes to write it if not to read it had made his way to mr pickwick's side and placed him in the vehicle just as the latter had concluded the third and last round of a single combat with the town beadle run to the justice's cried a dozen voices ah run avay said mr weller jumping upon the box give my compliments mr veller's compliments to the justice and tell him i've spiled his beadle and that if he'll swear in a new 'un i'll come back agin to morrow and spile him drive on old feller i'll give directions for the commencement of an action for false imprisonment against this captain boldwig directly i get to london said mr pickwick as soon as the carriage turned out of the town we were trespassing it seems said wardle i don't care said mr pickwick i'll bring the action no you won't said wardle i will by but as there was a humorous expression in wardle's face mr pickwick checked himself and said why not because said old wardle half bursting with laughter because they might turn round on some of us and say we had taken too much cold punch do what he would a smile would come into mr pickwick's face the smile extended into a laugh the laugh into a roar the roar became general so to keep up their good humour they stopped at the first roadside tavern they came to and ordered a glass of brandy and water all round with a magnum of extra strength for mr samuel weller chapter xx illustration showing how dodson and fogg were men of business and their clerks men of pleasure and how an affecting interview took place between mr weller and his long lost parent showing also what choice spirits assembled at the magpie and stump and what a capital chapter the next one will be in the ground floor front of a dingy house at the very farthest end of freeman's court cornhill sat the four clerks of messrs dodson and fogg two of his majesty's attorneys of the courts of king's bench and common pleas at westminster and solicitors of the high court of chancery the aforesaid clerks catching as favourable glimpses of heaven's light and heaven's sun in the course of their daily labours as a man might hope to do were he placed at the bottom of a reasonably deep well and without the opportunity of perceiving the stars in the day time which the latter secluded situation affords the clerks' office of messrs dodson and fogg was a dark mouldy earthy smelling room with a high wainscoted partition to screen the clerks from the vulgar gaze a couple of old wooden chairs a very loud ticking clock an almanack an umbrella stand a row of hat pegs and a few shelves on which were deposited several ticketed bundles of dirty papers some old deal boxes with paper labels and sundry decayed stone ink bottles of various shapes and sizes there was a glass door leading into the passage which formed the entrance to the court and on the outer side of this glass door mr pickwick closely followed by sam weller presented himself on the friday morning succeeding the occurrence of which a faithful narration is given in the last chapter come in can't you cried a voice from behind the partition in reply to mr pickwick's gentle tap at the door and mr pickwick and sam entered accordingly mr dodson or mr fogg at home sir inquired mr pickwick gently advancing hat in hand towards the partition mr dodson ain't at home and mr fogg's particularly engaged replied the voice and at the same time the head to which the voice belonged with a pen behind its ear looked over the partition and at mr pickwick it was a ragged head the sandy hair of which scrupulously parted on one side and flattened down with pomatum was twisted into little semi circular tails round a flat face ornamented with a pair of small eyes and garnished with a very dirty shirt collar and a rusty black stock mr dodson ain't at home and mr fogg's particularly engaged said the man to whom the head belonged when will mr dodson be back sir inquired mr pickwick can't say will it be long before mr fogg is disengaged sir don't know here the man proceeded to mend his pen with great deliberation while another clerk who was mixing a seidlitz powder under cover of the lid of his desk laughed approvingly i think i'll wait said mr pickwick there was no reply so mr pickwick sat down unbidden and listened to the loud ticking of the clock and the murmured conversation of the clerks that was a game wasn't it said one of the gentlemen in a brown coat and brass buttons inky drabs and bluchers at the conclusion of some inaudible relation of his previous evening's adventures devilish good devilish good said the seidlitz powder man tom cummins was in the chair said the man with the brown coat it was half past four when i got to somers town and then i was so uncommon lushy that i couldn't find the place where the latch key went in and was obliged to knock up the old 'ooman i say i wonder what old fogg 'ud say if he knew it i should get the sack i s'pose eh at this humorous notion all the clerks laughed in concert there was such a game with fogg here this mornin' said the man in the brown coat while jack was up stairs sorting the papers and you two were gone to the stamp office fogg was down here opening the letters when that chap as we issued the writ against at camberwell you know came in what's his name again ramsey said the clerk who had spoken to mr pickwick ah ramsey a precious seedy looking customer 'well sir' says old fogg looking at him very fierce you know his way 'well sir have you come to settle' 'yes i have sir' said ramsey putting his hand in his pocket and bringing out the money 'the debt's two pound ten and the costs three pound five and here it is sir' and he sighed like bricks as he lugged out the money done up in a bit of blotting paper old fogg looked first at the money and then at him and then he coughed in his rum way so that i knew something was coming 'you don't know there's a declaration filed which increases the costs materially i suppose' said fogg 'you don't say that sir' said ramsey starting back 'the time was only out last night sir' 'i do say it though' said fogg 'my clerk's just gone to file it hasn't mr jackson gone to file that declaration in bullman and ramsey mr wicks' of course i said yes and then fogg coughed again and looked at ramsey 'my god' said ramsey 'and here have i nearly driven myself mad scraping this money together and all to no purpose' 'none at all' said fogg coolly 'so you had better go back and scrape some more together and bring it here in time' 'i can't get it by god' said ramsey striking the desk with his fist 'don't bully me sir' said fogg getting into a passion on purpose 'i am not bullying you sir' said ramsey 'you are' said fogg 'get out sir get out of this office sir and come back sir when you know how to behave yourself' well ramsey tried to speak but fogg wouldn't let him so he put the money in his pocket and sneaked out the door was scarcely shut when old fogg turned round to me with a sweet smile on his face and drew the declaration out of his coat pocket 'here wicks' says fogg 'take a cab and go down to the temple as quick as you can and file that the costs are quite safe for he's a steady man with a large family at a salary of five and twenty shillings a week and if he gives us a warrant of attorney as he must in the end i know his employers will see it paid so we may as well get all we can out of him mr wicks it's a christian act to do it mr wicks for with his large family and small income he'll be all the better for a good lesson against getting into debt won't he mr wicks won't he' and he smiled so good naturedly as he went away that it was delightful to see him he is a capital man of business said wicks in a tone of the deepest admiration capital isn't he the other three cordially subscribed to this opinion and the anecdote afforded the most unlimited satisfaction nice men these here sir whispered mr weller to his master wery nice notion of fun they has sir mr pickwick nodded assent and coughed to attract the attention of the young gentlemen behind the partition who having now relaxed their minds by a little conversation among themselves condescended to take some notice of the stranger i wonder whether fogg's disengaged now said jackson i'll see said wicks dismounting leisurely from his stool what name shall i tell mr fogg pickwick replied the illustrious subject of these memoirs mr jackson departed up stairs on his errand and immediately returned with a message that mr fogg would see mr pickwick in five minutes and having delivered it returned again to his desk what did he say his name was whispered wicks pickwick replied jackson it's the defendant in bardell and pickwick a sudden scraping of feet mingled with the sound of suppressed laughter was heard from behind the partition they're a twiggin' of you sir whispered mr weller twigging of me sam replied mr pickwick what do you mean by twigging me mr weller replied by pointing with his thumb over his shoulder and mr pickwick on looking up became sensible of the pleasing fact that all the four clerks with countenances expressive of the utmost amusement and with their heads thrust over the wooden screen were minutely inspecting the figure and general appearance of the supposed trifler with female hearts and disturber of female happiness on his looking up the row of heads suddenly disappeared and the sound of pens travelling at a furious rate over paper immediately succeeded a sudden ring at the bell which hung in the office summoned mr jackson to the apartment of fogg from whence he came back to say that he fogg was ready to see mr pickwick if he would step up stairs up stairs mr pickwick did step accordingly leaving sam weller below the room door of the one pair back bore inscribed in legible characters the imposing words mr fogg and having tapped thereat and been desired to come in jackson ushered mr pickwick into the presence is mr dodson in inquired mr fogg just come in sir replied jackson ask him to step here yes sir exit jackson take a seat sir said fogg there is the paper sir my partner will be here directly and we can converse about this matter sir mr pickwick took a seat and the paper but instead of reading the latter peeped over the top of it and took a survey of the man of business who was an elderly pimply faced vegetable diet sort of man in a black coat dark mixture trousers and small black gaiters a kind of being who seemed to be an essential part of the desk at which he was writing and to have as much thought or sentiment after a few minutes' silence mr dodson a plump portly stern looking man with a loud voice appeared and the conversation commenced this is mr pickwick said fogg ah you are the defendant sir in bardell and pickwick said dodson i am sir replied mr pickwick well sir said dodson and what do you propose ah said fogg thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets and throwing himself back in his chair what do you propose mr pickwick hush fogg said dodson let me hear what mr pickwick has to say i came gentlemen said mr pickwick gazing placidly on the two partners i came here gentlemen to express the surprise with which i received your letter of the other day and to inquire what grounds of action you can have against me grounds of fogg had ejaculated thus much when he was stopped by dodson mr fogg said dodson i am going to speak i beg your pardon mr dodson said fogg for the grounds of action sir continued dodson with moral elevation in his air you will consult your own conscience and your own feelings we sir we are guided entirely by the statement of our client that statement sir may be true or it may be false it may be credible or it may be incredible but if it be true and if it be credible i do not hesitate to say sir that our grounds of action sir are strong and not to be shaken you may be an unfortunate man sir or you may be a designing one but if i were called upon as a juryman upon my oath sir to express my opinion of your conduct sir i do not hesitate to assert that i should have but one opinion about it here dodson drew himself up with an air of offended virtue and looked at fogg who thrust his hands further in his pockets and nodding his head sagely said in a tone of the fullest concurrence most certainly well sir said mr pickwick with considerable pain depicted in his countenance you will permit me to assure you that i am a most unfortunate man so far as this case is concerned i hope you are sir replied dodson i trust you may be sir if you are really innocent of what is laid to your charge you are more unfortunate than i had believed any man could possibly be what do you say mr fogg i say precisely what you say replied fogg with a smile of incredulity the writ sir which commences the action continued dodson was issued regularly mr fogg where is the prcipe book here it is said fogg handing over a square book with a parchment cover here is the entry resumed dodson 'middlesex capias martha bardell widow v samuel pickwick damages dodson and fogg for the plaintiff aug ' all regular sir perfectly dodson coughed and looked at fogg who said perfectly also and then they both looked at mr pickwick i am to understand then said mr pickwick that it really is your intention to proceed with this action understand sir that you certainly may replied dodson with something as near a smile as his importance would allow and that the damages are actually laid at fifteen hundred pounds said mr pickwick to which understanding you may add my assurance that if we could have prevailed upon our client they would have been laid at treble the amount sir replied dodson i believe mrs bardell specially said however observed fogg glancing at dodson that she would not compromise for a farthing less unquestionably replied dodson sternly for the action was only just begun and it wouldn't have done to let mr pickwick compromise it then even if he had been so disposed as you offer no terms sir said dodson displaying a slip of parchment in his right hand and affectionately pressing a paper copy of it on mr pickwick with his left i had better serve you with a copy of this writ sir here is the original sir very well gentlemen very well said mr pickwick rising in person and wrath at the same time you shall hear from my solicitor gentlemen we shall be very happy to do so said fogg rubbing his hands very said dodson opening the door and before i go gentlemen said the excited mr pickwick turning round on the landing permit me to say that of all the disgraceful and rascally proceedings stay sir stay interposed dodson with great politeness mr jackson mr wicks sir said the two clerks appearing at the bottom of the stairs i merely want you to hear what this gentleman says replied dodson pray go on sir disgraceful and rascally proceedings i think you said i did said mr pickwick thoroughly roused i said sir that of all the disgraceful and rascally proceedings that ever were attempted this is the most so i repeat it sir you hear that mr wicks said dodson you won't forget these expressions mr jackson said fogg perhaps you would like to call us swindlers sir said dodson pray do sir if you feel disposed now pray do sir i do said mr pickwick you are swindlers very good said dodson you can hear down there i hope mr wicks oh yes sir said wicks you had better come up a step or two higher if you can't added mr fogg go on sir do go on you had better call us thieves sir or perhaps you would like to assault one of us pray do it sir if you would we will not make the smallest resistance pray do it sir as fogg put himself very temptingly within the reach of mr pickwick's clenched fist there is little doubt that that gentleman would have complied with his earnest entreaty but for the interposition of sam who hearing the dispute emerged from the office mounted the stairs and seized his master by the arm you just come avay said mr weller battledore and shuttlecock's a wery good game ven you an't the shuttlecock and two lawyers the battledores in which case it gets too excitin' to be pleasant come away sir if you want to ease your mind by blowing up somebody come out into the court and blow up me but it's rayther too expensive work to be carried on here and without the slightest ceremony mr weller hauled his master down the stairs and down the court and having safely deposited him in cornhill fell behind prepared to follow whither soever he should lead mr pickwick walked on abstractedly crossed opposite the mansion house and bent his steps up cheapside sam began to wonder where they were going when his master turned round and said sam i will go immediately to mr perker's that's just exactly the wery place vere you ought to have gone last night sir replied mr weller i think it is sam said mr pickwick i know it is said mr weller well well sam replied mr pickwick we will go there at once but first as i have been rather ruffled i should like a glass of brandy and water warm sam where can i have it sam mr weller's knowledge of london was extensive and peculiar he replied without the slightest consideration second court on the right hand side last house but vun on the same side the vay take the box as stands in the first fireplace 'cos there an't no leg in the middle o' the table wich all the others has and its wery inconwenient mr pickwick observed his valet's directions implicitly and bidding sam follow him entered the tavern he had pointed out where the hot brandy and water was speedily placed before him while mr weller seated at a respectful distance though at the same table with his master was accommodated with a pint of porter the room was one of a very homely description and was apparently under the especial patronage of stage coachmen for several gentlemen who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession were drinking and smoking in the different boxes among the number was one stout red faced elderly man in particular seated in an opposite box who attracted mr pickwick's attention the stout man was smoking with great vehemence but between every half dozen puffs he took his pipe from his mouth and looked first at mr weller and then at mr pickwick then he would bury in a quart pot as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving and take another look at sam and mr pickwick then he would take another half dozen puffs with an air of profound meditation and look at them again at last the stout man putting up his legs on the seat and leaning his back against the wall began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all and to stare through the smoke at the new comers as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them at first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped mr weller's observation but by degrees as he saw mr pickwick's eyes every now and then turning towards him he began to gaze in the same direction at the same time shading his eyes with his hand as if he partially recognised the object before him and wished to make quite sure of its identity his doubts were speedily dispelled however for the stout man having blown a thick cloud from his pipe a hoarse voice like some strange effort of ventriloquism emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his throat and chest and slowly uttered these sounds wy sammy who's that sam inquired mr pickwick why i wouldn't ha' believed it sir replied mr weller with astonished eyes it's the old 'un old one said mr pickwick what old one my father sir replied mr weller how are you my ancient with which beautiful ebullition of filial affection mr weller made room on the seat beside him for the stout man who advanced pipe in mouth and pot in hand to greet him wy sammy said the father i ha'n't seen you for two years and better nor more you have old codger replied the son how's mother in law wy i'll tell you what sammy said mr weller senior with much solemnity in his manner there never was a nicer woman as a widder than that 'ere second wentur o' mine a sweet creetur she was sammy all i can say on her now is that as she was such an uncommon pleasant widder it's a great pity she ever changed her con dition she don't act as a vife sammy don't she though inquired mr weller junior the elder mr weller shook his head as he replied with a sigh i've done it once too often sammy i've done it once too often take example by your father my boy and be wery careful o' widders all your life specially if they've kept a public house sammy having delivered this parental advice with great pathos mr weller senior re filled his pipe from a tin box he carried in his pocket and lighting his fresh pipe from the ashes of the old one commenced smoking at a great rate beg your pardon sir he said renewing the subject and addressing mr pickwick after a considerable pause nothin' personal i hope sir i hope you ha'n't got a widder sir not i replied mr pickwick laughing and while mr pickwick laughed sam weller informed his parent in a whisper of the relation in which he stood towards that gentleman beg your pardon sir said mr weller senior taking off his hat i hope you've no fault to find vith sammy sir none whatever said mr pickwick wery glad to hear it sir replied the old man i took a good deal o' pains with his eddication sir let him run in the streets when he was wery young and shift for his self it's the only way to make a boy sharp sir rather a dangerous process i should imagine said mr pickwick with a smile and not a very sure one either added mr weller i got reg'larly done the other day no said his father illustration take example of your father my boy and be wery careful o' widders all your life i did said the son and he proceeded to relate in as few words as possible how he had fallen a ready dupe to the stratagems of job trotter mr weller senior listened to the tale with the most profound attention and at its termination said worn't one of these chaps slim and tall with long hair and the gift o' the gab wery gallopin' mr pickwick did not quite understand the last item of description but comprehending the first said yes at a venture t'other's a black haired chap in mulberry livery with a wery large head yes yes he is said mr pickwick and sam with great earnestness then i know where they are and that's all about it said mr weller they're at ipswich safe enough them two no said mr pickwick fact said mr weller and i'll tell you how i know it i work an ipswich coach now and then for a friend o' mine i worked down the wery day arter the night as you caught the rheumatiz and at the black boy at chelmsford the very place they'd come to i took 'em up right through to ipswich where the man servant him in the mulberries told me they was a goin' to put up for a long time i'll follow him said mr pickwick we may as well see ipswich as any other place i'll follow him you're quite certain it was them governor inquired mr weller junior quite sammy quite replied his father for their appearance is wery sing'ler besides that 'ere i wondered to see the gen'l'm'n so familiar with his servant and more than that as they sat in front right behind the box i heerd 'em laughing and saying how they'd done old fireworks old who said mr pickwick old fireworks sir by which i've no doubt they meant you sir there is nothing positively vile or atrocious in the appellation of old fireworks but still it is by no means a respectful or flattering designation the recollection of all the wrongs he had sustained at jingle's hands had crowded on mr pickwick's mind the moment mr weller began to speak it wanted but a feather to turn the scale and old fireworks did it i'll follow him said mr pickwick with an emphatic blow on the table i shall work down to ipswich the day arter to morrow sir said mr weller the elder from the bull in whitechapel and if you really mean to go you'd better go with me so we had said mr pickwick very true i can write to bury and tell them to meet me at ipswich we will go with you but don't hurry away mr weller won't you take anything you're wery good sir replied mr weller stopping short perhaps a small glass of brandy to drink your health and success to sammy sir wouldn't be amiss certainly not replied mr pickwick a glass of brandy here the brandy was brought and mr weller after pulling his hair to mr pickwick and nodding to sam jerked it down his capacious throat as if it had been a small thimbleful well done father said sam take care old fellow or you'll have a touch of your old complaint the gout i've found a sov'rin cure for that sammy said mr weller setting down the glass a sovereign cure for the gout said mr pickwick hastily producing his note book what is it the gout sir replied mr weller the gout is a complaint as arises from too much ease and comfort if ever you're attacked with the gout sir jist you marry a widder as has got a good loud woice with a decent notion of usin' it and you'll never have the gout again it's a capital prescription sir i takes it reg'lar and i can warrant it to drive away any illness as is caused by too much jollity having imparted this valuable secret mr weller drained his glass once more produced a laboured wink sighed deeply and slowly retired well what do you think of what your father says sam inquired mr pickwick with a smile think sir replied mr weller why i think he's the wictim o' connubiality as blue beard's domestic chaplain said with a tear of pity ven he buried him there was no replying to this very apposite conclusion and therefore mr pickwick after settling the reckoning resumed his walk to gray's inn by the time he reached its secluded groves however eight o'clock had struck and the unbroken stream of gentlemen in muddy high lows soiled white hats and rusty apparel who were pouring towards the different avenues of egress warned him that the majority of the offices had closed for that day after climbing two pairs of steep and dirty stairs he found his anticipations were realised mr perker's outer door was closed and the dead silence which followed mr weller's repeated kicks thereat announced that the officials had retired from business for the night this is pleasant sam said mr pickwick i shouldn't lose an hour in seeing him i shall not be able to get one wink of sleep to night i know unless i have the satisfaction of reflecting that i have confided this matter to a professional man here's an old 'ooman comin' up stairs sir replied mr weller p'raps she knows where we can find somebody hallo old lady vere's mr perker's people mr perker's people said a thin miserable looking old woman stopping to recover breath after the ascent of the staircase mr perker's people's gone and i'm a goin' to do the office out are you mr perker's servant inquired mr pickwick i am mr perker's laundress replied the old woman ah said mr pickwick half aside to sam it's a curious circumstance sam that they call the old women in these inns laundresses i wonder what that's for 'cos they has a mortal awersion to washing anythin' i suppose sir replied mr weller i shouldn't wonder said mr pickwick looking at the old woman whose appearance as well as the condition of the office which she had by this time opened indicated a rooted antipathy to the application of soap and water do you know where i can find mr perker my good woman no i don't replied the old woman gruffly he's out o' town now that's unfortunate said mr pickwick where's his clerk do you know yes i know where he is but he won't thank me for telling you replied the laundress i have very particular business with him said mr pickwick won't it do in the morning said the woman not so well replied mr pickwick well said the old woman if it was anything very particular i was to say where he was so i suppose there's no harm in telling if you just go to the magpie and stump and ask at the bar for mr lowten they'll show you in to him and he's mr perker's clerk with this direction and having been furthermore informed that the hostelry in question was situated in a court happy in the double advantage of being in the vicinity of clare market and closely approximating to the back of new inn mr pickwick and sam descended the rickety staircase in safety and issued forth in quest of the magpie and stump this favoured tavern sacred to the evening orgies of mr lowten and his companions was what ordinary people would designate a public house that the landlord was a man of a money making turn was sufficiently testified by the fact of a small bulkhead beneath the tap room window in size and shape not unlike a sedan chair being underlet to a mender of shoes and that he was a being of a philanthropic mind was evident from the protection he afforded to a pie man who vended his delicacies without fear of interruption on the very door step in the lower windows which were decorated with curtains of a saffron hue dangled two or three printed cards bearing reference to devonshire cider and dantzig spruce while a large black board announcing in white letters to an enlightened public that there were barrels of double stout in the cellars of the establishment left the mind in a state of not unpleasing doubt and uncertainty as to the precise direction in the bowels of the earth in which this mighty cavern might be supposed to extend when we add that the weather beaten signboard bore the half obliterated semblance of a magpie intently eyeing a crooked streak of brown paint which the neighbours had been taught from infancy to consider as the stump we have said all that need be said of the exterior of the edifice on mr pickwick's presenting himself at the bar an elderly female emerged from behind a screen therein and presented herself before him is mr lowten here ma'am inquired mr pickwick yes he is sir replied the landlady here charley show the gentleman in to mr lowten the gen'lm'n can't go in just now said a shambling pot boy with a red head 'cos mr lowten's a singin' a comic song and he'll put him out he'll be done d'rectly sir the red headed pot boy had scarcely finished speaking when a most unanimous hammering of tables and jingling of glasses announced that the song had that instant terminated and mr pickwick after desiring sam to solace himself in the tap suffered himself to be conducted into the presence of mr lowten at the announcement of gentleman to speak to you sir a puffy faced young man who filled the chair at the head of the table looked with some surprise in the direction from whence the voice proceeded and the surprise seemed to be by no means diminished when his eyes rested on an individual whom he had never seen before i beg your pardon sir said mr pickwick and i am very sorry to disturb the other gentlemen too but i come on very particular business and if you will suffer me to detain you at this end of the room for five minutes i shall be very much obliged to you the puffy faced young man rose and drawing a chair close to mr pickwick in an obscure corner of the room listened attentively to his tale of woe ah he said when mr pickwick had concluded dodson and fogg sharp practice theirs capital men of business dodson and fogg sir mr pickwick admitted the sharp practice of dodson and fogg and lowten resumed perker ain't in town and he won't be neither before the end of next week but if you want the action defended and will leave the copy with me i can do all that's needful till he comes back that's exactly what i came here for said mr pickwick handing over the document if anything particular occurs you can write to me at the post office ipswich that's all right replied mr perker's clerk and then seeing mr pickwick's eye wandering curiously towards the table he added will you join us for half an hour or so we are capital company here to night there's samkin and green's managing clerk and smithers and price's chancery and pimkin and thomas's out o' door sings a capital song he does and jack bamber and ever so many more you're come out of the country i suppose would you like to join us mr pickwick could not resist so tempting an opportunity of studying human nature he suffered himself to be led to the table where after having been introduced to the company in due form he was accommodated with a seat near the chairman and called for a glass of his favourite beverage a profound silence quite contrary to mr pickwick's expectation succeeded you don't find this sort of thing disagreeable i hope sir said his right hand neighbour a gentleman in a checked shirt and mosaic studs with a cigar in his mouth not in the least replied mr pickwick i like it very much although i am no smoker myself i should be very sorry to say i wasn't interposed another gentleman on the opposite side of the table it's board and lodging to me is smoke mr pickwick glanced at the speaker and thought that if it were washing too it would be all the better here there was another pause mr pickwick was a stranger and his coming had evidently cast a damp upon the party mr grundy's going to oblige the company with a song said the chairman no he ain't said mr grundy why not said the chairman because he can't said mr grundy you had better say he won't replied the chairman well then he won't retorted mr grundy mr grundy's positive refusal to gratify the company occasioned another silence won't anybody enliven us said the chairman despondingly why don't you enliven us yourself mr chairman said a young man with a whisker a squint and an open shirt collar dirty from the bottom of the table hear hear said the smoking gentleman in the mosaic jewellery because i only know one song and i have sung it already and it's a fine of 'glasses round' to sing the same song twice in a night replied the chairman this was an unanswerable reply and silence prevailed again i have been to night gentlemen said mr pickwick hoping to start a subject which all the company could take a part in discussing i have been to night in a place which you all know very well doubtless but which i have not been in before for some years and know very little of i mean gray's inn gentlemen curious little nooks in a great place like london these old inns are by jove said the chairman whispering across the table to mr pickwick you have hit upon something that one of us at least would talk upon for ever you'll draw old jack bamber out he was never heard to talk about anything else but the inns and he has lived alone in them till he's half crazy the individual to whom lowten alluded was a little yellow high shouldered man whose countenance from his habit of stooping forward when silent mr pickwick had not observed before he wondered though when the old man raised his shrivelled face and bent his grey eye upon him with a keen inquiring look that such remarkable features could have escaped his attention for a moment there was a fixed grim smile perpetually on his countenance he leant his chin on a long skinny hand with nails of extraordinary length and as he inclined his head to one side and looked keenly out from beneath his ragged grey eyebrows there was a strange wild slyness in his leer quite repulsive to behold this was the figure that now started forward and burst into an animated torrent of words as this chapter has been a long one however and as the old man was a remarkable personage it will be more respectful to him and more convenient to us to let him speak for himself in a fresh one chapter xxi illustration in which the old man launches forth into his favourite theme and relates a story about a queer client aha said the old man a brief description of whose manner and appearance concluded the last chapter aha who was talking about the inns i was sir replied mr pickwick i was observing what singular old places they are you said the old man contemptuously what do you know of the time when young men shut themselves up in those lonely rooms and read and read hour after hour and night after night till their reason wandered beneath their midnight studies till their mental powers were exhausted till morning's light brought no freshness or health to them and they sank beneath the unnatural devotion of their youthful energies to their dry old books coming down to a later time and a very different day what do you know of the gradual sinking beneath consumption or the quick wasting of fever the grand results of 'life' and dissipation which men have undergone in these same rooms how many vain pleaders for mercy do you think have turned away heart sick from the lawyer's office to find a resting place in the thames or a refuge in the gaol they are no ordinary houses those there is not a panel in the old wainscoting but what if it were endowed with the powers of speech and memory could start from the wall and tell its tale of horror the romance of life sir the romance of life commonplace as they may seem now i tell you they are strange old places and i would rather hear many a legend with a terrific sounding name than the true history of one old set of chambers there was something so odd in the old man's sudden energy and the subject which had called it forth that mr pickwick was prepared with no observation in reply and the old man checking his impetuosity and resuming the leer which had disappeared during his previous excitement said look at them in another light their most commonplace and least romantic what fine places of slow torture they are think of the needy man who has spent his all beggared himself and pinched his friends to enter the profession which will never yield him a morsel of bread the waiting the hope the disappointment the fear the misery the poverty the blight on his hopes and end to his career the suicide perhaps or the shabby slipshod drunkard am i not right about them and the old man rubbed his hands and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject mr pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity and the remainder of the company smiled and looked on in silence talk of your german universities said the little old man pooh pooh there's romance enough at home without going half a mile for it only people never think of it i never thought of the romance of this particular subject before certainly said mr pickwick laughing to be sure you didn't said the little old man of course not as a friend of mine used to say to me 'what is there in chambers in particular' 'queer old places' said i 'not at all' said he 'lonely' said i 'not a bit of it' said he he died one morning of apoplexy as he was going to open his outer door fell with his head in his own letter box and there he lay for eighteen months everybody thought he'd gone out of town and how was he found at last inquired mr pickwick the benchers determined to have his door broken open as he hadn't paid any rent for two years so they did forced the lock and a very dusty skeleton in a blue coat black knee shorts and silks fell forward in the arms of the porter who opened the door queer that rather perhaps the little old man put his head more on one side and rubbed his hands with unspeakable glee i know another case said the little old man when his chuckles had in some degree subsided it occurred in clifford's inn tenant of a top set bad character shut himself up in his bed room closet and took a dose of arsenic the steward thought he had run away opened the door and put a bill up another man came took the chambers furnished them and went to live there somehow or other he couldn't sleep always restless and uncomfortable 'odd' says he 'i'll make the other room my bed chamber and this my sitting room' he made the change and slept very well at night but suddenly found that somehow he couldn't read in the evening he got nervous and uncomfortable and used to be always snuffing his candles and staring about him 'i can't make this out' said he when he came home from the play one night and was drinking a glass of cold grog with his back to the wall in order that he mightn't be able to fancy there was any one behind him 'i can't make it out' said he and just then his eyes rested on the little closet that had been always locked up and a shudder ran through his whole frame from top to toe 'i have felt this strange feeling before' said he 'i cannot help thinking there's something wrong about that closet' he made a strong effort plucked up his courage shivered the lock with a blow or two of the poker opened the door and there sure enough standing bolt upright in the corner was the last tenant with a little bottle clasped firmly in his hand and his face well as the little old man concluded he looked round on the attentive faces of his wondering auditory with a smile of grim delight what strange things these are you tell us of sir said mr pickwick minutely scanning the old man's countenance by the aid of his glasses strange said the little old man nonsense you think them strange because you know nothing about it they are funny but not uncommon funny exclaimed mr pickwick involuntarily yes funny are they not replied the little old man with a diabolical leer and then without pausing for an answer he continued i knew another man let me see forty years ago now who took an old damp rotten set of chambers in one of the most ancient inns that had been shut up and empty for years and years before there were lots of old women's stories about the place and it certainly was very far from being a cheerful one but he was poor and the rooms were cheap and that would have been quite a sufficient reason for him if they had been ten times worse than they really were he was obliged to take some mouldering fixtures that were on the place and among the rest was a great lumbering wooden press for papers with large glass doors and a green curtain inside a pretty useless thing for him for he had no papers to put in it and as to his clothes he carried them about with him and that wasn't very hard work either well he had moved in all his furniture it wasn't quite a truck full and had sprinkled it about the room so as to make the four chairs look as much like a dozen as possible and was sitting down before the fire at night drinking the first glass of two gallons of whisky he had ordered on credit wondering whether it would ever be paid for and if so in how many years' time when his eyes encountered the glass doors of the wooden press 'ah' says he 'if i hadn't been obliged to take that ugly article at the old broker's valuation i might have got something comfortable for the money i'll tell you what it is old fellow' he said speaking aloud to the press having nothing else to speak to 'if it wouldn't cost more to break up your old carcase than it would ever be worth afterwards i'd have a fire out of you in less than no time' he had hardly spoken the words when a sound resembling a faint groan appeared to issue from the interior of the case it startled him at first but thinking on a moment's reflection that it must be some young fellow in the next chamber who had been dining out he put his feet on the fender and raised the poker to stir the fire at that moment the sound was repeated and one of the glass doors slowly opening disclosed a pale and emaciated figure in soiled and worn apparel standing erect in the press the figure was tall and thin and the countenance expressive of care and anxiety but there was something in the hue of the skin and gaunt and unearthly appearance of the whole form which no being of this world was ever seen to wear 'who are you' said the new tenant turning very pale poising the poker in his hand however and taking a very decent aim at the countenance of the figure 'who are you' 'don't throw that poker at me' replied the form 'if you hurled it with ever so sure an aim it would pass through me without resistance and expend its force on the wood behind i am a spirit' 'and pray what do you want here' faltered the tenant 'in this room' replied the apparition 'my worldly ruin was worked and i and my children beggared in this press the papers in a long long suit which accumulated for years were deposited in this room when i had died of grief and long deferred hope two wily harpies divided the wealth for which i had contested during a wretched existence and of which at last not one farthing was left for my unhappy descendants i terrified them from the spot and since that day have prowled by night the only period at which i can revisit the earth about the scenes of my long protracted misery this apartment is mine leave it to me' 'if you insist upon making your appearance here' said the tenant who had had time to collect his presence of mind during this prosy statement of the ghost's 'i shall give up possession with the greatest pleasure but i should like to ask you one question if you will allow me' 'say on' said the apparition sternly 'well' said the tenant 'i don't apply the observation personally to you because it is equally applicable to most of the ghosts i ever heard of but it does appear to me somewhat inconsistent that when you have an opportunity of visiting the fairest spots of earth for i suppose space is nothing to you you should always return exactly to the very places where you have been most miserable' 'egad that's very true i never thought of that before' said the ghost 'you see sir' pursued the tenant 'this is a very uncomfortable room from the appearance of that press i should be disposed to say that it is not wholly free from bugs and i really think you might find much more comfortable quarters to say nothing of the climate of london which is extremely disagreeable' 'you are very right sir' said the ghost politely 'it never struck me till now i'll try change of air directly' in fact he began to vanish as he spoke his legs indeed had quite disappeared 'and if sir' said the tenant calling after him 'if you would have the goodness to suggest to the other ladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting old empty houses that they might be much more comfortable elsewhere you will confer a very great benefit on society' 'i will' replied the ghost 'we must be dull fellows very dull fellows indeed i can't imagine how we can have been so stupid' with these words the spirit disappeared and what is rather remarkable added the old man with a shrewd look round the table he never came back again that ain't bad if it's true said the man in the mosaic studs lighting a fresh cigar if exclaimed the old man with a look of excessive contempt i suppose he added turning to lowten he'll say next that my story about the queer client we had when i was in an attorney's office is not true either i shouldn't wonder i shan't venture to say anything at all about it seeing that i never heard the story observed the owner of the mosaic decorations i wish you would repeat it sir said mr pickwick ah do said lowten nobody has heard it but me and i have nearly forgotten it the old man looked round the table and leered more horribly than ever as if in triumph at the attention which was depicted in every face then rubbing his chin with his hand and looking up to the ceiling as if to recall the circumstances to his memory he began as follows the old man's tale about the queer client it matters little said the old man where or how i picked up this brief history if i were to relate it in the order in which it reached me i should commence in the middle and when i had arrived at the conclusion go back for a beginning it is enough for me to say that some of the circumstances passed before my own eyes for the remainder i know them to have happened and there are some persons yet living who will remember them but too well in the borough high street near st george's church and on the same side of the way stands as most people know the smallest of our debtors' prisons the marshalsea although in later times it has been a very different place from the sink of filth and dirt it once was even its improved condition holds out but little temptation to the extravagant or consolation to the improvident the condemned felon has as good a yard for air and exercise in newgate as the insolvent debtor in the marshalsea prison better but this is past in a better age and the prison exists no longer it may be my fancy or it may be that i cannot separate the place from the old recollections associated with it but this part of london i cannot bear the street is broad the shops are spacious the noise of passing vehicles the footsteps of a perpetual stream of people all the busy sounds of traffic resound in it from morn to midnight but the streets around are mean and close poverty and debauchery lie festering in the crowded alleys want and misfortune are pent up in the narrow prison an air of gloom and dreariness seems in my eyes at least to hang about the scene and to impart to it a squalid and sickly hue many eyes that have long since been closed in the grave have looked round upon that scene lightly enough when entering the gate of the old marshalsea prison for the first time for despair seldom comes with the first severe shock of misfortune a man has confidence in untried friends he remembers the many offers of service so freely made by his boon companions when he wanted them not he has hope the hope of happy inexperience and however he may bend beneath the first shock it springs up in his bosom and flourishes there for a brief space until it droops beneath the blight of disappointment and neglect how soon have those same eyes deeply sunken in the head glared from faces wasted with famine and sallow from confinement in days when it was no figure of speech to say that debtors rotted in prison with no hope of release and no prospect of liberty the atrocity in its full extent no longer exists but there is enough of it left to give rise to occurrences that make the heart bleed twenty years ago that pavement was worn with the footsteps of a mother and child who day by day so surely as the morning came presented themselves at the prison gate often after a night of restless misery and anxious thoughts were they there a full hour too soon and then the young mother turning meekly away would lead the child to the old bridge and raising him in her arms to show him the glistening water tinted with the light of the morning's sun and stirring with all the bustling preparations for business and pleasure that the river presented at that early hour endeavour to interest his thoughts in the objects before him but she would quickly set him down and hiding her face in her shawl give vent to the tears that blinded her for no expression of interest or amusement lighted up his thin and sickly face his recollections were few enough but they were all of one kind all connected with the poverty and misery of his parents hour after hour had he sat on his mother's knee and with childish sympathy watched the tears that stole down her face and then crept quietly away into some dark corner and sobbed himself to sleep the hard realities of the world with many of its worst privations hunger and thirst and cold and want had all come home to him from the first dawnings of reason and though the form of childhood was there its light heart its merry laugh and sparkling eyes were wanting the father and mother looked on upon this and upon each other with thoughts of agony they dared not breathe in words the healthy strong made man who could have borne almost any fatigue of active exertion was wasting beneath the close confinement and unhealthy atmosphere of a crowded prison the slight and delicate woman was sinking beneath the combined effects of bodily and mental illness the child's young heart was breaking winter came and with it weeks of cold and heavy rain the poor girl had removed to a wretched apartment close to the spot of her husband's imprisonment and though the change had been rendered necessary by their increasing poverty she was happier now for she was nearer him for two months she and her little companion watched the opening of the gate as usual one day she failed to come for the first time another morning arrived and she came alone the child was dead they little know who coldly talk of the poor man's bereavements as a happy release from pain to the departed and a merciful relief from expense to the survivor they little know i say what the agony of those bereavements is a silent look of affection and regard when all other eyes are turned coldly away the consciousness that we possess the sympathy and affection of one being when all others have deserted us is a hold a stay a comfort in the deepest affliction which no wealth could purchase or power bestow the child had sat at his parents' feet for hours together with his little hands patiently folded in each other and his thin wan face raised towards them they had seen him pine away from day to day and though his brief existence had been a joyless one and he was now removed to that peace and rest which child as he was he had never known in this world they were his parents and his loss sunk deep into their souls it was plain to those who looked upon the mother's altered face that death must soon close the scene of her adversity and trial her husband's fellow prisoners shrunk from obtruding on his grief and misery and left to himself alone the small room he had previously occupied in common with two companions she shared it with him and lingering on without pain but without hope her life ebbed slowly away she had fainted one evening in her husband's arms and he had borne her to the open window to revive her with the air when the light of the moon falling full upon her face showed him a change upon her features which made him stagger beneath her weight like a helpless infant 'set me down george' she said faintly he did so and seating himself beside her covered his face with his hands and burst into tears 'it is very hard to leave you george' she said 'but it is god's will and you must bear it for my sake oh how i thank him for having taken our boy he is happy and in heaven now what would he have done here without his mother' 'you shall not die mary you shall not die' said the husband starting up he paced hurriedly to and fro striking his head with his clenched fists then reseating himself beside her and supporting her in his arms added more calmly 'rouse yourself my dear girl pray pray do you will revive yet' 'never again george never again' said the dying woman 'let them lay me by my poor boy now but promise me that if ever you leave this dreadful place and should grow rich you will have us removed to some quiet country churchyard a long long way off very far from here where we can rest in peace dear george promise me you will' 'i do i do' said the man throwing himself passionately on his knees before her 'speak to me mary another word one look but one' he ceased to speak for the arm that clasped his neck grew stiff and heavy a deep sigh escaped from the wasted form before him the lips moved and a smile played upon the face but the lips were pallid and the smile faded into a rigid and ghastly stare he was alone in the world that night in the silence and desolation of his miserable room the wretched man knelt down by the dead body of his wife and called on god to witness a terrible oath that from that hour he devoted himself to revenge her death and that of his child that thenceforth to the last moment of his life his whole energies should be directed to this one object that his revenge should be protracted and terrible that his hatred should be undying and inextinguishable and should hunt its object through the world the deepest despair and passion scarcely human had made such fierce ravages on his face and form in that one night that his companions in misfortune shrunk affrighted from him as he passed by his eyes were bloodshot and heavy his face a deadly white and his body bent as if with age he had bitten his under lip nearly through in the violence of his mental suffering and the blood which had flowed from the wound had trickled down his chin and stained his shirt and neckerchief no tear or sound of complaint escaped him but the unsettled look and disordered haste with which he paced up and down the yard denoted the fever which was burning within it was necessary that his wife's body should be removed from the prison without delay he received the communication with perfect calmness and acquiesced in its propriety nearly all the inmates of the prison had assembled to witness its removal they fell back on either side when the widower appeared he walked hurriedly forward and stationed himself alone in a little railed area close to the lodge gate from whence the crowd with an instinctive feeling of delicacy had retired the rude coffin was borne slowly forward on men's shoulders a dead silence pervaded the throng broken only by the audible lamentations of the women and the shuffling steps of the bearers on the stone pavement they reached the spot where the bereaved husband stood and stopped he laid his hand upon the coffin and mechanically adjusting the pall with which it was covered motioned them onward the turnkeys in the prison lobby took off their hats as it passed through and in another moment the heavy gate closed behind it he looked vacantly upon the crowd and fell heavily to the ground although for many weeks after this he was watched night and day in the wildest ravings of fever neither the consciousness of his loss nor the recollection of the vow he had made ever left him for a moment scenes changed before his eyes place succeeded place and event followed event in all the hurry of delirium but they were all connected in some way with the great object of his mind he was sailing over a boundless expanse of sea with a blood red sky above and the angry waters lashed into fury beneath boiled and eddied up on every side there was another vessel before them toiling and labouring in the howling storm her canvas fluttering in ribbons from the mast and her deck thronged with figures who were lashed to the sides over which huge waves every instant burst sweeping away some devoted creatures into the foaming sea onward they bore amidst the roaring mass of water with a speed and force which nothing could resist and striking the stern of the foremost vessel crushed her beneath their keel from the huge whirlpool which the sinking wreck occasioned arose a shriek so loud and shrill the death cry of a hundred drowning creatures blended into one fierce yell that it rung far above the war cry of the elements and echoed and re echoed till it seemed to pierce air sky and ocean but what was that that old grey head that rose above the water's surface and with looks of agony and screams for aid buffeted with the waves one look and he had sprung from the vessel's side and with vigorous strokes was swimming towards it he reached it he was close upon it they were his features the old man saw him coming and vainly strove to elude his grasp but he clasped him tight and dragged him beneath the water down down with him fifty fathoms down his struggles grew fainter and fainter until they wholly ceased he was dead he had killed him and had kept his oath he was traversing the scorching sands of a mighty desert barefoot and alone the sand choked and blinded him its fine thin grains entered the very pores of his skin and irritated him almost to madness gigantic masses of the same material carried forward by the wind and shone through by the burning sun stalked in the distance like pillars of living fire the bones of men who had perished in the dreary waste lay scattered at his feet a fearful light fell on everything around so far as the eye could reach nothing but objects of dread and horror presented themselves vainly striving to utter a cry of terror with his tongue cleaving to his mouth he rushed madly forward armed with supernatural strength he waded through the sand until exhausted with fatigue and thirst he fell senseless on the earth what fragrant coolness revived him what gushing sound was that water it was indeed a well and the clear fresh stream was running at his feet he drank deeply of it and throwing his aching limbs upon the bank sunk into a delicious trance the sound of approaching footsteps roused him an old grey headed man tottered forward to slake his burning thirst it was he again he wound his arms round the old man's body and held him back he struggled and shrieked for water for but one drop of water to save his life but he held the old man firmly and watched his agonies with greedy eyes and when his lifeless head fell forward on his bosom he rolled the corpse from him with his feet when the fever had left him and consciousness returned he awoke to find himself rich and free to hear that the parent who would have let him die in gaol would who had let those who were far dearer to him than his own existence die of want and sickness of heart that medicine cannot cure had been found dead on his bed of down he had had all the heart to leave his son a beggar but proud even of his health and strength had put off the act till it was too late and now might gnash his teeth in the other world at the thought of the wealth his remissness had left him he awoke to this and he awoke to more to recollect the purpose for which he lived and to remember that his enemy was his wife's own father the man who had cast him into prison and who when his daughter and her child sued at his feet for mercy had spurned them from his door oh how he cursed the weakness that prevented him from being up and active in his scheme of vengeance he caused himself to be carried from the scene of his loss and misery and conveyed to a quiet residence on the sea coast not in the hope of recovering his peace of mind or happiness for both were fled for ever but to restore his prostrate energies and meditate on his darling object and here some evil spirit cast in his way the opportunity for his first most horrible revenge it was summer time and wrapped in his gloomy thoughts he would issue from his solitary lodgings early in the evening and wandering along a narrow path beneath the cliffs to a wild and lonely spot that had struck his fancy in his ramblings seat himself on some fallen fragment of the rock and burying his face in his hands remain there for hours sometimes until night had completely closed in and the long shadows of the frowning cliffs above his head cast a thick black darkness on every object near him he was seated here one calm evening in his old position now and then raising his head to watch the flight of a sea gull or carry his eye along the glorious crimson path which commencing in the middle of the ocean seemed to lead to its very verge where the sun was setting when the profound stillness of the spot was broken by a loud cry for help he listened doubtful of his having heard aright when the cry was repeated with even greater vehemence than before and starting to his feet he hastened in the direction whence it proceeded the tale told itself at once some scattered garments lay on the beach a human head was just visible above the waves at a little distance from the shore and an old man wringing his hands in agony was running to and fro shrieking for assistance the invalid whose strength was now sufficiently restored threw off his coat and rushed towards the sea with the intention of plunging in and dragging the drowning man ashore 'hasten here sir in god's name help help sir for the love of heaven he is my son sir my only son' said the old man frantically as he advanced to meet him 'my only son sir and he is dying before his father's eyes' at the first word the old man uttered the stranger checked himself in his career and folding his arms stood perfectly motionless 'great god' exclaimed the old man recoiling 'heyling' the stranger smiled and was silent 'heyling' said the old man wildly 'my boy heyling my dear boy look look' gasping for breath the miserable father pointed to the spot where the young man was struggling for life 'hark' said the old man 'he cries once more he is alive yet heyling save him save him' the stranger smiled again and remained immovable as a statue 'i have wronged you' shrieked the old man falling on his knees and clasping his hands together 'be revenged take my all my life cast me into the water at your feet and if human nature can repress a struggle i will die without stirring hand or foot do it heyling do it but save my boy he is so young heyling so young to die' 'listen' said the stranger grasping the old man fiercely by the wrist 'i will have life for life and here is one my child died before his father's eyes a far more agonising and painful death than that young slanderer of his sister's worth is meeting while i speak you laughed laughed in your daughter's face where death had already set his hand at our sufferings then what think you of them now see there see there' as the stranger spoke he pointed to the sea a faint cry died away upon its surface the last powerful struggle of the dying man agitated the rippling waves for a few seconds and the spot where he had gone down into his early grave was undistinguishable from the surrounding water three years had elapsed when a gentleman alighted from a private carriage at the door of a london attorney then well known as a man of no great nicety in his professional dealings and requested a private interview on business of importance although evidently not past the prime of life his face was pale haggard and dejected and it did not require the acute perception of the man of business to discern at a glance that disease or suffering had done more to work a change in his appearance than the mere hand of time could have accomplished in twice the period of his whole life 'i wish you to undertake some legal business for me' said the stranger the attorney bowed obsequiously and glanced at a large packet which the gentleman carried in his hand his visitor observed the look and proceeded 'it is no common business' said he 'nor have these papers reached my hands without long trouble and great expense' the attorney cast a still more anxious look at the packet and his visitor untying the string that bound it disclosed a quantity of promissory notes with copies of deeds and other documents 'upon these papers' said the client 'the man whose name they bear has raised as you will see large sums of money for some years past there was a tacit understanding between him and the men into whose hands they originally went and from whom i have by degrees purchased the whole for treble and quadruple their nominal value that these loans should be from time to time renewed until a given period had elapsed such an understanding is nowhere expressed he has sustained many losses of late and these obligations accumulating upon him at once would crush him to the earth' 'the whole amount is many thousands of pounds' said the attorney looking over the papers 'it is' said the client 'what are we to do' inquired the man of business 'do' replied the client with sudden vehemence 'put every engine of the law in force every trick that ingenuity can devise and rascality execute fair means and foul the open oppression of the law aided by all the craft of its most ingenious practitioners i would have him die a harassing and lingering death ruin him seize and sell his lands and goods drive him from house and home and drag him forth a beggar in his old age to die in a common gaol' 'but the costs my dear sir the costs of all this' reasoned the attorney when he had recovered from his momentary surprise 'if the defendant be a man of straw who is to pay the costs sir' 'name any sum' said the stranger his hand trembling so violently with excitement that he could scarcely hold the pen he seized as he spoke 'any sum and it is yours don't be afraid to name it man i shall not think it dear if you gain my object' the attorney named a large sum at hazard as the advance he should require to secure himself against the possibility of loss but more with the view of ascertaining how far his client was really disposed to go than with any idea that he would comply with the demand the stranger wrote a cheque upon his banker for the whole amount and left him the draft was duly honoured and the attorney finding that his strange client might be safely relied upon commenced his work in earnest for more than two years afterwards mr heyling would sit whole days together in the office poring over the papers as they accumulated and reading again and again his eyes gleaming with joy the letters of remonstrance the prayers for a little delay the representations of the certain ruin in which the opposite party must be involved which poured in as suit after suit and process after process was commenced to all applications for a brief indulgence there was but one reply the money must be paid land house furniture each in its turn was taken under some one of the numerous executions which were issued and the old man himself would have been immured in prison had he not escaped the vigilance of the officers and fled the implacable animosity of heyling so far from being satiated by the success of his persecution increased a hundredfold with the ruin he inflicted on being informed of the old man's flight his fury was unbounded he gnashed his teeth with rage tore the hair from his head and assailed with horrid imprecations the men who had been entrusted with the writ he was only restored to comparative calmness by repeated assurances of the certainty of discovering the fugitive agents were sent in quest of him in all directions every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for the purpose of discovering his place of retreat but it was all in vain half a year had passed over and he was still undiscovered at length late one night heyling of whom nothing had been seen for many weeks before appeared at his attorney's private residence and sent up word that a gentleman wished to see him instantly before the attorney who had recognised his voice from above stairs could order the servant to admit him he had rushed up the staircase and entered the drawing room pale and breathless having closed the door to prevent being overheard he sunk into a chair and said in a low voice 'hush i have found him at last' 'no' said the attorney 'well done my dear sir well done' 'he lies concealed in a wretched lodging in camden town' said heyling 'perhaps it is as well we did lose sight of him for he has been living alone there in the most abject misery all the time and he is poor very poor' 'very good' said the attorney 'you will have the caption made to morrow of course' 'yes' replied heyling 'stay no the next day you are surprised at my wishing to postpone it' he added with a ghastly smile 'but i had forgotten the next day is an anniversary in his life let it be done then' 'very good' said the attorney 'will you write down instructions for the officer' 'no let him meet me here at eight in the evening and i will accompany him myself' they met on the appointed night and hiring a hackney coach directed the driver to stop at that corner of the old pancras road at which stands the parish workhouse by the time they alighted there it was quite dark and proceeding by the dead wall in front of the veterinary hospital they entered a small by street which is or was at that time called little college street and which whatever it may be now was in those days a desolate place enough surrounded by little else than fields and ditches having drawn the travelling cap he had on half over his face and muffled himself in his cloak heyling stopped before the meanest looking house in the street and knocked gently at the door it was opened at once by a woman who dropped a curtsey of recognition and heyling whispering the officer to remain below crept gently up stairs and opening the door of the front room entered at once the object of his search and his unrelenting animosity now a decrepid old man was seated at a bare deal table on which stood a miserable candle he started on the entrance of the stranger and rose feebly to his feet 'what now what now' said the old man 'what fresh misery is this what do you want here' 'a word with you' replied heyling as he spoke he seated himself at the other end of the table and throwing off his cloak and cap disclosed his features the old man seemed instantly deprived of the power of speech he fell backward in his chair and clasping his hands together gazed on the apparition with a mingled look of abhorrence and fear 'this day six years' said heyling 'i claimed the life you owed me for my child's beside the lifeless form of your daughter old man i swore to live a life of revenge i have never swerved from my purpose for a moment's space but if i had one thought of her uncomplaining suffering look as she drooped away or of the starving face of our innocent child would have nerved me to my task my first act of requital you well remember this is my last' the old man shivered and his hands dropped powerless by his side 'i leave england to morrow' said heyling after a moment's pause 'to night i consign you to the living death to which you devoted her a hopeless prison ' he raised his eyes to the old man's countenance and paused he lifted the light to his face set it gently down and left the apartment 'you had better see to the old man' he said to the woman as he opened the door and motioned the officer to follow him into the street 'i think he is ill' the woman closed the door ran hastily upstairs and found him lifeless beneath a plain grave stone in one of the most peaceful and secluded churchyards in kent where wild flowers mingle with the grass and the soft landscape around forms the fairest spot in the garden of england lie the bones of the young mother and her gentle child but the ashes of the father do not mingle with theirs nor from that night forward did the attorney ever gain the remotest clue to the subsequent history of his queer client as the old man concluded his tale he advanced to a peg in one corner and taking down his hat and coat put them on with great deliberation and without saying another word walked slowly away as the gentleman with the mosaic studs had fallen asleep and the major part of the company were deeply occupied in the humorous process of dropping melted tallow grease into his brandy and water mr pickwick departed unnoticed and having settled his own score and that of mr weller issued forth in company with that gentleman from beneath the portal of the magpie and stump chapter xxii illustration mr pickwick journeys to ipswich and meets with a romantic adventure with a middle aged lady in yellow curl papers that 'ere your governor's luggage sammy inquired mr weller of his affectionate son as he entered the yard of the bull inn whitechapel with a travelling bag and a small portmanteau you might ha' made a worser guess than that old feller replied mr weller the younger setting down his burden in the yard and sitting himself down upon it afterwards the governor hisself 'll be down here presently he's a cabbin' it i suppose said the father yes he's a havin' two mile o' danger at eightpence responded the son how's mother in law this mornin' queer sammy queer replied the elder mr weller with impressive gravity she's been gettin' rayther in the methodistical order lately sammy and she is uncommon pious to be sure she's too good a creetur for me sammy i feel i don't deserve her ah said mr samuel that's wery self denyin' o' you wery replied his parent with a sigh she's got hold o' some inwention for grown up people being born again sammy the new birth i thinks they calls it i should wery much like to see that system in haction sammy i should wery much like to see your mother in law born again wouldn't i put her out to nurse what do you think them women does t'other day continued mr weller after a short pause during which he had significantly struck the side of his nose with his fore finger some half dozen times what do you think they does t'other day sammy don't know replied sam what goes and gets up a grand tea drinkin' for a feller they calls their shepherd said mr weller i was a standing starin' in at the pictur shop down at our place when i sees a little bill about it 'tickets half a crown all applications to be made to the committee secretary mrs weller' and when i got home there was the committee a sittin' in our back parlour fourteen women i wish you could ha' heard 'em sammy there they was a passin' resolutions and wotin' supplies and all sorts o' games well what with your mother in law a worrying me to go and what with my looking for'ard to seein' some queer starts if i did i put my name down for a ticket at six o'clock on the friday evenin' i dresses myself out wery smart and off i goes with the old 'ooman and up we walks into a fust floor where there was tea things for thirty and a whole lot o' women as begins whisperin' to one another and lookin' at me as if they'd never seen a rayther stout gen'lm'n of eight and fifty afore by and bye there comes a great bustle down stairs and a lanky chap with a red nose and a white neckcloth rushes up and sings out 'here's the shepherd a coming to wisit his faithful flock' and in comes a fat chap in black vith a great white face a smilin' avay like clockwork such goin's on sammy 'the kiss of peace' says the shepherd and then he kissed the women all round and ven he'd done the man vith the red nose began i was just a thinkin' whether i hadn't better begin too 'specially as there was a wery nice lady a sittin' next me ven in comes the tea and your mother in law as had been makin' the kettle bile down stairs at it they went tooth and nail such a precious loud hymn sammy while the tea was a brewing such a grace such eatin' and drinkin' i wish you could ha' seen the shepherd walkin' into the ham and muffins i never see such a chap to eat and drink never the red nosed man warn't by no means the sort of person you'd like to grub by contract but he was nothin' to the shepherd well arter the tea was over they sang another hymn and then the shepherd began to preach and wery well he did it considerin' how heavy them muffins must have lied on his chest presently he pulls up all of a sudden and hollers out 'where is the sinner where is the mis'rable sinner' upon which all the women looked at me and began to groan as if they was a dying i thought it was rather sing'ler but hows'ever i says nothing presently he pulls up again and lookin' wery hard at me says 'where is the sinner where is the mis'rable sinner' and all the women groans again ten times louder than afore i got rather wild at this so i takes a step or two for'ard and says 'my friend' says i 'did you apply that 'ere obserwation to me' 'stead of begging my pardon as any gent'lm'n would ha' done he got more abusive than ever called me a wessel sammy a wessel of wrath and all sorts o' names so my blood being reg'larly up i first give him two or three for himself and then two or three more to hand over to the man with the red nose and walked off i wish you could ha' heard how the women screamed sammy ven they picked up the shepherd from under the table hallo here's the governor the size of life as mr weller spoke mr pickwick dismounted from a cab and entered the yard fine mornin' sir said mr weller senior beautiful indeed replied mr pickwick beautiful indeed echoed a red haired man with an inquisitive nose and blue spectacles who had unpacked himself from a cab at the same moment as mr pickwick going to ipswich sir i am replied mr pickwick extraordinary coincidence so am i mr pickwick bowed going outside said the red haired man mr pickwick bowed again bless my soul how remarkable i am going outside too said the red haired man we are positively going together and the red haired man who was an important looking sharp nosed mysterious spoken personage with a bird like habit of giving his head a jerk every time he said anything smiled as if he had made one of the strangest discoveries that ever fell to the lot of human wisdom i am happy in the prospect of your company sir said mr pickwick ah said the new comer it's a good thing for both of us isn't it company you see company is is it's a very different thing from solitude ain't it there's no denying that 'ere said mr weller joining in the conversation with an affable smile that's what i call a self evident proposition as the dog's meat man said when the housemaid told him he warn't a gentleman ah said the red haired man surveying mr weller from head to foot with a supercilious look friend of yours sir not exactly a friend replied mr pickwick in a low tone the fact is he is my servant but i allow him to take a good many liberties for between ourselves i flatter myself he is an original and i am rather proud of him ah said the red haired man that you see is a matter of taste i am not fond of anything original i don't like it don't see the necessity for it what's your name sir here is my card sir replied mr pickwick much amused by the abruptness of the question and the singular manner of the stranger ah said the red haired man placing the card in his pocket book pickwick very good i like to know a man's name it saves so much trouble that's my card sir magnus you will perceive sir magnus is my name it's rather a good name i think sir a very good name indeed said mr pickwick wholly unable to repress a smile yes i think it is resumed mr magnus there's a good name before it too you will observe permit me sir if you hold the card a little slanting this way you catch the light upon the up stroke there peter magnus sounds well i think sir very said mr pickwick curious circumstance about those initials sir said mr magnus you will observe pm post meridian in hasty notes to intimate acquaintance i sometimes sign myself 'afternoon' it amuses my friends very much mr pickwick it is calculated to afford them the highest gratification i should conceive said mr pickwick rather envying the ease with which mr magnus's friends were entertained now gen'lm'n said the hostler coach is ready if you please is all my luggage in inquired mr magnus all right sir is the red bag in all right sir and the striped bag fore boot sir and the brown paper parcel under the seat sir and the leather hat box they're all in sir now will you get up said mr pickwick excuse me replied magnus standing on the wheel excuse me mr pickwick i cannot consent to get up in this state of uncertainty i am quite satisfied from that man's manner that that leather hat box is not in the solemn protestations of the hostler being wholly unavailing the leather hat box was obliged to be raked up from the lowest depth of the boot to satisfy him that it had been safely packed and after he had been assured on this head he felt a solemn presentiment first that the red bag was mislaid and next that the striped bag had been stolen and then that the brown paper parcel had come untied at length when he had received ocular demonstration of the groundless nature of each and every of these suspicions he consented to climb up to the roof of the coach observing that now he had taken everything off his mind he felt quite comfortable and happy you're given to nervousness ain't you sir inquired mr weller senior eyeing the stranger askance as he mounted to his place yes i always am rather about these little matters said the stranger but i am all right now quite right well that's a blessin' said mr weller sammy help your master up to the box t'other leg sir that's it give us your hand sir up with you you was a lighter weight when you was a boy sir true enough that mr weller said the breathless mr pickwick good humouredly as he took his seat on the box beside him jump up in front sammy said mr weller now villam run 'em out take care o' the archvay gen'lm'n 'heads' as the pieman says that'll do villam let 'em alone and away went the coach up whitechapel to the admiration of the whole population of that pretty densely populated quarter not a wery nice neighbourhood this sir said sam with a touch of the hat which always preceded his entering into conversation with his master it is not indeed sam replied mr pickwick surveying the crowded and filthy street through which they were passing it's a wery remarkable circumstance sir said sam that poverty and oysters always seems to go together i don't understand you sam said mr pickwick what i mean sir said sam is that the poorer a place is the greater call there seems to be for oysters look here sir here's a oyster stall to every half dozen houses the street's lined vith 'em blessed if i don't think that ven a man's wery poor he rushes out of his lodgings and eats oysters in reg'lar desperation to be sure he does said mr weller senior and it's just the same vith pickled salmon those are two very remarkable facts which never occurred to me before said mr pickwick the very first place we stop at i'll make a note of them by this time they had reached the turnpike at mile end a profound silence prevailed until they had got two or three miles further on when mr weller senior turning suddenly to mr pickwick said wery queer life is a pike keeper's sir a what said mr pickwick a pike keeper what do you mean by a pike keeper inquired mr peter magnus the old 'un means a turnpike keeper gen'lm'n observed mr samuel weller in explanation oh said mr pickwick i see yes very curious life very uncomfortable they're all on 'em men as has met vith some disappointment in life said mr weller senior ay ay said mr pickwick yes consequence of vich they retires from the world and shuts themselves up in pikes partly vith the view of being solitary and partly to rewenge themselves on mankind by takin' tolls dear me said mr pickwick i never knew that before fact sir said mr weller if they was gen'lm'n you'd call 'em misanthropes but as it is they only takes to pike keepin' with such conversation possessing the inestimable charm of blending amusement with instruction did mr weller beguile the tediousness of the journey during the greater part of the day topics of conversation were never wanting for even when any pause occurred in mr weller's loquacity it was abundantly supplied by the desire evinced by mr magnus to make himself acquainted with the whole of the personal history of his fellow travellers and his loudly expressed anxiety at every stage respecting the safety and well being of the two bags the leather hat box and the brown paper parcel in the main street of ipswich on the left hand side of the way a short distance after you have passed through the open space fronting the town hall stands an inn known far and wide by the appellation of the great white horse rendered the more conspicuous by a stone statue of some rampacious animal with flowing mane and tail distantly resembling an insane cart horse which is elevated above the principal door the great white horse is famous in the neighbourhood in the same degree as a prize ox or county paper chronicled turnip or unwieldy pig for its enormous size never were such labyrinths of uncarpeted passages such clusters of mouldy ill lighted rooms such huge numbers of small dens for eating or sleeping in beneath any one roof as are collected together between the four walls of the great white horse at ipswich it was at the door of this overgrown tavern that the london coach stopped at the same hour every evening and it was from this same london coach that mr pickwick sam weller and mr peter magnus dismounted on the particular evening to which this chapter of our history bears reference do you stop here sir inquired mr peter magnus when the striped bag and the red bag and the brown paper parcel and the leather hat box had all been deposited in the passage do you stop here sir i do said mr pickwick dear me said mr magnus i never knew anything like these extraordinary coincidences why i stop here too i hope we dine together with pleasure replied mr pickwick i am not quite certain whether i have any friends here or not though is there any gentleman of the name of tupman here waiter a corpulent man with a fortnight's napkin under his arm and coeval stockings on his legs slowly desisted from his occupation of staring down the street on this question being put to him by mr pickwick and after minutely inspecting that gentleman's appearance from the crown of his hat to the lowest button of his gaiters replied emphatically no nor any gentleman of the name of snodgrass inquired mr pickwick no nor winkle no my friends have not arrived to day sir said mr pickwick we will dine alone then show us a private room waiter on this request being preferred the corpulent man condescended to order the boots to bring in the gentlemen's luggage and preceding them down a long dark passage ushered them into a large badly furnished apartment with a dirty grate in which a small fire was making a wretched attempt to be cheerful but was fast sinking beneath the dispiriting influence of the place after the lapse of an hour a bit of fish and a steak were served up to the travellers and when the dinner was cleared away mr pickwick and mr peter magnus drew their chairs up to the fire and having ordered a bottle of the worst possible port wine at the highest possible price for the good of the house drank brandy and water for their own mr peter magnus was naturally of a very communicative disposition and the brandy and water operated with wonderful effect in warming into life the deepest hidden secrets of his bosom after sundry accounts of himself his family his connexions his friends his jokes his business and his brothers most talkative men have a great deal to say about their brothers mr peter magnus took a blue view of mr pickwick through his coloured spectacles for several minutes and then said with an air of modesty and what do you think what do you think mr pickwick i have come down here for upon my word said mr pickwick it is wholly impossible for me to guess on business perhaps partly right sir replied mr peter magnus but partly wrong at the same time try again mr pickwick really said mr pickwick i must throw myself on your mercy to tell me or not as you may think best for i should never guess if i were to try all night why then he he he said mr peter magnus with a bashful titter what should you think mr pickwick if i had come down here to make a proposal sir eh he he he think that you are very likely to succeed replied mr pickwick with one of his beaming smiles ah said mr magnus but do you really think so mr pickwick do you though certainly said mr pickwick no but you're joking though i am not indeed why then said mr magnus to let you into a little secret i think so too i don't mind telling you mr pickwick although i'm dreadful jealous by nature horrid that the lady is in this house here mr magnus took off his spectacles on purpose to wink and then put them on again that's what you were running out of the room for before dinner then so often said mr pickwick archly hush yes you're right that was it not such a fool as to see her though no no wouldn't do you know after having just come off a journey wait till to morrow sir double the chance then mr pickwick sir there is a suit of clothes in that bag and a hat in that box which i expect in the effect they will produce will be invaluable to me sir indeed said mr pickwick yes you must have observed my anxiety about them to day i do not believe that such another suit of clothes and such a hat could be bought for money mr pickwick mr pickwick congratulated the fortunate owner of the irresistible garments on their acquisition and mr peter magnus remained for a few moments apparently absorbed in contemplation she's a fine creature said mr magnus is she said mr pickwick very said mr magnus very she lives about twenty miles from here mr pickwick i heard she would be here to night and all to morrow forenoon and came down to seize the opportunity i think an inn is a good sort of a place to propose to a single woman in mr pickwick she is more likely to feel the loneliness of her situation in travelling perhaps than she would be at home what do you think mr pickwick i think it very probable replied that gentleman i beg your pardon mr pickwick said mr peter magnus but i am naturally rather curious what may you have come down here for on a far less pleasant errand sir replied mr pickwick the colour mounting to his face at the recollection i have come down here sir to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual upon whose truth and honour i placed implicit reliance dear me said mr peter magnus that's very unpleasant it is a lady i presume eh ah sly mr pickwick sly well mr pickwick sir i wouldn't probe your feelings for the world painful subjects these sir very painful don't mind me mr pickwick if you wish to give vent to your feelings i know what it is to be jilted sir i have endured that sort of thing three or four times i am much obliged to you for your condolence on what you presume to be my melancholy case said mr pickwick winding up his watch and laying it on the table but no no said mr peter magnus not a word more it's a painful subject i see i see what's the time mr pickwick past twelve dear me it's time to go to bed it will never do sitting here i shall be pale to morrow mr pickwick at the bare notion of such a calamity mr peter magnus rang the bell for the chamber maid and the striped bag the red bag the leathern hat box and the brown paper parcel having been conveyed to his bed room he retired in company with a japanned candlestick to one side of the house while mr pickwick and another japanned candlestick were conducted through a multitude of tortuous windings to another this is your room sir said the chamber maid very well replied mr pickwick looking round him it was a tolerably large double bedded room with a fire upon the whole a more comfortable looking apartment than mr pickwick's short experience of the accommodations of the great white horse had led him to expect nobody sleeps in the other bed of course said mr pickwick oh no sir very good tell my servant to bring me up some hot water at half past eight in the morning and that i shall not want him any more to night yes sir and bidding mr pickwick good night the chamber maid retired and left him alone mr pickwick sat himself down in a chair before the fire and fell into a train of rambling meditations first he thought of his friends and wondered when they would join him then his mind reverted to mrs martha bardell and from that lady it wandered by a natural process to the dingy counting house of dodson and fogg from dodson and fogg's it flew off at a tangent to the very centre of the history of the queer client and then it came back to the great white horse at ipswich with sufficient clearness to convince mr pickwick that he was falling asleep so he roused himself and began to undress when he recollected he had left his watch on the table down stairs now this watch was a special favourite with mr pickwick having been carried about beneath the shadow of his waistcoat for a greater number of years than we feel called upon to state at present the possibility of going to sleep unless it were ticking gently beneath his pillow or in the watch pocket over his head had never entered mr pickwick's brain so as it was pretty late now and he was unwilling to ring his bell at that hour of the night he slipped on his coat of which he had just divested himself and taking the japanned candlestick in his hand walked quietly down stairs the more stairs mr pickwick went down the more stairs there seemed to be to descend and again and again when mr pickwick got into some narrow passage and began to congratulate himself on having gained the ground floor did another flight of stairs appear before his astonished eyes at last he reached a stone hall which he remembered to have seen when he entered the house passage after passage did he explore room after room did he peep into at length as he was on the point of giving up the search in despair he opened the door of the identical room in which he had spent the evening and beheld his missing property on the table mr pickwick seized the watch in triumph and proceeded to retrace his steps to his bed chamber if his progress downward had been attended with difficulties and uncertainty his journey back was infinitely more perplexing rows of doors garnished with boots of every shape make and size branched off in every possible direction a dozen times did he softly turn the handle of some bed room door which resembled his own when a gruff cry from within of who the devil's that or what do you want here caused him to steal away on tiptoe with a perfectly marvellous celerity he was reduced to the verge of despair when an open door attracted his attention he peeped in right at last there were the two beds whose situation he perfectly remembered and the fire still burning his candle not a long one when he first received it had flickered away in the drafts of air through which he had passed and sank into the socket as he closed the door after him no matter said mr pickwick i can undress myself just as well by the light of the fire the bedsteads stood one on each side of the door and on the inner side of each was a little path terminating in a rush bottomed chair just wide enough to admit of a person's getting into or out of bed on that side if he or she thought proper having carefully drawn the curtains of his bed on the outside mr pickwick sat down on the rush bottomed chair and leisurely divested himself of his shoes and gaiters he then took off and folded up his coat waistcoat and neckcloth and slowly drawing on his tasselled night cap secured it firmly on his head by tying beneath his chin the strings which he always had attached to that article of dress it was at this moment that the absurdity of his recent bewilderment struck upon his mind throwing himself back in the rush bottomed chair mr pickwick laughed to himself so heartily that it would have been quite delightful to any man of well constituted mind to have watched the smiles that expanded his amiable features as they shone forth from beneath the night cap it is the best idea said mr pickwick to himself smiling till he almost cracked the night cap strings it is the best idea my losing myself in this place and wandering about those staircases that i ever heard of droll droll very droll here mr pickwick smiled again a broader smile than before and was about to continue the process of undressing in the best possible humour when he was suddenly stopped by a most unexpected interruption to wit the entrance into the room of some person with a candle who after locking the door advanced to the dressing table and set down the light upon it the smile that played on mr pickwick's features was instantaneously lost in a look of the most unbounded and wonder stricken surprise the person whoever it was had come in so suddenly and with so little noise that mr pickwick had had no time to call out or oppose their entrance who could it be a robber some evil minded person who had seen him come up stairs with a handsome watch in his hand perhaps what was he to do the only way in which mr pickwick could catch a glimpse of his mysterious visitor with the least danger of being seen himself was by creeping on to the bed and peeping out from between the curtains on the opposite side to this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted keeping the curtains carefully closed with his hand so that nothing more of him could be seen than his face and night cap and putting on his spectacles he mustered up courage and looked out mr pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay standing before a dressing glass was a middle aged lady in yellow curl papers busily engaged in brushing what ladies call their back hair however the unconscious middle aged lady came into that room it was quite clear that she contemplated remaining there for the night for she had brought a rushlight and shade with her which with praiseworthy precaution against fire she had stationed in a basin on the floor where it was glimmering away like a gigantic light house in a particularly small piece of water bless my soul thought mr pickwick what a dreadful thing hem said the lady and in went mr pickwick's head with automaton like rapidity i never met with anything so awful as this thought poor mr pickwick the cold perspiration starting in drops upon his night cap never this is fearful it was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to see what was going forward so out went mr pickwick's head again the prospect was worse than before the middle aged lady had finished arranging her hair had carefully enveloped it in a muslin night cap with a small plaited border and was gazing pensively on the fire this matter is growing alarming reasoned mr pickwick with himself i can't allow things to go on in this way by the self possession of that lady it is clear to me that i must have come into the wrong room if i call out she'll alarm the house but if i remain here the consequences will be still more frightful mr pickwick it is quite unnecessary to say was one of the most modest and delicate minded of mortals the very idea of exhibiting his night cap to a lady overpowered him but he had tied those confounded strings in a knot and do what he would he couldn't get it off the disclosure must be made there was only one other way of doing it he shrunk behind the curtains and called out very loudly ha hum that the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident by her falling up against the rushlight shade that she persuaded herself it must have been the effect of imagination was equally clear for when mr pickwick under the impression that she had fainted away stone dead from fright ventured to peep out again she was gazing pensively on the fire as before most extraordinary female this thought mr pickwick popping in again ha hum these last sounds so like those in which as legends inform us the ferocious giant blunderbore was in the habit of expressing his opinion that it was time to lay the cloth were too distinctly audible to be again mistaken for the workings of fancy gracious heaven said the middle aged lady what's that it's it's only a gentleman ma'am said mr pickwick from behind the curtains a gentleman said the lady with a terrific scream it's all over thought mr pickwick a strange man shrieked the lady another instant and the house would be alarmed her garments rustled as she rushed towards the door ma'am said mr pickwick thrusting out his head in the extremity of his desperation ma'am now although mr pickwick was not actuated by any definite object in putting out his head it was instantaneously productive of a good effect the lady as we have already stated was near the door she must pass it to reach the staircase and she would most undoubtedly have done so by this time had not the sudden apparition of mr pickwick's night cap driven her back into the remotest corner of the apartment where she stood staring wildly at mr pickwick while mr pickwick in his turn stared wildly at her wretch said the lady covering her eyes with her hands what do you want here nothing ma'am nothing whatever ma'am said mr pickwick earnestly nothing said the lady looking up nothing ma'am upon my honour said mr pickwick nodding his head so energetically that the tassel of his night cap danced again i am almost ready to sink ma'am beneath the confusion of addressing a lady in my night cap here the lady hastily snatched off hers but i can't get it off ma'am here mr pickwick gave it a tremendous tug in proof of the statement it is evident to me ma'am now that i have mistaken this bed room for my own i had not been here five minutes ma'am when you suddenly entered it if this improbable story be really true sir said the lady sobbing violently you will leave it instantly i will ma'am with the greatest pleasure replied mr pickwick instantly sir said the lady certainly ma'am interposed mr pickwick very quickly certainly ma'am i i am very sorry ma'am said mr pickwick making his appearance at the bottom of the bed to have been the innocent occasion of this alarm and emotion deeply sorry ma'am the lady pointed to the door one excellent quality of mr pickwick's character was beautifully displayed at this moment under the most trying circumstances although he had hastily put on his hat over his night cap after the manner of the old patrol although he carried his shoes and gaiters in his hand and his coat and waistcoat over his arm nothing could subdue his native politeness i am exceedingly sorry ma'am said mr pickwick bowing very low if you are sir you will at once leave the room said the lady immediately ma'am this instant ma'am said mr pickwick opening the door and dropping both his shoes with a crash in so doing i trust ma'am resumed mr pickwick gathering up his shoes and turning round to bow again i trust ma'am that my unblemished character and the devoted respect i entertain for your sex will plead as some slight excuse for this but before mr pickwick could conclude the sentence the lady had thrust him into the passage and locked and bolted the door behind him illustration i trust ma'am resumed mr pickwick that my unblemished character and the devoted respect i entertain for your sex whatever grounds of self congratulation mr pickwick might have for having escaped so quietly from his late awkward situation his present position was by no means enviable he was alone in an open passage in a strange house in the middle of the night half dressed it was not to be supposed that he could find his way in perfect darkness to a room which he had been wholly unable to discover with a light and if he made the slightest noise in his fruitless attempts to do so he stood every chance of being shot at and perhaps killed by some wakeful traveller he had no resource but to remain where he was until daylight appeared so after groping his way a few paces down the passage and to his infinite alarm stumbling over several pairs of boots in so doing mr pickwick crouched into a little recess in the wall to wait for morning as philosophically as he might he was not destined however to undergo this additional trial of patience for he had not long been ensconced in his present concealment when to his unspeakable horror a man bearing a light appeared at the end of the passage his horror was suddenly converted into joy however when he recognised the form of his faithful attendant it was indeed mr samuel weller who after sitting up thus late in conversation with the boots who was sitting up for the mail was now about to retire to rest sam said mr pickwick suddenly appearing before him where's my bedroom illustration sam said mr pickwick where's my bedroom mr weller stared at his master with the most emphatic surprise and it was not until the question had been repeated three several times that he turned round and led the way to the long sought apartment sam said mr pickwick as he got into bed i have made one of the most extraordinary mistakes to night that ever were heard of wery likely sir replied mr weller dryly but of this i am determined sam said mr pickwick that if i were to stop in this house for six months i would never trust myself about it alone again that's the wery prudentest resolution as you could come to sir replied mr weller you rayther want somebody to look arter you sir ven your judgment goes out a wisitin' what do you mean by that sam said mr pickwick he raised himself in bed and extended his hand as if he were about to say something more but suddenly checking himself turned round and bade his valet good night good night sir replied mr weller he paused when he got outside the door shook his head walked on stopped snuffed the candle shook his head again and finally proceeded slowly to his chamber apparently buried in the profoundest meditation chapter xxiii illustration in which mr samuel weller begins to devote his energies to the return match between himself and mr trotter in a small room in the vicinity of the stable yard betimes in the morning which was ushered in by mr pickwick's adventure with the middle aged lady in the yellow curl papers sat mr weller senior preparing himself for his journey to london he was sitting in an excellent attitude for having his portrait taken it is very possible that at some earlier period of his career mr weller's profile might have presented a bold and determined outline his face however had expanded under the influence of good living and a disposition remarkable for resignation and its bold fleshy curves had so far extended beyond the limits originally assigned them that unless you took a full view of his countenance in front it was difficult to distinguish more than the extreme tip of a very rubicund nose his chin from the same cause had acquired the grave and imposing form which is generally described by prefixing the word double to that expressive feature and his complexion exhibited that peculiarly mottled combination of colours which is only to be seen in gentlemen of his profession and in under done roast beef round his neck he wore a crimson travelling shawl which merged into his chin by such imperceptible gradations that it was difficult to distinguish the folds of the one from the folds of the other over this he mounted a long waistcoat of a broad pink striped pattern and over that again a wide skirted green coat ornamented with large brass buttons whereof the two which garnished the waist were so far apart that no man had ever beheld them both at the same time his hair which was short sleek and black was just visible beneath the capacious brim of a low crowned brown hat his legs were encased in knee cord breeches and painted top boots and a copper watch chain terminating in one seal and a key of the same material dangled loosely from his capacious waistband we have said that mr weller was engaged in preparing for his journey to london he was taking sustenance in fact on the table before him stood a pot of ale a cold round of beef and a very respectable looking loaf to each of which he distributed his favours in turn with the most rigid impartiality he had just cut a mighty slice from the latter when the footsteps of somebody entering the room caused him to raise his head and he beheld his son mornin' sammy said the father the son walked up to the pot of ale and nodding significantly to his parent took a long draught by way of reply wery good power o' suction sammy said mr weller the elder looking into the pot when his first born had set it down half empty you'd ha' made an uncommon fine oyster sammy if you'd been born in that station o' life yes i des say i should ha' managed to pick up a respectable livin' replied sam applying himself to the cold beef with considerable vigour i'm wery sorry sammy said the elder mr weller shaking up the ale by describing small circles with the pot preparatory to drinking i'm wery sorry sammy to hear from your lips as you let yourself be gammoned by that 'ere mulberry man i always thought up to three days ago that the names of veller and gammon could never come into contact sammy never always exceptin' the case of a widder of course said sam widders sammy replied mr weller slightly changing colour widders are 'ceptions to ev'ry rule i have heerd how many ord'nary women one widder's equal to in pint o' comin' over you i think it's five and twenty but i don't rightly know vether it ain't more well that's pretty well said sam besides continued mr weller not noticing the interruption that's a wery different thing you know what the counsel said sammy as defended the gen'l'm'n as beat his wife with the poker venever he got jolly 'and arter all my lord' says he 'it's a amiable weakness' so i says respectin' widders sammy and so you'll say ven you gets as old as me i ought to ha' know'd better i know said sam ought to ha' know'd better repeated mr weller striking the table with his fist ought to ha' know'd better why i know a young 'un as hasn't had half nor quarter your eddication as hasn't slept about the markets no not six months who'd ha' scorned to be let in in such a vay scorned it sammy in the excitement of feeling produced by this agonising reflection mr weller rang the bell and ordered an additional pint of ale well it's no use talking about it now said sam it's over and can't be helped and that's one consolation as they always says in turkey ven they cuts the wrong man's head off it's my innings now gov'rnor and as soon as i catches hold o' this 'ere trotter i'll have a good 'un i hope you will sammy i hope you will returned mr weller here's your health sammy and may you speedily vipe off the disgrace as you've inflicted on the family name in honour of this toast mr weller imbibed at a draught at least two thirds of the newly arrived pint and handed it over to his son to dispose of the remainder which he instantaneously did and now sammy said mr weller consulting the large double faced silver watch that hung at the end of the copper chain now it's time i was up at the office to get my vay bill and see the coach loaded for coaches sammy is like guns they requires to be loaded with wery great care afore they go off at this parental and professional joke mr weller junior smiled a filial smile his revered parent continued in a solemn tone i'm a goin' to leave you samivel my boy and there's no telling ven i shall see you again your mother in law may ha' been too much for me or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o' the celebrated mr veller o' the bell savage the family name depends wery much upon you samivel and i hope you'll do wot's right by it upon all little pints o' breedin' i know i may trust you as vell as if it was my own self so i've only this here one little bit of adwice to give you if ever you gets to up'ards o' fifty and feels disposed to go a marryin' anybody no matter who just you shut yourself up in your own room if you've got one and pison yourself off hand hangin's wulgar so don't you have nothin' to say to that pison yourself samivel my boy pison yourself and you'll be glad on it arterwards with these affecting words mr weller looked steadfastly on his son and turning slowly upon his heel disappeared from his sight in the contemplative mood which these words had awakened mr samuel weller walked forth from the great white horse when his father had left him and bending his steps towards st clement's church endeavoured to dissipate his melancholy by strolling among its ancient precincts he had loitered about for some time when he found himself in a retired spot a kind of court yard of venerable appearance which he discovered had no other outlet than the turning by which he had entered he was about retracing his steps when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot by a sudden appearance and the mode and manner of this appearance we now proceed to relate mr samuel weller had been staring up at the old brick houses now and then in his deep abstraction bestowing a wink upon some healthy looking servant girl as she drew up a blind or threw open a bed room window when the green gate of a garden at the bottom of the yard opened and a man having emerged therefrom closed the green gate very carefully after him and walked briskly towards the very spot where mr weller was standing now taking this as an isolated fact unaccompanied by any attendant circumstances there was nothing very extraordinary in it because in many parts of the world men do come out of gardens close green gates after them and even walk briskly away without attracting any particular share of public observation it is clear therefore that there must have been something in the man or in his manner or both to attract mr weller's particular notice whether there was or not we must leave the reader to determine when we have faithfully recorded the behaviour of the individual in question when the man had shut the green gate after him he walked as we have said twice already with a brisk pace up the court yard but he no sooner caught sight of mr weller than he faltered and stopped as if uncertain for the moment what course to adopt as the green gate was closed behind him and there was no other outlet but the one in front however he was not long in perceiving that he must pass mr samuel weller to get away he therefore resumed his brisk pace and advanced staring straight before him the most extraordinary thing about the man was that he was contorting his face into the most fearful and astonishing grimaces that ever were beheld nature's handiwork never was disguised with such extraordinary artificial carving as the man had overlaid his countenance with in one moment well said mr weller to himself as the man approached this is wery odd i could ha' swore it was him up came the man and his face became more frightfully distorted than ever as he drew nearer i could take my oath to that 'ere black hair and mulberry suit said mr weller only i never see such a face as that afore as mr weller said this the man's features assumed an unearthly twinge perfectly hideous he was obliged to pass very near sam however and the scrutinising glance of that gentleman enabled him to detect under all these appalling twists of feature something too like the small eyes of mr job trotter to be easily mistaken hallo you sir shouted sam fiercely the stranger stopped hallo repeated sam still more gruffly the man with the horrible face looked with the greatest surprise up the court and down the court and in at the windows of the houses everywhere but at sam weller and took another step forward when he was brought to again by another shout hallo you sir said sam for the third time there was no pretending to mistake where the voice came from now so the stranger having no other resource at last looked sam weller full in the face it won't do job trotter said sam come none o' that 'ere nonsense you ain't so wery 'andsome that you can afford to throw avay many o' your good looks bring them 'ere eyes o' your'n back into their proper places or i'll knock 'em out of your head d'ye hear as mr weller appeared fully disposed to act up to the spirit of this address mr trotter gradually allowed his face to resume its natural expression and then giving a start of joy exclaimed what do i see mr walker ah replied sam you're wery glad to see me ain't you glad exclaimed job trotter oh mr walker if you had but known how i have looked forward to this meeting it is too much mr walker i cannot bear it indeed i cannot and with these words mr trotter burst into a regular inundation of tears and flinging his arms around those of mr weller embraced him closely in an ecstasy of joy get off cried sam indignant at this process and vainly endeavouring to extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance get off i tell you what are you crying over me for you portable ingine because i am so glad to see you replied job trotter gradually releasing mr weller as the first symptoms of his pugnacity disappeared oh mr walker this is too much too much echoed sam i think it is too much rayther now what have you got to say to me eh mr trotter made no reply for the little pink pocket handkerchief was in full force what have you got to say to me afore i knock your head off repeated mr weller in a threatening manner eh said mr trotter with a look of virtuous surprise what have you got to say to me i mr walker don't call me valker my name's veller you know that vell enough what have you got to say to me bless you mr walker weller i mean a great many things if you will come away somewhere where we can talk comfortably if you knew how i have looked for you mr weller wery hard indeed i s'pose said sam dryly very very sir replied mr trotter without moving a muscle of his face but shake hands mr weller sam eyed his companion for a few seconds and then as if actuated by a sudden impulse complied with his request how said job trotter as they walked away how is your dear good master oh he is a worthy gentleman mr weller i hope he didn't catch cold that dreadful night sir there was a momentary look of deep slyness in job trotter's eye as he said this which ran a thrill through mr weller's clenched fist as he burnt with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs sam constrained himself however and replied that his master was extremely well oh i am so glad replied mr trotter is he here is your'n asked sam by way of reply oh yes he is here and i grieve to say mr weller he is going on worse than ever ah ah said sam oh shocking terrible at a boarding school said sam no not at a boarding school replied job trotter with the same sly look which sam had noticed before not at a boarding school at the house with the green gate said sam eyeing his companion closely no no oh not there replied job with a quickness very unusual to him not there what was you a doin' there asked sam with a sharp glance got inside the gate by accident perhaps why mr weller replied job i don't mind telling you my little secrets because you know we took such a fancy for each other when we first met you recollect how pleasant we were that morning oh yes said sam impatiently i remember well well replied job speaking with great precision and in the low tone of a man who communicates an important secret in that house with the green gate mr weller they keep a good many servants so i should think from the look on it interposed sam yes continued mr trotter and one of them is a cook who has saved up a little money mr weller and is desirous if she can establish herself in life to open a little shop in the chandlery way you see yes yes mr weller well sir i met her at a chapel that i go to a very neat little chapel in this town mr weller where they sing the number four collection of hymns which i generally carry about with me in a little book which you may perhaps have seen in my hand and i got a little intimate with her mr weller and from that an acquaintance sprung up between us and i may venture to say mr weller that i am to be the chandler ah and a wery amiable chandler you'll make replied sam eyeing job with a side look of intense dislike the great advantage of this mr weller continued job his eyes filling with tears as he spoke will be that i shall be able to leave my present disgraceful service with that bad man and to devote myself to a better and more virtuous life more like the way in which i was brought up mr weller you must ha' been wery nicely brought up said sam oh very mr weller very replied job at the recollection of the purity of his youthful days mr trotter pulled forth the pink handkerchief and wept copiously you must ha' been an uncommon nice boy to go to school vith said sam i was sir replied job heaving a deep sigh i was the idol of the place ah said sam i don't wonder at it what a comfort you must ha' been to your blessed mother at these words mr job trotter inserted an end of the pink handkerchief into the corner of each eye one after the other and began to weep copiously wot's the matter vith the man said sam indignantly chelsea water works is nothin' to you what are you melting vith now the consciousness o' willany i cannot keep my feelings down mr weller said job after a short pause to think that my master should have suspected the conversation i had with yours and so dragged me away in a post chaise and after persuading the sweet young lady to say she knew nothing of him and bribing the school mistress to do the same deserted her for a better speculation oh mr weller it makes me shudder oh that was the vay was it said mr weller to be sure it was replied job vell said sam as they had now arrived near the hotel i vant to have a little bit o' talk with you job so if you're not partickler engaged i should like to see you at the great white horse to night somewheres about eight o'clock i shall be sure to come said job yes you'd better replied sam with a very meaning look or else i shall perhaps be asking arter you at the other side of the green gate and then i might cut you out you know i shall be sure to be with you sir said mr trotter and wringing sam's hand with the utmost fervour he walked away take care job trotter take care said sam looking after him or i shall be one too many for you this time i shall indeed having uttered this soliloquy and looked after job till he was to be seen no more mr weller made the best of his way to his master's bed room it's all in training sir said sam what's in training sam inquired mr pickwick i've found 'em out sir said sam found out whom that 'ere queer customer and the melan cholly chap with the black hair impossible sam said mr pickwick with the greatest energy where are they sam where are they hush hush replied mr weller and as he assisted mr pickwick to dress he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter but when is this to be done sam inquired mr pickwick all in good time sir replied sam whether it was done in good time or not will be seen hereafter chapter xxiv illustration wherein mr peter magnus grows jealous and the middle aged lady apprehensive which brings the pickwickians within the grasp of the law when mr pickwick descended to the room in which he and mr peter magnus had spent the preceding evening he found that gentleman with the major part of the contents of the two bags the leathern hat box and the brown paper parcel displayed to all possible advantage on his person while he himself was pacing up and down the room in a state of the utmost excitement and agitation good morning sir said mr peter magnus what do you think of this sir very effective indeed replied mr pickwick surveying the garments of mr peter magnus with a good natured smile yes i think it'll do said mr magnus mr pickwick sir i have sent up my card have you said mr pickwick and the waiter brought back word that she would see me at eleven at eleven sir it only wants a quarter now very near the time said mr pickwick yes it is rather near replied mr magnus rather too near to be pleasant eh mr pickwick sir confidence is a great thing in these cases observed mr pickwick i believe it is sir said mr peter magnus i am very confident sir really mr pickwick i do not see why a man should feel any fear in such a case as this sir what is it sir there's nothing to be ashamed of it's a matter of mutual accommodation nothing more husband on one side wife on the other that's my view of the matter mr pickwick it is a very philosophical one replied mr pickwick but breakfast is waiting mr magnus come down they sat to breakfast but it was evident notwithstanding the boasting of mr peter magnus that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness of which loss of appetite a propensity to upset the tea things a spectral attempt at drollery and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock every other second were among the principal symptoms he he he tittered mr magnus affecting cheerfulness and gasping with agitation it only wants two minutes mr pickwick am i pale sir not very replied mr pickwick there was a brief pause i beg your pardon mr pickwick but have you ever done this sort of thing in your time said mr magnus you mean proposing said mr pickwick yes never said mr pickwick with great energy never you have no idea then how it's best to begin said mr magnus why said mr pickwick i may have formed some ideas upon the subject but as i have never submitted them to the test of experience i should be sorry if you were induced to regulate your proceedings by them i should feel very much obliged to you for any advice sir said mr magnus taking another look at the clock the hand of which was verging on the five minutes past well sir said mr pickwick with the profound solemnity with which that great man could when he pleased render his remarks so deeply impressive i should commence sir with a tribute to the lady's beauty and excellent qualities from them sir i should diverge to my own unworthiness very good said mr magnus unworthiness for her only mind sir resumed mr pickwick for to show that i was not wholly unworthy sir i should take a brief review of my past life and present condition i should argue by analogy that to anybody else i must be a very desirable object i should then expatiate on the warmth of my love and the depth of my devotion perhaps i might then be tempted to seize her hand yes i see said mr magnus that would be a very great point i should then sir continued mr pickwick growing warmer as the subject presented itself in more glowing colours before him i should then sir come to the plain and simple question 'will you have me' i think i am justified in assuming that upon this she would turn away her head you think that may be taken for granted said mr magnus because if she did not do that at the right place it would be embarrassing i think she would said mr pickwick upon this sir i should squeeze her hand and i think i think mr magnus that after i had done that supposing there was no refusal i should gently draw away the handkerchief which my slight knowledge of human nature leads me to suppose the lady would be applying to her eyes at the moment and steal a respectful kiss i think i should kiss her mr magnus and at this particular point i am decidedly of opinion that if the lady were going to take me at all she would murmur into my ears a bashful acceptance mr magnus started gazed on mr pickwick's intelligent face for a short time in silence and then the dial pointing to the ten minutes past shook him warmly by the hand and rushed desperately from the room mr pickwick had taken a few strides to and fro and the small hand of the clock following the latter part of his example had arrived at the figure which indicates the half hour when the door suddenly opened he turned round to meet mr peter magnus and encountered in his stead the joyous face of mr tupman the serene countenance of mr winkle and the intellectual lineaments of mr snodgrass as mr pickwick greeted them mr peter magnus tripped into the room my friends the gentleman i was speaking of mr magnus said mr pickwick your servant gentlemen said mr magnus evidently in a high state of excitement mr pickwick allow me to speak to you one moment sir as he said this mr magnus harnessed his forefinger to mr pickwick's button hole and drawing him to a window recess said congratulate me mr pickwick i followed your advice to the very letter and it was all correct was it inquired mr pickwick it was sir could not possibly have been better replied mr magnus mr pickwick she is mine i congratulate you with all my heart replied mr pickwick warmly shaking his new friend by the hand you must see her sir said mr magnus this way if you please excuse us for one instant gentlemen hurrying on in this way mr peter magnus drew mr pickwick from the room he paused at the next door in the passage and tapped gently thereat come in said a female voice and in they went miss witherfield said mr magnus allow me to introduce my very particular friend mr pickwick mr pickwick i beg to make you known to miss witherfield the lady was at the upper end of the room as mr pickwick bowed he took his spectacles from his waistcoat pocket and put them on a process which he had no sooner gone through than uttering an exclamation of surprise mr pickwick retreated several paces and the lady with a half suppressed scream hid her face in her hands and dropped into a chair whereupon mr peter magnus was stricken motionless on the spot and gazed from one to the other with a countenance expressive of the extremities of horror and surprise this certainly was to all appearance very unaccountable behaviour but the fact is that mr pickwick no sooner put on his spectacles than he at once recognised in the future mrs magnus the lady into whose room he had so unwarrantably intruded on the previous night and the spectacles had no sooner crossed mr pickwick's nose than the lady at once identified the countenance which she had seen surrounded by all the horrors of a night cap so the lady screamed and mr pickwick started mr pickwick exclaimed mr magnus lost in astonishment what is the meaning of this sir what is the meaning of it sir added mr magnus in a threatening and a louder tone sir said mr pickwick somewhat indignant at the very sudden manner in which mr peter magnus had conjugated himself into the imperative mood i decline answering that question you decline it sir said mr magnus i do sir replied mr pickwick i object to saying anything which may compromise that lady or awaken unpleasant recollections in her breast without her consent and permission miss witherfield said mr peter magnus do you know this person know him repeated the middle aged lady hesitating yes know him ma'am i said know him replied mr magnus with ferocity i have seen him replied the middle aged lady where inquired mr magnus where that said the middle aged lady rising from her seat and averting her head that i would not reveal for worlds i understand you ma'am said mr pickwick and respect your delicacy it shall never be revealed by me depend upon it upon my word ma'am said mr magnus considering the situation in which i am placed with regard to yourself you carry this matter off with tolerable coolness tolerable coolness ma'am cruel mr magnus said the middle aged lady here she wept very copiously indeed address your observations to me sir interposed mr pickwick i alone am to blame if anybody be oh you alone are to blame are you sir said mr magnus i i see through this sir you repent of your determination now do you my determination said mr pickwick your determination sir oh don't stare at me sir said mr magnus i recollect your words last night sir you came down here sir to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual on whose truth and honour you had placed implicit reliance eh here mr peter magnus indulged in a prolonged sneer and taking off his green spectacles which he probably found superfluous in his fit of jealousy rolled his little eyes about in a manner frightful to behold eh said mr magnus and then he repeated the sneer with increased effect but you shall answer it sir answer what said mr pickwick never mind sir replied mr magnus striding up and down the room never mind there must be something very comprehensive in this phrase of never mind for we do not recollect to have ever witnessed a quarrel in the street at a theatre public room or elsewhere in which it has not been the standard reply to all belligerent inquiries do you call yourself a gentleman sir never mind sir did i offer to say anything to the young woman sir never mind sir do you want your head knocked up against that wall sir never mind sir it is observable too that there would appear to be some hidden taunt in this universal never mind which rouses more indignation in the bosom of the individual addressed than the most lavish abuse could possibly awaken we do not mean to assert that the application of this brevity to himself struck exactly that indignation to mr pickwick's soul which it would infallibly have roused in a vulgar breast we merely record the fact that mr pickwick opened the room door and abruptly called out tupman come here mr tupman immediately presented himself with a look of very considerable surprise tupman said mr pickwick a secret of some delicacy in which that lady is concerned is the cause of a difference which has just arisen between this gentleman and myself when i assure him in your presence that it has no relation to himself and is not in any way connected with his affairs i need hardly beg you to take notice that if he continue to dispute it he expresses a doubt of my veracity which i shall consider extremely insulting as mr pickwick said this he looked encyclopdias at mr peter magnus mr pickwick's upright and honourable bearing coupled with that force and energy of speech which so eminently distinguished him would have carried conviction to any reasonable mind but unfortunately at that particular moment the mind of mr peter magnus was in anything but reasonable order consequently instead of receiving mr pickwick's explanation as he ought to have done he forthwith proceeded to work himself into a red hot scorching consuming passion and to talk about what was due to his own feelings and all that sort of thing adding force to his declamation by striding to and fro and pulling his hair amusements which he would vary occasionally by shaking his fist in mr pickwick's philanthropic countenance mr pickwick in his turn conscious of his own innocence and rectitude and irritated by having unfortunately involved the middle aged lady in such an unpleasant affair was not so quietly disposed as was his wont the consequence was that words ran high and voices higher and at length mr magnus told mr pickwick he should hear from him to which mr pickwick replied with laudable politeness that the sooner he heard from him the better whereupon the middle aged lady rushed in terror from the room out of which mr tupman dragged mr pickwick leaving mr peter magnus to himself and meditation if the middle aged lady had mingled much with the busy world or had profited at all by the manners and customs of those who make the laws and set the fashions she would have known that this sort of ferocity is the most harmless thing in nature but as she had lived for the most part in the country and never read the parliamentary debates she was little versed in these particular refinements of civilised life accordingly when she had gained her bed chamber bolted herself in and begun to meditate on the scene she had just witnessed the most terrific pictures of slaughter and destruction presented themselves to her imagination among which a full length portrait of mr peter magnus borne home by four men with the embellishment of a whole barrel full of bullets in his left side was among the very least the more the middle aged lady meditated the more terrified she became and at length she determined to repair to the house of the principal magistrate of the town and request him to secure the persons of mr pickwick and mr tupman without delay to this decision the middle aged lady was impelled by a variety of considerations the chief of which was the incontestable proof it would afford of her devotion to mr peter magnus and her anxiety for his safety she was too well acquainted with his jealous temperament to venture the slightest allusion to the real cause of her agitation on beholding mr pickwick and she trusted to her own influence and power of persuasion with the little man to quell his boisterous jealousy supposing that mr pickwick were removed and no fresh quarrel could arise filled with these reflections the middle aged lady arrayed herself in her bonnet and shawl and repaired to the mayor's dwelling straightway now george nupkins esquire the principal magistrate aforesaid was as grand a personage as the fastest walker would find out between sunrise and sunset on the twenty first of june which being according to the almanacs the longest day in the whole year would naturally afford him the longest period for his search on this particular morning mr nupkins was in a state of the utmost excitement and irritation for there had been a rebellion in the town all the day scholars at the largest day school had conspired to break the windows of an obnoxious apple seller and had hooted the beadle and pelted the constabulary an elderly gentleman in top boots who had been called out to repress the tumult and who had been a peace officer man and boy for half a century at least and mr nupkins was sitting in his easy chair frowning with majesty and boiling with rage when a lady was announced on pressing private and particular business mr nupkins looked calmly terrible and commanded that the lady should be shown in which command like all the mandates of emperors and magistrates and other great potentates of the earth was forthwith obeyed and miss witherfield interestingly agitated was ushered in accordingly muzzle said the magistrate muzzle was an undersized footman with a long body and short legs muzzle yes your worship place a chair and leave the room yes your worship now ma'am will you state your business said the magistrate it is of a very painful kind sir said miss witherfield very likely ma'am said the magistrate compose your feelings ma'am here mr nupkins looked benignant and then tell me what legal business brings you here ma'am here the magistrate triumphed over the man and he looked stern again it is very distressing to me sir to give this information said miss witherfield but i fear a duel is going to be fought here here ma'am said the magistrate where ma'am in ipswich in ipswich ma'am a duel in ipswich said the magistrate perfectly aghast at the notion impossible ma'am nothing of the kind can be contemplated in this town i am persuaded bless my soul ma'am are you aware of the activity of our local magistracy do you happen to have heard ma'am that i rushed into a prize ring on the fourth of may last attended by only sixty special constables and at the hazard of falling a sacrifice to the angry passions of an infuriated multitude prohibited a pugilistic contest between the middlesex dumpling and the suffolk bantam a duel in ipswich ma'am i don't think i do not think said the magistrate reasoning with himself that any two men can have had the hardihood to plan such a breach of the peace in this town my information is unfortunately but too correct said the middle aged lady i was present at the quarrel it's a most extraordinary thing said the astounded magistrate muzzle yes your worship send mr jinks here directly instantly yes your worship muzzle retired and a pale sharp nosed half fed shabbily clad clerk of middle age entered the room mr jinks said the magistrate mr jinks sir said mr jinks this lady mr jinks has come here to give information of an intended duel in this town mr jinks not knowing exactly what to do smiled a dependent's smile what are you laughing at mr jinks said the magistrate mr jinks looked serious instantly mr jinks said the magistrate you're a fool mr jinks looked humbly at the great man and bit the top of his pen you may see something very comical in this information sir but i can tell you this mr jinks that you have very little to laugh at said the magistrate the hungry looking jinks sighed as if he were quite aware of the fact of his having very little indeed to be merry about and being ordered to take the lady's information shambled to a seat and proceeded to write it down this man pickwick is the principal i understand said the magistrate when the statement was finished he is said the middle aged lady and the other rioter what's his name mr jinks tupman sir tupman is the second yes the other principal you say has absconded ma'am yes replied miss witherfield with a short cough very well said the magistrate these are two cut throats from london who have come down here to destroy his majesty's population thinking that at this distance from the capital the arm of the law is weak and paralysed they shall be made an example of draw up the warrants mr jinks muzzle yes your worship is grummer down stairs yes your worship send him up the obsequious muzzle retired and presently returned introducing the elderly gentleman in the top boots who was chiefly remarkable for a bottle nose a hoarse voice a snuff coloured surtout and a wandering eye grummer said the magistrate your wash up is the town quiet now pretty well your wash up replied grummer pop'lar feeling has in a measure subsided consekens o' the boys having dispersed to cricket nothing but vigorous measures will do in these times grummer said the magistrate in a determined manner if the authority of the king's officers is set at nought we must have the riot act read if the civil power cannot protect these windows grummer the military must protect the civil power and the windows too i believe that is a maxim of the constitution mr jinks certainly sir said jinks very good said the magistrate signing the warrants grummer you will bring these persons before me this afternoon you will find them at the great white horse you recollect the case of the middlesex dumpling and the suffolk bantam grummer mr grummer intimated by a retrospective shake of the head that he should never forget it as indeed it was not likely he would so long as it continued to be cited daily this is even more unconstitutional said the magistrate this is even a greater breach of the peace and a grosser infringement of his majesty's prerogative i believe duelling is one of his majesty's most undoubted prerogatives mr jinks expressly stipulated in magna charta sir said mr jinks one of the brightest jewels in the british crown wrung from his majesty by the barons i believe mr jinks said the magistrate just so sir replied mr jinks very well said the magistrate drawing himself up proudly it shall not be violated in this portion of his dominions grummer procure assistance and execute these warrants with as little delay as possible muzzle yes your worship show the lady out miss witherfield retired deeply impressed with the magistrates' learning and research mr nupkins retired to lunch mr jinks retired within himself that being the only retirement he had except the sofa bedstead in the small parlour which was occupied by his landlady's family in the daytime and mr grummer retired to wipe out by his mode of discharging his present commission the insult which had been fastened upon himself and the other representative of his majesty the beadle in the course of the morning while these resolute and determined preparations for the conservation of the king's peace were pending mr pickwick and his friends wholly unconscious of the mighty events in progress had sat quietly down to dinner and very talkative and companionable they all were mr pickwick was in the very act of relating his adventure of the preceding night to the great amusement of his followers mr tupman especially when the door opened and a somewhat forbidding countenance peeped into the room the eyes in the forbidding countenance looked very earnestly at mr pickwick for several seconds and were to all appearance satisfied with their investigation for the body to which the forbidding countenance belonged slowly brought itself into the apartment and presented the form of an elderly individual in top boots not to keep the reader any longer in suspense in short the eyes were the wandering eyes of mr grummer and the body was the body of the same gentleman mr grummer's mode of proceeding was professional but peculiar his first act was to bolt the door on the inside his second to polish his head and countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief his third to place his hat with the cotton handkerchief in it on the nearest chair and his fourth to produce from the breast pocket of his coat a short truncheon surmounted by a brazen crown with which he beckoned to mr pickwick with a grave and ghost like air mr snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence he looked steadily at mr grummer for a brief space and then said emphatically this is a private room sir a private room mr grummer shook his head and replied no room's private to his majesty when the street door's once passed that's law some people maintains that an englishman's house is his castle that's gammon the pickwickians gazed on each other with wondering eyes which is mr tupman inquired mr grummer he had an intuitive perception of mr pickwick he knew him at once my name's tupman said that gentleman my name's law said mr grummer what said mr tupman law replied mr grummer law civil power and exekative them's my titles here's my authority blank tupman blank pickvick against the peace of our sufferin lord the king stattit in that case made and purwided and all regular i apprehend you pickvick tupman the aforesaid what do you mean by this insolence said mr tupman starting up leave the room halloo said mr grummer retreating very expeditiously to the door and opening it an inch or two dubbley well said a deep voice from the passage come for'ard dubbley at the word of command a dirty faced man something over six feet high and stout in proportion squeezed himself through the half open door making his face very red in the process and entered the room is the other specials outside dubbley inquired mr grummer mr dubbley who was a man of few words nodded assent order in the diwision under your charge dubbley said mr grummer mr dubbley did as he was desired and half a dozen men each with a short truncheon and a brass crown flocked into the room mr grummer pocketed his staff and looked at mr dubbley mr dubbley pocketed his staff and looked at the division the division pocketed their staffs and looked at messrs tupman and pickwick mr pickwick and his followers rose as one man what is the meaning of this atrocious intrusion upon my privacy said mr pickwick who dares apprehend me said mr tupman what do you want here scoundrels said mr snodgrass mr winkle said nothing but he fixed his eyes on grummer and bestowed a look upon him which if he had had any feeling must have pierced his brain as it was however it had no visible effect upon him whatever when the executive perceived that mr pickwick and his friends were disposed to resist the authority of the law they very significantly turned up their coat sleeves as if knocking them down in the first instance and taking them up afterwards were a mere professional act which had only to be thought of to be done as a matter of course this demonstration was not lost upon mr pickwick he conferred a few moments with mr tupman apart and then signified his readiness to proceed to the mayor's residence merely begging the parties then and there assembled to take notice that it was his firm intention to resent this monstrous invasion of his privileges as an englishman the instant he was at liberty whereat the parties then and there assembled laughed very heartily with the single exception of mr grummer who seemed to consider that any slight cast upon the divine right of magistrates was a species of blasphemy not to be tolerated but when mr pickwick had signified his readiness to bow to the laws of his country and just when the waiters and hostlers and chamber maids and post boys who had anticipated a delightful commotion from his threatened obstinacy began to turn away disappointed and disgusted a difficulty arose which had not been foreseen with every sentiment of veneration for the constituted authorities mr pickwick resolutely protested against making his appearance in the public streets surrounded and guarded by the officers of justice like a common criminal mr grummer in the then disturbed state of public feeling for it was half holiday and the boys had not yet gone home as resolutely protested against walking on the opposite side of the way and taking mr pickwick's parole that he would go straight to the magistrate's and both mr pickwick and mr tupman as strenuously objected to the expense of a post coach which was the only respectable conveyance that could be obtained the dispute ran high and the dilemma lasted long and just as the executive were on the point of overcoming mr pickwick's objection to walking to the magistrate's by the trite expedient of carrying him thither it was recollected that there stood in the inn yard an old sedan chair which having been originally built for a gouty gentleman with funded property would hold mr pickwick and mr tupman at least as conveniently as a modern post chaise the chair was hired and brought into the hall mr pickwick and mr tupman squeezed themselves inside and pulled down the blinds a couple of chairmen were speedily found and the procession started in grand order the specials surrounded the body of the vehicle mr grummer and mr dubbley marched triumphantly in front mr snodgrass and mr winkle walked arm in arm behind and the unsoaped of ipswich brought up the rear the shopkeepers of the town although they had a very indistinct notion of the nature of the offence could not but be much edified and gratified by this spectacle here was the strong arm of the law coming down with twenty gold beater force upon two offenders from the metropolis itself the mighty engine was directed by their own magistrate and worked by their own officers and both the criminals by their united efforts were securely shut up in the narrow compass of one sedan chair many were the expressions of approval and admiration which greeted mr grummer as he headed the cavalcade staff in hand loud and long were the shouts raised by the unsoaped and amidst these united testimonials of public approbation the procession moved slowly and majestically along mr weller habited in his morning jacket with the black calico sleeves was returning in a rather desponding state from an unsuccessful survey of the mysterious house with the green gate when raising his eyes he beheld a crowd pouring down the street surrounding an object which had very much the appearance of a sedan chair willing to divert his thoughts from the failure of his enterprise he stepped aside to see the crowd pass and finding that they were cheering away very much to their own satisfaction forthwith began by way of raising his spirits to cheer too with all his might and main mr grummer passed and mr dubbley passed and the sedan passed and the body guard of specials passed and sam was still responding to the enthusiastic cheers of the mob and waving his hat about as if he were in the very last extreme of the wildest joy though of course he had not the faintest idea of the matter in hand when he was suddenly stopped by the unexpected appearance of mr winkle and mr snodgrass what's the row gen'l'm'n cried sam who have they got in this here watch box in mournin' both gentlemen replied together but their words were lost in the tumult who cried sam again once more was a joint reply returned and though the words were inaudible sam saw by the motion of the two pairs of lips that they had uttered the magic word pickwick this was enough in another minute mr weller had made his way through the crowd stopped the chairmen and confronted the portly grummer hallo old gen'l'm'n said sam who have you got in this here conwayance stand back said mr grummer whose dignity like the dignity of a great many other men had been wondrously augmented by a little popularity knock him down if he don't said mr dubbley i'm wery much obliged to you old gen'l'm'n replied sam for consulting my conwenience and i'm still more obliged to the other gen'l'm'n who looks as if he'd just escaped from a giant's carrywan for his wery 'ansome suggestion but i should perfer your givin' me a answer to my question if it's all the same to you how are you sir this last observation was addressed with a patronising air to mr pickwick who was peeping through the front window mr grummer perfectly speechless with indignation dragged the truncheon with the brass crown from its particular pocket and flourished it before sam's eyes ah said sam it's wery pretty 'specially the crown which is uncommon like the real one stand back said the outraged mr grummer by way of adding force to the command he thrust the brass emblem of royalty into sam's neckcloth with one hand and seized sam's collar with the other a compliment which mr weller returned by knocking him down out of hand having previously with the utmost consideration knocked down a chairman for him to lie upon whether mr winkle was seized with a temporary attack of that species of insanity which originates in a sense of injury or animated by this display of mr weller's valour is uncertain but certain it is that he no sooner saw mr grummer fall than he made a terrific onslaught on a small boy who stood next to him whereupon mr snodgrass in a truly christian spirit and in order that he might take no one unawares announced in a very loud tone that he was going to begin and proceeded to take off his coat with the utmost deliberation he was immediately surrounded and secured and it is but common justice both to him and mr winkle to say that they did not make the slightest attempt to rescue either themselves or mr weller who after a most vigorous resistance was overpowered by numbers and taken prisoner the procession then re formed the chairmen resumed their stations and the march was re commenced mr pickwick's indignation during the whole of this proceeding was beyond all bounds he could just see sam upsetting the specials and flying about in every direction and that was all he could see for the sedan doors wouldn't open and the blinds wouldn't pull up at length with the assistance of mr tupman he managed to push open the roof and mounting on the seat and steadying himself as well as he could by placing his hand on that gentleman's shoulder mr pickwick proceeded to address the multitude to dwell upon the unjustifiable manner in which he had been treated and to call upon them to take notice that his servant had been first assaulted in this order they reached the magistrate's house the chairmen trotting the prisoners following mr pickwick oratorising and the crowd shouting chapter xxv illustration showing among a variety of pleasant matters how majestic and impartial mr nupkins was and how mr weller returned mr job trotter's shuttlecock as heavily as it came with another matter which will be found in its place violent was mr weller's indignation as he was borne along numerous were the allusions to the personal appearance and demeanour of mr grummer and his companion and valorous were the defiances to any six of the gentlemen present in which he vented his dissatisfaction mr snodgrass and mr winkle listened with gloomy respect to the torrent of eloquence which their leader poured forth from the sedan chair and the rapid course of which not all mr tupman's earnest entreaties to have the lid of the vehicle closed were able to check for an instant but mr weller's anger quickly gave way to curiosity when the procession turned down the identical court yard in which he had met with the runaway job trotter and curiosity was exchanged for a feeling of the most gleeful astonishment when the all important mr grummer commanding the sedan bearers to halt advanced with dignified and portentous steps to the very green gate from which job trotter had emerged and gave a mighty pull at the bell handle which hung at the side thereof the ring was answered by a very smart and pretty faced servant girl who after holding up her hands in astonishment at the rebellious appearance of the prisoners and the impassioned language of mr pickwick summoned mr muzzle mr muzzle opened one half of the carriage gate to admit the sedan the captured ones and the specials and immediately slammed it in the faces of the mob who indignant at being excluded and anxious to see what followed relieved their feelings by kicking at the gate and ringing the bell for an hour or two afterwards in this amusement they all took part by turns except three or four fortunate individuals who having discovered a grating in the gate which commanded a view of nothing stared through it with the indefatigable perseverance with which people will flatten their noses against the front windows of a chemist's shop when a drunken man who has been run over by a dog cart in the street is undergoing a surgical inspection in the back parlour at the foot of a flight of steps leading to the house door which was guarded on either side by an american aloe in a green tub the sedan chair stopped mr pickwick and his friends were conducted into the hall whence having been previously announced by muzzle and ordered in by mr nupkins they were ushered into the worshipful presence of that public spirited officer the scene was an impressive one well calculated to strike terror to the hearts of culprits and to impress them with an adequate idea of the stern majesty of the law in front of a big book case in a big chair behind a big table and before a big volume sat mr nupkins looking a full size larger than any one of them big as they were the table was adorned with piles of papers and above the further end of it appeared the head and shoulders of mr jinks who was busily engaged in looking as busy as possible the party having all entered muzzle carefully closed the door and placed himself behind his master's chair to await his orders mr nupkins threw himself back with thrilling solemnity and scrutinised the faces of his unwilling visitors now grummer who is that person said mr nupkins pointing to mr pickwick who as the spokesman of his friends stood hat in hand bowing with the utmost politeness and respect this here's pickvick your wash up said grummer come none o' that 'ere old strike a light interposed mr weller elbowing himself into the front rank beg your pardon sir but this here officer o' yourn in the gambooge tops 'ull never earn a decent livin' as a master o' the ceremonies any vere this here sir continued mr weller thrusting grummer aside and addressing the magistrate with pleasant familiarity this here is s pickvick esquire this here's mr tupman that 'ere's mr snodgrass and furder on next him on the t'other side mr winkle all wery nice gen'l'm'n sir as you'll be wery happy to have the acquaintance on so the sooner you commits these here officers o' yourn to the tread mill for a month or two the sooner we shall begin to be on a pleasant understanding business first pleasure afterwards as king richard the third said wen he stabbed the t'other king in the tower afore he smothered the babbies at the conclusion of this address mr weller brushed his hat with his right elbow and nodded benignly to jinks who had heard him throughout with unspeakable awe who is this man grummer said the magistrate wery desp'rate ch'racter your wash up replied grummer he attempted to rescue the prisoners and assaulted the officers so we took him into custody and brought him here you did quite right replied the magistrate he is evidently a desperate ruffian he is my servant sir said mr pickwick angrily oh he is your servant is he said mr nupkins a conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice and murder its officers pickwick's servant put that down mr jinks mr jinks did so what's your name fellow thundered mr nupkins veller replied sam a very good name for the newgate calendar said mr nupkins this was a joke so jinks grummer dubbley all the specials and muzzle went into fits of laughter of five minutes' duration put down his name mr jinks said the magistrate two l's old feller said sam here an unfortunate special laughed again whereupon the magistrate threatened to commit him instantly it is a dangerous thing to laugh at the wrong man in these cases where do you live said the magistrate vare ever i can replied sam put down that mr jinks said the magistrate who was fast rising into a rage score it under said sam he is a vagabond mr jinks said the magistrate he is a vagabond on his own statement is he not mr jinks certainly sir then i'll commit him i'll commit him as such said mr nupkins this is a wery impartial country for justice said sam there ain't a magistrate goin' as don't commit himself twice as often as he commits other people at this sally another special laughed and then tried to look so supernaturally solemn that the magistrate detected him immediately grummer said mr nupkins reddening with passion how dare you select such an inefficient and disreputable person for a special constable as that man how dare you do it sir i am very sorry your wash up stammered grummer very sorry said the furious magistrate you shall repent of this neglect of duty mr grummer you shall be made an example of take that fellow's staff away he's drunk you're drunk fellow i am not drunk your worship said the man you are drunk returned the magistrate how dare you say you are not drunk sir when i say you are doesn't he smell of spirits grummer horrid your wash up replied grummer who had a vague impression that there was a smell of rum somewhere i knew he did said mr nupkins i saw he was drunk when he first came into the room by his excited eye did you observe his excited eye mr jinks certainly sir i haven't touched a drop of spirits this morning said the man who was as sober a fellow as need be how dare you tell me a falsehood said mr nupkins isn't he drunk at this moment mr jinks certainly sir replied jinks mr jinks said the magistrate i shall commit that man for contempt make out his committal mr jinks and committed the special would have been only jinks who was the magistrate's adviser having had a legal education of three years in a country attorney's office whispered the magistrate that he thought it wouldn't do so the magistrate made a speech and said that in consideration of the special's family he would merely reprimand and discharge him accordingly the special was abused vehemently for a quarter of an hour and sent about his business and grummer dubbley muzzle and all the other specials murmured their admiration of the magnanimity of mr nupkins now mr jinks said the magistrate swear grummer grummer was sworn directly but as grummer wandered and mr nupkin's dinner was nearly ready mr nupkins cut the matter short by putting leading questions to grummer which grummer answered as nearly in the affirmative as he could so the examination went off all very smooth and comfortable and two assaults were proved against mr weller and a threat against mr winkle and a push against mr snodgrass when all this was done to the magistrate's satisfaction the magistrate and mr jinks consulted in whispers the consultation having lasted about ten minutes mr jinks retired to his end of the table and the magistrate with a preparatory cough drew himself up in his chair and was proceeding to commence his address when mr pickwick interposed i beg your pardon sir for interrupting you said mr pickwick but before you proceed to express and act upon any opinion you may have formed on the statements which have been made here i must claim my right to be heard so far as i am personally concerned hold your tongue sir said the magistrate peremptorily i must submit to you sir said mr pickwick hold your tongue sir interposed the magistrate or i shall order an officer to remove you you may order your officers to do whatever you please sir said mr pickwick and i have no doubt from the specimen i have had of the subordination preserved amongst them that whatever you order they will execute sir but i shall take the liberty sir of claiming my right to be heard until i am removed by force pickvick and principle exclaimed mr weller in a very audible voice sam be quiet said mr pickwick dumb as a drum with a hole in it sir replied sam mr nupkins looked at mr pickwick with a gaze of intense astonishment at his displaying such unwonted temerity and was apparently about to return a very angry reply when mr jinks pulled him by the sleeve and whispered something in his ear to this the magistrate returned a half audible answer and then the whispering was renewed jinks was evidently remonstrating at length the magistrate gulping down with a very bad grace his disinclination to hear anything more turned to mr pickwick and said sharply what do you want to say first said mr pickwick sending a look through his spectacles under which even nupkins quailed first i wish to know what i and my friend have been brought here for must i tell him whispered the magistrate to jinks i think you had better sir whispered jinks to the magistrate an information has been sworn before me said the magistrate that it is apprehended you are going to fight a duel and that the other man tupman is your aider and abettor in it therefore eh mr jinks certainly sir therefore i call upon you both to i think that's the course mr jinks certainly sir to to what mr jinks said the magistrate pettishly to find bail sir yes therefore i call upon you both as i was about to say when i was interrupted by my clerk to find bail good bail whispered mr jinks i shall require good bail said the magistrate town's people whispered jinks they must be town's people said the magistrate fifty pounds each whispered jinks and householders of course i shall require two sureties of fifty pounds each said the magistrate aloud with great dignity and they must be householders of course but bless my heart sir said mr pickwick who together with mr tupman was all amazement and indignation we are perfect strangers in the town i have as little knowledge of any householders here as i have intention of fighting a duel with anybody i dare say replied the magistrate i dare say don't you mr jinks certainly sir have you anything more to say inquired the magistrate mr pickwick had a great deal more to say which he would no doubt have said very little to his own advantage or the magistrate's satisfaction if he had not the moment he ceased speaking been pulled by the sleeve by mr weller with whom he was immediately engaged in so earnest a conversation that he suffered the magistrate's inquiry to pass wholly unnoticed mr nupkins was not the man to ask a question of the kind twice over and so with another preparatory cough he proceeded amidst the reverential and admiring silence of the constables to pronounce his decision he should fine weller two pounds for the first assault and three pounds for the second he should fine winkle two pounds and snodgrass one pound besides requiring them to enter into their own recognisances to keep the peace towards all his majesty's subjects and especially towards his liege servant daniel grummer pickwick and tupman he had already held to bail immediately on the magistrate ceasing to speak mr pickwick with a smile mantling on his again good humoured countenance stepped forward and said i beg the magistrate's pardon but may i request a few minutes' private conversation with him on a matter of deep importance to himself what said the magistrate mr pickwick repeated his request this is a most extraordinary request said the magistrate a private interview a private interview replied mr pickwick firmly only as a part of the information which i wish to communicate is derived from my servant i should wish him to be present the magistrate looked at mr jinks mr jinks looked at the magistrate the officers looked at each other in amazement mr nupkins turned suddenly pale could the man weller in a moment of remorse have divulged some secret conspiracy for his assassination it was a dreadful thought he was a public man and he turned paler as he thought of julius csar and mr perceval the magistrate looked at mr pickwick again and beckoned mr jinks what do you think of this request mr jinks murmured mr nupkins mr jinks who didn't exactly know what to think of it and was afraid he might offend smiled feebly after a dubious fashion and screwing up the corners of his mouth shook his head slowly from side to side mr jinks said the magistrate gravely you are an ass at this little expression of opinion mr jinks smiled again rather more feebly than before and edged himself by degrees back into his own corner mr nupkins debated the matter within himself for a few seconds and then rising from his chair and requesting mr pickwick and sam to follow him led the way into a small room which opened into the justice parlour desiring mr pickwick to walk to the upper end of the little apartment and holding his hand upon the half closed door that he might be able to effect an immediate escape in case there was the least tendency to a display of hostilities mr nupkins expressed his readiness to hear the communication whatever it might be i will come to the point at once sir said mr pickwick it affects yourself and your credit materially i have every reason to believe sir that you are harbouring in your house a gross impostor two interrupted sam mulberry agin all natur for tears and willainy sam said mr pickwick if i am to render myself intelligible to this gentleman i must beg you to control your feelings wery sorry sir replied mr weller but when i think o' that 'ere job i can't help opening the walve a inch or two in one word sir said mr pickwick is my servant right in suspecting that a certain captain fitz marshall is in the habit of visiting here because added mr pickwick as he saw that mr nupkins was about to offer a very indignant interruption because if he be i know that person to be a hush hush said mr nupkins closing the door know him to be what sir an unprincipled adventurer a dishonourable character a man who preys upon society and makes easily deceived people his dupes sir his absurd his foolish his wretched dupes sir said the excited mr pickwick dear me said mr nupkins turning very red and altering his whole manner directly dear me mr pickvick said sam pickwick said the magistrate dear me mr pickwick pray take a seat you cannot mean this captain fitz marshall don't call him a cap'en said sam nor fitz marshall neither he ain't neither one nor t'other he's a strolling actor he is and his name's jingle and if ever there was a wolf in a mulberry suit that ere job trotter's him it is very true sir said mr pickwick replying to the magistrate's look of amazement my only business in this town is to expose the person of whom we now speak mr pickwick proceeded to pour into the horror stricken ear of mr nupkins an abridged account of mr jingle's atrocities he related how he had first met him how he had eloped with miss wardle how he had cheerfully resigned the lady for a pecuniary consideration how he had entrapped himself into a lady's boarding school at midnight and how he mr pickwick now felt it his duty to expose his assumption of his present name and rank as the narrative proceeded all the warm blood in the body of mr nupkins tingled up into the very tips of his ears he had picked up the captain at a neighbouring race course charmed with his long list of aristocratic acquaintance his extensive travel and his fashionable demeanour mrs nupkins and miss nupkins had exhibited captain fitz marshall and quoted captain fitz marshall and hurled captain fitz marshall at the devoted heads of their select circle of acquaintance until their bosom friends mrs porkenham and the miss porkenhams and mr sidney porkenham were ready to burst with jealousy and despair and now to hear after all that he was a needy adventurer a strolling player and if not a swindler something so very like it that it was hard to tell the difference heavens what would the porkenhams say what would be the triumph of mr sidney porkenham when he found that his addresses had been slighted for such a rival how should he nupkins meet the eye of old porkenham at the next quarter sessions and what a handle would it be for the opposition magisterial party if the story got abroad but after all said mr nupkins brightening for a moment after a long pause after all this is a mere statement captain fitz marshall is a man of very engaging manners and i dare say has many enemies what proof have you of the truth of these representations confront me with him said mr pickwick that is all i ask and all i require confront him with me and my friends here you will want no further proof why said mr nupkins that might be very easily done for he will be here to night and then there would be no occasion to make the matter public just just for the young man's own sake you know i i should like to consult mrs nupkins on the propriety of the step in the first instance though at all events mr pickwick we must despatch this legal business before we can do anything else pray step back into the next room into the next room they went grummer said the magistrate in an awful voice your wash up replied grummer with the smile of a favourite come come sir said the magistrate sternly don't let me see any of this levity here it is very unbecoming and i can assure you that you have very little to smile at was the account you gave me just now strictly true now be careful sir your wash up stammered grummer i oh you are confused are you said the magistrate mr jinks you observe this confusion certainly sir replied jinks now said the magistrate repeat your statement grummer and again i warn you to be careful mr jinks take his words down the unfortunate grummer proceeded to re state his complaint but what between mr jinks taking down his words and the magistrate's taking them up his natural tendency to rambling and his extreme confusion he managed to get involved in something under three minutes in such a mass of entanglement and contradiction that mr nupkins at once declared he didn't believe him so the fines were remitted and mr jinks found a couple of bail in no time and all these solemn proceedings having been satisfactorily concluded mr grummer was ignominiously ordered out an awful instance of the instability of human greatness and the uncertain tenure of great men's favour mrs nupkins was a majestic female in a pink gauze turban and a light brown wig miss nupkins possessed all her mamma's haughtiness without the turban and all her ill nature without the wig and whenever the exercise of these two amiable qualities involved mother and daughter in some unpleasant dilemma as they not unfrequently did they both concurred in laying the blame on the shoulders of mr nupkins accordingly when mr nupkins sought mrs nupkins and detailed the communication which had been made by mr pickwick mrs nupkins suddenly recollected that she had always expected something of the kind that she had always said it would be so that her advice was never taken that she really did not know what mr nupkins supposed she was and so forth the idea said miss nupkins forcing a tear of very scanty proportions into the corner of each eye the idea of my being made such a fool of ah you may thank your papa my dear said mrs nupkins how have i implored and begged that man to inquire into the captain's family connections how have i urged and entreated him to take some decisive step i am quite certain nobody would believe it quite but my dear said mr nupkins don't talk to me you aggravating thing don't said mrs nupkins my love said mr nupkins you professed yourself very fond of captain fitz marshall you have constantly asked him here my dear and you have lost no opportunity of introducing him elsewhere didn't i say so henrietta cried mrs nupkins appealing to her daughter with the air of a much injured female didn't i say that your papa would turn round and lay all this at my door didn't i say so here mrs nupkins sobbed oh pa remonstrated miss nupkins and here she sobbed too isn't it too much when he has brought all this disgrace and ridicule upon us to taunt me with being the cause of it exclaimed mrs nupkins how can we ever show ourselves in society said miss nupkins how can we face the porkenhams cried mrs nupkins or the griggs's cried miss nupkins or the slummintowkens cried mrs nupkins but what does your papa care what is it to him at this dreadful reflection mrs nupkins wept with mental anguish and miss nupkins followed on the same side mrs nupkins's tears continued to gush forth with great velocity until she had gained a little time to think the matter over when she decided in her own mind that the best thing to do would be to ask mr pickwick and his friends to remain until the captain's arrival and then to give mr pickwick the opportunity he sought if it appeared that he had spoken truly the captain could be turned out of the house without noising the matter abroad and they could easily account to the porkenhams for his disappearance by saying that he had been appointed through the court influence of his family to the governor generalship of sierra leone or saugur point or any other of those salubrious climates which enchant europeans so much that when they once get there they can hardly ever prevail upon themselves to come back again when mrs nupkins dried up her tears miss nupkins dried up hers and mr nupkins was very glad to settle the matter as mrs nupkins had proposed so mr pickwick and his friends having washed off all marks of their late encounter were introduced to the ladies and soon afterwards to their dinner and mr weller whom the magistrate with his peculiar sagacity had discovered in half an hour to be one of the finest fellows alive was consigned to the care and guardianship of mr muzzle who was specially enjoined to take him below and make much of him how de do sir said mr muzzle as he conducted mr weller down the kitchen stairs why no con siderable change has taken place in the state of my system since i see you cocked up behind your governor's chair in the parlour a little vile ago replied sam you will excuse my not taking more notice of you then said mr muzzle you see master hadn't introduced us then lord how fond he is of you mr weller to be sure ah said sam what a pleasant chap he is ain't he replied mr muzzle so much humour said sam and such a man to speak said mr muzzle how his ideas flow don't they wonderful replied sam they comes a pouring out knocking each other's heads so fast that they seems to stun one another you hardly know what he's arter do you that's the great merit of his style of speaking rejoined mr muzzle take care of the last step mr weller would you like to wash your hands sir before we join the ladies here's a sink with the water laid on sir and a clean jack towel behind the door ah perhaps i may as well have a rinse replied mr weller applying plenty of yellow soap to the towel and rubbing away till his face shone again how many ladies are there only two in our kitchen said mr muzzle cook and 'ousemaid we keep a boy to do the dirty work and a gal besides but they dine in the washus oh they dines in the washus do they said mr weller yes replied mr muzzle we tried 'em at our table when they first come but we couldn't keep 'em the gal's manners is dreadful vulgar and the boy breathes so very hard while he's eating that we found it impossible to sit at table with him young grampus said mr weller oh dreadful rejoined mr muzzle but that is the worst of country service mr weller the juniors is always so very savage this way sir if you please this way preceding mr weller with the utmost politeness mr muzzle conducted him into the kitchen mary said mr muzzle to the pretty servant girl this is mr weller a gentleman as master has sent down to be made as comfortable as possible and your master's a knowin' hand and has just sent me to the right place said mr weller with a glance of admiration at mary if i wos master o' this here house i should alvays find the materials for comfort vere mary wos lor mr weller said mary blushing well i never ejaculated the cook bless me cook i forgot you said mr muzzle mr weller let me introduce you how are you ma'am said mr weller wery glad to see you indeed and hope our acquaintance may be a long 'un as the gen'lm'n said to the fi' pun' note when this ceremony of introduction had been gone through the cook and mary retired into the back kitchen to titter for ten minutes then returning all giggles and blushes they sat down to dinner mr weller's easy manners and conversational powers had such irresistible influence with his new friends that before the dinner was half over they were on a footing of perfect intimacy and in possession of a full account of the delinquency of job trotter i never could a bear that job said mary no more you never ought to my dear replied mr weller why not inquired mary cos ugliness and svindlin' never ought to be formiliar vith elegance and wirtew replied mr weller ought they mr muzzle not by no means replied that gentleman here mary laughed and said the cook had made her and the cook laughed and said she hadn't i han't got a glass said mary drink with me my dear said mr weller put your lips to this here tumbler and then i can kiss you by deputy for shame mr weller said mary what's a shame my dear talkin' in that way nonsense it ain't no harm it's natur ain't it cook don't ask me imperence replied the cook in a high state of delight and hereupon the cook and mary laughed again till what between the beer and the cold meat and the laughter combined the latter young lady was brought to the verge of choking an alarming crisis from which she was only recovered by sundry pats on the back and other necessary attentions most delicately administered by mr samuel weller in the midst of all this jollity and conviviality a loud ring was heard at the garden gate to which the young gentleman who took his meals in the wash house immediately responded mr weller was in the height of his attentions to the pretty housemaid mr muzzle was busy doing the honours of the table and the cook had just paused to laugh in the very act of raising a huge morsel to her lips when the kitchen door opened and in walked mr job trotter we have said in walked mr job trotter but the statement is not distinguished by our usual scrupulous adherence to facts the door opened and mr trotter appeared he would have walked in and was in the very act of doing so indeed when catching sight of mr weller he involuntarily shrank back a pace or two and stood gazing on the unexpected scene before him perfectly motionless with amazement and terror here he is said sam rising with great glee why we were that wery moment a speaking o' you how are you where have you been come in laying his hand on the mulberry collar of the unresisting job mr weller dragged him into the kitchen and locking the door handed the key to mr muzzle who very coolly buttoned it up in a side pocket well here's a game cried sam only think o' my master havin' the pleasure o' meeting your'n up stairs and me havin' the joy o' meetin' you down here how are you gettin' on and how is the chandlery bis'ness likely to do well i am so glad to see you how happy you look it's quite a treat to see you ain't it mr muzzle quite said mr muzzle so cheerful he is said sam in such good spirits said muzzle and so glad to see us that makes it so much more comfortable said sam sit down sit down mr trotter suffered himself to be forced into a chair by the fireside he cast his small eyes first on mr weller and then on mr muzzle but said nothing well now said sam afore these here ladies i should jest like to ask you as a sort of curiosity wether you don't con sider yourself as nice and well behaved a young gen'l'm'n as ever used a pink check pocket handkerchief and the number four collection and as was ever a going to be married to a cook said that lady indignantly the willin and leave off his evil ways and set up in the chandlery line arterwards said the housemaid now i'll tell you what it is young man said mr muzzle solemnly enraged at the last two allusions this here lady pointing to the cook keeps company with me and when you presume sir to talk of keeping chandlers' shops with her you injure me in one of the most delicatest points in which one man can injure another do you understand me sir here mr muzzle who had a great notion of his eloquence in which he imitated his master paused for a reply but mr trotter made no reply so mr muzzle proceeded in a solemn manner it's very probable sir that you won't be wanted up stairs for several minutes sir because my master is at this moment particularly engaged in settling the hash of your master sir and therefore you'll have leisure sir for a little private talk with me sir do you understand me sir mr muzzle again paused for a reply and again mr trotter disappointed him well then said mr muzzle i'm very sorry to have to explain myself before ladies but the urgency of the case will be my excuse the back kitchen's empty sir if you will step in there sir mr weller will see fair and we can have mutual satisfaction till the bell rings follow me sir as mr muzzle uttered these words he took a step or two towards the door and by way of saving time began to pull off his coat as he walked along now the cook no sooner heard the concluding words of this desperate challenge and saw mr muzzle about to put it into execution than she uttered a loud and piercing shriek and rushing on mr job trotter who rose from his chair on the instant tore and buffeted his large flat face with an energy peculiar to excited females and twining her hands in his long black hair tore therefrom about enough to make five or six dozen of the very largest sized mourning rings having accomplished this feat with all the ardour which her devoted love for mr muzzle inspired she staggered back and being a lady of very excitable and delicate feelings she instantly fell under the dresser and fainted away at this moment the bell rang that's for you job trotter said sam and before mr trotter could offer remonstrance or reply even before he had time to staunch the wounds inflicted by the insensible lady sam seized one arm and mr muzzle the other and one pulling before and the other pushing behind they conveyed him up stairs and into the parlour it was an impressive tableau alfred jingle esquire alias captain fitz marshall was standing near the door with his hat in his hand and a smile on his face wholly unmoved by his very unpleasant situation confronting him stood mr pickwick who had evidently been inculcating some high moral lesson for his left hand was beneath his coat tail and his right extended in air as was his wont when delivering himself of an impressive address at a little distance stood mr tupman with indignant countenance carefully held back by his two younger friends at the further end of the room were mr nupkins mrs nupkins and miss nupkins gloomily grand and savagely vexed what prevents me said mr nupkins with magisterial dignity as job was brought in what prevents me from detaining these men as rogues and impostors it is a foolish mercy what prevents me pride old fellow pride replied jingle quite at his ease wouldn't do no go caught a captain eh ha ha very good husband for daughter biter bit make it public not for worlds look stupid very wretch said mrs nupkins we scorn your base insinuations i always hated him added henrietta oh of course said jingle tall young man old lover sidney porkenham rich fine fellow not so rich as captain though turn him away off with him anything for captain nothing like captain anywhere all the girls raving mad eh job here mr jingle laughed very heartily and job rubbing his hands with delight uttered the first sound he had given vent to since he entered the house a low noiseless chuckle which seemed to intimate that he enjoyed his laugh too much to let any of it escape in sound mr nupkins said the elder lady this is not a fit conversation for the servants to overhear let these wretches be removed certainly my dear said mr nupkins muzzle your worship open the front door yes your worship leave the house said mr nupkins waving his hand emphatically jingle smiled and moved towards the door stay said mr pickwick jingle stopped i might said mr pickwick have taken a much greater revenge for the treatment i have experienced at your hands and that of your hypocritical friend there job trotter bowed with great politeness and laid his hand upon his heart i say said mr pickwick growing gradually angry that i might have taken a greater revenge but i content myself with exposing you which i consider a duty i owe to society this is a leniency sir which i hope you will remember when mr pickwick arrived at this point job trotter with facetious gravity applied his hand to his ear as if not desirous to lose a syllable he uttered and i have only to add sir said mr pickwick now thoroughly angry that i consider you a rascal and a a ruffian and and worse than any man i ever saw or heard of except that pious and sanctified vagabond in the mulberry livery ha ha said jingle good fellow pickwick fine heart stout old boy but must not be passionate bad thing very bye bye see you again some day keep up your spirits now job trot with these words mr jingle stuck on his hat in the old fashion and strode out of the room job trotter paused looked round smiled and then with a bow of mock solemnity to mr pickwick and a wink to mr weller the audacious slyness of which baffles all description followed the footsteps of his hopeful master sam said mr pickwick as mr weller was following sir stay here mr weller seemed uncertain stay here repeated mr pickwick mayn't i polish that ere job off in the front garden said mr weller certainly not replied mr pickwick mayn't i kick him out of the gate sir said mr weller not on any account replied his master for the first time since his engagement mr weller looked for a moment discontented and unhappy but his countenance immediately cleared up for the wily mr muzzle by concealing himself behind the street door and rushing violently out at the right instant contrived with great dexterity to overturn both mr jingle and his attendant down the flight of steps into the american aloe tubs that stood beneath having discharged my duty sir said mr pickwick to mr nupkins i will with my friends bid you farewell while we thank you for such hospitality as we have received permit me to assure you in our joint names that we should not have accepted it or have consented to extricate ourselves in this way from our previous dilemma had we not been impelled by a strong sense of duty we return to london to morrow your secret is safe with us having thus entered his protest against their treatment of the morning mr pickwick bowed low to the ladies and notwithstanding the solicitations of the family left the room with his friends get your hat sam said mr pickwick it's below stairs sir said sam and he ran down after it now there was nobody in the kitchen but the pretty housemaid and as sam's hat was mislaid he had to look for it and the pretty housemaid lighted him they had to look all over the place for the hat the pretty housemaid in her anxiety to find it went down on her knees and turned over all the things that were heaped together in a little corner by the door it was an awkward corner you couldn't get at it without shutting the door first here it is said the pretty housemaid this is it ain't it let me look said sam illustration you don't mean to say you did that on purpose the pretty housemaid had stood the candle on the floor as it gave a very dim light sam was obliged to go down on his knees before he could see whether it really was his own hat or not it was a remarkably small corner and so it was nobody's fault but the man's who built the house sam and the pretty housemaid were necessarily very close together yes this is it said sam good bye good bye said the pretty housemaid good bye said sam and as he said it he dropped the hat that had cost so much trouble in looking for how awkward you are said the pretty housemaid you'll lose it again if you don't take care so just to prevent his losing it again she put it on for him whether it was that the pretty housemaid's face looked prettier still when it was raised towards sam's or whether it was the accidental consequence of their being so near to each other is matter of uncertainty to this day but sam kissed her you don't mean to say you did that on purpose said the pretty housemaid blushing no i didn't then said sam but i will now so he kissed her again sam said mr pickwick calling over the banisters coming sir replied sam running up stairs how long you have been said mr pickwick there was something behind the door sir which perwented our getting it open for ever so long sir replied sam and this was the first passage of mr weller's first love chapter xxvi illustration which contains a brief account of the progress of the action of bardell against pickwick having accomplished the main end and object of his journey the exposure of jingle mr pickwick resolved on immediately returning to london with a view of becoming acquainted with the proceedings which had been taken against him in the meantime by messrs dodson and fogg acting upon this resolution with all the energy and decision of his character he mounted to the back seat of the first coach which left ipswich on the morning after the memorable occurrences detailed at length in the two preceding chapters and accompanied by his three friends and mr samuel weller arrived in the metropolis in perfect health and safety the same evening here the friends for a short time separated messrs tupman winkle and snodgrass repaired to their several homes to make such preparations as might be requisite for their forthcoming visit to dingley dell and mr pickwick and sam took up their present abode in very good old fashioned and comfortable quarters to wit the george and vulture tavern and hotel george yard lombard street mr pickwick had dined finished his second pint of particular port pulled his silk handkerchief over his head put his feet on the fender and thrown himself back in an easy chair when the entrance of mr weller with his carpet bag aroused him from his tranquil meditations sam said mr pickwick sir said mr weller i have just been thinking sam said mr pickwick that having left a good many things at mrs bardell's in goswell street i ought to arrange for taking them away before i leave town again wery good sir replied mr weller i could send them to tupman's for the present sam continued mr pickwick but before we take them away it is necessary that they should be looked up and put together i wish you would step up to goswell street sam and arrange about it at once sir inquired mr weller at once replied mr pickwick and stay sam added mr pickwick pulling out his purse there is some rent to pay the quarter is not due till christmas but you may pay it and have done with it a month's notice terminates my tenancy here it is written out give it and tell mrs bardell she may put a bill up as soon as she likes wery good sir replied mr weller anythin' more sir nothing more sam mr weller stepped slowly to the door as if he expected something more slowly opened it slowly stepped out and had slowly closed it within a couple of inches when mr pickwick called out sam sir said mr weller stepping quickly back and closing the door behind him i have no objection sam to your endeavouring to ascertain how mrs bardell herself seems disposed towards me and whether it is really probable that this vile and groundless action is to be carried to extremity i say i do not object to your doing this if you wish it sam said mr pickwick sam gave a short nod of intelligence and left the room mr pickwick drew the silk handkerchief once more over his head and composed himself to a nap mr weller promptly walked forth to execute his commission it was nearly nine o'clock when he reached goswell street a couple of candles were burning in the little front parlour and a couple of caps were reflected on the window blind mrs bardell had got company mr weller knocked at the door and after a pretty long interval occupied by the party without in whistling a tune and by the party within in persuading a refractory flat candle to allow itself to be lighted a pair of small boots pattered over the floor cloth and master bardell presented himself well young townskip said sam how's mother she's pretty well replied master bardell so am i well that's a mercy said sam tell her i want to speak to her will you my hinfant fernomenon master bardell thus adjured placed the refractory flat candle on the bottom stair and vanished into the front parlour with his message the two caps reflected on the window blind were the respective head dresses of a couple of mrs bardell's most particular acquaintance who had just stepped in to have a quiet cup of tea and a little warm supper of a couple of sets of pettitoes and some toasted cheese the cheese was simmering and browning away most delightfully in a little dutch oven before the fire the pettitoes were getting on deliciously in a little tin saucepan on the hob and mrs bardell and her two friends were getting on very well also in a little quiet conversation about and concerning all their particular friends and acquaintance when master bardell came back from answering the door and delivered the message entrusted to him by mr samuel weller mr pickwick's servant said mrs bardell turning pale bless my soul said mrs cluppins well i raly would not ha' believed it unless i had ha' happened to ha' been here said mrs sanders mrs cluppins was a little brisk busy looking woman mrs sanders was a big fat heavy faced personage and the two were the company mrs bardell felt it proper to be agitated and as none of the three exactly knew whether under existing circumstances any communication otherwise than through dodson and fogg ought to be held with mr pickwick's servant they were all rather taken by surprise in this state of indecision obviously the first thing to be done was to thump the boy for finding mr weller at the door so his mother thumped him and he cried melodiously illustration mrs bardell and her two friends were getting on very well hold your noise do you naughty creetur said mrs bardell yes don't worrit your poor mother said mrs sanders she's quite enough to worrit her as it is without you tommy said mrs cluppins with sympathising resignation ah worse luck poor lamb said mrs sanders at all which moral reflections master bardell howled the louder now what shall i do said mrs bardell to mrs cluppins i think you ought to see him replied mrs cluppins but on no account without a witness i think two witnesses would be more lawful said mrs sanders who like the other friend was bursting with curiosity perhaps he'd better come in here said mrs bardell to be sure replied mrs cluppins eagerly catching at the idea walk in young man and shut the street door first please mr weller immediately took the hint and presenting himself in the parlour explained his business to mrs bardell thus wery sorry to 'casion any personal inconwenience ma'am as the housebreaker said to the old lady when he put her on the fire but as me and my governor's jest come to town and is jest going away again it can't be helped you see of course the young man can't help the faults of his master said mrs cluppins much struck by mr weller's appearance and conversation certainly not chimed in mrs sanders who from certain wistful glances at the little tin saucepan seemed to be engaged in a mental calculation of the probable extent of the pettitoes in the event of sam's being asked to stop to supper so all i've come about is jest this here said sam disregarding the interruption first to give my governor's notice there it is secondly to pay the rent here it is thirdly to say as all his things is to be put together and give to anybody as we sends for 'em fourthly that you may let the place as soon as you like and that's all whatever has happened said mrs bardell i always have said and always will say that in every respect but one mr pickwick has always behaved himself like a perfect gentleman his money always was as good as the bank always as mrs bardell said this she applied her handkerchief to her eyes and went out of the room to get the receipt sam well knew that he had only to remain quiet and the women were sure to talk so he looked alternately at the tin saucepan the toasted cheese the wall and the ceiling in profound silence poor dear said mrs cluppins ah poor thing replied mrs sanders sam said nothing he saw they were coming to the subject i raly cannot contain myself said mrs cluppins when i think of such perjury i don't wish to say anything to make you uncomfortable young man but your master's an old brute and i wish i had him here to tell him so i wish you had said sam to see how dreadful she takes on going moping about and taking no pleasure in nothing except when her friends comes in out of charity to sit with her and make her comfortable resumed mrs cluppins glancing at the tin saucepan and the dutch oven its shocking barbareous said mrs sanders and your master young man a gentleman with money as could never feel the expense of a wife no more than nothing continued mrs cluppins with great volubility why there ain't the faintest shade of an excuse for his behaviour why don't he marry her ah said sam to be sure that's the question question indeed retorted mrs cluppins she'd question him if she'd my spirit hows'ever there is law for us women mis'rable creeturs as they'd make us if they could and that your master will find out young man to his cost afore he's six months older at this consolatory reflection mrs cluppins bridled up and smiled at mrs sanders who smiled back again the action's going on and no mistake thought sam as mrs bardell re entered with the receipt here's the receipt mr weller said mrs bardell and here's the change and i hope you'll take a little drop of something to keep the cold out if it's only for old acquaintance' sake mr weller sam saw the advantage he should gain and at once acquiesced whereupon mrs bardell produced from a small closet a black bottle and a wineglass and so great was her abstraction in her deep mental affliction that after filling mr weller's glass she brought out three more wineglasses and filled them too lauk mrs bardell said mrs cluppins see what you've been and done well that is a good one ejaculated mrs sanders ah my poor head said mrs bardell with a faint smile sam understood all this of course so he said at once that he never could drink before supper unless a lady drank with him a great deal of laughing ensued and mrs sanders volunteered to humour him so she took a slight sip out of her glass then sam said it must go all round so they all took a slight sip then little mrs cluppins proposed a toast success to bardell agin pickwick and then the ladies emptied their glasses in honour of the sentiment and got very talkative directly i suppose you've heard what's going forward mr weller said mrs bardell i've heerd somethin' on it replied sam it's a terrible thing to be dragged before the public in that way mr weller said mrs bardell but i see now that it's the only thing i ought to do and my lawyers mr dodson and fogg tell me that with the evidence as we shall call we must succeed i don't know what i should do mr weller if i didn't the mere idea of mrs bardell's failing in her action affected mrs sanders so deeply that she was under the necessity of re filling and re emptying her glass immediately feeling as she said afterwards that if she hadn't had the presence of mind to do so she must have dropped ven is it expected to come on inquired sam either in february or march replied mrs bardell what a number of witnesses there'll be won't there said mrs cluppins ah won't there replied mrs sanders and won't mr dodson and fogg be wild if the plaintiff shouldn't get it added mrs cluppins when they do it all on speculation ah won't they said mrs sanders but the plaintiff must get it resumed mrs cluppins i hope so said mrs bardell oh there can't be any doubt about it rejoined mrs sanders vell said sam rising and setting down his glass all i can say is that i wish you may get it thank'ee mr weller said mrs bardell fervently and of them dodson and foggs as does these sort o' things on spec continued mr weller as well as for the other kind and gen'rous people o' the same purfession as sets people by the ears free gratis for nothing and sets their clerks to work to find out little disputes among their neighbours and acquaintances as vants settlin' by means o' law suits all i can say o' them is that i vish they had the reward i'd give 'em ah i wish they had the reward that every kind and generous heart would be inclined to bestow upon them said the gratified mrs bardell amen to that replied sam and a fat and happy livin' they'd get out of it wish you good night ladies to the great relief of mrs sanders sam was allowed to depart without any reference on the part of the hostess to the pettitoes and toasted cheese to which the ladies with such juvenile assistance as master bardell could afford soon afterwards rendered the amplest justice indeed they wholly vanished before their strenuous exertions mr weller went his way back to the george and vulture and faithfully recounted to his master such indications of the sharp practice of dodson and fogg as he had contrived to pick up in his visit to mrs bardell's an interview with mr perker next day more than confirmed mr weller's statement and mr pickwick was fain to prepare for his christmas visit to dingley dell with the pleasant anticipation that some two or three months afterwards an action brought against him for damages sustained by reason of a breach of promise of marriage would be publicly tried in the court of common pleas the plaintiff having all the advantages derivable not only from the force of circumstances but from the sharp practice of dodson and fogg to boot chapter xxvii illustration samuel weller makes a pilgrimage to dorking and beholds his mother in law there still remaining an interval of two days before the time agreed upon for the departure of the pickwickians to dingley dell mr weller sat himself down in a back room at the george and vulture after eating an early dinner to muse on the best way of disposing of his time it was a remarkably fine day and he had not turned the matter over in his mind ten minutes when he was suddenly stricken filial and affectionate and it occurred to him so strongly that he ought to go down and see his father and pay his duty to his mother in law that he was lost in astonishment at his own remissness in never thinking of this moral obligation before anxious to atone for his past neglect without another hour's delay he straightway walked up the stairs to mr pickwick and requested leave of absence for this laudable purpose certainly sam certainly said mr pickwick his eyes glistening with delight at this manifestation of filial feeling on the part of his attendant certainly sam mr weller made a grateful bow i am very glad to see that you have so high a sense of your duties as a son sam said mr pickwick i always had sir replied mr weller that's a very gratifying reflection sam said mr pickwick approvingly wery sir replied mr weller if ever i wanted anythin' o' my father i always asked for it in a very 'spectful and obligin' manner if he didn't give it me i took it for fear i should be led to do anythin' wrong through not havin' it i saved him a world o' trouble in this vay sir that's not precisely what i meant sam said mr pickwick shaking his head with a slight smile all good feeling sir the wery best intentions as the gen'lm'n said ven he run away from his wife 'cos she seemed unhappy with him replied mr weller you may go sam said mr pickwick thank'ee sir replied mr weller and having made his best bow and put on his best clothes sam planted himself on the top of the arundel coach and journeyed on to dorking the marquis of granby in mrs weller's time was quite a model of a roadside public house of the better class just large enough to be convenient and small enough to be snug on the opposite side of the road was a large sign board on a high post representing the head and shoulders of a gentleman with an apoplectic countenance in a red coat with deep blue facings and a touch of the same blue over his three cornered hat for a sky over that again were a pair of flags beneath the last button of his coat were a couple of cannon and the whole formed an expressive and undoubted likeness of the marquis of granby of glorious memory the bar window displayed a choice collection of geranium plants and a well dusted row of spirit phials the open shutters bore a variety of golden inscriptions eulogistic of good beds and neat wines and the choice group of countrymen and hostlers lounging about the stable door and horse trough afforded presumptive proof of the excellent quality of the ale and spirits which were sold within sam weller paused when he dismounted from the coach to note all these little indications of a thriving business with the eye of an experienced traveller and having done so stepped in at once highly satisfied with everything he had observed now then said a shrill female voice the instant sam thrust his head in at the door what do you want young man sam looked round in the direction whence the voice proceeded it came from a rather stout lady of comfortable appearance who was seated beside the fire place in the bar blowing the fire to make the kettle boil for tea she was not alone for on the other side of the fire place sitting bolt upright in a high backed chair was a man in threadbare black clothes with a back almost as long and stiff as that of the chair itself who caught sam's most particular and especial attention at once he was a prim faced red nosed man with a long thin countenance and a semi rattlesnake sort of eye rather sharp but decidedly bad he wore very short trousers and black cotton stockings which like the rest of his apparel were particularly rusty his looks were starched but his white neckerchief was not and its long limp ends straggled over his closely buttoned waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion a pair of old worn beaver gloves a broad brimmed hat and a faded green umbrella with plenty of whalebone sticking through the bottom as if to counter balance the want of a handle at the top lay on a chair beside him and being disposed in a very tidy and careful manner seemed to imply that the red nosed man whoever he was had no intention of going away in a hurry to do the red nosed man justice he would have been very far from wise if he had entertained any such intention for to judge from all appearances he must have been possessed of a most desirable circle of acquaintance if he could have reasonably expected to be more comfortable anywhere else the fire was blazing brightly under the influence of the bellows and the kettle was singing gaily under the influence of both a small tray of tea things was arranged on the table a plate of hot buttered toast was gently simmering before the fire and the red nosed man himself was busily engaged in converting a large slice of bread into the same agreeable edible through the instrumentality of a long brass toasting fork beside him stood a glass of reeking hot pine apple rum and water with a slice of lemon in it and every time the red nosed man stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye with the view of ascertaining how it got on he imbibed a drop or two of the hot pine apple rum and water and smiled upon the rather stout lady as she blew the fire sam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene that he suffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded it was not until it had been twice repeated each time in a shriller tone that he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour governor in inquired sam in reply to the question no he isn't replied mrs weller for the rather stout lady was no other than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead and gone mr clarke no he isn't and i don't expect him either i suppose he's a drivin' up to day said sam he may be or he may not replied mrs weller buttering the round of toast which the red nosed man had just finished i don't know and what's more i don't care ask a blessin' mr stiggins the red nosed man did as he was desired and instantly commenced on the toast with fierce voracity the appearance of the red nosed man had induced sam at first sight to more than half suspect that he was the deputy shepherd of whom his estimable parent had spoken the moment he saw him eat all doubt on the subject was removed and he perceived at once that if he purposed to take up his temporary quarters where he was he must make his footing good without delay he therefore commenced proceedings by putting his arm over the half door of the bar coolly unbolting it and leisurely walking in mother in law said sam how are you why i do believe he is a weller said mrs w raising her eyes to sam's face with no very gratified expression of countenance i rayther think he is said the imperturbable sam and i hope this here reverend gen'lm'n 'll excuse me saying that i wish i was the weller as owns you mother in law illustration mother in law said sam how are you this was a double barrelled compliment it implied that mrs weller was a most agreeable female and also that mr stiggins had a clerical appearance it made a visible impression at once and sam followed up his advantage by kissing his mother in law get along with you said mrs weller pushing him away for shame young man said the gentleman with the red nose no offence sir no offence replied sam you're wery right though it ain't the right sort o' thing when mothers in law is young and good looking is it sir it's all vanity said mr stiggins ah so it is said mrs weller setting her cap to rights sam thought it was too but he held his peace the deputy shepherd seemed by no means best pleased with sam's arrival and when the first effervescence of the compliment had subsided even mrs weller looked as if she could have spared him without the smallest inconvenience however there he was and as he couldn't be decently turned out they all three sat down to tea and how's father said sam at this inquiry mrs weller raised her hands and turned up her eyes as if the subject were too painful to be alluded to mr stiggins groaned what's the matter with that 'ere gen'lm'n inquired sam he's shocked at the way your father goes on in replied mrs weller oh he is is he said sam and with too good reason added mrs weller gravely mr stiggins took up a fresh piece of toast and groaned heavily he is a dreadful reprobate said mrs weller a man of wrath exclaimed mr stiggins he took a large semi circular bite of the toast and groaned aloud sam felt very strongly disposed to give the reverend mr stiggins something to groan for but he repressed his inclination and merely asked what's the old 'un up to now up to indeed said mrs weller oh he has a hard heart night after night does this excellent man don't frown mr stiggins i will say you are an excellent man come and sit here for hours together and it has not the least effect upon him well that is odd said sam it 'ud have a wery considerable effect upon me if i wos in his place i know that the fact is my young friend said mr stiggins solemnly he has an obderrate bosom oh my young friend who else could have resisted the pleading of sixteen of our fairest sisters and withstood their exhortations to subscribe to our noble society for providing the infant negroes in the west indies with flannel waistcoats and moral pocket handkerchiefs what's a moral pocket ankercher said sam i never see one o' them articles o' furniter those which combine amusement with instruction my young friend replied mr stiggins blending select tales with wood cuts oh i know said sam them as hangs up in the linen drapers' shops with beggars' petitions and all that 'ere upon 'em mr stiggins began a third round of toast and nodded assent and he wouldn't be persuaded by the ladies wouldn't he said sam sat and smoked his pipe and said the infant negroes were what did he say the infant negroes were said mrs weller little humbugs replied mr stiggins deeply affected said the infant negroes were little humbugs repeated mrs weller and they both groaned at the atrocious conduct of the old gentleman a great many more inquiries of a similar nature might have been disclosed only the toast being all eaten the tea having got very weak and sam holding out no indications of meaning to go mr stiggins suddenly recollected that he had a most pressing appointment with the shepherd and took himself off accordingly the tea things had scarcely been put away and the hearth swept up when the london coach deposited mr weller senior at the door his legs deposited him in the bar and his eyes showed him his son what sammy exclaimed the father what old nobs ejaculated the son and they shook hands heartily wery glad to see you sammy said the elder mr weller though how you've managed to get over your mother in law is a mystery to me i only vish you'd write me out the receipt that's all hush said sam she's at home old feller she ain't vithin hearin' replied mr weller she always goes and blows up down stairs for a couple of hours arter tea so we'll just give ourselves a damp sammy saying this mr weller mixed two glasses of spirits and water and produced a couple of pipes the father and son sitting down opposite each other sam on one side of the fire in the high backed chair and mr weller senior on the other in an easy ditto they proceeded to enjoy themselves with all due gravity anybody been here sammy asked mr weller senior drily after a long silence sam nodded an expressive assent red nosed chap inquired mr weller sam nodded again amiable man that 'ere sammy said mr weller smoking violently seems so observed sam good hand at accounts said mr weller is he said sam borrows eighteenpence on monday and comes on tuesday for a shillin' to make it up half a crown calls again on vensday for another half crown to make it five shillin's and goes on doubling till he gets it up to a five pund note in no time like them sums in the 'rithmetic book 'bout the nails in the horse's shoes sammy sam intimated by a nod that he recollected the problem alluded to by his parent so you vouldn't subscribe to the flannel veskits said sam after another interval of smoking cert'nly not replied mr weller what's the good o' flannel veskits to the young niggers abroad but i'll tell you what it is sammy said mr weller lowering his voice and bending across the fire place i'd come down wery handsome towards strait veskits for some people at home as mr weller said this he slowly recovered his former position and winked at his first born in a profound manner it cert'nly seems a queer start to send out pocket ankerchers to people as don't know the use on 'em observed sam they're alvays a doin' some gammon of that sort sammy replied his father t'other sunday i wos walkin' up the road ven who should i see a standin' at a chapel door with a blue soup plate in her hand but your mother in law i werily believe there was change for a couple o' suvrins in it then sammy all in ha'pence and as the people came out they rattled the pennies in it till you'd ha' thought that no mortal plate as ever was baked could ha' stood the wear and tear what d'ye think it was all for for another tea drinkin' perhaps said sam not a bit on it replied the father for the shepherd's water rate sammy the shepherd's water rate said sam ay replied mr weller there was three quarters owin' and the shepherd hadn't paid a farden not he perhaps it might be on account that the water warn't o' much use to him for it's wery little o' that tap he drinks sammy wery he knows a trick worth a good half dozen of that he does hows'ever it warn't paid and so they cuts the water off down goes the shepherd to chapel gives out as he's a persecuted saint and says he hopes the heart of the turncock as cut the water off 'll be softened and turned in the right vay but he rayther thinks he's booked for somethin' uncomfortable upon this the women calls a meetin' sings a hymn wotes your mother in law into the chair wolunteers a collection next sunday and hands it all over to the shepherd and if he ain't got enough out on 'em sammy to make him free of the water company for life said mr weller in conclusion i'm one dutchman and you're another and that's all about it mr weller smoked for some minutes in silence and then resumed the worst o' these here shepherds is my boy that they reg'larly turns the heads of all the young ladies about here lord bless their little hearts they thinks it's all right and don't know no better but they're the wictims o' gammon samivel they're the wictims o' gammon i s'pose they are said sam nothin' else said mr weller shaking his head gravely and wot aggrawates me samivel is to see 'em a wastin' all their time and labour in making clothes for copper coloured people as don't want 'em and taking no notice of flesh coloured christians as do if i'd my vay samivel i'd just stick some o' these here lazy shepherds behind a heavy wheelbarrow and run 'em up and down a fourteen inch wide plank all day that 'ud shake the nonsense out of 'em if anything vould mr weller having delivered this gentle recipe with strong emphasis eked out by a variety of nods and contortions of the eye emptied his glass at a draught and knocked the ashes out of his pipe with native dignity he was engaged in this operation when a shrill voice was heard in the passage here's your dear relation sammy said mr weller and mrs w hurried into the room oh you've come back have you said mrs weller yes my dear replied mr weller filling a fresh pipe has mr stiggins been back said mrs weller no my dear he hasn't replied mr weller lighting the pipe by the ingenious process of holding to the bowl thereof between the tongs a red hot coal from the adjacent fire and what's more my dear i shall manage to survive it if he don't come back at all ugh you wretch said mrs weller thank'ee my love said mr weller come come father said sam none o' these little lovins afore strangers here's the reverend gen'lm'n a comin' in now at this announcement mrs weller hastily wiped off the tears which she had just begun to force on and mr w drew his chair sullenly into the chimney corner mr stiggins was easily prevailed on to take another glass of the hot pine apple rum and water and a second and a third and then to refresh himself with a slight supper previous to beginning again he sat on the same side as mr weller senior and every time he could contrive to do so unseen by his wife that gentleman indicated to his son the hidden emotions of his bosom by shaking his fist over the deputy shepherd's head a process which afforded his son the most unmingled delight and satisfaction and more especially as mr stiggins went on quietly drinking the hot pine apple rum and water wholly unconscious of what was going on the major part of the conversation was confined to mrs weller and the reverend mr stiggins and the topics principally descanted on were the virtues of the shepherd the worthiness of his flock and the high crimes and misdemeanours of everybody beside dissertations which the elder mr weller occasionally interrupted by half suppressed references to a gentleman of the name of walker and other running commentaries of the same kind at length mr stiggins with several most indubitable symptoms of having quite as much pine apple rum and water about him as he could comfortably accommodate took his hat and his leave and sam was immediately afterwards shown to bed by his father the respectable old gentleman wrung his hand fervently and seemed disposed to address some observation to his son but on mrs weller advancing towards him he appeared to relinquish that intention and abruptly bade him good night sam was up betimes next day and having partaken of a hasty breakfast prepared to return to london he had scarcely set foot without the house when his father stood before him goin' sammy inquired mr weller off at once replied sam i vish you could muffle that 'ere stiggins and take him with you said mr weller i am ashamed on you said sam reproachfully what do you let him show his red nose in the markis o' granby at all for mr weller the elder fixed on his son an earnest look and replied 'cause i'm a married man samivel 'cause i'm a married man when you're a married man samivel you'll understand a good many things as you don't understand now but vether it's worth while going through so much to learn so little as the charity boy said ven he got to the end of the alphabet is a matter o' taste i rayther think it isn't well said sam good bye tar tar sammy replied his father i've only got to say this here said sam stopping short that if i was the properiator o' the markis o' granby and that 'ere stiggins came and made toast in my bar i'd what interposed mr weller with great anxiety what pison his rum and water said sam no said mr weller shaking his son eagerly by the hand would you raly sammy would you though i would said sam i wouldn't be too hard upon him at first i'd drop him in the water butt and put the lid on and if i found he was insensible to kindness i'd try the other persvasion the elder mr weller bestowed a look of deep unspeakable admiration on his son and having once more grasped his hand walked slowly away revolving in his mind the numerous reflections to which his advice had given rise sam looked after him until he turned a corner of the road and then set forward on his walk to london he meditated at first on the probable consequences of his own advice and the likelihood and unlikelihood of his father's adopting it he dismissed the subject from his mind however with the consolatory reflection that time alone would show and this is the reflection we would impress upon the reader chapter xxviii illustration a good humoured christmas chapter containing an account of a wedding and some other sports beside which although in their way even as good customs as marriage itself are not quite so religiously kept up in these degenerate times as brisk as bees if not altogether as light as fairies did the four pickwickians assemble on the morning of the twenty second day of december in the year of grace in which these their faithfully recorded adventures were undertaken and accomplished christmas was close at hand in all his bluff and hearty honesty it was the season of hospitality merriment and open heartedness the old year was preparing like an ancient philosopher to call his friends around him and amidst the sound of feasting and revelry to pass gently and calmly away gay and merry was as the time and gay and merry were at least four of the numerous hearts that were gladdened by its coming and numerous indeed are the hearts to which christmas brings a brief season of happiness and enjoyment how many families whose members have been dispersed and scattered far and wide in the restless struggles of life are then re united and meet once again in that happy state of companionship and mutual good will which is a source of such pure and unalloyed delight and one so incompatible with the cares and sorrows of the world that the religious belief of the most civilised nations and the rude traditions of the roughest savages alike number it among the first joys of a future condition of existence provided for the blest and happy how many old recollections and how many dormant sympathies does christmas time awaken we write these words now many miles distant from the spot at which year after year we met on that day a merry and joyous circle many of the hearts that throbbed so gaily then have ceased to beat many of the looks that shone so brightly then have ceased to glow the hands we grasped have grown cold the eyes we sought have hid their lustre in the grave and yet the old house the room the merry voices and smiling faces the jest the laugh the most minute and trivial circumstances connected with those happy meetings crowd upon our minds at each recurrence of the season as if the last assemblage had been but yesterday happy happy christmas that can win us back to the delusions of our childish days that can recall to the old man the pleasures of his youth that can transport the sailor and the traveller thousands of miles away back to his own fireside and his quiet home but we are so taken up and occupied with the good qualities of this saint christmas that we are keeping mr pickwick and his friends waiting in the cold on the outside of the muggleton coach which they have just attained well wrapped up in great coats shawls and comforters the portmanteaus and carpet bags have been stowed away and mr weller and the guard are endeavouring to insinuate into a fore boot a huge cod fish several sizes too large for it which is snugly packed up in a long brown basket with a layer of straw over the top and which has been left to the last in order that he may repose safely on the half dozen barrels of real native oysters all the property of mr pickwick which have been arranged in regular order at the bottom of the receptacle the interest displayed in mr pickwick's countenance is most intense as mr weller and the guard try to squeeze the cod fish into the boot first head first and then tail first and then top upward and then bottom upward and then side ways and then long ways all of which artifices the implacable cod fish sturdily resists until the guard accidentally hits him in the very middle of the basket whereupon he suddenly disappears into the boot and with him the head and shoulders of the guard himself who not calculating upon so sudden a cessation of the passive resistance of the cod fish experiences a very unexpected shock to the unsmotherable delight of all the porters and bystanders upon this mr pickwick smiles with great good humour and drawing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket begs the guard as he picks himself out of the boot to drink his health in a glass of hot brandy and water at which the guard smiles too and messrs snodgrass winkle and tupman all smile in company the guard and mr weller disappear for five minutes most probably to get the hot brandy and water for they smell very strongly of it when they return the coachman mounts the box mr weller jumps up behind the pickwickians pull their coats round their legs and their shawls over their noses the helpers pull the horse cloths off the coachman shouts out a cheery all right and away they go they have rumbled through the streets and jolted over the stones and at length reach the wide and open country the wheels skim over the hard and frosty ground and the horses bursting into a canter at a smart crack of the whip step along the road as if the load behind them coach passengers cod fish oyster barrels and all were but a feather at their heels they have descended a gentle slope and enter upon a level as compact and dry as a solid block of marble two miles long another crack of the whip and on they speed at a smart gallop the horses tossing their heads and rattling the harness as if in exhilaration at the rapidity of the motion while the coachman holding whip and reins in one hand takes off his hat with the other and resting it on his knees pulls out his handkerchief and wipes his forehead partly because he has the habit of doing it and partly because it's as well to show the passengers how cool he is and what an easy thing it is to drive four in hand when you have had as much practice as he has having done this very leisurely otherwise the effect would be materially impaired he replaces his handkerchief pulls on his hat adjusts his gloves squares his elbows cracks the whip again and on they speed more merrily than before a few small houses scattered on either side of the road betoken the entrance to some town or village the lively notes of the guard's key bugle vibrate in the clear cold air and wake up the old gentleman inside who carefully letting down the window sash half way and standing sentry over the air takes a short peep out and then carefully pulling it up again informs the other inside that they're going to change directly on which the other inside wakes himself up and determines to postpone his next nap until after the stoppage again the bugle sounds lustily forth and rouses the cottager's wife and children who peep out at the house door and watch the coach till it turns the corner when they once more crouch round the blazing fire and throw on another log of wood against father comes home while father himself a full mile off has just exchanged a friendly nod with the coachman and turned round to take a good long stare at the vehicle as it whirls away and now the bugle plays a lively air as the coach rattles through the ill paved streets of a country town and the coachman undoing the buckle which keeps his ribands together prepares to throw them off the moment he stops mr pickwick emerges from his coat collar and looks about him with great curiosity perceiving which the coachman informs mr pickwick of the name of the town and tells him it was market day yesterday both of which pieces of information mr pickwick retails to his fellow passengers whereupon they emerge from their coat collars too and look about them also mr winkle who sits at the extreme edge with one leg dangling in the air is nearly precipitated into the street as the coach twists round the sharp corner by the cheesemonger's shop and turns into the market place and before mr snodgrass who sits next to him has recovered from his alarm they pull up at the inn yard where the fresh horses with cloths on are already waiting the coachman throws down the reins and gets down himself and the other outside passengers drop down also except those who have no great confidence in their ability to get up again and they remain where they are and stamp their feet against the coach to warm them looking with longing eyes and red noses at the bright fire in the inn bar and the sprigs of holly with red berries which ornament the window but the guard has delivered at the corn dealer's shop the brown paper packet he took out of the little pouch which hangs over his shoulder by a leathern strap and has seen the horses carefully put to and has thrown on the pavement the saddle which was brought from london on the coach roof and has assisted in the conference between the coachman and the hostler about the grey mare that hurt her off fore leg last tuesday and he and mr weller are all right behind and the coachman is all right in front and the old gentleman inside who has kept the window down full two inches all this time has pulled it up again and the cloths are off and they are all ready for starting except the two stout gentlemen whom the coachman inquires after with some impatience hereupon the coachman and the guard and sam weller and mr winkle and mr snodgrass and all the hostlers and every one of the idlers who are more in number than all the others put together shout for the missing gentlemen as loud as they can bawl a distant response is heard from the yard and mr pickwick and mr tupman come running down it quite out of breath for they have been having a glass of ale apiece and mr pickwick's fingers are so cold that he has been full five minutes before he could find the sixpence to pay for it the coachman shouts an admonitory now then gen'lm'n the guard re echoes it the old gentleman inside thinks it a very extraordinary thing that people will get down when they know there isn't time for it mr pickwick struggles up on one side mr tupman on the other mr winkle cries all right and off they start shawls are pulled up coat collars are re adjusted the pavement ceases the houses disappear and they are once again dashing along the open road with the fresh clear air blowing in their faces and gladdening their very hearts within them illustration a distant response is heard from the yard and mr pickwick and mr tupman come running down it such was the progress of mr pickwick and his friends by the muggleton telegraph on their way to dingley dell and at three o'clock that afternoon they all stood high and dry safe and sound hale and hearty upon the steps of the blue lion having taken on the road quite enough of ale and brandy to enable them to bid defiance to the frost that was binding up the earth in its iron fetters and weaving its beautiful net work upon the trees and hedges mr pickwick was busily engaged in counting the barrels of oysters and superintending the disinterment of the cod fish when he felt himself gently pulled by the skirts of the coat looking round he discovered that the individual who resorted to this mode of catching his attention was no other than mr wardle's favourite page better known to the readers of this unvarnished history by the distinguished appellation of the fat boy aha said mr pickwick aha said the fat boy as he said it he glanced from the cod fish to the oyster barrels and chuckled joyously he was fatter than ever well you look rosy enough my young friend said mr pickwick i've been asleep right in front of the tap room fire replied the fat boy who had heated himself to the colour of a new chimney pot in the course of an hour's nap master sent me over with the shay cart to carry your luggage up to the house he'd ha' sent some saddle horses but he thought you'd rather walk being a cold day yes yes said mr pickwick hastily for he remembered how they had travelled over nearly the same ground on a previous occasion yes we would rather walk here sam sir said mr weller help mr wardle's servant to put the packages into the cart and then ride on with him we will walk forward at once having given this direction and settled with the coachman mr pickwick and his three friends struck into the footpath across the fields and walked briskly away leaving mr weller and the fat boy confronted together for the first time sam looked at the fat boy with great astonishment but without saying a word and began to stow the luggage rapidly away in the cart while the fat boy stood quietly by and seemed to think it a very interesting sort of thing to see mr weller working by himself illustration aha said the fat boy there said sam throwing in the last carpet bag there they are yes said the fat boy in a very satisfied tone there they are vell young twenty stun said sam you're a nice specimen of a prize boy you are thankee said the fat boy you ain't got nothin' on your mind as makes you fret yourself have you inquired sam not as i knows on replied the fat boy i should rayther ha' thought to look at you that you was a labourin' under an unrequited attachment to some young 'ooman said sam the fat boy shook his head vell said sam i'm glad to hear it do you ever drink anythin' i likes eating better replied the boy ah said sam i should ha' s'posed that but what i mean is should you like a drop of anythin' as 'd warm you but i s'pose you never was cold with all them elastic fixtures was you sometimes replied the boy and i likes a drop of something when it's good oh you do do you said sam come this way then the blue lion tap was soon gained and the fat boy swallowed a glass of liquor without so much as winking a feat which considerably advanced him in mr weller's good opinion mr weller having transacted a similar piece of business on his own account they got into the cart can you drive said the fat boy i should rayther think so replied sam there then said the fat boy putting the reins in his hand and pointing up a lane it's as straight as you can go you can't miss it with these words the fat boy laid himself affectionately down by the side of the cod fish and placing an oyster barrel under his head for a pillow fell asleep instantaneously well said sam of all the cool boys ever i set my eyes on this here young gen'lm'n is the coolest come wake up young dropsy but as young dropsy evinced no symptoms of returning animation sam weller sat himself down in front of the cart and starting the old horse with a jerk of the rein jogged steadily on towards manor farm meanwhile mr pickwick and his friends having walked their blood into active circulation proceeded cheerfully on the paths were hard the grass was crisp and frosty the air had a fine dry bracing coldness and the rapid approach of the grey twilight slate coloured is a better term in frosty weather made them look forward with pleasant anticipation to the comforts which awaited them at their hospitable entertainer's it was the sort of afternoon that might induce a couple of elderly gentlemen in a lonely field to take off their great coats and play at leap frog in pure lightness of heart and gaiety and we firmly believe that had mr tupman at that moment proffered a back mr pickwick would have accepted his offer with the utmost avidity however mr tupman did not volunteer any such accommodation and the friends walked on conversing merrily as they turned into a lane they had to cross the sound of many voices burst upon their ears and before they had even had time to form a guess to whom they belonged they walked into the very centre of the party who were expecting their arrival a fact which was first notified to the pickwickians by the loud hurrah which burst from old wardle's lips when they appeared in sight first here was wardle himself looking if possible more jolly than ever then there were bella and her faithful trundle and lastly there were emily and some eight or ten young ladies who had all come down to the wedding which was to take place next day and who were in as happy and important a state as young ladies usually are on such momentous occasions and they were one and all startling the fields and lanes far and wide with their frolic and laughter the ceremony of introduction under such circumstances was very soon performed or we should rather say that the introduction was soon over without any ceremony at all in two minutes thereafter mr pickwick was joking with the young ladies who wouldn't come over the stile while he looked or who having pretty feet and unexceptionable ankles preferred standing on the top rail for five minutes or so declaring that they were too frightened to move with as much ease and absence of reserve or constraint as if he had known them for life it is worthy of remark too that mr snodgrass offered emily far more assistance than the absolute terrors of the stile although it was full three feet high and had only a couple of stepping stones would seem to require while one black eyed young lady in a very nice little pair of boots with fur round the top was observed to scream very loudly when mr winkle offered to help her over all this was very snug and pleasant and when the difficulties of the stile were at last surmounted and they once more entered on the open field old wardle informed mr pickwick how they had all been down in a body to inspect the furniture and fittings up of the house which the young couple were to tenant after the christmas holidays at which communication bella and trundle both coloured up as red as the fat boy after the tap room fire and the young lady with the black eyes and the fur round the boots whispered something in emily's ear and then glanced archly at mr snodgrass to which emily responded that she was a foolish girl but turned very red notwithstanding and mr snodgrass who was as modest as all great geniuses usually are felt the crimson rising to the crown of his head and devoutly wished in the inmost recesses of his own heart that the young lady aforesaid with her black eyes and her archness and her boots with the fur round the top were all comfortably deposited in the adjacent county but if they were social and happy outside the house what was the warmth and cordiality of their reception when they reached the farm the very servants grinned with pleasure at sight of mr pickwick and emma bestowed a half demure half impudent and all pretty look of recognition on mr tupman which was enough to make the statue of bonaparte in the passage unfold his arms and clasp her within them the old lady was seated in customary state in the front parlour but she was rather cross and by consequence most particularly deaf she never went out herself and like a great many other old ladies of the same stamp she was apt to consider it an act of domestic treason if anybody else took the liberty of doing what she couldn't so bless her old soul she sat as upright as she could in her great armchair and looked as fierce as might be and that was benevolent after all mother said wardle mr pickwick you recollect him never mind replied the old lady with great dignity don't trouble mr pickwick about an old creetur like me nobody cares about me now and it's very nat'ral they shouldn't here the old lady tossed her head and smoothed down her lavender coloured silk dress with trembling hands come come ma'am said mr pickwick i can't let you cut an old friend in this way i have come down expressly to have a long talk and another rubber with you and we'll show these boys and girls how to dance a minuet before they're eight and forty hours older the old lady was rapidly giving way but she did not like to do it all at once so she only said ah i can't hear him nonsense mother said wardle come come don't be cross there's a good soul recollect bella come you must keep her spirits up poor girl the good lady heard this for her lip quivered as her son said it but age has its little infirmities of temper and she was not quite brought round yet so she smoothed down the lavender coloured dress again and turning to mr pickwick said ah mr pickwick young people was very different when i was a girl no doubt of that ma'am said mr pickwick and that's the reason why i would make much of the few that have any traces of the old stock and saying this mr pickwick gently pulled bella towards him and bestowing a kiss upon her forehead bade her sit down on the little stool at her grandmother's feet whether the expression of her countenance as it was raised towards the old lady's face called up a thought of old times or whether the old lady was touched by mr pickwick's affectionate good nature or whatever was the cause she was fairly melted so she threw herself on her grand daughter's neck and all the little ill humour evaporated in a gush of silent tears a happy party they were that night sedate and solemn were the score of rubbers in which mr pickwick and the old lady played together uproarious was the mirth of the round table long after the ladies had retired did the hot elder wine well qualified with brandy and spice go round and round and round again and sound was the sleep and pleasant were the dreams that followed it is a remarkable fact that those of mr snodgrass bore constant reference to emily wardle and that the principal figure in mr winkle's visions was a young lady with black eyes an arch smile and a pair of remarkably nice boots with fur round the tops mr pickwick was awakened early in the morning by a hum of voices and a pattering of feet sufficient to rouse even the fat boy from his heavy slumbers he sat up in bed and listened the female servants and female visitors were running constantly to and fro and there were such multitudinous demands for hot water such repeated outcries for needles and thread and so many half suppressed entreaties of oh do come and tie me there's a dear that mr pickwick in his innocence began to imagine that something dreadful must have occurred when he grew more awake and remembered the wedding the occasion being an important one he dressed himself with peculiar care and descended to the breakfast room there were all the female servants in a brand new uniform of pink muslin gowns with white bows in their caps running about the house in a state of excitement and agitation which it would be impossible to describe the old lady was dressed out in a brocaded gown which had not seen the light for twenty years saving and excepting such truant rays as had stolen through the chinks in the box in which it had been laid by during the whole time mr trundle was in high feather and spirits but a little nervous withal the hearty old landlord was trying to look very cheerful and unconcerned but failing signally in the attempt all the girls were in tears and white muslin except a select two or three who were being honoured with a private view of the bride and bridesmaids upstairs all the pickwickians were in a most blooming array and there was a terrific roaring on the grass in front of the house occasioned by all the men boys and hobbledehoys attached to the farm each of whom had got a white bow in his button hole and all of whom were cheering with might and main being incited thereunto and stimulated therein by the precept and example of mr samuel weller who had managed to become mighty popular already and was as much at home as if he had been born on the land a wedding is a licensed subject to joke upon but there really is no great joke in the matter after all we speak merely of the ceremony and beg it to be distinctly understood that we indulge in no hidden sarcasm upon a married life mixed up with the pleasure and joy of the occasion are the many regrets at quitting home the tears of parting between parent and child the consciousness of leaving the dearest and kindest friends of the happiest portion of human life to encounter its cares and troubles with others still untried and little known natural feelings which we would not render this chapter mournful by describing and which we should be still more unwilling to be supposed to ridicule let us briefly say then that the ceremony was performed by the old clergyman in the parish church of dingley dell and that mr pickwick's name is attached to the register still preserved in the vestry thereof that the young lady with the black eyes signed her name in a very unsteady and tremulous manner that emily's signature as the other bridesmaid is nearly illegible that it all went off in very admirable style that the young ladies generally thought it far less shocking than they had expected and that although the owner of the black eyes and the arch smile informed mr winkle that she was sure she could never submit to anything so dreadful we have the very best reasons for thinking she was mistaken to all this we may add that mr pickwick was the first who saluted the bride and that in so doing he threw over her neck a rich gold watch and chain which no mortal eyes but the jeweller's had ever beheld before then the old church bell rang as gaily as it could and they all returned to breakfast vere does the mince pies go young opium eater said mr weller to the fat boy as he assisted in laying out such articles of consumption as had not been duly arranged on the previous night the fat boy pointed to the destination of the pies wery good said sam stick a bit o' christmas in 'em t'other dish opposite there now we look compact and comfortable as the father said ven he cut his little boy's head off to cure him of squintin' as mr weller made the comparison he fell back a step or two to give full effect to it and surveyed the preparations with the utmost satisfaction wardle said mr pickwick almost as soon as they were all seated a glass of wine in honour of this happy occasion i shall be delighted my boy said wardle joe damn that boy he's gone to sleep no i ain't sir replied the fat boy starting up from a remote corner where like the patron saint of fat boys the immortal horner he had been devouring a christmas pie though not with the coolness and deliberation which characterised that young gentleman's proceedings fill mr pickwick's glass yes sir the fat boy filled mr pickwick's glass and then retired behind his master's chair from whence he watched the play of the knives and forks and the progress of the choice morsels from the dishes to the mouths of the company with a kind of dark and gloomy joy that was most impressive god bless you old fellow said mr pickwick same to you my boy replied wardle and they pledged each other heartily mrs wardle said mr pickwick we old folks must have a glass of wine together in honour of this joyful event the old lady was in a state of great grandeur just then for she was sitting at the top of the table in the brocaded gown with her newly married granddaughter on one side and mr pickwick on the other to do the carving mr pickwick had not spoken in a very loud tone but she understood him at once and drank off a full glass of wine to his long life and happiness after which the worthy old soul launched forth into a minute and particular account of her own wedding with a dissertation on the fashion of wearing high heeled shoes and some particulars concerning the life and adventures of the beautiful lady tollimglower deceased at all of which the old lady herself laughed very heartily indeed and so did the young ladies too for they were wondering among themselves what on earth grandma was talking about when they laughed the old lady laughed ten times more heartily and said that these always had been considered capital stories which caused them all to laugh again and put the old lady into the very best of humours then the cake was cut and passed through the ring the young ladies saved pieces to put under their pillows to dream of their future husbands on and a great deal of blushing and merriment was thereby occasioned mr miller said mr pickwick to his old acquaintance the hard headed gentleman a glass of wine with great satisfaction mr pickwick replied the hard headed gentleman solemnly you'll take me in said the benevolent old clergyman and me interposed his wife and me and me said a couple of poor relations at the bottom of the table who had eaten and drank very heartily and laughed at everything mr pickwick expressed his heartfelt delight at every additional suggestion and his eyes beamed with hilarity and cheerfulness ladies and gentlemen said mr pickwick suddenly rising hear hear hear hear hear hear cried mr weller in the excitement of his feelings call in all the servants cried old wardle interposing to prevent the public rebuke which mr weller would otherwise most indubitably have received from his master give them a glass of wine each to drink the toast in now pickwick amidst the silence of the company the whispering of the women servants and the awkward embarrassment of the men mr pickwick proceeded ladies and gentlemen no i won't say ladies and gentlemen i'll call you my friends my dear friends if the ladies will allow me to take so great a liberty here mr pickwick was interrupted by immense applause from the ladies echoed by the gentlemen during which the owner of the eyes was distinctly heard to state that she could kiss that dear mr pickwick whereupon mr winkle gallantly inquired if it couldn't be done by deputy to which the young lady with the black eyes replied go away and accompanied the request with a look which said as plainly as a look could do if you can my dear friends resumed mr pickwick i am going to propose the health of the bride and bridegroom god bless 'em cheers and tears my young friend trundle i believe to be a very excellent and manly fellow and his wife i know to be a very amiable and lovely girl well qualified to transfer to another sphere of action the happiness which for twenty years she has diffused around her in her father's house here the fat boy burst forth into stentorian blubberings and was led forth by the coat collar by mr weller i wish added mr pickwick i wish i was young enough to be her sister's husband cheers but failing that i am happy to be old enough to be her father for being so i shall not be suspected of any latent designs when i say that i admire esteem and love them both cheers and sobs the bride's father our good friend there is a noble person and i am proud to know him great uproar he is a kind excellent independent spirited fine hearted hospitable liberal man enthusiastic shouts from the poor relations at all the adjectives and especially at the two last that his daughter may enjoy all the happiness even he can desire and that he may derive from the contemplation of her felicity all the gratification of heart and peace of mind which he so well deserves is i am persuaded our united wish so let us drink their healths and wish them prolonged life and every blessing mr pickwick concluded amidst a whirlwind of applause and once more were the lungs of the supernumeraries under mr weller's command brought into active and efficient operation mr wardle proposed mr pickwick mr pickwick proposed the old lady mr snodgrass proposed mr wardle mr wardle proposed mr snodgrass one of the poor relations proposed mr tupman and the other poor relation proposed mr winkle all was happiness and festivity until the mysterious disappearance of both the poor relations beneath the table warned the party that it was time to adjourn at dinner they met again after a five and twenty mile walk undertaken by the males at wardle's recommendation to get rid of the effects of the wine at breakfast the poor relations had kept in bed all day with the view of attaining the same happy consummation but as they had been unsuccessful they stopped there mr weller kept the domestics in a state of perpetual hilarity and the fat boy divided his time into small alternate allotments of eating and sleeping the dinner was as hearty an affair as the breakfast and was quite as noisy without the tears then came the dessert and some more toasts then came the tea and coffee and then the ball the best sitting room at manor farm was a good long dark panelled room with a high chimney piece and a capacious chimney up which you could have driven one of the new patent cabs wheels and all at the upper end of the room seated in a shady bower of holly and evergreens were the two best fiddlers and the only harp in all muggleton in all sorts of recesses and on all kinds of brackets stood massive old silver candlesticks with four branches each the carpet was up the candles burnt bright the fire blazed and crackled on the hearth and merry voices and light hearted laughter rang through the room if any of the old english yeomen had turned into fairies when they died it was just the place in which they would have held their revels if anything could have added to the interest of this agreeable scene it would have been the remarkable fact of mr pickwick's appearing without his gaiters for the first time within the memory of his oldest friends you mean to dance said wardle of course i do replied mr pickwick don't you see i am dressed for the purpose mr pickwick called attention to his speckled stockings and smartly tied pumps you in silk stockings exclaimed mr tupman jocosely and why not sir why not said mr pickwick turning warmly upon him oh of course there is no reason why you shouldn't wear them responded mr tupman i imagine not sir i imagine not said mr pickwick in a very peremptory tone mr tupman had contemplated a laugh but he found it was a serious matter so he looked grave and said they were a pretty pattern i hope they are said mr pickwick fixing his eyes upon his friend you see nothing extraordinary in the stockings as stockings i trust sir certainly not oh certainly not replied mr tupman he walked away and mr pickwick's countenance resumed its customary benign expression we are all ready i believe said mr pickwick who was stationed with the old lady at the top of the dance and had already made four false starts in his excessive anxiety to commence then begin at once said wardle now up struck the two fiddles and the one harp and off went mr pickwick into hands across when there was a general clapping of hands and a cry of stop stop what's the matter said mr pickwick who was only brought to by the fiddles and harp desisting and could have been stopped by no other earthly power if the house had been on fire where's arabella allen cried a dozen voices and winkle added mr tupman here we are exclaimed that gentleman emerging with his pretty companion from the corner as he did so it would have been hard to tell which was the redder in the face he or the young lady with the black eyes what an extraordinary thing it is winkle said mr pickwick rather pettishly that you couldn't have taken your place before not at all extraordinary said mr winkle well said mr pickwick with a very expressive smile as his eyes rested on arabella well i don't know that it was extraordinary either after all however there was no time to think more about the matter for the fiddles and harp began in real earnest away went mr pickwick hands across down the middle to the very end of the room and half way up the chimney back again to the door poussette everywhere loud stamp on the ground ready for the next couple off again all the figure over once more another stamp to beat out the time next couple and the next and the next again never was such going at last after they had reached the bottom of the dance and full fourteen couple after the old lady had retired in an exhausted state and the clergyman's wife had been substituted in her stead did that gentleman when there was no demand whatever on his exertions keep perpetually dancing in his place to keep time to the music smiling on his partner all the while with a blandness of demeanour which baffles all description long before mr pickwick was weary of dancing the newly married couple had retired from the scene there was a glorious supper downstairs notwithstanding and a good long sitting after it and when mr pickwick awoke late the next morning he had a confused recollection of having severally and confidentially invited somewhere about five and forty people to dine with him at the george and vulture the very first time they came to london which mr pickwick rightly considered a pretty certain indication of his having taken something besides exercise on the previous night and so your family has games in the kitchen to night my dear has they inquired sam of emma yes mr weller replied emma we always have on christmas eve master wouldn't neglect to keep it up on any account your master's a wery pretty notion of keepin' anythin' up my dear said mr weller i never see such a sensible sort of man as he is or such a reg'lar gen'l'm'n oh that he is said the fat boy joining in the conversation don't he breed nice pork the fat youth gave a semi cannibalic leer at mr weller as he thought of the roast legs and gravy oh you've woke up at last have you said sam the fat boy nodded i'll tell you what it is young boa constructer said mr weller impressively if you don't sleep a little less and exercise a little more ven you come to be a man you'll lay yourself open to the same sort of personal inconwenience as was inflicted on the old gen'l'm'n as wore the pigtail what did they do to him inquired the fat boy in a faltering voice i'm a goin' to tell you replied mr weller he was one o' the largest patterns as was ever turned out reg'lar fat man as hadn't caught a glimpse of his own shoes for five and forty year lor exclaimed emma no that he hadn't my dear said mr weller and if you'd put an exact model of his own legs on the dinin' table afore him he wouldn't ha' known 'em well he always walks to his office with a wery handsome gold watch chain hanging out about a foot and a quarter and a gold watch in his fob pocket as was worth i'm afraid to say how much but as much as a watch can be a large heavy round manafacter as stout for a watch as he was for a man and with a big face in proportion 'you'd better not carry that 'ere watch' says the old gen'l'm'n's friends 'you'll be robbed on it' says they 'shall i' says he 'yes you will' says they 'vell' says he 'i should like to see the thief as could get this here watch out for i'm blest if i ever can it's such a tight fit' says he 'and venever i wants to know what's o'clock i'm obliged to stare into the bakers' shops' he says well then he laughs as hearty as if he was a goin' to pieces and out he walks agin with his powdered head and pigtail and rolls down the strand vith the chain hangin' out furder than ever and the great round watch almost bustin' through his grey kersey smalls there warn't a pickpocket in all london as didn't take a pull at that chain but the chain 'ud never break and the watch 'ud never come out so they soon got tired o' dragging such a heavy old gen'l'm'n along the pavement and he'd go home and laugh till the pigtail wibrated like the perderlum of a dutch clock at last one day the old gen'l'm'n was a rolling along and he sees a pickpocket as he know'd by sight a comin' up arm in arm vith a little boy with a very large head 'here's a game' says the old gen'l'm'n to himself 'they're a goin' to have another try but it won't do' so he begins a chucklin' wery hearty ven all of a sudden the little boy leaves hold of the pickpocket's arm and rushes head foremost straight into the old gen'l'm'n's stomach and for a moment doubles him right up vith the pain 'murder' says the old gen'l'm'n 'all right sir' says the pickpocket a whisperin' in his ear and when he come straight agin the watch and chain was gone and what's worse than that the old gen'l'm'n's digestion was all wrong ever arterwards to the wery last day of his life so just you look about you young feller and take care you don't get too fat as mr weller concluded this moral tale with which the fat boy appeared much affected they all three repaired to the large kitchen in which the family were by this time assembled according to annual custom on christmas eve observed by old wardle's fore fathers from time immemorial from the centre of the ceiling of this kitchen old wardle had just suspended with his own hands a huge branch of mistletoe and this same branch of mistletoe instantaneously gave rise to a scene of general and most delightful struggling and confusion in the midst of which mr pickwick with a gallantry that would have done honour to a descendant of lady tollimglower herself took the old lady by the hand led her beneath the mystic branch and saluted her in all courtesy and decorum the old lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all the dignity which befitted so important and serious a solemnity but the younger ladies not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious veneration for the custom or imagining that the value of a salute is very much enhanced if it cost a little trouble to obtain it screamed and struggled and ran into corners and threatened and remonstrated and did everything but leave the room until some of the less adventurous gentlemen were on the point of desisting when they all at once found it useless to resist any longer and submitted to be kissed with a good grace mr winkle kissed the young lady with the black eyes and mr snodgrass kissed emily and mr weller not being particular about the form of being under the mistletoe kissed emma and the other female servants just as he caught them as to the poor relations they kissed everybody not even excepting the plainer portions of the young lady visitors who in their excessive confusion ran right under the mistletoe as soon as it was hung up without knowing it wardle stood with his back to the fire surveying the whole scene with the utmost satisfaction and the fat boy took the opportunity of appropriating to his own use and summarily devouring a particularly fine mince pie that had been carefully put by for somebody else now the screaming had subsided and faces were in a glow and curls in a tangle and mr pickwick after kissing the old lady as before mentioned was standing under the mistletoe looking with a very pleased countenance on all that was passing around him when the young lady with the black eyes after a little whispering with the other young ladies made a sudden dart forward and putting her arm round mr pickwick's neck saluted him affectionately on the left cheek and before mr pickwick distinctly knew what was the matter he was surrounded by the whole body and kissed by every one of them it was a pleasant thing to see mr pickwick the centre of the group now pulled this way and then that and first kissed on the chin and then on the nose and then on the spectacles and to hear the peals of laughter which were raised on every side but it was a still more pleasant thing to see mr pickwick blinded shortly afterwards with a silk handkerchief falling up against the wall and scrambling into corners and going through all the mysteries of blindman's buff with the utmost relish for the game until at last he caught one of the poor relations and then had to evade the blindman himself which he did with a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause of all beholders the poor relations caught the people who they thought would like it and when the game flagged got caught themselves when they were all tired of blindman's buff there was a great game at snap dragon and when fingers enough were burned with that and all the raisins were gone they sat down by the huge fire of blazing logs to a substantial supper and a mighty bowl of wassail something smaller than an ordinary wash house copper in which the hot apples were hissing and bubbling with a rich look and a jolly sound that were perfectly irresistible this said mr pickwick looking round him this is indeed comfort our invariable custom replied mr wardle everybody sits down with us on christmas eve as you see them now servants and all and here we wait until the clock strikes twelve to usher christmas in and beguile the time with forfeits and old stories trundle my boy rake up the fire up flew the bright sparks in myriads as the logs were stirred the deep red blaze sent forth a rich glow that penetrated into the furthest corner of the room and cast its cheerful tint on every face come said wardle a song a christmas song i'll give you one in default of a better bravo said mr pickwick fill up cried wardle it will be two hours good before you see the bottom of the bowl through the deep rich colour of the wassail fill up all round and now for a song thus saying the merry old gentleman in a good round sturdy voice commenced without more ado a christmas carol i care not for spring on his fickle wing let the blossoms and buds be borne he woos them amain with his treacherous rain and he scatters them ere the morn an inconstant elf he knows not himself nor his own changing mind an hour he'll smile in your face and with wry grimace he'll wither your youngest flower let the summer sun to his bright home run he shall never be sought by me when he's dimmed by a cloud i can laugh aloud and care not how sulky he be for his darling child is the madness wild that sports in fierce fever's train and when love is too strong it don't last long as many have found to their pain a mild harvest night by the tranquil light of the modest and gentle moon has a far sweeter sheen for me i ween than the broad and unblushing noon but every leaf awakens my grief as it lieth beneath the tree so let autumn air be never so fair it by no means agrees with me but my song i troll out for christmas stout the hearty the true and the bold a bumper i drain and with might and main give three cheers for this christmas old we'll usher him in with a merry din that shall gladden his joyous heart and we'll keep him up while there's bite or sup and in fellowship good we'll part in his fine honest pride he scorns to hide one jot of his hard weather scars they're no disgrace for there's much the same trace on the cheeks of our bravest tars then again i'll sing 'till the roof doth ring and it echoes from wall to wall to the stout old wight fair welcome to night as the king of the seasons all this song was tumultuously applauded for friends and dependents make a capital audience and the poor relations especially were in perfect ecstasies of rapture again was the fire replenished and again went the wassail round how it snows said one of the men in a low tone snows does it said wardle rough cold night sir replied the man and there's a wind got up that drifts it across the fields in a thick white cloud what does jem say inquired the old lady there ain't anything the matter is there no no mother replied wardle he says there's a snow drift and a wind that's piercing cold i should know that by the way it rumbles in the chimney ah said the old lady there was just such a wind and just such a fall of snow a good many years back i recollect just five years before your poor father died it was a christmas eve too and i remember that on that very night he told us the story about the goblins that carried away old gabriel grub the story about what said mr pickwick oh nothing nothing replied wardle about an old sexton that the good people down here suppose to have been carried away by goblins suppose ejaculated the old lady is there anybody hardy enough to disbelieve it suppose haven't you heard ever since you were a child that he was carried away by the goblins and don't you know he was very well mother he was if you like said wardle laughing he was carried away by goblins pickwick and there's an end to the matter no no said mr pickwick not an end of it i assure you for i must hear how and why and all about it wardle smiled as every head was bent forward to hear and filling out the wassail with no stinted hand nodded a health to mr pickwick and began as follows but bless our editorial heart what a long chapter we have been betrayed into we had quite forgotten all such petty restrictions as chapters we solemnly declare so here goes to give the goblin a fair start in a new one a clear stage and no favour for the goblins ladies and gentlemen
