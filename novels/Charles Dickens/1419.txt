transcribed from the chapman and hall christmas stories edition by david price email ccxcoventryacuk mugby junction chapter i barbox brothers i guard what place is this mugby junction sir a windy place yes it mostly is sir and looks comfortless indeed yes it generally does sir is it a rainy night still pours sir open the door i'll get out you'll have sir said the guard glistening with drops of wet and looking at the tearful face of his watch by the light of his lantern as the traveller descended three minutes here more i think for i am not going on thought you had a through ticket sir so i have but i shall sacrifice the rest of it i want my luggage please to come to the van and point it out sir be good enough to look very sharp sir not a moment to spare the guard hurried to the luggage van and the traveller hurried after him the guard got into it and the traveller looked into it those two large black portmanteaus in the corner where your light shines those are mine name upon 'em sir barbox brothers stand clear sir if you please one two right lamp waved signal lights ahead already changing shriek from engine train gone mugby junction said the traveller pulling up the woollen muffler round his throat with both hands at past three o'clock of a tempestuous morning so he spoke to himself there was no one else to speak to perhaps though there had been any one else to speak to he would have preferred to speak to himself speaking to himself he spoke to a man within five years of fifty either way who had turned grey too soon like a neglected fire a man of pondering habit brooding carriage of the head and suppressed internal voice a man with many indications on him of having been much alone he stood unnoticed on the dreary platform except by the rain and by the wind those two vigilant assailants made a rush at him very well said he yielding it signifies nothing to me to what quarter i turn my face thus at mugby junction at past three o'clock of a tempestuous morning the traveller went where the weather drove him not but what he could make a stand when he was so minded for coming to the end of the roofed shelter it is of considerable extent at mugby junction and looking out upon the dark night with a yet darker spirit wing of storm beating its wild way through it he faced about and held his own as ruggedly in the difficult direction as he had held it in the easier one thus with a steady step the traveller went up and down up and down up and down seeking nothing and finding it a place replete with shadowy shapes this mugby junction in the black hours of the four and twenty mysterious goods trains covered with palls and gliding on like vast weird funerals conveying themselves guiltily away from the presence of the few lighted lamps as if their freight had come to a secret and unlawful end half miles of coal pursuing in a detective manner following when they lead stopping when they stop backing when they back red hot embers showering out upon the ground down this dark avenue and down the other as if torturing fires were being raked clear concurrently shrieks and groans and grinds invading the ear as if the tortured were at the height of their suffering iron barred cages full of cattle jangling by midway the drooping beasts with horns entangled eyes frozen with terror and mouths too at least they have long icicles or what seem so hanging from their lips unknown languages in the air conspiring in red green and white characters an earthquake accompanied with thunder and lightning going up express to london now all quiet all rusty wind and rain in possession lamps extinguished mugby junction dead and indistinct with its robe drawn over its head like caesar now too as the belated traveller plodded up and down a shadowy train went by him in the gloom which was no other than the train of a life from whatsoever intangible deep cutting or dark tunnel it emerged here it came unsummoned and unannounced stealing upon him and passing away into obscurity here mournfully went by a child who had never had a childhood or known a parent inseparable from a youth with a bitter sense of his namelessness coupled to a man the enforced business of whose best years had been distasteful and oppressive linked to an ungrateful friend dragging after him a woman once beloved attendant with many a clank and wrench were lumbering cares dark meditations huge dim disappointments monotonous years a long jarring line of the discords of a solitary and unhappy existence yours sir the traveller recalled his eyes from the waste into which they had been staring and fell back a step or so under the abruptness and perhaps the chance appropriateness of the question oh my thoughts were not here for the moment yes yes those two portmanteaus are mine are you a porter on porter's wages sir but i am lamps the traveller looked a little confused who did you say you are lamps sir showing an oily cloth in his hand as farther explanation surely surely is there any hotel or tavern here not exactly here sir there is a refreshment room here but lamps with a mighty serious look gave his head a warning roll that plainly added but it's a blessed circumstance for you that it's not open you couldn't recommend it i see if it was available ask your pardon sir if it was open it ain't my place as a paid servant of the company to give my opinion on any of the company's toepics he pronounced it more like toothpicks beyond lamp ile and cottons returned lamps in a confidential tone but speaking as a man i wouldn't recommend my father if he was to come to life again to go and try how he'd be treated at the refreshment room not speaking as a man no i would not the traveller nodded conviction i suppose i can put up in the town there is a town here for the traveller though a stay at home compared with most travellers had been like many others carried on the steam winds and the iron tides through that junction before without having ever as one might say gone ashore there oh yes there's a town sir anyways there's town enough to put up in but following the glance of the other at his luggage this is a very dead time of the night with us sir the deadest time i might a'most call it our deadest and buriedest time no porters about well sir you see returned lamps confidential again they in general goes off with the gas that's how it is and they seem to have overlooked you through your walking to the furder end of the platform but in about twelve minutes or so she may be up who may be up the three forty two sir she goes off in a sidin' till the up x passes and then she here an air of hopeful vagueness pervaded lamps does all as lays in her power i doubt if i comprehend the arrangement i doubt if anybody do sir she's a parliamentary sir and you see a parliamentary or a skirmishun do you mean an excursion that's it sir a parliamentary or a skirmishun she mostly does go off into a sidin' but when she can get a chance she's whistled out of it and she's whistled up into doin' all as lamps again wore the air of a highly sanguine man who hoped for the best all as lays in her power he then explained that the porters on duty being required to be in attendance on the parliamentary matron in question would doubtless turn up with the gas in the meantime if the gentleman would not very much object to the smell of lamp oil and would accept the warmth of his little room the gentleman being by this time very cold instantly closed with the proposal a greasy little cabin it was suggestive to the sense of smell of a cabin in a whaler but there was a bright fire burning in its rusty grate and on the floor there stood a wooden stand of newly trimmed and lighted lamps ready for carriage service they made a bright show and their light and the warmth accounted for the popularity of the room as borne witness to by many impressions of velveteen trousers on a form by the fire and many rounded smears and smudges of stooping velveteen shoulders on the adjacent wall various untidy shelves accommodated a quantity of lamps and oil cans and also a fragrant collection of what looked like the pocket handkerchiefs of the whole lamp family as barbox brothers so to call the traveller on the warranty of his luggage took his seat upon the form and warmed his now ungloved hands at the fire he glanced aside at a little deal desk much blotched with ink which his elbow touched upon it were some scraps of coarse paper and a superannuated steel pen in very reduced and gritty circumstances from glancing at the scraps of paper he turned involuntarily to his host and said with some roughness why you are never a poet man lamps had certainly not the conventional appearance of one as he stood modestly rubbing his squab nose with a handkerchief so exceedingly oily that he might have been in the act of mistaking himself for one of his charges he was a spare man of about the barbox brothers time of life with his features whimsically drawn upward as if they were attracted by the roots of his hair he had a peculiarly shining transparent complexion probably occasioned by constant oleaginous application and his attractive hair being cut short and being grizzled and standing straight up on end as if it in its turn were attracted by some invisible magnet above it the top of his head was not very unlike a lamp wick but to be sure it's no business of mine said barbox brothers that was an impertinent observation on my part be what you like some people sir remarked lamps in a tone of apology are sometimes what they don't like nobody knows that better than i do sighed the other i have been what i don't like all my life when i first took sir resumed lamps to composing little comic songs like barbox brothers eyed him with great disfavour to composing little comic songs like and what was more hard to singing 'em afterwards said lamps it went against the grain at that time it did indeed something that was not all oil here shining in lamps's eye barbox brothers withdrew his own a little disconcerted looked at the fire and put a foot on the top bar why did you do it then he asked after a short pause abruptly enough but in a softer tone if you didn't want to do it why did you do it where did you sing them public house to which mr lamps returned the curious reply bedside at this moment while the traveller looked at him for elucidation mugby junction started suddenly trembled violently and opened its gas eyes she's got up lamps announced excited what lays in her power is sometimes more and sometimes less but it's laid in her power to get up to night by george the legend barbox brothers in large white letters on two black surfaces was very soon afterwards trundling on a truck through a silent street and when the owner of the legend had shivered on the pavement half an hour what time the porter's knocks at the inn door knocked up the whole town first and the inn last he groped his way into the close air of a shut up house and so groped between the sheets of a shut up bed that seemed to have been expressly refrigerated for him when last made ii you remember me young jackson what do i remember if not you you are my first remembrance it was you who told me that was my name it was you who told me that on every twentieth of december my life had a penitential anniversary in it called a birthday i suppose the last communication was truer than the first what am i like young jackson you are like a blight all through the year to me you hard lined thin lipped repressive changeless woman with a wax mask on you are like the devil to me most of all when you teach me religious things for you make me abhor them you remember me mr young jackson in another voice from another quarter most gratefully sir you were the ray of hope and prospering ambition in my life when i attended your course i believed that i should come to be a great healer and i felt almost happy even though i was still the one boarder in the house with that horrible mask and ate and drank in silence and constraint with the mask before me every day as i had done every every every day through my school time and from my earliest recollection what am i like mr young jackson you are like a superior being to me you are like nature beginning to reveal herself to me i hear you again as one of the hushed crowd of young men kindling under the power of your presence and knowledge and you bring into my eyes the only exultant tears that ever stood in them you remember me mr young jackson in a grating voice from quite another quarter too well you made your ghostly appearance in my life one day and announced that its course was to be suddenly and wholly changed you showed me which was my wearisome seat in the galley of barbox brothers when they were if they ever were is unknown to me there was nothing of them but the name when i bent to the oar you told me what i was to do and what to be paid you told me afterwards at intervals of years when i was to sign for the firm when i became a partner when i became the firm i know no more of it or of myself what am i like mr young jackson you are like my father i sometimes think you are hard enough and cold enough so to have brought up an acknowledged son i see your scanty figure your close brown suit and your tight brown wig but you too wear a wax mask to your death you never by a chance remove it it never by a chance falls off and i know no more of you throughout this dialogue the traveller spoke to himself at his window in the morning as he had spoken to himself at the junction overnight and as he had then looked in the darkness a man who had turned grey too soon like a neglected fire so he now looked in the sun light an ashier grey like a fire which the brightness of the sun put out the firm of barbox brothers had been some offshoot or irregular branch of the public notary and bill broking tree it had gained for itself a griping reputation before the days of young jackson and the reputation had stuck to it and to him as he had imperceptibly come into possession of the dim den up in the corner of a court off lombard street on whose grimy windows the inscription barbox brothers had for many long years daily interposed itself between him and the sky so he had insensibly found himself a personage held in chronic distrust whom it was essential to screw tight to every transaction in which he engaged whose word was never to be taken without his attested bond whom all dealers with openly set up guards and wards against this character had come upon him through no act of his own it was as if the original barbox had stretched himself down upon the office floor and had thither caused to be conveyed young jackson in his sleep and had there effected a metempsychosis and exchange of persons with him the discovery aided in its turn by the deceit of the only woman he had ever loved and the deceit of the only friend he had ever made who eloped from him to be married together the discovery so followed up completed what his earliest rearing had begun he shrank abashed within the form of barbox and lifted up his head and heart no more but he did at last effect one great release in his condition he broke the oar he had plied so long and he scuttled and sank the galley he prevented the gradual retirement of an old conventional business from him by taking the initiative and retiring from it with enough to live on though after all with not too much he obliterated the firm of barbox brothers from the pages of the post office directory and the face of the earth leaving nothing of it but its name on two portmanteaus for one must have some name in going about for people to pick up he explained to mugby high street through the inn window and that name at least was real once whereas young jackson not to mention its being a sadly satirical misnomer for old jackson he took up his hat and walked out just in time to see passing along on the opposite side of the way a velveteen man carrying his day's dinner in a small bundle that might have been larger without suspicion of gluttony and pelting away towards the junction at a great pace there's lamps said barbox brothers and by the bye ridiculous surely that a man so serious so self contained and not yet three days emancipated from a routine of drudgery should stand rubbing his chin in the street in a brown study about comic songs bedside said barbox brothers testily sings them at the bedside why at the bedside unless he goes to bed drunk does i shouldn't wonder but it's no business of mine let me see mugby junction mugby junction where shall i go next as it came into my head last night when i woke from an uneasy sleep in the carriage and found myself here i can go anywhere from here where shall i go i'll go and look at the junction by daylight there's no hurry and i may like the look of one line better than another but there were so many lines gazing down upon them from a bridge at the junction it was as if the concentrating companies formed a great industrial exhibition of the works of extraordinary ground spiders that spun iron and then so many of the lines went such wonderful ways so crossing and curving among one another that the eye lost them and then some of them appeared to start with the fixed intention of going five hundred miles and all of a sudden gave it up at an insignificant barrier or turned off into a workshop and then others like intoxicated men went a little way very straight and surprisingly slued round and came back again and then others were so chock full of trucks of coal others were so blocked with trucks of casks others were so gorged with trucks of ballast others were so set apart for wheeled objects like immense iron cotton reels while others were so bright and clear and others were so delivered over to rust and ashes and idle wheelbarrows out of work with their legs in the air looking much like their masters on strike that there was no beginning middle or end to the bewilderment barbox brothers stood puzzled on the bridge passing his right hand across the lines on his forehead which multiplied while he looked down as if the railway lines were getting themselves photographed on that sensitive plate then was heard a distant ringing of bells and blowing of whistles then puppet looking heads of men popped out of boxes in perspective and popped in again then prodigious wooden razors set up on end began shaving the atmosphere then several locomotive engines in several directions began to scream and be agitated then along one avenue a train came in then along another two trains appeared that didn't come in but stopped without then bits of trains broke off then a struggling horse became involved with them then the locomotives shared the bits of trains and ran away with the whole i have not made my next move much clearer by this no hurry no need to make up my mind to day or to morrow nor yet the day after i'll take a walk it fell out somehow perhaps he meant it should that the walk tended to the platform at which he had alighted and to lamps's room but lamps was not in his room a pair of velveteen shoulders were adapting themselves to one of the impressions on the wall by lamps's fireplace but otherwise the room was void in passing back to get out of the station again he learnt the cause of this vacancy by catching sight of lamps on the opposite line of railway skipping along the top of a train from carriage to carriage and catching lighted namesakes thrown up to him by a coadjutor he is busy he has not much time for composing or singing comic songs this morning i take it the direction he pursued now was into the country keeping very near to the side of one great line of railway and within easy view of others i have half a mind' he said glancing around to settle the question from this point by saying 'i'll take this set of rails or that or t'other and stick to it' they separate themselves from the confusion out here and go their ways ascending a gentle hill of some extent he came to a few cottages there looking about him as a very reserved man might who had never looked about him in his life before he saw some six or eight young children come merrily trooping and whooping from one of the cottages and disperse but not until they had all turned at the little garden gate and kissed their hands to a face at the upper window a low window enough although the upper for the cottage had but a story of one room above the ground now that the children should do this was nothing but that they should do this to a face lying on the sill of the open window turned towards them in a horizontal position and apparently only a face was something noticeable he looked up at the window again could only see a very fragile though a very bright face lying on one cheek on the window sill the delicate smiling face of a girl or woman framed in long bright brown hair round which was tied a light blue band or fillet passing under the chin he walked on turned back passed the window again shyly glanced up again no change he struck off by a winding branch road at the top of the hill which he must otherwise have descended kept the cottages in view worked his way round at a distance so as to come out once more into the main road and be obliged to pass the cottages again the face still lay on the window sill but not so much inclined towards him and now there were a pair of delicate hands too they had the action of performing on some musical instrument and yet it produced no sound that reached his ears mugby junction must be the maddest place in england said barbox brothers pursuing his way down the hill the first thing i find here is a railway porter who composes comic songs to sing at his bedside the second thing i find here is a face and a pair of hands playing a musical instrument that don't play the day was a fine bright day in the early beginning of november the air was clear and inspiriting and the landscape was rich in beautiful colours the prevailing colours in the court off lombard street london city had been few and sombre sometimes when the weather elsewhere was very bright indeed the dwellers in those tents enjoyed a pepper and salt coloured day or two but their atmosphere's usual wear was slate or snuff coloured he relished his walk so well that he repeated it next day he was a little earlier at the cottage than on the day before and he could hear the children upstairs singing to a regular measure and clapping out the time with their hands still there is no sound of any musical instrument he said listening at the corner and yet i saw the performing hands again as i came by what are the children singing why good lord they can never be singing the multiplication table they were though and with infinite enjoyment the mysterious face had a voice attached to it which occasionally led or set the children right its musical cheerfulness was delightful the measure at length stopped and was succeeded by a murmuring of young voices and then by a short song which he made out to be about the current month of the year and about what work it yielded to the labourers in the fields and farmyards then there was a stir of little feet and the children came trooping and whooping out as on the previous day and again as on the previous day they all turned at the garden gate and kissed their hands evidently to the face on the window sill though barbox brothers from his retired post of disadvantage at the corner could not see it but as the children dispersed he cut off one small straggler a brown faced boy with flaxen hair and said to him come here little one tell me whose house is that the child with one swarthy arm held up across his eyes half in shyness and half ready for defence said from behind the inside of his elbow phoebe's and who said barbox brothers quite as much embarrassed by his part in the dialogue as the child could possibly be by his is phoebe to which the child made answer why phoebe of course the small but sharp observer had eyed his questioner closely and had taken his moral measure he lowered his guard and rather assumed a tone with him as having discovered him to be an unaccustomed person in the art of polite conversation phoebe said the child can't be anybobby else but phoebe can she no i suppose not well returned the child then why did you ask me deeming it prudent to shift his ground barbox brothers took up a new position what do you do there up there in that room where the open window is what do you do there cool said the child eh co o ol the child repeated in a louder voice lengthening out the word with a fixed look and great emphasis as much as to say what's the use of your having grown up if you're such a donkey as not to understand me ah school school said barbox brothers yes yes yes and phoebe teaches you the child nodded good boy tound it out have you said the child yes i have found it out what would you do with twopence if i gave it you pend it the knock down promptitude of this reply leaving him not a leg to stand upon barbox brothers produced the twopence with great lameness and withdrew in a state of humiliation but seeing the face on the window sill as he passed the cottage he acknowledged its presence there with a gesture which was not a nod not a bow not a removal of his hat from his head but was a diffident compromise between or struggle with all three the eyes in the face seemed amused or cheered or both and the lips modestly said good day to you sir i find i must stick for a time to mugby junction said barbox brothers with much gravity after once more stopping on his return road to look at the lines where they went their several ways so quietly i can't make up my mind yet which iron road to take in fact i must get a little accustomed to the junction before i can decide so he announced at the inn that he was going to stay on for the present and improved his acquaintance with the junction that night and again next morning and again next night and morning going down to the station mingling with the people there looking about him down all the avenues of railway and beginning to take an interest in the incomings and outgoings of the trains at first he often put his head into lamps's little room but he never found lamps there a pair or two of velveteen shoulders he usually found there stooping over the fire sometimes in connection with a clasped knife and a piece of bread and meat but the answer to his inquiry where's lamps was either that he was t'other side the line or that it was his off time or in the latter case his own personal introduction to another lamps who was not his lamps however he was not so desperately set upon seeing lamps now but he bore the disappointment nor did he so wholly devote himself to his severe application to the study of mugby junction as to neglect exercise on the contrary he took a walk every day and always the same walk but the weather turned cold and wet again and the window was never open iii at length after a lapse of some days there came another streak of fine bright hardy autumn weather it was a saturday the window was open and the children were gone not surprising this for he had patiently watched and waited at the corner until they were gone good day he said to the face absolutely getting his hat clear off his head this time good day to you sir i am glad you have a fine sky again to look at thank you sir it is kind if you you are an invalid i fear no sir i have very good health but are you not always lying down oh yes i am always lying down because i cannot sit up but i am not an invalid the laughing eyes seemed highly to enjoy his great mistake would you mind taking the trouble to come in sir there is a beautiful view from this window and you would see that i am not at all ill being so good as to care it was said to help him as he stood irresolute but evidently desiring to enter with his diffident hand on the latch of the garden gate it did help him and he went in the room upstairs was a very clean white room with a low roof its only inmate lay on a couch that brought her face to a level with the window the couch was white too and her simple dress or wrapper being light blue like the band around her hair she had an ethereal look and a fanciful appearance of lying among clouds he felt that she instinctively perceived him to be by habit a downcast taciturn man it was another help to him to have established that understanding so easily and got it over there was an awkward constraint upon him nevertheless as he touched her hand and took a chair at the side of her couch i see now he began not at all fluently how you occupy your hand only seeing you from the path outside i thought you were playing upon something she was engaged in very nimbly and dexterously making lace a lace pillow lay upon her breast and the quick movements and changes of her hands upon it as she worked had given them the action he had misinterpreted that is curious she answered with a bright smile for i often fancy myself that i play tunes while i am at work have you any musical knowledge she shook her head i think i could pick out tunes if i had any instrument which could be made as handy to me as my lace pillow but i dare say i deceive myself at all events i shall never know you have a musical voice excuse me i have heard you sing with the children she answered slightly colouring oh yes i sing with the dear children if it can be called singing barbox brothers glanced at the two small forms in the room and hazarded the speculation that she was fond of children and that she was learned in new systems of teaching them very fond of them she said shaking her head again but i know nothing of teaching beyond the interest i have in it and the pleasure it gives me when they learn perhaps your overhearing my little scholars sing some of their lessons has led you so far astray as to think me a grand teacher ah i thought so no i have only read and been told about that system it seemed so pretty and pleasant and to treat them so like the merry robins they are that i took up with it in my little way you don't need to be told what a very little way mine is sir she added with a glance at the small forms and round the room all this time her hands were busy at her lace pillow as they still continued so and as there was a kind of substitute for conversation in the click and play of its pegs barbox brothers took the opportunity of observing her he guessed her to be thirty the charm of her transparent face and large bright brown eyes was not that they were passively resigned but that they were actively and thoroughly cheerful even her busy hands which of their own thinness alone might have besought compassion plied their task with a gay courage that made mere compassion an unjustifiable assumption of superiority and an impertinence he saw her eyes in the act of rising towards his and he directed his towards the prospect saying beautiful indeed most beautiful sir i have sometimes had a fancy that i would like to sit up for once only to try how it looks to an erect head but what a foolish fancy that would be to encourage it cannot look more lovely to any one than it does to me her eyes were turned to it as she spoke with most delighted admiration and enjoyment there was not a trace in it of any sense of deprivation and those threads of railway with their puffs of smoke and steam changing places so fast make it so lively for me she went on i think of the number of people who can go where they wish on their business or their pleasure i remember that the puffs make signs to me that they are actually going while i look and that enlivens the prospect with abundance of company if i want company there is the great junction too i don't see it under the foot of the hill but i can very often hear it and i always know it is there it seems to join me in a way to i don't know how many places and things that i shall never see with an abashed kind of idea that it might have already joined himself to something he had never seen he said constrainedly just so and so you see sir pursued phoebe i am not the invalid you thought me and i am very well off indeed you have a happy disposition said barbox brothers perhaps with a slight excusatory touch for his own disposition ah but you should know my father she replied his is the happy disposition don't mind sir for his reserve took the alarm at a step upon the stairs and he distrusted that he would be set down for a troublesome intruder this is my father coming the door opened and the father paused there why lamps exclaimed barbox brothers starting from his chair how do you do lamps to which lamps responded the gentleman for nowhere how do you do sir and they shook hands to the greatest admiration and surprise of lamp's daughter i have looked you up half a dozen times since that night said barbox brothers but have never found you so i've heerd on sir so i've heerd on returned lamps it's your being noticed so often down at the junction without taking any train that has begun to get you the name among us of the gentleman for nowhere no offence in my having called you by it when took by surprise i hope sir none at all it's as good a name for me as any other you could call me by but may i ask you a question in the corner here lamps suffered himself to be led aside from his daughter's couch by one of the buttons of his velveteen jacket is this the bedside where you sing your songs lamps nodded the gentleman for nowhere clapped him on the shoulder and they faced about again upon my word my dear said lamps then to his daughter looking from her to her visitor it is such an amaze to me to find you brought acquainted with this gentleman that i must if this gentleman will excuse me take a rounder mr lamps demonstrated in action what this meant by pulling out his oily handkerchief rolled up in the form of a ball and giving himself an elaborate smear from behind the right ear up the cheek across the forehead and down the other cheek to behind his left ear after this operation he shone exceedingly it's according to my custom when particular warmed up by any agitation sir he offered by way of apology and really i am throwed into that state of amaze by finding you brought acquainted with phoebe that i that i think i will if you'll excuse me take another rounder which he did seeming to be greatly restored by it they were now both standing by the side of her couch and she was working at her lace pillow your daughter tells me said barbox brothers still in a half reluctant shamefaced way that she never sits up no sir nor never has done you see her mother who died when she was a year and two months old was subject to very bad fits and as she had never mentioned to me that she was subject to fits they couldn't be guarded against consequently she dropped the baby when took and this happened it was very wrong of her said barbox brothers with a knitted brow to marry you making a secret of her infirmity' well sir pleaded lamps in behalf of the long deceased you see phoebe and me we have talked that over too and lord bless us such a number on us has our infirmities what with fits and what with misfits of one sort and another that if we confessed to 'em all before we got married most of us might never get married might not that be for the better not in this case sir said phoebe giving her hand to her father no not in this case sir said her father patting it between his own you correct me returned barbox brothers with a blush and i must look so like a brute that at all events it would be superfluous in me to confess to that infirmity i wish you would tell me a little more about yourselves i hardly knew how to ask it of you for i am conscious that i have a bad stiff manner a dull discouraging way with me but i wish you would with all our hearts sir returned lamps gaily for both and first of all that you may know my name stay interposed the visitor with a slight flush what signifies your name lamps is name enough for me i like it it is bright and expressive what do i want more why to be sure sir returned lamps i have in general no other name down at the junction but i thought on account of your being here as a first class single in a private character that you might the visitor waved the thought away with his hand and lamps acknowledged the mark of confidence by taking another rounder you are hard worked i take for granted said barbox brothers when the subject of the rounder came out of it much dirtier than be went into it lamps was beginning not particular so when his daughter took him up oh yes sir he is very hard worked fourteen fifteen eighteen hours a day sometimes twenty four hours at a time and you said barbox brothers what with your school phoebe and what with your lace making but my school is a pleasure to me she interrupted opening her brown eyes wider as if surprised to find him so obtuse i began it when i was but a child because it brought me and other children into company don't you see that was not work i carry it on still because it keeps children about me that is not work i do it as love not as work then my lace pillow her busy hands had stopped as if her argument required all her cheerful earnestness but now went on again at the name it goes with my thoughts when i think and it goes with my tunes when i hum any and that's not work why you yourself thought it was music you know sir and so it is to me everything is cried lamps radiantly everything is music to her sir my father is at any rate said phoebe exultingly pointing her thin forefinger at him there is more music in my father than there is in a brass band i say my dear it's very fillyillially done you know but you are flattering your father he protested sparkling no i am not sir i assure you no i am not if you could hear my father sing you would know i am not but you never will hear him sing because he never sings to any one but me however tired he is he always sings to me when he comes home when i lay here long ago quite a poor little broken doll he used to sing to me more than that he used to make songs bringing in whatever little jokes we had between us more than that he often does so to this day oh i'll tell of you father as the gentleman has asked about you he is a poet sir i shouldn't wish the gentleman my dear observed lamps for the moment turning grave to carry away that opinion of your father because it might look as if i was given to asking the stars in a molloncolly manner what they was up to which i wouldn't at once waste the time and take the liberty my dear my father resumed phoebe amending her text is always on the bright side and the good side you told me just now i had a happy disposition how can i help it well but my dear returned lamps argumentatively how can i help it put it to yourself sir look at her always as you see her now always working and after all sir for but a very few shillings a week always contented always lively always interested in others of all sorts i said this moment she was always as you see her now so she is with a difference that comes to much the same for when it is my sunday off and the morning bells have done ringing i hear the prayers and thanks read in the touchingest way and i have the hymns sung to me so soft sir that you couldn't hear 'em out of this room in notes that seem to me i am sure to come from heaven and go back to it it might have been merely through the association of these words with their sacredly quiet time or it might have been through the larger association of the words with the redeemer's presence beside the bedridden but here her dexterous fingers came to a stop on the lace pillow and clasped themselves around his neck as he bent down there was great natural sensibility in both father and daughter the visitor could easily see but each made it for the other's sake retiring not demonstrative and perfect cheerfulness intuitive or acquired was either the first or second nature of both in a very few moments lamps was taking another rounder with his comical features beaming while phoebe's laughing eyes just a glistening speck or so upon their lashes were again directed by turns to him and to her work and to barbox brothers when my father sir she said brightly tells you about my being interested in other people even though they know nothing about me which by the bye i told you myself you ought to know how that comes about that's my father's doing no it isn't he protested don't you believe him sir yes it is he tells me of everything he sees down at his work you would be surprised what a quantity he gets together for me every day he looks into the carriages and tells me how the ladies are dressed so that i know all the fashions he looks into the carriages and tells me what pairs of lovers he sees and what new married couples on their wedding trip so that i know all about that he collects chance newspapers and books so that i have plenty to read he tells me about the sick people who are travelling to try to get better so that i know all about them in short as i began by saying he tells me everything he sees and makes out down at his work and you can't think what a quantity he does see and make out as to collecting newspapers and books my dear said lamps it's clear i can have no merit in that because they're not my perquisites you see sir it's this way a guard he'll say to me 'hallo here you are lamps i've saved this paper for your daughter how is she a going on' a head porter he'll say to me 'here catch hold lamps here's a couple of wollumes for your daughter is she pretty much where she were' and that's what makes it double welcome you see if she had a thousand pound in a box they wouldn't trouble themselves about her but being what she is that is you understand lamps added somewhat hurriedly not having a thousand pound in a box they take thought for her and as concerning the young pairs married and unmarried it's only natural i should bring home what little i can about them seeing that there's not a couple of either sort in the neighbourhood that don't come of their own accord to confide in phoebe she raised her eyes triumphantly to barbox brothers as she said indeed sir that is true if i could have got up and gone to church i don't know how often i should have been a bridesmaid but if i could have done that some girls in love might have been jealous of me and as it is no girl is jealous of me and my pillow would not have been half as ready to put the piece of cake under as i always find it she added turning her face on it with a light sigh and a smile at her father the arrival of a little girl the biggest of the scholars now led to an understanding on the part of barbox brothers that she was the domestic of the cottage and had come to take active measures in it attended by a pail that might have extinguished her and a broom three times her height he therefore rose to take his leave and took it saying that if phoebe had no objection he would come again he had muttered that he would come in the course of his walks the course of his walks must have been highly favourable to his return for he returned after an interval of a single day you thought you would never see me any more i suppose he said to phoebe as he touched her hand and sat down by her couch why should i think so was her surprised rejoinder i took it for granted you would mistrust me for granted sir have you been so much mistrusted i think i am justified in answering yes but i may have mistrusted too on my part no matter just now we were speaking of the junction last time i have passed hours there since the day before yesterday are you now the gentleman for somewhere she asked with a smile certainly for somewhere but i don't yet know where you would never guess what i am travelling from shall i tell you i am travelling from my birthday her hands stopped in her work and she looked at him with incredulous astonishment yes said barbox brothers not quite easy in his chair from my birthday i am to myself an unintelligible book with the earlier chapters all torn out and thrown away my childhood had no grace of childhood my youth had no charm of youth and what can be expected from such a lost beginning his eyes meeting hers as they were addressed intently to him something seemed to stir within his breast whispering was this bed a place for the graces of childhood and the charms of youth to take to kindly oh shame shame it is a disease with me said barbox brothers checking himself and making as though he had a difficulty in swallowing something to go wrong about that i don't know how i came to speak of that i hope it is because of an old misplaced confidence in one of your sex involving an old bitter treachery i don't know i am all wrong together her hands quietly and slowly resumed their work glancing at her he saw that her eyes were thoughtfully following them i am travelling from my birthday he resumed because it has always been a dreary day to me my first free birthday coming round some five or six weeks hence i am travelling to put its predecessors far behind me and to try to crush the day or at all events put it out of my sight by heaping new objects on it as he paused she looked at him but only shook her head as being quite at a loss this is unintelligible to your happy disposition he pursued abiding by his former phrase as if there were some lingering virtue of self defence in it i knew it would be and am glad it is however on this travel of mine in which i mean to pass the rest of my days having abandoned all thought of a fixed home i stopped as you have heard from your father at the junction here the extent of its ramifications quite confused me as to whither i should go from here i have not yet settled being still perplexed among so many roads what do you think i mean to do how many of the branching roads can you see from your window looking out full of interest she answered seven seven said barbox brothers watching her with a grave smile well i propose to myself at once to reduce the gross number to those very seven and gradually to fine them down to one the most promising for me and to take that but how will you know sir which is the most promising she asked with her brightened eyes roving over the view ah said barbox brothers with another grave smile and considerably improving in his ease of speech to be sure in this way where your father can pick up so much every day for a good purpose i may once and again pick up a little for an indifferent purpose the gentleman for nowhere must become still better known at the junction he shall continue to explore it until he attaches something that he has seen heard or found out at the head of each of the seven roads to the road itself and so his choice of a road shall be determined by his choice among his discoveries her hands still busy she again glanced at the prospect as if it comprehended something that had not been in it before and laughed as if it yielded her new pleasure but i must not forget said barbox brothers having got so far to ask a favour i want your help in this expedient of mine i want to bring you what i pick up at the heads of the seven roads that you lie here looking out at and to compare notes with you about it may i they say two heads are better than one i should say myself that probably depends upon the heads concerned but i am quite sure though we are so newly acquainted that your head and your father's have found out better things phoebe than ever mine of itself discovered she gave him her sympathetic right hand in perfect rapture with his proposal and eagerly and gratefully thanked him that's well said barbox brothers again i must not forget having got so far to ask a favour will you shut your eyes laughing playfully at the strange nature of the request she did so keep them shut said barbox brothers going softly to the door and coming back you are on your honour mind not to open you eyes until i tell you that you may yes on my honour good may i take your lace pillow from you for a minute still laughing and wondering she removed her hands from it and he put it aside tell me did you see the puffs of smoke and steam made by the morning fast train yesterday on road number seven from here behind the elm trees and the spire that's the road said barbox brothers directing his eyes towards it yes i watched them melt away anything unusual in what they expressed no she answered merrily not complimentary to me for i was in that train i went don't open your eyes to fetch you this from the great ingenious town it is not half so large as your lace pillow and lies easily and lightly in its place these little keys are like the keys of a miniature piano and you supply the air required with your left hand may you pick out delightful music from it my dear for the present you can open your eyes now good bye in his embarrassed way he closed the door upon himself and only saw in doing so that she ecstatically took the present to her bosom and caressed it the glimpse gladdened his heart and yet saddened it for so might she if her youth had flourished in its natural course having taken to her breast that day the slumbering music of her own child's voice chapter ii barbox brothers and co with good will and earnest purpose the gentleman for nowhere began on the very next day his researches at the heads of the seven roads the results of his researches as he and phoebe afterwards set them down in fair writing hold their due places in this veracious chronicle but they occupied a much longer time in the getting together than they ever will in the perusal and this is probably the case with most reading matter except when it is of that highly beneficial kind for posterity which is thrown off in a few moments of leisure by the superior poetic geniuses who scorn to take prose pains it must be admitted however that barbox by no means hurried himself his heart being in his work of good nature he revelled in it there was the joy too it was a true joy to him of sometimes sitting by listening to phoebe as she picked out more and more discourse from her musical instrument and as her natural taste and ear refined daily upon her first discoveries besides being a pleasure this was an occupation and in the course of weeks it consumed hours it resulted that his dreaded birthday was close upon him before he had troubled himself any more about it the matter was made more pressing by the unforeseen circumstance that the councils held at which mr lamps beaming most brilliantly on a few rare occasions assisted respecting the road to be selected were after all in nowise assisted by his investigations for he had connected this interest with this road or that interest with the other but could deduce no reason from it for giving any road the preference consequently when the last council was holden that part of the business stood in the end exactly where it had stood in the beginning but sir remarked phoebe we have only six roads after all is the seventh road dumb the seventh road oh said barbox brothers rubbing his chin that is the road i took you know when i went to get your little present that is its story phoebe would you mind taking that road again sir she asked with hesitation not in the least it is a great high road after all i should like you to take it returned phoebe with a persuasive smile for the love of that little present which must ever be so dear to me i should like you to take it because that road can never be again like any other road to me i should like you to take it in remembrance of your having done me so much good of your having made me so much happier if you leave me by the road you travelled when you went to do me this great kindness sounding a faint chord as she spoke i shall feel lying here watching at my window as if it must conduct you to a prosperous end and bring you back some day it shall be done my dear it shall be done so at last the gentleman for nowhere took a ticket for somewhere and his destination was the great ingenious town he had loitered so long about the junction that it was the eighteenth of december when he left it high time he reflected as he seated himself in the train that i started in earnest only one clear day remains between me and the day i am running away from i'll push onward for the hill country to morrow i'll go to wales it was with some pains that he placed before himself the undeniable advantages to be gained in the way of novel occupation for his senses from misty mountains swollen streams rain cold a wild seashore and rugged roads and yet he scarcely made them out as distinctly as he could have wished whether the poor girl in spite of her new resource her music would have any feeling of loneliness upon her now just at first that she had not had before whether she saw those very puffs of steam and smoke that he saw as he sat in the train thinking of her whether her face would have any pensive shadow on it as they died out of the distant view from her window whether in telling him he had done her so much good she had not unconsciously corrected his old moody bemoaning of his station in life by setting him thinking that a man might be a great healer if he would and yet not be a great doctor these and other similar meditations got between him and his welsh picture there was within him too that dull sense of vacuity which follows separation from an object of interest and cessation of a pleasant pursuit and this sense being quite new to him made him restless further in losing mugby junction he had found himself again and he was not the more enamoured of himself for having lately passed his time in better company but surely here not far ahead must be the great ingenious town this crashing and clashing that the train was undergoing and this coupling on to it of a multitude of new echoes could mean nothing less than approach to the great station it did mean nothing less after some stormy flashes of town lightning in the way of swift revelations of red brick blocks of houses high red brick chimney shafts vistas of red brick railway arches tongues of fire blocks of smoke valleys of canal and hills if coal there came the thundering in at the journey's end having seen his portmanteaus safely housed in the hotel he chose and having appointed his dinner hour barbox brothers went out for a walk in the busy streets and now it began to be suspected by him that mugby junction was a junction of many branches invisible as well as visible and had joined him to an endless number of by ways for whereas he would but a little while ago have walked these streets blindly brooding he now had eyes and thoughts for a new external world how the many toiling people lived and loved and died how wonderful it was to consider the various trainings of eye and hand the nice distinctions of sight and touch that separated them into classes of workers and even into classes of workers at subdivisions of one complete whole which combined their many intelligences and forces though of itself but some cheap object of use or ornament in common life how good it was to know that such assembling in a multitude on their part and such contribution of their several dexterities towards a civilising end did not deteriorate them as it was the fashion of the supercilious mayflies of humanity to pretend but engendered among them a self respect and yet a modest desire to be much wiser than they were the first evinced in their well balanced bearing and manner of speech when he stopped to ask a question the second in the announcements of their popular studies and amusements on the public walls these considerations and a host of such made his walk a memorable one i too am but a little part of a great whole he began to think and to be serviceable to myself and others or to be happy i must cast my interest into and draw it out of the common stock although he had arrived at his journey's end for the day by noon he had since insensibly walked about the town so far and so long that the lamp lighters were now at their work in the streets and the shops were sparkling up brilliantly thus reminded to turn towards his quarters he was in the act of doing so when a very little hand crept into his and a very little voice said oh if you please i am lost he looked down and saw a very little fair haired girl yes she said confirming her words with a serious nod i am indeed i am lost greatly perplexed he stopped looked about him for help descried none and said bending low where do you live my child i don't know where i live she returned i am lost what is your name polly what is your other name the reply was prompt but unintelligible imitating the sound as he caught it he hazarded the guess trivits oh no said the child shaking her head nothing like that say it again little one an unpromising business for this time it had quite a different sound he made the venture paddens oh no said the child nothing like that once more let us try it again dear a most hopeless business this time it swelled into four syllables it can't be tappitarver said barbox brothers rubbing his head with his hat in discomfiture no it ain't the child quietly assented on her trying this unfortunate name once more with extraordinary efforts at distinctness it swelled into eight syllables at least ah i think said barbox brothers with a desperate air of resignation that we had better give it up but i am lost said the child nestling her little hand more closely in his and you'll take care of me won't you if ever a man were disconcerted by division between compassion on the one hand and the very imbecility of irresolution on the other here the man was lost he repeated looking down at the child i am sure i am what is to be done where do you live asked the child looking up at him wistfully over there he answered pointing vaguely in the direction of his hotel hadn't we better go there said the child really he replied i don't know but what we had so they set off hand in hand he through comparison of himself against his little companion with a clumsy feeling on him as if he had just developed into a foolish giant she clearly elevated in her own tiny opinion by having got him so neatly out of his embarrassment we are going to have dinner when we get there i suppose said polly well he rejoined i yes i suppose we are do you like your dinner asked the child why on the whole said barbox brothers yes i think i do i do mine said polly have you any brothers and sisters no have you mine are dead oh said barbox brothers with that absurd sense of unwieldiness of mind and body weighing him down he would have not known how to pursue the conversation beyond this curt rejoinder but that the child was always ready for him what she asked turning her soft hand coaxingly in his are you going to do to amuse me after dinner upon my soul polly exclaimed barbox brothers very much at a loss i have not the slightest idea then i tell you what said polly have you got any cards at your house plenty said barbox brothers in a boastful vein very well then i'll build houses and you shall look at me you mustn't blow you know oh no said barbox brothers no no no no blowing blowing's not fair he flattered himself that he had said this pretty well for an idiotic monster but the child instantly perceiving the awkwardness of his attempt to adapt himself to her level utterly destroyed his hopeful opinion of himself by saying compassionately what a funny man you are feeling after this melancholy failure as if he every minute grew bigger and heavier in person and weaker in mind barbox gave himself up for a bad job no giant ever submitted more meekly to be led in triumph by all conquering jack than he to be bound in slavery to polly do you know any stories she asked him he was reduced to the humiliating confession no what a dunce you must be mustn't you said polly he was reduced to the humiliating confession yes would you like me to teach you a story but you must remember it you know and be able to tell it right to somebody else afterwards he professed that it would afford him the highest mental gratification to be taught a story and that he would humbly endeavour to retain it in his mind whereupon polly giving her hand a new little turn in his expressive of settling down for enjoyment commenced a long romance of which every relishing clause began with the words so this or and so this as so this boy or so this fairy or and so this pie was four yards round and two yards and a quarter deep the interest of the romance was derived from the intervention of this fairy to punish this boy for having a greedy appetite to achieve which purpose this fairy made this pie and this boy ate and ate and ate and his cheeks swelled and swelled and swelled there were many tributary circumstances but the forcible interest culminated in the total consumption of this pie and the bursting of this boy truly he was a fine sight barbox brothers with serious attentive face and ear bent down much jostled on the pavements of the busy town but afraid of losing a single incident of the epic lest he should be examined in it by and by and found deficient thus they arrived at the hotel and there he had to say at the bar and said awkwardly enough i have found a little girl the whole establishment turned out to look at the little girl nobody knew her nobody could make out her name as she set it forth except one chamber maid who said it was constantinople which it wasn't i will dine with my young friend in a private room said barbox brothers to the hotel authorities and perhaps you will be so good as to let the police know that the pretty baby is here i suppose she is sure to be inquired for soon if she has not been already come along polly perfectly at ease and peace polly came along but finding the stairs rather stiff work was carried up by barbox brothers the dinner was a most transcendant success and the barbox sheepishness under polly's directions how to mince her meat for her and how to diffuse gravy over the plate with a liberal and equal hand was another fine sight and now said polly while we are at dinner you be good and tell me that story i taught you with the tremors of a civil service examination upon him and very uncertain indeed not only as to the epoch at which the pie appeared in history but also as to the measurements of that indispensable fact barbox brothers made a shaky beginning but under encouragement did very fairly there was a want of breadth observable in his rendering of the cheeks as well as the appetite of the boy and there was a certain tameness in his fairy referable to an under current of desire to account for her still as the first lumbering performance of a good humoured monster it passed muster i told you to be good said polly and you are good ain't you i hope so replied barbox brothers such was his deference that polly elevated on a platform of sofa cushions in a chair at his right hand encouraged him with a pat or two on the face from the greasy bowl of her spoon and even with a gracious kiss in getting on her feet upon her chair however to give him this last reward she toppled forward among the dishes and caused him to exclaim as he effected her rescue gracious angels whew i thought we were in the fire polly what a coward you are ain't you said polly when replaced yes i am rather nervous he replied whew don't polly don't flourish your spoon or you'll go over sideways don't tilt up your legs when you laugh polly or you'll go over backwards whew polly polly polly said barbox brothers nearly succumbing to despair we are environed with dangers indeed he could descry no security from the pitfalls that were yawning for polly but in proposing to her after dinner to sit upon a low stool i will if you will said polly so as peace of mind should go before all he begged the waiter to wheel aside the table bring a pack of cards a couple of footstools and a screen and close in polly and himself before the fire as it were in a snug room within the room then finest sight of all was barbox brothers on his footstool with a pint decanter on the rug contemplating polly as she built successfully and growing blue in the face with holding his breath lest he should blow the house down how you stare don't you said polly in a houseless pause detected in the ignoble fact he felt obliged to admit apologetically i am afraid i was looking rather hard at you polly why do you stare asked polly i cannot he murmured to himself recall why i don't know polly you must be a simpleton to do things and not know why mustn't you said polly in spite of which reproof he looked at the child again intently as she bent her head over her card structure her rich curls shading her face it is impossible he thought that i can ever have seen this pretty baby before can i have dreamed of her in some sorrowful dream he could make nothing of it so he went into the building trade as a journeyman under polly and they built three stories high four stories high even five i say who do you think is coming asked polly rubbing her eyes after tea he guessed the waiter no said polly the dustman i am getting sleepy a new embarrassment for barbox brothers i don't think i am going to be fetched to night said polly what do you think he thought not either after another quarter of an hour the dustman not merely impending but actually arriving recourse was had to the constantinopolitan chamber maid who cheerily undertook that the child should sleep in a comfortable and wholesome room which she herself would share and i know you will be careful won't you said barbox brothers as a new fear dawned upon him that she don't fall out of bed polly found this so highly entertaining that she was under the necessity of clutching him round the neck with both arms as he sat on his footstool picking up the cards and rocking him to and fro with her dimpled chin on his shoulder oh what a coward you are ain't you said polly do you fall out of bed n not generally polly no more do i with that polly gave him a reassuring hug or two to keep him going and then giving that confiding mite of a hand of hers to be swallowed up in the hand of the constantinopolitan chamber maid trotted off chattering without a vestige of anxiety he looked after her had the screen removed and the table and chairs replaced and still looked after her he paced the room for half an hour a most engaging little creature but it's not that a most winning little voice but it's not that that has much to do with it but there is something more how can it be that i seem to know this child what was it she imperfectly recalled to me when i felt her touch in the street and looking down at her saw her looking up at me mr jackson with a start he turned towards the sound of the subdued voice and saw his answer standing at the door oh mr jackson do not be severe with me speak a word of encouragement to me i beseech you you are polly's mother yes yes polly herself might come to this one day as you see what the rose was in its faded leaves as you see what the summer growth of the woods was in their wintry branches so polly might be traced one day in a careworn woman like this with her hair turned grey before him were the ashes of a dead fire that had once burned bright this was the woman he had loved this was the woman he had lost such had been the constancy of his imagination to her so had time spared her under its withholding that now seeing how roughly the inexorable hand had struck her his soul was filled with pity and amazement he led her to a chair and stood leaning on a corner of the chimney piece with his head resting on his hand and his face half averted did you see me in the street and show me to your child he asked yes is the little creature then a party to deceit i hope there is no deceit i said to her 'we have lost our way and i must try to find mine by myself go to that gentleman and tell him you are lost you shall be fetched by and by' perhaps you have not thought how very young she is she is very self reliant perhaps because she is so young he asked after a short pause why did you do this oh mr jackson do you ask me in the hope that you might see something in my innocent child to soften your heart towards me not only towards me but towards my husband he suddenly turned about and walked to the opposite end of the room he came back again with a slower step and resumed his former attitude saying i thought you had emigrated to america we did but life went ill with us there and we came back do you live in this town yes i am a daily teacher of music here my husband is a book keeper are you forgive my asking poor we earn enough for our wants that is not our distress my husband is very very ill of a lingering disorder he will never recover you check yourself if it is for want of the encouraging word you spoke of take it from me i cannot forget the old time beatrice god bless you she replied with a burst of tears and gave him her trembling hand compose yourself i cannot be composed if you are not for to see you weep distresses me beyond expression speak freely to me trust me she shaded her face with her veil and after a little while spoke calmly her voice had the ring of polly's it is not that my husband's mind is at all impaired by his bodily suffering for i assure you that is not the case but in his weakness and in his knowledge that he is incurably ill he cannot overcome the ascendancy of one idea it preys upon him embitters every moment of his painful life and will shorten it she stopping he said again speak freely to me trust me we have had five children before this darling and they all lie in their little graves he believes that they have withered away under a curse and that it will blight this child like the rest under what curse both i and he have it on our conscience that we tried you very heavily and i do not know but that if i were as ill as he i might suffer in my mind as he does this is the constant burden 'i believe beatrice i was the only friend that mr jackson ever cared to make though i was so much his junior the more influence he acquired in the business the higher he advanced me and i was alone in his private confidence i came between him and you and i took you from him we were both secret and the blow fell when he was wholly unprepared the anguish it caused a man so compressed must have been terrible the wrath it awakened inappeasable so a curse came to be invoked on our poor pretty little flowers and they fall' and you beatrice he asked when she had ceased to speak and there had been a silence afterwards how say you until within these few weeks i was afraid of you and i believed that you would never never forgive until within these few weeks he repeated have you changed your opinion of me within these few weeks yes for what reason i was getting some pieces of music in a shop in this town when to my terror you came in as i veiled my face and stood in the dark end of the shop i heard you explain that you wanted a musical instrument for a bedridden girl your voice and manner were so softened you showed such interest in its selection you took it away yourself with so much tenderness of care and pleasure that i knew you were a man with a most gentle heart oh mr jackson mr jackson if you could have felt the refreshing rain of tears that followed for me was phoebe playing at that moment on her distant couch he seemed to hear her i inquired in the shop where you lived but could get no information as i had heard you say that you were going back by the next train but you did not say where i resolved to visit the station at about that time of day as often as i could between my lessons on the chance of seeing you again i have been there very often but saw you no more until to day you were meditating as you walked the street but the calm expression of your face emboldened me to send my child to you and when i saw you bend your head to speak tenderly to her i prayed to god to forgive me for having ever brought a sorrow on it i now pray to you to forgive me and to forgive my husband i was very young he was young too and in the ignorant hardihood of such a time of life we don't know what we do to those who have undergone more discipline you generous man you good man so to raise me up and make nothing of my crime against you for he would not see her on her knees and soothed her as a kind father might have soothed an erring daughter thank you bless you thank you when he next spoke it was after having drawn aside the window curtain and looked out awhile then he only said is polly asleep yes as i came in i met her going away upstairs and put her to bed myself leave her with me for to morrow beatrice and write me your address on this leaf of my pocket book in the evening i will bring her home to you and to her father hallo cried polly putting her saucy sunny face in at the door next morning when breakfast was ready i thought i was fetched last night so you were polly but i asked leave to keep you here for the day and to take you home in the evening upon my word said polly you are very cool ain't you however polly seemed to think it a good idea and added i suppose i must give you a kiss though you are cool the kiss given and taken they sat down to breakfast in a highly conversational tone of course you are going to amuse me said polly oh of course said barbox brothers in the pleasurable height of her anticipations polly found it indispensable to put down her piece of toast cross one of her little fat knees over the other and bring her little fat right hand down into her left hand with a business like slap after this gathering of herself together polly by that time a mere heap of dimples asked in a wheedling manner what are we going to do you dear old thing why i was thinking said barbox brothers but are you fond of horses polly ponies i am said polly especially when their tails are long but horses n no too big you know well pursued barbox brothers in a spirit of grave mysterious confidence adapted to the importance of the consultation i did see yesterday polly on the walls pictures of two long tailed ponies speckled all over no no no cried polly in an ecstatic desire to linger on the charming details not speckled all over speckled all over which ponies jump through hoops no no no cried polly as before they never jump through hoops yes they do oh i assure you they do and eat pie in pinafores ponies eating pie in pinafores said polly what a story teller you are ain't you upon my honour and fire off guns polly hardly seemed to see the force of the ponies resorting to fire arms and i was thinking pursued the exemplary barbox that if you and i were to go to the circus where these ponies are it would do our constitutions good does that mean amuse us inquired polly what long words you do use don't you apologetic for having wandered out of his depth he replied that means amuse us that is exactly what it means there are many other wonders besides the ponies and we shall see them all ladies and gentlemen in spangled dresses and elephants and lions and tigers polly became observant of the teapot with a curled up nose indicating some uneasiness of mind they never get out of course she remarked as a mere truism the elephants and lions and tigers oh dear no oh dear no said polly and of course nobody's afraid of the ponies shooting anybody not the least in the world no no not the least in the world said polly i was also thinking proceeded barbox that if we were to look in at the toy shop to choose a doll not dressed cried polly with a clap of her hands no no no not dressed full dressed together with a house and all things necessary for housekeeping polly gave a little scream and seemed in danger of falling into a swoon of bliss what a darling you are she languidly exclaimed leaning back in her chair come and be hugged or i must come and hug you this resplendent programme was carried into execution with the utmost rigour of the law it being essential to make the purchase of the doll its first feature or that lady would have lost the ponies the toy shop expedition took precedence polly in the magic warehouse with a doll as large as herself under each arm and a neat assortment of some twenty more on view upon the counter did indeed present a spectacle of indecision not quite compatible with unalloyed happiness but the light cloud passed the lovely specimen oftenest chosen oftenest rejected and finally abided by was of circassian descent possessing as much boldness of beauty as was reconcilable with extreme feebleness of mouth and combining a sky blue silk pelisse with rose coloured satin trousers and a black velvet hat which this fair stranger to our northern shores would seem to have founded on the portraits of the late duchess of kent the name this distinguished foreigner brought with her from beneath the glowing skies of a sunny clime was on polly's authority miss melluka and the costly nature of her outfit as a housekeeper from the barbox coffers may be inferred from the two facts that her silver tea spoons were as large as her kitchen poker and that the proportions of her watch exceeded those of her frying pan miss melluka was graciously pleased to express her entire approbation of the circus and so was polly for the ponies were speckled and brought down nobody when they fired and the savagery of the wild beasts appeared to be mere smoke which article in fact they did produce in large quantities from their insides the barbox absorption in the general subject throughout the realisation of these delights was again a sight to see nor was it less worthy to behold at dinner when he drank to miss melluka tied stiff in a chair opposite to polly the fair circassian possessing an unbendable spine and even induced the waiter to assist in carrying out with due decorum the prevailing glorious idea to wind up there came the agreeable fever of getting miss melluka and all her wardrobe and rich possessions into a fly with polly to be taken home but by that time polly had become unable to look upon such accumulated joys with waking eyes and had withdrawn her consciousness into the wonderful paradise of a child's sleep sleep polly sleep said barbox brothers as her head dropped on his shoulder you shall not fall out of this bed easily at any rate what rustling piece of paper he took from his pocket and carefully folded into the bosom of polly's frock shall not be mentioned he said nothing about it and nothing shall be said about it they drove to a modest suburb of the great ingenious town and stopped at the fore court of a small house do not wake the child said barbox brothers softly to the driver i will carry her in as she is greeting the light at the opened door which was held by polly's mother polly's bearer passed on with mother and child in to a ground floor room there stretched on a sofa lay a sick man sorely wasted who covered his eyes with his emaciated hand tresham said barbox in a kindly voice i have brought you back your polly fast asleep give me your hand and tell me you are better the sick man reached forth his right hand and bowed his head over the hand into which it was taken and kissed it thank you thank you i may say that i am well and happy that's brave said barbox tresham i have a fancy can you make room for me beside you here he sat down on the sofa as he said the words cherishing the plump peachey cheek that lay uppermost on his shoulder i have a fancy tresham i am getting quite an old fellow now you know and old fellows may take fancies into their heads sometimes to give up polly having found her to no one but you will you take her from me as the father held out his arms for the child each of the two men looked steadily at the other she is very dear to you tresham unutterably dear god bless her it is not much polly he continued turning his eyes upon her peaceful face as he apostrophized her it is not much polly for a blind and sinful man to invoke a blessing on something so far better than himself as a little child is but it would be much much upon his cruel head and much upon his guilty soul if he could be so wicked as to invoke a curse he had better have a millstone round his neck and be cast into the deepest sea live and thrive my pretty baby here he kissed her live and prosper and become in time the mother of other little children like the angels who behold the father's face he kissed her again gave her up gently to both her parents and went out but he went not to wales no he never went to wales he went straightway for another stroll about the town and he looked in upon the people at their work and at their play here there every there and where not for he was barbox brothers and co now and had taken thousands of partners into the solitary firm he had at length got back to his hotel room and was standing before his fire refreshing himself with a glass of hot drink which he had stood upon the chimney piece when he heard the town clocks striking and referring to his watch found the evening to have so slipped away that they were striking twelve as he put up his watch again his eyes met those of his reflection in the chimney glass why it's your birthday already he said smiling you are looking very well i wish you many happy returns of the day he had never before bestowed that wish upon himself by jupiter he discovered it alters the whole case of running away from one's birthday it's a thing to explain to phoebe besides here is quite a long story to tell her that has sprung out of the road with no story i'll go back instead of going on i'll go back by my friend lamps's up x presently he went back to mugby junction and in point of fact he established himself at mugby junction it was the convenient place to live in for brightening phoebe's life it was the convenient place to live in for having her taught music by beatrice it was the convenient place to live in for occasionally borrowing polly it was the convenient place to live in for being joined at will to all sorts of agreeable places and persons so he became settled there and his house standing in an elevated situation it is noteworthy of him in conclusion as polly herself might not irreverently have put it there was an old barbox who lived on a hill and if he ain't gone he lives there still here follows the substance of what was seen heard or otherwise picked up by the gentleman for nowhere in his careful study of the junction chapter iii the boy at mugby i am the boy at mugby that's about what i am you don't know what i mean what a pity but i think you do i think you must look here i am the boy at what is called the refreshment room at mugby junction and what's proudest boast is that it never yet refreshed a mortal being up in a corner of the down refreshment room at mugby junction in the height of twenty seven cross draughts i've often counted 'em while they brush the first class hair twenty seven ways behind the bottles among the glasses bounded on the nor'west by the beer stood pretty far to the right of a metallic object that's at times the tea urn and at times the soup tureen according to the nature of the last twang imparted to its contents which are the same groundwork fended off from the traveller by a barrier of stale sponge cakes erected atop of the counter and lastly exposed sideways to the glare of our missis's eye you ask a boy so sitiwated next time you stop in a hurry at mugby for anything to drink you take particular notice that he'll try to seem not to hear you that he'll appear in a absent manner to survey the line through a transparent medium composed of your head and body and that he won't serve you as long as you can possibly bear it that's me what a lark it is we are the model establishment we are at mugby other refreshment rooms send their imperfect young ladies up to be finished off by our missis for some of the young ladies when they're new to the business come into it mild ah our missis she soon takes that out of 'em why i originally come into the business meek myself but our missis she soon took that out of me what a delightful lark it is i look upon us refreshmenters as ockipying the only proudly independent footing on the line there's papers for instance my honourable friend if he will allow me to call him so him as belongs to smith's bookstall why he no more dares to be up to our refreshmenting games than he dares to jump a top of a locomotive with her steam at full pressure and cut away upon her alone driving himself at limited mail speed papers he'd get his head punched at every compartment first second and third the whole length of a train if he was to ventur to imitate my demeanour it's the same with the porters the same with the guards the same with the ticket clerks the same the whole way up to the secretary traffic manager or very chairman there ain't a one among 'em on the nobly independent footing we are did you ever catch one of them when you wanted anything of him making a system of surveying the line through a transparent medium composed of your head and body i should hope not you should see our bandolining room at mugby junction it's led to by the door behind the counter which you'll notice usually stands ajar and it's the room where our missis and our young ladies bandolines their hair you should see 'em at it betwixt trains bandolining away as if they was anointing themselves for the combat when you're telegraphed you should see their noses all a going up with scorn as if it was a part of the working of the same cooke and wheatstone electrical machinery you should hear our missis give the word here comes the beast to be fed and then you should see 'em indignantly skipping across the line from the up to the down or wicer warsaw and begin to pitch the stale pastry into the plates and chuck the sawdust sangwiches under the glass covers and get out the ha ha ha the sherry o my eye my eye for your refreshment it's only in the isle of the brave and land of the free by which of course i mean to say britannia that refreshmenting is so effective so 'olesome so constitutional a check upon the public there was a foreigner which having politely with his hat off beseeched our young ladies and our missis for a leetel gloss host prarndee and having had the line surveyed through him by all and no other acknowledgment was a proceeding at last to help himself as seems to be the custom in his own country when our missis with her hair almost a coming un bandolined with rage and her eyes omitting sparks flew at him cotched the decanter out of his hand and said put it down i won't allow that the foreigner turned pale stepped back with his arms stretched out in front of him his hands clasped and his shoulders riz and exclaimed ah is it possible this that these disdaineous females and this ferocious old woman are placed here by the administration not only to empoison the voyagers but to affront them great heaven how arrives it the english people or is he then a slave or idiot another time a merry wideawake american gent had tried the sawdust and spit it out and had tried the sherry and spit that out and had tried in vain to sustain exhausted natur upon butter scotch and had been rather extra bandolined and line surveyed through when as the bell was ringing and he paid our missis he says very loud and good tempered i tell yew what 'tis ma'arm i la'af theer i la'af i dew i oughter ha' seen most things for i hail from the onlimited side of the atlantic ocean and i haive travelled right slick over the limited head on through jeerusalemm and the east and likeways france and italy europe old world and am now upon the track to the chief europian village but such an institution as yew and yewer young ladies and yewer fixin's solid and liquid afore the glorious tarnal i never did see yet and if i hain't found the eighth wonder of monarchical creation in finding yew and yewer young ladies and yewer fixin's solid and liquid all as aforesaid established in a country where the people air not absolute loo naticks i am extra double darned with a nip and frizzle to the innermostest grit wheerfur theer i la'af i dew ma'arm i la'af and so he went stamping and shaking his sides along the platform all the way to his own compartment i think it was her standing up agin the foreigner as giv' our missis the idea of going over to france and droring a comparison betwixt refreshmenting as followed among the frog eaters and refreshmenting as triumphant in the isle of the brave and land of the free by which of course i mean to say agin britannia our young ladies miss whiff miss piff and mrs sniff was unanimous opposed to her going for as they says to our missis one and all it is well beknown to the hends of the herth as no other nation except britain has a idea of anythink but above all of business why then should you tire yourself to prove what is already proved our missis however being a teazer at all pints stood out grim obstinate and got a return pass by southeastern tidal to go right through if such should be her dispositions to marseilles sniff is husband to mrs sniff and is a regular insignificant cove he looks arter the sawdust department in a back room and is sometimes when we are very hard put to it let behind the counter with a corkscrew but never when it can be helped his demeanour towards the public being disgusting servile how mrs sniff ever come so far to lower herself as to marry him i don't know but i suppose he does and i should think he wished he didn't for he leads a awful life mrs sniff couldn't be much harder with him if he was public similarly miss whiff and miss piff taking the tone of mrs sniff they shoulder sniff about when he is let in with a corkscrew and they whisk things out of his hands when in his servility he is a going to let the public have 'em and they snap him up when in the crawling baseness of his spirit he is a going to answer a public question and they drore more tears into his eyes than ever the mustard does which he all day long lays on to the sawdust but it ain't strong once when sniff had the repulsiveness to reach across to get the milk pot to hand over for a baby i see our missis in her rage catch him by both his shoulders and spin him out into the bandolining room but mrs sniff how different she's the one she's the one as you'll notice to be always looking another way from you when you look at her she's the one with the small waist buckled in tight in front and with the lace cuffs at her wrists which she puts on the edge of the counter before her and stands a smoothing while the public foams this smoothing the cuffs and looking another way while the public foams is the last accomplishment taught to the young ladies as come to mugby to be finished by our missis and it's always taught by mrs sniff when our missis went away upon her journey mrs sniff was left in charge she did hold the public in check most beautiful in all my time i never see half so many cups of tea given without milk to people as wanted it with nor half so many cups of tea with milk given to people as wanted it without when foaming ensued mrs sniff would say then you'd better settle it among yourselves and change with one another it was a most highly delicious lark i enjoyed the refreshmenting business more than ever and was so glad i had took to it when young our missis returned it got circulated among the young ladies and it as it might be penetrated to me through the crevices of the bandolining room that she had orrors to reveal if revelations so contemptible could be dignified with the name agitation become awakened excitement was up in the stirrups expectation stood a tiptoe at length it was put forth that on our slacked evening in the week and at our slackest time of that evening betwixt trains our missis would give her views of foreign refreshmenting in the bandolining room it was arranged tasteful for the purpose the bandolining table and glass was hid in a corner a arm chair was elevated on a packing case for our missis's ockypation a table and a tumbler of water no sherry in it thankee was placed beside it two of the pupils the season being autumn and hollyhocks and dahlias being in ornamented the wall with three devices in those flowers on one might be read may albion never learn on another keep the public down on another our refreshmenting charter the whole had a beautiful appearance with which the beauty of the sentiments corresponded on our missis's brow was wrote severity as she ascended the fatal platform not that that was anythink new miss whiff and miss piff sat at her feet three chairs from the waiting room might have been perceived by a average eye in front of her on which the pupils was accommodated behind them a very close observer might have discerned a boy myself where said our missis glancing gloomily around is sniff i thought it better answered mrs sniff that he should not be let to come in he is such an ass no doubt assented our missis but for that reason is it not desirable to improve his mind oh nothing will ever improve him said mrs sniff however pursued our missis call him in ezekiel i called him in the appearance of the low minded cove was hailed with disapprobation from all sides on account of his having brought his corkscrew with him he pleaded the force of habit the force said mrs sniff don't let us have you talking about force for gracious' sake there do stand still where you are with your back against the wall he is a smiling piece of vacancy and he smiled in the mean way in which he will even smile at the public if he gets a chance language can say no meaner of him and he stood upright near the door with the back of his head agin the wall as if he was a waiting for somebody to come and measure his heighth for the army i should not enter ladies says our missis on the revolting disclosures i am about to make if it was not in the hope that they will cause you to be yet more implacable in the exercise of the power you wield in a constitutional country and yet more devoted to the constitutional motto which i see before me it was behind her but the words sounded better so 'may albion never learn' here the pupils as had made the motto admired it and cried hear hear hear sniff showing an inclination to join in chorus got himself frowned down by every brow the baseness of the french pursued our missis as displayed in the fawning nature of their refreshmenting equals if not surpasses anythink as was ever heard of the baseness of the celebrated bonaparte miss whiff miss piff and me we drored a heavy breath equal to saying we thought as much miss whiff and miss piff seeming to object to my droring mine along with theirs i drored another to aggravate 'em shall i be believed says our missis with flashing eyes when i tell you that no sooner had i set my foot upon that treacherous shore here sniff either bursting out mad or thinking aloud says in a low voice feet plural you know the cowering that come upon him when he was spurned by all eyes added to his being beneath contempt was sufficient punishment for a cove so grovelling in the midst of a silence rendered more impressive by the turned up female noses with which it was pervaded our missis went on shall i be believed when i tell you that no sooner had i landed this word with a killing look at sniff on that treacherous shore than i was ushered into a refreshment room where there were i do not exaggerate actually eatable things to eat a groan burst from the ladies i not only did myself the honour of jining but also of lengthening it out where there were our missis added not only eatable things to eat but also drinkable things to drink a murmur swelling almost into a scream ariz miss piff trembling with indignation called out name i will name said our missis there was roast fowls hot and cold there was smoking roast veal surrounded with browned potatoes there was hot soup with again i ask shall i be credited nothing bitter in it and no flour to choke off the consumer there was a variety of cold dishes set off with jelly there was salad there was mark me fresh pastry and that of a light construction there was a luscious show of fruit there was bottles and decanters of sound small wine of every size and adapted to every pocket the same odious statement will apply to brandy and these were set out upon the counter so that all could help themselves our missis's lips so quivered that mrs sniff though scarcely less convulsed than she were got up and held the tumbler to them this proceeds our missis was my first unconstitutional experience well would it have been if it had been my last and worst but no as i proceeded farther into that enslaved and ignorant land its aspect became more hideous i need not explain to this assembly the ingredients and formation of the british refreshment sangwich universal laughter except from sniff who as sangwich cutter shook his head in a state of the utmost dejection as he stood with it agin the wall well said our missis with dilated nostrils take a fresh crisp long crusty penny loaf made of the whitest and best flour cut it longwise through the middle insert a fair and nicely fitting slice of ham tie a smart piece of ribbon round the middle of the whole to bind it together add at one end a neat wrapper of clean white paper by which to hold it and the universal french refreshment sangwich busts on your disgusted vision a cry of shame from all except sniff which rubbed his stomach with a soothing hand i need not said our missis explain to this assembly the usual formation and fitting of the british refreshment room no no and laughter sniff agin shaking his head in low spirits agin the wall well said our missis what would you say to a general decoration of everythink to hangings sometimes elegant to easy velvet furniture to abundance of little tables to abundance of little seats to brisk bright waiters to great convenience to a pervading cleanliness and tastefulness positively addressing the public and making the beast thinking itself worth the pains contemptuous fury on the part of all the ladies mrs sniff looking as if she wanted somebody to hold her and everbody else looking as if they'd rayther not three times said our missis working herself into a truly terrimenjious state three times did i see these shameful things only between the coast and paris and not counting either at hazebroucke at arras at amiens but worse remains tell me what would you call a person who should propose in england that there should be kept say at our own model mugby junction pretty baskets each holding an assorted cold lunch and dessert for one each at a certain fixed price and each within a passenger's power to take away to empty in the carriage at perfect leisure and to return at another station fifty or a hundred miles farther on there was disagreement what such a person should be called whether revolutionise atheist bright i said him or un english miss piff screeched her shrill opinion last in the words a malignant maniac i adopt says our missis the brand set upon such a person by the righteous indignation of my friend miss piff a malignant maniac know then that that malignant maniac has sprung from the congenial soil of france and that his malignant madness was in unchecked action on this same part of my journey i noticed that sniff was a rubbing his hands and that mrs sniff had got her eye upon him but i did not take more particular notice owing to the excited state in which the young ladies was and to feeling myself called upon to keep it up with a howl on my experience south of paris said our missis in a deep tone i will not expatiate too loathsome were the task but fancy this fancy a guard coming round with the train at full speed to inquire how many for dinner fancy his telegraphing forward the number of dinners fancy every one expected and the table elegantly laid for the complete party fancy a charming dinner in a charming room and the head cook concerned for the honour of every dish superintending in his clean white jacket and cap fancy the beast travelling six hundred miles on end very fast and with great punctuality yet being taught to expect all this to be done for it a spirited chorus of the beast i noticed that sniff was agin a rubbing his stomach with a soothing hand and that he had drored up one leg but agin i didn't take particular notice looking on myself as called upon to stimulate public feeling it being a lark besides putting everything together said our missis french refreshmenting comes to this and oh it comes to a nice total first eatable things to eat and drinkable things to drink a groan from the young ladies kep' up by me second convenience and even elegance another groan from the young ladies kep' up by me third moderate charges this time a groan from me kep' up by the young ladies fourth and here says our missis i claim your angriest sympathy attention common civility nay even politeness me and the young ladies regularly raging mad all together and i cannot in conclusion says our missis with her spitefullest sneer give you a completer pictur of that despicable nation after what i have related than assuring you that they wouldn't bear our constitutional ways and noble independence at mugby junction for a single month and that they would turn us to the right about and put another system in our places as soon as look at us perhaps sooner for i do not believe they have the good taste to care to look at us twice the swelling tumult was arrested in its rise sniff bore away by his servile disposition had drored up his leg with a higher and a higher relish and was now discovered to be waving his corkscrew over his head it was at this moment that mrs sniff who had kep' her eye upon him like the fabled obelisk descended on her victim our missis followed them both out and cries was heard in the sawdust department you come into the down refreshment room at the junction making believe you don't know me and i'll pint you out with my right thumb over my shoulder which is our missis and which is miss whiff and which is miss piff and which is mrs sniff but you won't get a chance to see sniff because he disappeared that night whether he perished tore to pieces i cannot say but his corkscrew alone remains to bear witness to the servility of his disposition
