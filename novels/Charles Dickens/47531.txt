iii london richard bentley new burlington street whiting beaufort house oliver twist chapter xxxvii containing an account of what passed between mr and mrs bumble and monks at their nocturnal interview it was a dull close overcast summer evening when the clouds which had been threatening all day spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour already yielded large drops of rain and seemed to presage a violent thunderstormas mr and mrs bumble turning out of the main street of the town directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses distant from it some mile and ahalf or thereabouts and erected on a low unwholesome swamp bordering upon the river they were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments which might perhaps serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain and sheltering them from observation the husband carried a lantern from which however no light yet shone and trudged on a few paces in front as thoughthe way being dirtyto give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints they went on in profound silence every now and then mr bumble relaxed his pace and turned his head round as if to make sure that his helpmate was following and discovering that she was close at his heels mended his rate of walking and proceeded at a considerable increase of speed towards their place of destination this was far from being a place of doubtful character for it had long been known as the residence of none but low and desperate ruffians who under various pretences of living by their labour subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime it was a collection of mere hovels some hastily built with loose bricks and others of old wormeaten ship timber jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement and planted for the most part within a few feet of the rivers bank a few leaky boats drawn up on the mud and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it and here and there an oar or coil of rope appeared at first to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed would have led a passerby without much difficulty to the conjecture that they were disposed there rather for the preservation of appearances than with any view to their being actually employed in the heart of this cluster of huts and skirting the river which its upper stories overhung stood a large building formerly used as a manufactory of some kind and which had in its day probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements but it had long since gone to ruin the rat the worm and the action of the damp had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water beneath while the remainder tottering and bending over the dark stream seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion and involving itself in the same fate it was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air and the rain commenced pouring violently down the place should be somewhere here said bumble consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand halloa there cried a voice from above following the sound bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door breasthigh on the second story stand still a minute cried the voice ill be with you directly with which the head disappeared and the door closed is that the man asked mr bumbles good lady mr bumble nodded in the affirmative then mind what i told you said the matron and be careful to say as little as you can or youll betray us at once mr bumble who had eyed the building with very rueful looks was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any farther with the enterprise just then when he was prevented by the appearance of monks who opened a small door near which they stood and beckoned them inwards come he cried impatiently stamping his foot upon the ground dont keep me here the woman who had hesitated at first walked boldly in without any further invitation and mr bumble who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind followed obviously very ill at his ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic what the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet said monks turning round and addressing bumble after he had bolted the door behind them wewe were only cooling ourselves stammered bumble looking apprehensively about him cooling yourselves retorted monks not all the rain that ever fell or ever will fall will put as much of hells fire out as a man can carry about with him you wont cool yourself so easily dont think it with this agreeable speech monks turned short upon the matron and bent his fierce gaze upon her till even she who was not easily cowed was fain to withdraw her eyes and turn them towards the ground this is the woman is it demanded monks hem that is the woman replied mr bumble mindful of his wifes caution you think women never can keep secrets i suppose said the matron interposing and returning as she spoke the searching look of monks i know they will always keep one till its found out said monks contemptuously and what may that be asked the matron in the same tone the loss of their own good name replied monks so by the same rule if a womans a party to a secret that might hang or transport her im not afraid of her telling it to any body not i do you understand me no rejoined the matron slightly colouring as she spoke of course you dont said monks ironically how should you bestowing something halfway between a sneer and a scowl upon his two companions and again beckoning them to follow him the man hastened across the apartment which was of considerable extent but low in the roof and was preparing to ascend a steep staircase or rather ladder leading to another floor of warehouses above when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture and a peal of thunder followed which shook the crazy building to its centre hear it he cried shrinking back hear it rolling and crashing away as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils are hiding from it fire the sound i hate it he remained silent for a few moments and then removing his hands suddenly from his face showed to the unspeakable discomposure of mr bumble that it was much distorted and nearly blank these fits come over me now and then said monks observing his alarm and thunder sometimes brings them on dont mind me now its all over for this once thus speaking he led the way up the ladder and hastily closing the windowshutter of the room into which it led lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it now said monks when they had all three seated themselves the sooner we come to our business the better for all the woman knows what it is does she the question was addressed to bumble but his wife anticipated the reply by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it he is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died and that she told you something about the mother of the boy you named replied the matron interrupting him yes the first question is of what nature was her communication said monks thats the second observed the woman with much deliberation the first is what may the communication be worth who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is asked monks nobody better than you i am persuaded answered mrs bumble who did not want for spirit as her yokefellow could abundantly testify humph said monks significantly and with a look of eager inquiry there may be moneys worth to get eh perhaps there may was the composed reply something that was taken from her said monks eagerly something that she woresomething that you had better bid interrupted mrs bumble i have heard enough already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to mr bumble who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes which he directed towards his wife and monks by turns in undisguised astonishment increased if possible when the latter sternly demanded what sum was required for the disclosure whats it worth to you asked the woman as collectedly as before it may be nothing it may be twenty pounds replied monks speak out and let me know which add five pounds to the sum you have named give me fiveandtwenty pounds in gold said the woman and ill tell you all i knownot before fiveandtwenty pounds exclaimed monks drawing back i spoke as plainly as i could replied mrs bumble and its not a large sum either not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when its told cried monks impatiently and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value in course of time answered the matron still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed as to lying dead there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for any thing you or i know who will tell strange tales at last what if i pay it for nothing asked monks hesitating you can easily take it away again replied the matron i am but a woman alone here and unprotected not alone my dear nor unprotected neither submitted mr bumble in a voice tremulous with fear i am here my dear and besides said mr bumble his teeth chattering as he spoke mr monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on parochial persons mr monks is aware that i am not a young man my dear and also that i am a little run to seed as i may say but he has heerdi say i have no doubt mr monks has heerd my dearthat i am a very determined officer with very uncommon strength if im once roused i only want a little rousing thats all as mr bumble spoke he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination and plainly showed by the alarmed expression of every feature that he did want a little rousing and not a little prior to making any very warlike demonstration unless indeed against paupers or other person or persons trained down for the purpose you are a fool said mrs bumble in reply and had better hold your tongue he had better have cut it out before he came if he cant speak in a lower tone said monks grimly so hes your husband eh he my husband tittered the matron parrying the question i thought as much when you came in rejoined monks marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke so much the better i have less hesitation in dealing with two people when i find that theres only one will between them im in earnestsee here he thrust his hand into a sidepocket and producing a canvass bag told out twentyfive sovereigns on the table and pushed them over to the woman now he said gather them up and when this cursed peal of thunder that i feel is coming up to break over the housetop is gone lets hear your story the roar of thunder which seemed in fact much nearer and to shiver and break almost over their heads having subsided monks raising his face from the table bent forward to listen to what the woman should say the faces of the three nearly touched as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible the sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances which encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness looked ghastly in the extreme when this woman that we called old sally died the matron began she and i were alone was there no one by asked monks in the same hollow whisper no sick wretch or idiot in some other bedno one who could hear and might by possibility understand not a soul replied the woman we were alone i stood alone beside the body when death came over it good said monks regarding her attentively go on she spoke of a young creature resumed the matron who had brought a child into the world some years before not merely in the same room but in the same bed in which she then lay dying ay said monks with quivering lip and glancing over his shoulder blood how things come about at last the child was the one you named to him last night said the matron nodding carelessly towards her husband the mother this nurse had robbed in life asked monks in death replied the woman with something like a shudder she stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the infants sake she sold it cried monks with desperate eagerness did she sell itwherewhento whomhow long before as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this said the matron she fell back and died without saying more cried monks in a voice which from its very suppression seemed only the more furious its a lie ill not be played with she said moreill tear the life out of you both but ill know what it was she didnt utter another word said the woman to all appearance unmoved as mr bumble was very far from being by the strange mans violence but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which was partly closed and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper which contained interposed monks stretching forward nothing replied the woman it was a pawnbrokers duplicate for what demanded monks in good time ill tell you said the woman i judge that she had kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better account and then pawned it and saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbrokers interest year by year and prevent its running out so that if any thing came of it it could still be redeemed nothing had come of it and as i tell you she died with the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand the time was out in two days i thought something might one day come of it too and so redeemed the pledge where is it now asked monks quickly there replied the woman and as if glad to be relieved of it she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a french watch which monks pouncing upon tore open with trembling hands it contained a little gold locket in which were two locks of hair and a plain gold weddingring it has the word agnes engraved on the inside said the woman there is a blank left for the surname and then follows the date which is within a year before the child was born i found out that and this is all said monks after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet all replied the woman mr bumble drew a long breath as if he were glad to find that the story was over and no mention made of taking the fiveandtwenty pounds back again and now took courage to wipe off the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose unchecked during the whole of the previous conversation i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at said his wife addressing monks after a short silence and i want to know nothing for its safer not but i may ask you two questions may i you may ask said monks with some show of surprise but whether i answer or not is another question which makes three observed mr bumble essaying a stroke of facetiousness is that what you expected to get from me demanded the matron it is replied monks the other question what you propose to do with it can it be used against me never rejoined monks nor against me either see here but dont move a step forward or your lifes not worth a bulrush with these words he suddenly wheeled the table aside and pulling an iron ring in the boarding threw back a large trapdoor which opened close at mr bumbles feet and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward with great precipitation look down said monks lowering the lantern into the gulf dont fear me i could have let you down quietly enough when you were seated over it if that had been my game thus encouraged the matron drew near to the brink and even mr bumble himself impelled by curiosity ventured to do the same the turbid water swollen by the heavy rain was rushing rapidly on below and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles there had once been a watermill beneath and the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes and fragments of machinery that yet remained seemed to dart onward with a new impulse when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course if you flung a mans body down there where would it be tomorrow morning said monks swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides replied bumble recoiling at the very notion monks drew the little packet from his breast into which he had hurriedly thrust it and tying it firmly to a leaden weight which had formed a part of some pulley and was lying on the floor dropped it into the stream it fell straight and true as a die clove the water with a scarcely audible splash and was gone illustration the evidence destroyed the three looked into each others faces and seemed to breathe more freely there said monks closing the trapdoor which fell heavily back into its former position if the sea ever gives up its deadas books say it willit will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash among it we have nothing more to say and may break up our pleasant party by all means observed mr bumble with great alacrity youll keep a quiet tongue in your head will you said monks with a threatening look i am not afraid of your wife you may depend upon me young man answered mr bumble bowing himself gradually towards the ladder with excessive politeness on every bodys account young man on my own you know mr monks i am glad for your sake to hear it remarked monks light your lantern and get away from here as fast as you can it was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point or mr bumble who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below he lighted his lantern from that which monks had detached from the rope and now carried in his hand and making no effort to prolong the discourse descended in silence followed by his wife monks brought up the rear after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without and the rushing of the water they traversed the lower room slowly and with caution for monks started at every shadow and mr bumble holding his lantern a foot above the ground walked not only with remarkable care but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure looking nervously about him for hidden trapdoors the gate at which they had entered was softly unfastened and opened by monks and merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside they were no sooner gone than monks who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below and bidding him go first and bear the light returned to the chamber he had just quitted chapter xxxviii introduces some respectable characters with whom the reader is already acquainted and shows how monks and the jew laid their worthy heads together it was about two hours earlier on the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated when mr william sikes awakening from a nap drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was the room in which mr sikes propounded this question was not one of those he had tenanted previous to the chertsey expedition although it was in the same quarter of the town and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings it was not in appearance so desirable a habitation as his old quarters being a mean and badlyfurnished apartment of very limited size lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof and abutting upon a close and dirty lane nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentlemans having gone down in the world of late for a great scarcity of furniture and total absence of comfort together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen bespoke a state of extreme poverty while the meager and attenuated condition of mr sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms if they had stood in need of corroboration the housebreaker was lying on the bed wrapped in his white greatcoat by way of dressinggown and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness and the addition of a soiled nightcap and a stiff black beard of a weeks growth the dog sat at the bedside now eyeing his master with a wistful look and now pricking his ears and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street or in the lower part of the house attracted his attention seated by the window busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robbers ordinary dress was a female so pale and reduced with watching and privation that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same nancy who has already figured in this tale but for the voice in which she replied to mr sikess question not long gone seven said the girl how do you feel tonight bill as weak as water replied mr sikes with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs here lend us a hand and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow illness had not improved mr sikess temper for as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair he muttered various curses upon her awkwardness and struck her whining are you said sikes come dont stand snivelling there if you cant do any thing better than that cut off altogether dye hear me i hear you replied the girl turning her face aside and forcing a laugh what fancy have you got in your head now oh youve thought better of it have you growled sikes marking the tear which trembled in her eye all the better for you you have why you dont mean to say youd be hard upon me tonight bill said the girl laying her hand upon his shoulder no cried mr sikes why not such a number of nights said the girl with a touch of womans tenderness which communicated something like sweetness of tone even to her voicesuch a number of nights as ive been patient with you nursing and caring for you as if you had been a child and this the first that ive seen you like yourself you wouldnt have served me as you did just now if youd thought of that would you come come say you wouldnt well then rejoined mr sikes i wouldnt why damme now the girls whining again illustration mr fagin and his pupil recovering nancy its nothing said the girl throwing herself into a chair dont you seem to mind me and itll soon be over whatll be over demanded mr sikes in a savage voice what foolery are you up to now again get up and bustle about and dont come over me with your womans nonsense at any other time this remonstrance and the tone in which it was delivered would have had the desired effect but the girl being really weak and exhausted dropped her head over the back of the chair and fainted before mr sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which on similar occasions he was accustomed to garnish his threats not knowing very well what to do in this uncommon emergency for miss nancys hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of without much assistance mr sikes tried a little blasphemy and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual called for assistance whats the matter here my dear said the jew looking in lend a hand to the girl cant you replied sikes impatiently and dont stand chattering and grinning at me with an exclamation of surprise fagin hastened to the girls assistance while mr john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger who had followed his venerable friend into the room hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden and snatching a bottle from the grasp of master charles bates who came close at his heels uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth and poured a portion of its contents down the patients throat previously taking a taste himself to prevent mistakes give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows charley said mr dawkins and you slap her hands fagin while bill undoes the petticuts these united restoratives administered with great energy especially that department consigned to master bates who appeared to consider his share in the proceeding a piece of unexampled pleasantry were not long in producing the desired effect the girl gradually recovered her senses and staggering to a chair by the bedside hid her face upon the pillow leaving mr sikes to confront the newcomers in some astonishment at their unlookedfor appearance why what evil wind has blowed you here he asked of fagin no evil wind at all my dear replied the jew for ill winds blow nobody any good and ive brought something good with me that youll be glad to see dodger my dear open the bundle and give bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on this morning in compliance with mr fagins request the artful untied his bundle which was of large size and formed of an old tablecloth and handed the articles it contained one by one to charley bates who placed them on the table with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence sitch a rabbit pie bill exclaimed that young gentleman disclosing to view a huge pasty sitch delicate creeturs with sitch tender limbs bill that the wery bones melt in your mouth and theres no occasion to pick em half a pound of seven and sixpenny green so precious strong that if you mix it with boiling water itll go nigh to blow the lid of the teapot off a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didnt work at all at afore they got it to sitch a pitch of goodnessoh no two halfquartern brans pound of best fresh piece of double gloster and to wind up all some of the richest sort you ever lushed uttering this last panegyric master bates produced from one of his extensive pockets a fullsized winebottle carefully corked while mr dawkins at the same instant poured out a wine glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moments hesitation ah said the jew rubbing his hands with great satisfaction youll do bill youll do now do exclaimed mr sikes i might have been done for twenty times over afore youd have done any thing to help me what do you mean by leaving a man in this state three weeks and more you falsehearted wagabond only hear him boys said the jew shrugging his shoulders and us come to bring him all these beautiful things the things is well enough in their way observed mr sikes a little soothed as he glanced over the table but what have you got to say for yourself why you should leave me here down in the mouth health blunt and every thing else and take no more notice of me all this mortal time than if i was that ere dogdrive him down charley i never see such a jolly dog as that cried master bates doing as he was desired smelling the grub like a old lady agoing to market hed make his fortun on the stage that dog would and rewive the drayma besides hold your din cried sikes as the dog retreated under the bed still growling angrily and what have you got to say for yourself you withered old fence eh i was away from london a week and more my dear on a plant replied the jew and what about the other fortnight demanded sikes what about the other fortnight that youve left me lying here like a sick rat in his hole i couldnt help it bill replied the jew i cant go into a long explanation before company but i couldnt help it upon my honour upon your what growled sikes with excessive disgust here cut me off a piece of the pie one of you boys to take the taste of that out of my mouth or itll choke me dead dont be out of temper my dear urged the jew submissively i have never forgot you bill never once no ill pound it that you hant replied sikes with a bitter grin youve been scheming and plotting away every hour that ive laid shivering and burning here and bill was to do this and bill was to do that and bill was to do it all dirt cheap as soon as he got well and was quite poor enough for your work if it hadnt been for the girl i might have died there now bill remonstrated the jew eagerly catching at the word if it hadnt been for the girl who was the means of your having such a handy girl about you but me he says true enough there god knows said nancy coming hastily forward let him be let him be nancys appearance gave a new turn to the conversation for the boys receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew began to ply her with liquor of which however she partook very sparingly while fagin assuming an unusual flow of spirits gradually brought mr sikes into a better temper by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter and moreover laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes which after repeated applications to the spiritbottle he condescended to make its all very well said mr sikes but i must have some blunt from you tonight i havent a piece of coin about me replied the jew then youve got lots at home retorted sikes and i must have some from there lots cried the jew holding up his hands i havent so much as would i dont know how much youve got and i dare say you hardly know yourself as it would take a pretty long time to count it said sikes but i must have some tonight and thats flat well well said the jew with a sigh ill send the artful round presently you wont do nothing of the kind rejoined mr sikes the artfuls a deal too artful and would forget to come or lose his way or get dodged by traps and so be perwented or any thing for an excuse if you put him up to it nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it to make all sure and ill lie down and have a snooze while shes gone after a great deal of haggling and squabbling the jew beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteenpence to keep house with mr sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldnt get any more he must be content with that nancy prepared to accompany him home while the dodger and master bates put the eatables in the cupboard the jew then taking leave of his affectionate friend returned homewards attended by nancy and the boys mr sikes meanwhile flinging himself on the bed and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young ladys return in due time they arrived at the jews abode where they found toby crackit and mr chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost and with it his fifteenth and last sixpence much to the amusement of his young friends mr crackit apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments yawned and inquiring after sikes took up his hat to go has nobody been toby asked the jew not a living leg answered mr crackit pulling up his collar its been as dull as swipes you ought to stand something handsome fagin to recompense me for keeping house so long damme im as flat as a juryman and should have gone to sleep as fast as newgate if i hadnt had the good natur to amuse this youngster horrid dull im blessed if i ant with these and other ejaculations of the same kind mr toby crackit swept up his winnings and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure and swaggered out of the room with so much elegance and gentility that mr chitling bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview and that he didnt value his losses the snap of a little finger wot a rum chap you are tom said master bates highly amused by this declaration not a bit of it replied mr chitling am i fagin a very clever fellow my dear said the jew patting him on the shoulder and winking to his other pupils and mr crackit is a heavy swell ant he fagin asked tom no doubt at all of that my dear replied the jew and it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance ant it fagin pursued tom very much so indeed my dear replied the jew theyre only jealous tom because he wont give it to them ah cried tom triumphantly thats where it is he has cleaned me out but i can go and earn some more when i likecant i fagin to be sure you can replied the jew and the sooner you go the better tom so make up your loss at once and dont lose any more time dodger charley its time you were on the laycome its near ten and nothing done yet in obedience to this hint the boys nodding to nancy took up their hats and left the room the dodger and his vivacious friend indulging as they went in many witticisms at the expense of mr chitling in whose conduct it is but justice to say there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town who pay a much higher price than mr chitling for being seen in good society and a great number of fine gentlemen composing the good society aforesaid who establish their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash toby crackit now said the jew when they had left the room ill go and get you that cash nancy this is only the key of a little cupboard where i keep a few odd things the boys get my dear i never lock up my money for ive got none to lock up my dearha ha hanone to lock its a poor trade nancy and no thanks but im fond of seeing the young people about me and i bear it all i bear it all hush he said hastily concealing the key in his breast whos that listen the girl who was sitting at the table with her arms folded appeared in no way interested in the arrival or to care whether the person whoever he was came or went until the murmur of a mans voice reached her ears the instant she caught the sound she tore off her bonnet and shawl with the rapidity of lightning and thrust them under the table the jew turning round immediately afterwards she muttered a complaint of the heat in a tone of languor that contrasted very remarkably with the extreme haste and violence of this action which however had been unobserved by fagin who had his back towards her at the time bah whispered the jew as though nettled by the interruption its the man i expected before hes coming down stairs not a word about the money while hes here nance he wont stop longnot ten minutes my dear laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip the jew carried a candle to the door as a mans step was heard upon the stairs without and reached it at the same moment as the visiter who coming hastily into the room was close upon the girl before he observed her it was monks only one of my young people said the jew observing that monks drew back on beholding a stranger dont move nancy the girl drew closer to the table and glancing at monks with an air of careless levity withdrew her eyes but as he turned his towards the jew she stole another look so keen and searching and full of purpose that if there had been any bystander to observe the change he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person any news inquired the jew great andandgood asked the jew hesitatingly as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine not bad any way replied monks with a smile i have been prompt enough this time let me have a word with you the girl drew closer to the table and made no offer to leave the room although she could see that monks was pointing to her the jewperhaps fearing that she might say something aloud about the money if he endeavoured to get rid of herpointed upwards and took monks out of the room not that infernal hole we were in before she could hear the man say as they went up stairs the jew laughed and making some reply which did not reach her seemed by the creaking of the boards to lead his companion to the second story before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house the girl had slipped off her shoes and drawing her gown loosely over her head and muffling her arms in it stood at the door listening with breathless interest the moment the noise ceased she glided from the room ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence and was lost in the gloom above the room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread and immediately afterwards the two men were heard descending monks went at once into the street and the jew crawled up stairs again for the money when he returned the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet as if preparing to be gone why nance exclaimed the jew starting back as he put down the candle how pale you are pale echoed the girl shading her eyes with her hands as if to look steadily at him quite horrible said the jew what have you been doing to yourself nothing that i know of except sitting in this close place for i dont know how long and all replied the girl carelessly come let me get back thats a dear with a sigh for every piece of money fagin told the amount into her hand and they parted without more conversation than interchanging a goodnight when the girl got into the open street she sat down upon a doorstep and seemed for a few moments wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way suddenly she arose and hurrying on in a direction quite opposite to that in which sikes was awaiting her return quickened her pace until it gradually resolved into a violent run after completely exhausting herself she stopped to take breath and as if suddenly recollecting herself and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon wrung her hands and burst into tears it might be that her tears relieved her or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition but she turned back and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction partly to recover lost time and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker if she betrayed any agitation by the time she presented herself to mr sikes he did not observe it for merely inquiring if she had brought the money and receiving a reply in the affirmative he uttered a growl of satisfaction and replacing his head upon his pillow resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted chapter xxxix a strange interview which is a sequel to the last chapter it was fortunate for the girl that the possession of money occasioned mr sikes so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment that she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon would have been obvious to his lynxeyed friend the jew who would most probably have taken the alarm at once but mr sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards every body and being furthermore in an unusually amiable condition as has been already observed saw nothing unusual in her demeanour and indeed troubled himself so little about her that had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions as the day closed in the girls excitement increased and when night came on and she sat by watching till the housebreaker should drink himself asleep there was an unusual paleness in her cheek and fire in her eye that even sikes observed with astonishment mr sikes being weak from the fever was lying in bed taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory and had pushed his glass towards nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time when these symptoms first struck him why burn my body said the man raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face you look like a corpse come to life again whats the matter matter replied the girl nothing what do you look at me so hard for what foolery is this demanded sikes grasping her by the arm and shaking her roughly what is it what do you mean what are you thinking of ha of many things bill replied the girl shuddering and as she did so pressing her hands upon her eyes but lord what odds in that the tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken seemed to produce a deeper impression on sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them i tell you wot it is said sikes if you havent caught the fever and got it comin on now theres something more than usual in the wind and something dangerous too youre not agoing to no damme you wouldnt do that do what asked the girl there aint said sikes fixing his eyes upon her and muttering the words to himself there aint a stauncherhearted gal going or id have cut her throat three months ago shes got the fever coming on thats it fortifying himself with this assurance sikes drained the glass to the bottom and then with many grumbling oaths called for his physic the girl jumped up with great alacrity poured it quickly out but with her back towards him and held the vessel to his lips while he drank it off now said the robber come and sit aside of me and put on your own face or ill alter it so that you wont know it again when you do want it the girl obeyed and sikes locking her hand in his fell back upon the pillow turning his eyes upon her face they closed opened again closed once more again opened the housebreaker shifted his position restlessly and after dozing again and again for two or three minutes and as often springing up with a look of terror and gazing vacantly about him was suddenly stricken as it were while in the very attitude of rising into a deep and heavy sleep the grasp of his hand relaxed the upraised arm fell languidly by his side and he lay like one in a profound trance the laudanum has taken effect at last murmured the girl as she rose from the bedside i may be too late even now she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl looking fearfully round from time to time as if despite the sleeping draught she expected every moment to feel the pressure of sikess heavy hand upon her shoulder then stooping softly over the bed she kissed the robbers lips and opening and closing the roomdoor with noiseless touch hurried from the house a watchman was crying halfpast nine down a dark passage through which she had to pass in gaining the main thoroughfare has it long gone the halfhour asked the girl itll strike the hour in another quarter said the man raising his lantern to her face and i cannot get there in less than an hour or more muttered nancy brushing swiftly past him and gliding rapidly down the street many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way in making from spitalfields towards the westend of london the clock struck ten increasing her impatience she tore along the narrow pavement elbowing the passengers from side to side and darting almost under the horses heads crossed crowded streets where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like the woman is mad said the people turning to look after her as she rushed away when she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town the streets were comparatively deserted and here her headlong progress seemed to excite a greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past some quickened their pace behind as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate and a few made head upon her and looked back surprised at her undiminished speed but they fell off one by one and when she neared her place of destination she was alone it was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near hyde park as the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door guided her to the spot the clock struck eleven she had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute and making up her mind to advance but the sound determined her and she stepped into the hall the porters seat was vacant she looked round with an air of incertitude and advanced towards the stairs now young woman said a smartlydressed female looking out from a door behind her who do you want here a lady who is stopping in this house answered the girl a lady was the reply accompanied with a scornful look what lady pray miss maylie said nancy the young woman who had by this time noted her appearance replied only by a look of virtuous disdain and summoned a man to answer her to him nancy repeated her request what name am i to say asked the waiter its of no use saying any replied nancy nor business said the man no nor that neither rejoined the girl i must see the lady come said the man pushing her towards the door none of this take yourself off will you i shall be carried out if i go said the girl violently and i can make that a job that two of you wont like to do isnt there any body here she said looking round that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me this appeal produced an effect on a goodtemperedfaced mancook who with some other of the servants was looking on and who stepped forward to interfere take it up for her joe cant you said this person whats the good replied the man you dont suppose the young lady will see such as her do you this allusion to nancys doubtful character raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids who remarked with great fervour that the creature was a disgrace to her sex and strongly advocated her being thrown ruthlessly into the kennel do what you like with me said the girl turning to the men again but do what i ask you first and i ask you to give this message for god almightys sake the softhearted cook added his intercession and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery whats it to be said the man with one foot on the stairs that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss maylie alone said nancy and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say she will know whether to hear her business or have her turned out of doors as an impostor i say said the man youre coming it strong you give the message said the girl firmly and let me hear the answer the man ran up stairs and nancy remained pale and almost breathless listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific and became still more so when the man returned and said the young woman was to walk up stairs its no good being proper in this world said the first housemaid brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire said the second the third contented herself with wondering what ladies was made of and the fourth took the first in a quartette of shameful with which the dianas concluded regardless of all thisfor she had weightier matters at heartnancy followed the man with trembling limbs to a small antechamber lighted by a lamp from the ceiling in which he left her and retired the girls life had been squandered in the streets and the most noisome of the stews and dens of london but there was something of the womans original nature left in her still and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview but struggling with these better feelings was pridethe vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and selfassured the miserable companion of thieves and ruffians the fallen outcast of low haunts the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks living within the shadow of the gallows itselfeven this degraded being felt too proud to betray one feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness but which alone connected her with that humanity of which her wasting life had obliterated all outward traces when a very child she raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl and then bending them on the ground tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said its a hard matter to get to see you lady if i had taken offence and gone away as many would have done youd have been sorry for it one day and not without reason either i am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you replied rose do not think of it but tell me why you wished to see me i am the person you inquired for the kind tone of this answer the sweet voice the gentle manner the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure took the girl completely by surprise and she burst into tears oh lady lady she said clasping her hands passionately before her face if there was more like you there would be fewer like methere wouldthere would sit down said rose earnestly you distress me if you are in poverty or affliction i shall be truly happy to relieve you if i cani shall indeed sit down let me stand lady said the girl still weeping and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better it is growing late isisthat door shut yes said rose recoiling a few steps as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it why because said the girl i am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands i am the girl that dragged little oliver back to old fagins the jews on the night he went out from the house in pentonville you said rose maylie i lady replied the girl i am the infamous creature you have heard of that lives among the thieves and that never from the first moment i can recollect my eyes and senses opening on london streets have known any better life or kinder words than they have given me so help me god do not mind shrinking openly from me lady i am younger than you would think to look at me but i am well used to it the poorest women fall back as i make my way along the crowded pavement what dreadful things are these said rose involuntarily falling from her strange companion thank heaven upon your knees dear lady cried the girl that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness andand something worse than allas i have been from my cradle i may use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will be my deathbed i pity you said rose in a broken voice it wrings my heart to hear you god bless you for your goodness rejoined the girl if you knew what i am sometimes you would pity me indeed but i have stolen away from those who would surely murder me if they knew i had been here to tell you what i have overheard do you know a man named monks no said rose he knows you replied the girl and knew you were here for it was by hearing him tell the place that i found you out i never heard the name said rose then he goes by some other amongst us rejoined the girl which i more than thought before some time ago and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery isuspecting this manlistened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark i found out from what i heard that monksthe man i asked you about you know yes said rose i understand that monks pursued the girl had seen him accidentally with two of our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for though i couldnt make out why a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own for what purpose asked rose he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of finding out said the girl and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery but i did and i saw him no more till last night and what occurred then ill tell you lady last night he came again again they went up stairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow should not betray me again listened at the door the first words i heard monks say were these so the only proofs of the boys identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin they laughed and talked of his success in doing this and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild said that though he had got the young devils money safely now hed rather have had it the other way for what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the fathers will by driving him through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit of him besides what is all this said rose the truth lady though it comes from my lips replied the girl then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strangers to yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boys life without bringing his own neck in danger he would but as he couldnt hed be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life and if he took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet in short fagin he says jew as you are you never laid such snares as ill contrive for my young brother oliver his brother exclaimed rose clasping her hands those were his words said nancy glancing uneasily round as she had scarcely ceased to do since she began to speak for a vision of sikes haunted her perpetually and more when he spoke of you and the other lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who your twolegged spaniel was you do not mean said rose turning very pale to tell me that this was said in earnest he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a man ever did replied the girl shaking her head he is an earnest man when his hatred is up i know many who do worse things but id rather listen to them all a dozen times than to that monks once it is growing late and i have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this i must get back quickly but what can i do said rose to what use can i turn this communication without you back why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colours if you repeat this information to a gentleman whom i can summon in one instant from the next room you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hours delay i wish to go back said the girl i must go back becausehow can i tell such things to an innocent lady like youbecause among the men i have told you of there is one the most desperate among them all that i cant leave nonot even to be saved from the life i am leading now your having interfered in this dear boys behalf before said rose your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say your evident contrition and sense of shame all lead me to believe that you might be yet reclaimed oh said the earnest girl folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex the firstthe first i do believe who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion do hear my words and let me save you yet for better things lady cried the girl sinking on her knees dear sweet angel lady you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow but it is too lateit is too late it is never too late said rose for penitence and atonement it is cried the girl writhing in the agony of her mind i cannot leave him nowi could not be his death why should you be asked rose nothing could save him cried the girl if i told others what i have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die he is the boldest and has been so cruel is it possible cried rose that for such a man as this you can resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue it is madness i dont know what it is answered the girl i only know that it is so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself i must go back whether it is gods wrath for the wrong i have done i do not know but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage and should be i believe if i knew that i was to die by his hand at last what am i to do said rose i should not let you depart from me thus you should lady and i know you will rejoined the girl rising you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness and forced no promise from you as i might have done of what use then is the communication you have made said rose this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me benefit oliver whom you are anxious to serve you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret and advise you what to do rejoined the girl but where can i find you again when it is necessary asked rose i do not seek to know where these dreadful people live but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and come alone or with the only other person that knows it and that i shall not be watched or followed asked the girl i promise you solemnly answered rose every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve said the girl without hesitation i will walk on london bridge if i am alive stay another moment interposed rose as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door think once again on your own condition and the opportunity you have of escaping from it you have a claim on me not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption will you return to this gang of robbers and to this man when a word can save you what fascination is it that can take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery oh is there no chord in your heart that i can touchis there nothing left to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are replied the girl steadily give away your hearts love will carry you all lengthseven such as you who have home friends other admirers every thing to fill them when such as me who have no certain roof but the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place that parents home and friends filled once or that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to cure us pity us ladypity us for having only one feeling of the woman left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering you will said rose after a pause take some money from me which may enable you to live without dishonestyat all events until we meet again not a penny replied the girl waving her hand do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you said rose stepping gently forward i wish to serve you indeed you would serve me best lady replied the girl wringing her hands if you could take my life at once for i have felt more grief to think of what i am tonight than i ever did before and it would be something not to die in the same hell in which i have lived god bless you sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought shame on mine thus speaking and sobbing aloud the unhappy creature turned away while rose maylie overpowered by this extraordinary interview which bore more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence sank into a chair and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts chapter xl containing fresh discoveries and showing that surprises like misfortunes seldom come alone her situation was indeed one of no common trial and difficulty for while she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which olivers history was enveloped she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed had reposed in her as a young and guileless girl her words and manner had touched rose maylies heart and mingled with her love for her young charge and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope they only proposed remaining in london three days prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast it was now midnight of the first day what course of action could she determine upon which could be adopted in eightandforty hours or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion mr losberne was with them and would be for the next two days but rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentlemans impetuosity and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which in the first explosion of his indignation he would regard the instrument of olivers recapture to trust him with the secret when her representations in the girls behalf could be seconded by no experienced person these were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to mrs maylie whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject as to resorting to any legal adviser even if she had known how to do so it was scarcely to be thought of for the same reasons once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from harry but this awakened the recollection of their last parting and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back whenthe tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflectionhe might have by this time learnt to forget her and to be happier away disturbed by these different reflectionsinclining now to one course and then to another and again recoiling from all as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind rose passed a sleepless and anxious night and after more communing with herself next day arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting harry maylie if it be painful to him she thought to come back here how painful will it be to me but perhaps he will not come he may write or he may come himself and studiously abstain from meeting mehe did when he went away i hardly thought he would but it was better for us botha great deal better and here rose dropped the pen and turned away as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep she had taken up the same pen and laid it down again fifty times and had considered and reconsidered the very first line of her letter without writing the first word when oliver who had been walking in the streets with mr giles for a bodyguard entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm what makes you look so flurried asked rose advancing to meet him speak to me oliver i hardly know how i feel as if i should be choked replied the boy oh dear to think that i should see him at last and you should be able to know that i have told you all the truth i never thought you had told us any thing but the truth dear said rose soothing him but what is thisof whom do you speak i have seen the gentleman replied oliver scarcely able to articulate the gentleman who was so good to memr brownlow that we have so often talked about where asked rose getting out of a coach replied oliver shedding tears of delight and going into a house i didnt speak to himi couldnt speak to him for he didnt see me and i trembled so that i was not able to go up to him but giles asked for me whether he lived there and they said he did look here said oliver opening a scrap of paper here it is heres where he livesim going there directly oh dear me dear me what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak again with her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy rose read the address which was cravenstreet in the strand and very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account quick she said tell them to fetch a hackneycoach and be ready to go with me i will take you there directly without a minutes loss of time i will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour and be ready as soon as you are oliver needed no prompting to despatch and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to cravenstreet when they arrived there rose left oliver in the coach under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him and sending up her card by the servant requested to see mr brownlow on very pressing business the servant soon returned to beg that she would walk up stairs and following him into an upper room miss maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance in a bottlegreen coat at no great distance from whom was seated another old gentleman in nankeen breeches and gaiters who did not look particularly benevolent and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick and his chin propped thereupon dear me said the gentleman in the bottlegreen coat hastily rising with great politeness i beg your pardon young ladyi imagined it was some importunate person whoi beg you will excuse me be seated pray mr brownlow i believe sir said rose glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken that is my name said the old gentleman this is my friend mr grimwig grimwig will you leave us for a few minutes i believe interposed miss maylie that at this period of our interview i need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away if i am correctly informed he is cognizant of the business on which i wish to speak to you mr brownlow inclined his head and mr grimwig who had made one very stiff bow and risen from his chair made another very stiff bow and dropped into it again i shall surprise you very much i have no doubt said rose naturally embarrassed but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine and i am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again indeed said mr brownlow may i ask his name oliver twist you knew him as replied rose the words no sooner escaped her lips than mr grimwig who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table upset it with a great crash and falling back in his chair discharged from his features every expression but one of the most unmitigated wonder and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare then as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion he jerked himself as it were by a convulsion into his former attitude and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle which seemed at last not to be discharged on empty air but to die away in the inmost recesses of his stomach mr brownlow was no less surprised although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner he drew his chair nearer to miss maylies and said do me the favour my dear young lady to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which nobody else knows any thing and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once induced to entertain of that poor child in heavens name put me in possession of it a bad oneill eat my head if he is not a bad one growled mr grimwig speaking by some ventriloquial power without moving a muscle of his face he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart said rose colouring and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over im only sixtyone said mr grimwig with the same rigid face and as the devils in it if this oliver is not twelve at least i dont see the application of that remark do not heed my friend miss maylie said mr brownlow he does not mean what he says yes he does growled mr grimwig no he does not said mr brownlow obviously rising in wrath as he spoke hell eat his head if he doesnt growled mr grimwig he would deserve to have it knocked off if he does said mr brownlow and hed uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it responded mr grimwig knocking his stick upon the floor having gone thus far the two old gentlemen severally took snuff and afterwards shook hands according to their invariable custom now miss maylie said mr brownlow to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child allowing me to premise that i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since i have been absent from this country my first impression that he had imposed upon me and been persuaded by his former associates to rob me has been considerably shaken rose who had had time to collect her thoughts at once related in a few natural words all that had befallen oliver since he left mr brownlows house reserving nancys information for that gentlemans private ear and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow for some months past had been the not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend thank god said the old gentleman this is great happiness to me great happiness but you have not told me where he is now miss maylie you must pardon my finding fault with youbut why not have brought him he is waiting in a coach at the door replied rose at this door cried the old gentleman with which he hurried out of the room down the stairs up the coachsteps and into the coach without another word when the roomdoor closed behind him mr grimwig lifted up his head and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table sitting in it all the time after performing this evolution he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times and then stopping suddenly before rose kissed her without the slightest preface hush he said as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding dont be afraid im old enough to be your grandfather youre a sweet girli like you here they are in fact as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat mr brownlow returned accompanied by oliver whom mr grimwig received very graciously and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in olivers behalf rose maylie would have been well repaid there is somebody else who should not be forgotten by the by said mr brownlow ringing the bell send mrs bedwin here if you please the old housekeeper answered the summons with all despatch and dropping a curtsey at the door waited for orders why you get blinder every day bedwin said mr brownlow rather testily well that i do sir replied the old lady peoples eyes at my time of life dont improve with age sir i could have told you that rejoined mr brownlow but put on your glasses and see if you cant find out what you were wanted for will you the old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles but olivers patience was not proof against this new trial and yielding to his first impulse he sprung into her arms god be good to me cried the old lady embracing him it is my innocent boy my dear old nurse cried oliver he would come backi knew he would said the old lady holding him in her arms how well he looks and how like a gentlemans son he is dressed again where have you been this long long while ah the same sweet face but not so pale the same soft eye but not so sad i have never forgotten them or his quiet smile but seen them every day side by side with those of my own dear children dead and gone since i was a young lightsome creature running on thus and now holding oliver from her to mark how he had grown now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair the poor soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns leaving her and oliver to compare notes at leisure mr brownlow led the way into another room and there heard from rose a full narration of her interview with nancy which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity rose also explained her reasons for not making a confident of her friend mr losberne in the first instance the old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself to afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight oclock that evening and that in the mean time mrs maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred these preliminaries adjusted rose and oliver returned home rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctors wrath for nancys history was no sooner unfolded to him than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of messrs blathers and duff and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth immediately to obtain the assistance of those worthies and doubtless he would in this first outbreak have carried the intention into effect without a moments consideration of the consequences if he had not been restrained in part by corresponding violence on the side of mr brownlow who was himself of an irascible temperament and partly by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose then what the devil is to be done said the impetuous doctor when they had rejoined the two ladies are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred pounds or so apiece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver not exactly that rejoined mr brownlow laughing but we must proceed gently and with great care gentleness and care exclaimed the doctor id send them one and all to never mind where interposed mr brownlow but reflect whether sending them any where is likely to attain the object we have in view what object asked the doctor simply the discovery of olivers parentage and regaining for him the inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently deprived ah said mr losberne cooling himself with his pockethandkerchief i almost forgot that you see pursued mr brownlow placing this poor girl entirely out of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should we bring about hanging a few of them at least in all probability suggested the doctor and transporting the rest very good replied mr brownlow smiling but no doubt they will bring that about themselves in the fulness of time and if we step in to forestal them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interest or at least to olivers which is the same thing how inquired the doctor thus it is quite clear that we shall have the most extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this man monks upon his knees that can only be done by stratagem and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people for suppose he were apprehended we have no proof against him he is not even so far as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang in any of their robberies if he were not discharged it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond and of course ever afterwards his mouth is so obstinately closed that he might as well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot then said the doctor impetuously i put it to you again whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest intentions but really do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray said mr brownlow interrupting rose as she was about to speak the promise shall be kept i dont think it will in the slightest degree interfere with our proceedings but before we can resolve upon any precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the understanding that she is to be dealt with by us and not by the law or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us to identify him she cannot be seen until next sunday night this is tuesday i would suggest that in the mean time we remain perfectly quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself although mr losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then and as both rose and mrs maylie sided very strongly with mr brownlow that gentlemans proposition was carried unanimously i should like he said to call in the aid of my friend grimwig he is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material assistance to us i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course in ten years though whether that is a recommendation or not you must determine for yourselves i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine said the doctor we must put it to the vote replied mr brownlow who may he be that ladys son and this young ladysvery old friend said the doctor motioning towards mrs maylie and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece rose blushed deeply but she did not make any audible objection to this motion possibly she felt in a hopeless minority and harry maylie and mr grimwig were accordingly added to the committee we stay in town of course said mrs maylie while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in whom we are all so deeply interested and i am content to remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that any hope remains good rejoined mr brownlow and as i see on the faces about me a disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to corroborate olivers tale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may deem it expedient to forestal them by telling my own story believe me that i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realized and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough come supper has been announced and young oliver who is all alone in the next room will have begun to think by this time that we have wearied of his company and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world with these words the old gentleman gave his hand to mrs maylie and escorted her into the supperroom mr losberne followed leading rose and the council was for the present effectually broken up chapter xli an old acquaintance of olivers exhibiting decided marks of genius becomes a public character in the metropolis upon the very same night when nancy having lulled mr sikes to sleep hurried on her selfimposed mission to rose maylie there advanced towards london by the great north road two persons upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention they were a man and woman or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female for the former was one of those longlimbed knockkneed shambling bony figures to whom it is difficult to assign any precise agelooking as they do when they are yet boys like undergrown men and when they are almost men like overgrown boys the woman was young but of a robust and hardy make as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back her companion was not encumbered with much luggage as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief and apparently light enough this circumstance added to the length of his legs which were of unusual extent enabled him with much ease to keep some halfdozen paces in advance of his companion to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head as if reproaching her tardiness and urging her to greater exertion thus they toiled along the dusty road taking little heed of any object within sight save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mailcoaches which were whirling out of town until they passed through highgate archway when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion come on cant yer what a lazybones yer are charlotte its a heavy load i can tell you said the female coming up almost breathless with fatigue heavy what are yer talking aboutwhat are yer made for rejoined the male traveller changing his own little bundle as he spoke to the other shoulder oh there yer are resting again well if yer aint enough to tire any bodys patience out i dont know what is is it much farther asked the woman resting herself on a bank and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face much farther yer as good as there said the longlegged tramper pointing out before him look therethose are the lights of london theyre a good two mile off at least said the woman despondingly never mind whether theyre two mile off or twenty said noah claypole for he it was but get up and come on or ill kick yer and so i give yer notice as noahs red nose grew redder with anger and as he crossed the road while speaking as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution the woman rose without any further remark and trudged onwards by his side where do you mean to stop for the night noah she asked after they had walked a few hundred yards how should i know replied noah whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking near i hope said charlotte no not near replied mr claypole therenot near so dont think it why not when i tell yer that i dont mean to do a thing thats enough without any why or because either replied mr claypole with dignity well you neednt be so cross said his companion a pretty thing it would be wouldnt it to go and stop at the very first publichouse outside the town so that sowerberry if he come up after us might poke in his old nose and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on said mr claypole in a jeering tone no i shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find and not stop till we come to the very outofthewayest house i can set eyes on cod yer may thank yer stars ive got a head for if we hadnt gone at first the wrong road on purpose and come back across country yerd have been locked up hard and fast a week ago my lady and serve yer right for being a fool i know i aint as cunning as you are replied charlotte but dont put all the blame on me and say i should have been locked up you would have been if i had been any way yer took the money from the till yer know yer did said mr claypole i took it for you noah dear rejoined charlotte did i keep it asked mr claypole no you trusted in me and let me carry it like a dear and so you are said the lady chucking him under the chin and drawing her arm through his this was indeed the case but as it was not mr claypoles habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in any body it should be observed in justice to that gentleman that he had trusted charlotte to this extent in order that if they were pursued the money might be found on her which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his utter innocence of any theft and greatly facilitate his chances of escape of course he entered at this juncture into no explanation of his motives and they walked on very lovingly together in pursuance of this cautious plan mr claypole went on without halting until he arrived at the angel at islington where he wisely judged from the crowd of passengers and number of vehicles that london began in earnest just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets and consequently the most to be avoided he crossed into saint johns road and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways which lying between grays inn lane and smithfield render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of london through these streets noah claypole walked dragging charlotte after him now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small publichouse and now jogging on again as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose at length he stopped in front of one more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen and having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement graciously announced his intention of putting up there for the night so give us the bundle said noah unstrapping it from the womans shoulders and slinging it over his own and dont yer speak except when yer spoken to whats the name of the housethrthree what cripples said charlotte three cripples repeated noah and a very good sign too now then keep close at my heels and come along with these injunctions he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder and entered the house followed by his companion there was nobody in the bar but a young jew who with his two elbows on the counter was reading a dirty newspaper he stared very hard at noah and noah stared very hard at him if noah had been attired in his charityboys dress there might have been some reason for the jews opening his eyes so wide but as he had discarded the coat and badge and wore a short smockfrock over his leathers there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a publichouse is this the three cripples asked noah that is the dabe of this house replied the jew a gentleman we met on the road coming up from the country recommended us here said noah nudging charlotte perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise we want to sleep here tonight ib dot certaid you cad said barney who was the attendant sprite but ill idquire show us the tap and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring will yer said noah barney complied by ushering them into a small backroom and setting the required viands before them having done which he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night and left the amiable couple to their refreshment now this backroom was immediately behind the bar and some steps lower so that any person connected with the house undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the lastnamed apartment about five feet from its flooring could not only look down upon any guests in the backroom without any great hazard of being observed the glass being in a dark angle of the wall between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself but could by applying his ear to the partition ascertain with tolerable distinctness their subject of conversation the landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes and barney had only just returned from making the communication above related when fagin in the course of his evenings business came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils hush said barney stradegers id the next roob strangers repeated the old man in a whisper ah ad rub uds too added barney frob the cuttry but subthig in your way or ib bistaked fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest and mounting on a stool cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass from which secret post he could see mr claypole taking cold beef from the dish and porter from the pot and administering homopathic doses of both to charlotte who sat patiently by eating and drinking at his pleasure aha whispered the jew looking round to barney i like the fellows looks hed be of use to us he knows how to train the girl already dont make as much noise as a mouse my dear and let me hear em talklet me hear em the jew again applied his eye to the glass and turning his ear to the partition listened attentively with a subtle and eager look upon his face that might have appertained to some old goblin so i mean to be a gentleman said mr claypole kicking out his legs and continuing a conversation the commencement of which fagin had arrived too late to hear no more jolly old coffins charlotte but a gentlemans life for me and if yer like yer shall be a lady i should like that well enough dear replied charlotte but tills aint to be emptied every day and people to get clear off after it tills be blowed said mr claypole theres more things besides tills to be emptied what do you mean asked his companion pockets womens ridicules houses mailcoaches banks said mr claypole rising with the porter but you cant do all that dear said charlotte i shall look out to get into company with them as can replied noah theyll be able to make us useful some way or another why you yourself are worth fifty women i never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when i let yer lor how nice it is to hear you say so exclaimed charlotte imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face there thatll do dont yer be too affectionate in case im cross with yer said noah disengaging himself with great gravity i should like to be the captain of some band and have the whopping of em and follering em about unbeknown to themselves that would suit me if there was good profit and if we could only get in with some gentlemen of this sort i say it would be cheap at that twentypound note youve gotespecially as we dont very well know how to get rid of it ourselves after expressing this opinion mr claypole looked into the porterpot with an aspect of deep wisdom and having well shaken its contents nodded condescendingly to charlotte and took a draught wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed he was meditating another when the sudden opening of the door and appearance of a stranger interrupted him the stranger was mr fagin and very amiable he looked and a very low bow he made as he advanced and setting himself down at the nearest table ordered something to drink of the grinning barney illustration the jew morris bolter begin to understand each other a pleasant night sir but cool for the time of year said fagin rubbing his hands from the country i see sir how do yer see that asked noah claypole we have not so much dust as that in london replied the jew pointing from noahs shoes to those of his companion and from them to the two bundles yer a sharp feller said noah ha ha only hear that charlotte why one need be sharp in this town my dear replied the jew sinking his voice to a confidential whisper and thats the truth the jew followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefingera gesture which noah attempted to imitate though not with complete success in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose however mr fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion and put about the liquor which barney reappeared with in a very friendly manner good stuff that observed mr claypole smacking his lips dear said fagin a man need be always emptying a till or a pocket or a womans reticule or a house or a mailcoach or a bank if he drinks it regularly mr claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair and looked from the jew to charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror dont mind me my dear said fagin drawing his chair closer ha ha it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance it was very lucky it was only me i didnt take it stammered noah no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair it was all her doing yerve got it now charlotte yer know yer have no matter whos got it or who did it my dear replied fagin glancing nevertheless with a hawks eye at the girl and the two bundles im in that way myself and i like you for it in what way asked mr claypole a little recovering in that way of business rejoined fagin and so are the people of the house youve hit the right nail upon the head and are as safe here as you could be there is not a safer place in all this town than is the cripples that is when i like to make it so and ive taken a fancy to you and the young woman so ive said the word and you may make your minds easy noah claypoles mind might have been at ease after this assurance but his body certainly was not for he shuffled and writhed about into various uncouth positions eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion ill tell you more said the jew after he had reassured the girl by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements i have got a friend that i think can gratify your darling wish and put you in the right way where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first and be taught all the others yer speak as if yer were in earnest replied noah what advantage would it be to me to be anything else inquired the jew shrugging his shoulders here let me have a word with you outside theres no occasion to trouble ourselves to move said noah getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again shell take the luggage up stairs the while charlotte see to them bundles this mandate which had been delivered with great majesty was obeyed without the slightest demur and charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while noah held the door open and watched her out shes kept tolerably well under aint she sir he asked as he resumed his seat in the tone of a keeper who has tamed some wild animal quite perfect rejoined fagin clapping him on the shoulder youre a genius my dear why i suppose if i wasnt i shouldnt be here replied noah but i say shell be back if yer lose time now what do you think said the jew if you was to like my friend could you do better than join him is he in a good way of business thats where it is responded noah winking one of his little eyes the top of the tree said the jew employs a power of hands and has the very best society in the profession regular townmaders asked mr claypole not a countryman amongem and i dont think hed take you even on my recommendation if he didnt run rather short of assistants just now replied the jew should i have to hand over said noah slapping his breechespocket it couldnt possibly be done without replied fagin in a most decided manner twenty pound thoughits a lot of money not when its in a note you cant ged rid of retorted fagin number and date taken i suppose payment stopped at the bank ah its not worth much to him itll have to go abroad and he couldnt sell it for a great deal in the market when could i see him asked noah doubtfully tomorrow morning replied the jew where here um said noah whats the wages live like a gentlemanboard and lodging pipes and spirits freehalf of all you earn and half of all the young woman earns replied mr fagin whether noah claypole whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive would have acceded even to these glowing terms had he been a perfectly free agent is very doubtful but as he recollected that in the event of his refusal it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately and more unlikely things had come to pass he gradually relented and said he thought that would suit him but yer see observed noah as she will be able to do a good deal i should like to take something very light a little fancy work suggested fagin ah something of that sort replied noah what do you think would suit me now something not too trying for the strength and not very dangerous you know thats the sort of thing i heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others my dear said the jew my friend wants somebody who would do that well very much why i did mention that and i shouldnt mind turning my hand to it sometimes rejoined mr claypole slowly but it wouldnt pay by itself you know thats true observed the jew ruminating or pretending to ruminate no it might not what do you think then asked noah anxiously regarding him something in the sneaking way where it was pretty sure work and not much more risk than being at home what do you think of the old ladies asked the jew theres a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels and running round the corner dont they holler out a good deal and scratch sometimes asked noah shaking his head i dont think that would answer my purpose aint there any other line open stop said the jew laying his hand on noahs knee the kinchin lay whats that demanded mr claypole the kinchins my dear said the jew is the young children thats sent on errands by their mothers with sixpences and shillings and the lay is just to take their money awaytheyve always got it ready in their handsand then knock em into the kennel and walk off very slow as if there was nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself ha ha ha ha ha roared mr claypole kicking up his legs in an ecstasy lord thats the very thing to be sure it is replied fagin and you can have a few good beats chalked out in camdentown and battlebridge and neighbourhoods like that where theyre always going errands and upset as many kinchins as you want any hour in the day ha ha ha with this fagin poked mr claypole in the side and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud well thats all right said noah when he had recovered himself and charlotte had returned what time tomorrow shall we say will ten do asked the jew adding as mr claypole nodded assent what name shall i tell my good friend mr bolter replied noah who had prepared himself for such an emergency mr morris bolter this is mrs bolter mrs bolters humble servant said fagin bowing with grotesque politeness i hope i shall know her better very shortly do you hear the gentleman charlotte thundered mr claypole yes noah dear replied mrs bolter extending her hand she calls me noah as a sort of fond way of talking said mr morris bolter late claypole turning to the jew you understand oh yes i understandperfectly replied fagin telling the truth for once good night good night with many adieus and good wishes mr fagin went his way and noah claypole bespeaking his good ladys attention proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made with all that haughtiness and air of superiority becoming not only a member of the sterner sex but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay in london and its vicinity chapter xlii wherein is shown how the artful dodger got into trouble and so it was you that was your own friend was it asked mr claypole otherwise bolter when by virtue of the compact entered into between them he had removed next day to the jews house cod i thought as much last night every mans his own friend my dear replied fagin with his most insinuating grin he hasnt as good a one as himself anywhere except sometimes replied morris bolter assuming the air of a man of the world some people are nobodys enemies but their own yer know dont believe that said the jew when a mans his own enemy its only because hes too much his own friend not because hes careful for every body but himself pooh pooh there aint such a thing in nature there oughtnt to be if there is replied mr bolter that stands to reason said the jew some conjurers say that number three is the magic number and some say number seven its neither my friend neither its number one ha ha cried mr bolter number one for ever in a little community like ours my dear said the jew who felt it necessary to qualify this position we have a general number one that is you cant consider yourself as number one without considering me too as the same and all the other young people oh the devil exclaimed mr bolter you see pursued the jew affecting to disregard this interruption we are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must be so for instance its your object to take care of number onemeaning yourself certainly replied mr bolter yer about right there well you cant take care of yourself number one without taking care of me number one number two you mean said mr bolter who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness no i dont retorted the jew im of the same importance to you as you are to yourself i say interrupted mr bolter yer a very nice man and im very fond of yer but we aint quite so thick together as all that comes to only think said the jew shrugging his shoulders and stretching out his hands only consider youve done whats a very pretty thing and what i love you for doing but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat thats so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloosenin plain english the halter mr bolter put his hand to his neckerchief as if he felt it inconveniently tight and murmured an assent qualified in tone but not in substance the gallows continued fagin the gallows my dear is an ugly fingerpost which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellows career on the broad highway to keep in the easy road and keep it at a distance is object number one with you of course it is replied mr bolter what do yer talk about such things for only to show you my meaning clearly said the jew raising his eyebrows to be able to do that you depend upon me to keep my little business all snug i depend upon you the first is your number one the second my number one the more you value your number one the more careful you must be of mine so we come at last to what i told you at firstthat a regard for number one holds us all together and must do so unless we would all go to pieces in company thats true rejoined mr bolter thoughtfully oh yer a cunning old codger mr fagin saw with delight that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance to strengthen an impression so desirable and useful he followed up the blow by acquainting him in some detail with the magnitude and extent of his operations blending truth and fiction together as best served his purpose and bringing both to bear with so much art that mr bolters respect visibly increased and became tempered at the same time with a degree of wholesome fear which it was highly desirable to awaken its this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses said the jew my best hand was taken from me yesterday morning yer dont mean to say he died cried mr bolter no no replied fagin not so bad as that not quite so bad what i suppose he was wanted interposed the jew yes he was wanted very particular inquired mr bolter no replied the jew not very he was charged with attempting to pick a pocket and they found a silver snuffbox on himhis own my dear his own for he took snuff himself and was very fond of it they remanded him till today for they thought they knew the owner ah he was worth fifty boxes and id give the price of as many to have him back you should have known the dodger my dear you should have known the dodger well but i shall know him i hope dont yer think so said mr bolter im doubtful about it replied the jew with a sigh if they dont get any fresh evidence itll only be a summary conviction and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so but if they do its a case of lagging they know what a clever lad he is hell be a lifer theyll make the artful nothing less than a lifer what do yer mean by lagging and a lifer demanded mr bolter whats the good of talking in that way to me why dont yer speak so as i can understand yer fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue and being interpreted mr bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words transportation for life when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of master bates with his hands in his breeches pockets and his face twisted into a look of semicomical woe its all up fagin said charley when he and his new companion had been made known to each other what do you mean asked the jew with trembling lips theyve found the gentleman as owns the box two or three mores a coming to dentify him and the artfuls booked for a passage out replied master bates i must have a full suit of mourning fagin and a hatband to wisit him in afore he sets out upon his travels to think of jack dawkinslummy jackthe dodgerthe artful dodgergoing abroad for a common twopennyhalfpenny sneezebox i never thought hed ha done it under a gold watch chain and seals at the lowest oh why didnt he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables and go out as a gentleman and not like a common prig without no honour nor glory with this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend master bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency what do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for exclaimed fagin darting an angry look at his pupil wasnt he always topsawyer among you allis there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scenteh not one replied master bates in a voice rendered husky by regretnot one then what do you talk of replied the jew angrily what are you blubbering for cause it isnt on the record is it said charley chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets cause it cant come out in the indictment cause nobody will never know half of what he was how will he stand in the newgate calendar praps not be there at all oh my eye my eye wot a blow it is ha ha cried the jew extending his right hand and turning to mr bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy see what a pride they take in their profession my dear isnt it beautiful mr bolter nodded assent and the jew after contemplating the grief of charley bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder never mind charley said fagin soothingly itll come out itll be sure to come out theyll all know what a clever fellow he was hell shew it himself and not disgrace his old pals and teachers think how young he is too what a distinction charley to be lagged at his time of life well it is a honourthat is said charley a little consoled he shall have all he wants continued the jew he shall be kept in the stone jug charley like a gentlemanlike a gentleman with his beer every day and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with if he cant spend it no shall he though cried charley bates ay that he shall replied the jew and well have a bigwig charleyone thats got the greatest gift of the gabto carry on his defence and he shall make a speech for himself too if he likes and well read it all in the papersartful dodgershrieks of laughterhere the court was convulsedeh charley eh ha ha laughed master bates what a lark that would be wouldnt it fagin i say how the artful would bother em wouldnt he would cried the jew he shallhe will ah to be sure so he will repeated charley rubbing his hands i think i see him now cried the jew bending his eyes upon his pupil so do i cried charley batesha ha ha so do i i see it all afore me upon my soul i do fagin what a game what a regular game all the bigwigs trying to look solemn and jack dawkins addressing of em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judges own son making a speech arter dinnerha ha ha in fact the jew had so well humoured his young friends eccentric disposition that master bates who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the light of a victim now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities we must know how he gets on today by some handy means or other said fagin let me think shall i go asked charley not for the world replied the jew are you mad my dearstark mad that youd walk into the very place whereno charley noone is enough to lose at a time you dont mean to go yourself i suppose said charley with a humorous leer that wouldnt quite fit replied fagin shaking his head then why dont you send this new cove asked master bates laying his hand on noahs arm nobody knows him why if he didnt mind observed the jew mind interposed charley what should he have to mind really nothing my dear said fagin turning to mr bolter really nothing oh i dare say about that yer know observed noah backing towards the door and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm no nonone of that its not in my department that isnt wot department has he got fagin inquired master bates surveying noahs lank form with much disgust the cutting away when theres anything wrong and the eating all the wittles when theres everything right is that his branch never mind retorted mr bolter and dont yer take liberties with yer superiors little boy or yerll find yerself in the wrong shop master bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat that it was some time before fagin could interpose and represent to mr bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the policeoffice that inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had been engaged nor any description of his person had yet been forwarded to the metropolis it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter and that if he were properly disguised it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in london inasmuch as it would be of all places the very last to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will persuaded in part by these representations but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of the jew mr bolter at length consented with a very bad grace to undertake the expedition by fagins directions he immediately substituted for his own attire a waggoners frock velveteen breeches and leather leggings all of which articles the jew had at hand he was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets and a carters whip thus equipped he was to saunter into the office as some country fellow from covent garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiosity and as he was as awkward ungainly and rawboned a fellow as need be mr fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection these arrangements completed he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger and was conveyed by master bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of bowstreet having described the precise situation of the office and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage and when he got into the yard take the door up the steps on the righthand side and pull off his hat as he went into the room charley bates bade him hurry on alone and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting noah claypole or morris bolter as the reader pleases punctually followed the directions he had received whichmaster bates being pretty well acquainted with the localitywere so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question or meeting with any interruption by the way he found himself jostled among a crowd of people chiefly women who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall a box for the witnesses in the middle and a desk for the magistrates on the right the awful locality lastnamed being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze and left the vulgar to imagine if they could the full majesty of justice there were only a couple of women in the dock who were nodding to their admiring friends while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table a jailer stood reclining against the dockrail tapping his nose listlessly with a large key except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers by proclaiming silence or looked sternly up to bid some woman take that baby out when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries halfsmothered in the mothers shawl from some meagre infant the room smelt close and unwholesome the walls were dirtdiscoloured and the ceiling blackened there was an old smoky bust over the mantelshelf and a dusty clock above the dockthe only thing present that seemed to go on as it ought for depravity or poverty or an habitual acquaintance with both had left a taint on all the animate matter hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it noah looked eagerly about him for the dodger but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished characters mother or sister and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father nobody at all answering the description given him of mr dawkins was to be seen he waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women being committed for trial went flaunting out and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner whom he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit it was indeed mr dawkins who shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual his left hand in his pocket and his hat in his right preceded the jailer with a rolling gait altogether indescribable and taking his place in the dock requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that ere disgraceful sitivation for hold your tongue will you said the jailer im an englishman ant i rejoined the dodger where are my priwileges youll get your privileges soon enough retorted the jailer and pepper with em well see wot the secretary of state for the home affairs has got to say to the beaks if i dont replied mr dawkins now then wot is this here business i shall thank the madgstrates to dispose of this here little affair and not to keep me while they read the paper for ive got an appointment with a genelman in the city and as im a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters hell go away if i aint there to my time and then praps there wont be an action for damage against those as kept me away oh no certainly not at this point the dodger with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter desired the jailer to communicate the names of them two old files as was on the bench which so tickled the spectators that they laughed almost as heartily as master bates could have done if he had heard the request silence there cried the jailer what is this inquired one of the magistrates a pickpocketing case your worship has that boy ever been here before he ought to have been a many times replied the jailer he has been pretty well everywhere else i know him well your worship oh you know me do you cried the artful making a note of the statement wery good thats a case of deformation of character any way here there was another laugh and another cry of silence now then where are the witnesses said the clerk ah thats right added the dodger where are they i should like to see em this wish was immediately gratified for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom which being a very old one he deliberately put back again after trying it on his own countenance for this reason he took the dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him and the said dodger being searched had upon his person a silver snuffbox with the owners name engraved upon the lid this gentleman had been discovered on reference to the court guide and being then and there present swore that the snuffbox was his and that he had missed it on the previous day the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to he had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng particularly active in making his way about and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him have you anything to ask this witness boy said the magistrate i wouldnt abase myself by descending to hold any conversation with him replied the dodger have you anything to say at all do you hear his worship ask if youve anything to say inquired the jailer nudging the silent dodger with his elbow i beg your pardon said the dodger looking up with an air of abstraction did you address yourself to me my man i never see such an outandout young wagabond your worship observed the officer with a grin do you mean to say anything you young shaver no replied the dodger not here for this aint the shop for justice besides which my attorney is abreakfasting this morning with the wice president of the house of commons but i shall have something to say elsewhere and so will he and so will a wery numerous and respectable circle of acquaintance asll make them beaks wish theyd never been born or that theyd got their footman to hang em up to their own hatpegs afore they let em come out this morning to try it upon me ill there hes fully committed interposed the clerk take him away come on said the jailer oh ah ill come on replied the dodger brushing his hat with the palm of his hand ah to the bench its no use your looking frightened i wont show you no mercy not a haporth of it youll pay for this my fine fellers i wouldnt be you for something i wouldnt go free now if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me here carry me off to prison take me away with these last words the dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar threatening till he got into the yard to make a parliamentary business of it and then grinning in the officers face with great glee and selfapproval having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell noah made the best of his way back to where he had left master bates after waiting here some time he was joined by that young gentleman who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person the two hastened back together to bear to mr fagin the animating news that the dodger was doing full justice to his bringingup and establishing for himself a glorious reputation chapter xliii the time arrives for nancy to redeem her pledge to rose maylie she fails noah claypole is employed by fagin on a secret mission adept as she was in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation the girl nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken worked upon her mind she remembered that both the crafty jew and the brutal sikes had confided to her schemes which had been hidden from all others in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion and vile as those schemes were desperate as were their originators and bitter as were her feelings towards the jew who had led her step by step deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery whence was no escape still there were times when even towards him she felt some relenting lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded and he should fall at lastrichly as he merited such a fateby her hand but these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration her fears for sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly keptshe had dropped no clue which could lead to his discoveryshe had refused even for his sake a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompassed herand what more could she do she was resolved though every mental struggle terminated in this conclusion they forced themselves upon her again and again and left their traces too she grew pale and thin even within a few days at times she took no heed of what was passing before her or no part in conversations where once she would have been the loudest at others she laughed without merriment and was noisy without cause or meaning at othersoften within a moment afterwardsshe sat silent and dejected brooding with her head upon her hands while the very effort by which she roused herself told more forcibly than even these indications that she was ill at ease and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in course of discussion by her companions it was sunday night and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour sikes and the jew were talking but they paused to listen the girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched and listened too intently eleven an hour this side of midnight said sikes raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat dark and heavy it is too a good night for business this ah replied the jew what a pity bill my dear that theres none quite ready to be done youre right for once replied sikes gruffly it is a pity for im in the humour too the jew sighed and shook his head despondingly we must make up for lost time when weve got things into a good train thats all i know said sikes thats the way to talk my dear replied the jew venturing to pat him on the shoulder it does me good to hear you does you good does it cried sikes well so be it ha ha ha laughed the jew as if he were relieved by even this concession youre like yourself tonight billquite like yourself i dont feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder so take it away said sikes casting off the jews hand it makes you nervous billreminds you of being nabbed does it said the jew determined not to be offended reminds me of being nabbed by the devil returned sikes not by a trap there never was another man with such a face as yours unless it was your father and i suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time unless you came straight from the old un without any father at all betwixt you which i shouldnt wonder at a bit fagin offered no reply to this compliment but pulling sikes by the sleeve pointed his finger towards nancy who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet and was now leaving the room hallo cried sikes nance wheres the gal going to at this time of night not far what answers that returned sikes where are you going i say not far and i say where retorted sikes in a loud voice do you hear me i dont know where replied the girl then i do said sikes more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed nowhere sit down im not well i told you that before rejoined the girl i want a breath of air put your head out of the winder and take it there replied sikes theres not enough there said the girl i want it in the street then you wont have it replied sikes with which assurance he rose locked the door took the key out and pulling her bonnet from her head flung it up to the top of an old press there said the robber now stop quietly where you are will you its not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me said the girl turning very pale what do you mean bill do you know what youre doing know what im oh cried sikes turning to fagin shes out of her senses you know or she darent talk to me in that way youll drive me on to something desperate muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak let me go will youthis minutethis instant no roared sikes tell him to let me go fagin he had better itll be better for him do you hear me cried nancy stamping her foot upon the ground hear you repeated sikes turning round in his chair to confront her ay and if i hear you for half a minute longer the dog shall have such a grip on your throat asll tear some of that screaming voice out wot has come over you you jadewot is it let me go said the girl with great earnestness then sitting herself down on the floor before the door she saidbill let me go you dont know what youre doingyou dont indeed for only one hourdodo cut my limbs off one by one cried sikes seizing her roughly by the arm if i dont think the gals stark raving mad get up not till you let me gonot till you let me gonevernever screamed the girl sikes looked on for a minute watching his opportunity and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her struggling and wrestling with him by the way into a small room adjoining where he sat himself on a bench and thrusting her into a chair held her down by force she struggled and implored by turns until twelve oclock had struck and then wearied and exhausted ceased to contest the point any further with a caution backed by many oaths to make no more efforts to go out that night sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined the jew phew said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face wot a precious strange gal that is you may say that bill replied the jew thoughtfully you may say that wot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for do you think asked sikes come you should know her better than mewot does it mean obstinacywomans obstinacy i suppose my dear replied the jew shrugging his shoulders well i suppose it is growled sikes i thought i had tamed her but shes as bad as ever worse said the jew thoughtfully i never knew her like this for such a little cause nor i said sikes i think shes got a touch of that fever in her blood yet and it wont come outeh like enough replied the jew ill let her a little blood without troubling the doctor if shes took that way again said sikes the jew nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment she was hanging about me all day and night too when i was stretched on my back and you like a blackhearted wolf as you are kept yourself aloof said sikes we was very poor too all the time and i think one way or other its worried and fretted her and that being shut up here so long has made her restlesseh thats it my dear replied the jew in a whisperhush as he uttered these words the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat her eyes were swollen and red she rocked herself to and fro tossed her head and after a little time burst out laughing why now shes on the other tack exclaimed sikes turning a look of excessive surprise upon his companion the jew nodded to him to take no further notice just then and in a few minutes the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour whispering sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing fagin took up his hat and bade him goodnight he paused when he reached the door and looking round asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs light him down said sikes who was filling his pipe its a pity he should break his neck himself and disappoint the sightseers there show him a light nancy followed the old man down stairs with the candle when they reached the passage he laid his finger on his lip and drawing close to the girl said in a whisper what is it nancy dear what do you mean replied the girl in the same tone the reason of all this replied fagin if hehe pointed with his skinny forefinger up the stairsis so hard with you hes a brute nance a brutebeast why dont you well said the girl as fagin paused with his mouth almost touching her ear and his eyes looking into hers no matter just now said the jew well talk of this again you have a friend in me nance a staunch friend i have the means at hand quiet and close if you want revenge on those that treat you like a doglike a dog worse than his dog for he humours him sometimescome to me i say come to me he is the mere hound of a day but you know me of old nanceof old i know you well replied the girl without manifesting the least emotion good night she shrunk back as fagin offered to lay his hand on hers but said good night again in a steady voice and answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence closed the door between them fagin walked towards his own home intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain he had conceived the ideanot from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him but slowly and by degreesthat nancy wearied of the housebreakers brutality had conceived an attachment for some new friend her altered manner her repeated absences from home alone her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous and added to these her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour all favoured the supposition and rendered it to him at least almost a matter of certainty the object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons he would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as nancy and must thus fagin argued be secured without delay there was another and a darker object to be gained sikes knew too much and his ruffian taunts had not galled the jew the less because the wounds were hidden the girl must know well that if she shook him off she could never be safe from his fury and that it would be surely wreakedto the maiming of limbs or perhaps the loss of lifeon the object of her more recent fancy with a little persuasion thought fagin what more likely than that she would consent to poison him women have done such things and worse to secure the same object before now there would be the dangerous villainthe man i hategone another secured in his place and my influence over the girl with the knowledge of this crime to back it unlimited these things passed through the mind of fagin during the short time he sat alone in the housebreakers room and with them uppermost in his thoughts he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting there was no expression of surprise no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning the girl clearly comprehended it her glance at parting showed that but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of sikes and that was one of the chief ends to be attained how thought the jew as he crept homewards can i increase my influence with her what new power can i acquire such brains are fertile in expedients if without extracting a confession from herself he laid a watch discovered the object of her altered regard and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes of whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs could he not secure her compliance i can said fagin almost aloud she durst not refuse me thennot for her life not for her life i have it all the means are ready and shall be set to work i shall have you yet he cast back a dark look and a threatening motion of the hand towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain and went on his way busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment which he wrenched tightly in his grasp as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers he rose betimes next morning and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate who after a delay which seemed interminable at length presented himself and commenced a voracious assault upon the breakfast bolter said the jew drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite to him well here i am returned noah whats the matter dont yer ask me to do anything till i have done eating thats a great fault in this place yer never get time enough over yer meals you can talk as you eat cant you said fagin cursing his dear young friends greediness from the very bottom of his heart oh yes i can talk i get on better when i talk said noah cutting a monstrous slice of bread wheres charlotte out said fagin i sent her out this morning with the other young woman because i wanted us to be alone oh said noah i wish yerd ordered her to make some buttered toast first well talk away yer wont interrupt me there seemed indeed no great fear of anything interrupting him as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business you did well yesterday my dear said the jew beautiful six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day the kinchin lay will be a fortune to you dont yer forget to add three pintpots and a milkcan said mr bolter no no my dear replied the jew the pintpots were great strokes of genius but the milkcan was a perfect masterpiece pretty well i think for a beginner remarked mr bolter complacently the pots i took off airy railings and the milkcan was standing by itself outside a publichouse so i thought it might get rusty with the rain or catch cold yer know ha ha ha the jew affected to laugh very heartily and mr bolter having had his laugh out took a series of large bites which finished his first hunk of bread and butter and assisted himself to a second i want you bolter said fagin leaning over the table to do a piece of work for me my dear that needs great care and caution i say rejoined bolter dont yer go shoving me into danger or sending me to any more policeoffices that dont suit me that dont and so i tell yer theres not the smallest danger in itnot the very smallest said the jew its only to dodge a woman an old woman demanded mr bolter a young one replied fagin i can do that pretty well i know said bolter i was a regular cunning sneak when i was at school what am i to dodge her for not to not to do anything interrupted the jew but to tell me where she goes to who she sees and if possible what she says to remember the street if it is a street or the house if it is a house and to bring me back all the information you can whatll yer give me asked noah setting down his cup and looking his employer eagerly in the face if you do it well a pound my dearone pound said fagin wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible and thats what i never gave yet for any job of work where there wasnt valuable consideration to be gained who is she inquired noah one of us oh lor cried noah curling up his nose yer doubtful of her are yer she has found out some new friends my dear and i must know who they are replied the jew i see said noah just to have the pleasure of knowing them if theyre respectable people ehha ha ha im your man i knew you would be cried fagin elated by the success of his proposal of course of course replied noah where is she where am i to wait for her when am i to go all that my dear you shall hear from me ill point her out at the proper time said fagin you keep ready and leave the rest to me that night and the next and the next again the spy sat booted and equipped in his carters dress ready to turn out at a word from fagin six nights passedsix long weary nightsand on each fagin came home with a disappointed face and briefly intimated that it was not yet time on the seventh he returned earlier and with an exultation he could not conceal it was sunday she goes abroad tonight said fagin and on the right errand im sure for she has been alone all day and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak come with me quick noah started up without saying a word for the jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him they left the house stealthily and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets arrived at length before a publichouse which noah recognised as the same in which he had slept on the night of his arrival in london it was past eleven oclock and the door was closed it opened softly on its hinges as the jew gave a low whistle they entered without noise and the door was closed behind them scarcely venturing to whisper but substituting dumb show for words fagin and the young jew who had admitted them pointed out the pane of glass to noah and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room is that the woman he asked scarcely above his breath the jew nodded yes i cant see her face well whispered noah she is looking down and the candle is behind her stay there whispered fagin he signed to barney who withdrew in an instant the lad entered the room adjoining and under pretence of snuffing the candle moved it into the required position and speaking to the girl caused her to raise her face i see her now cried the spy plainly asked the jew i should know her among a thousand he hastily descended as the roomdoor opened and the girl came out fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment and emerged by the door at which they had entered hist cried the lad who held the door now noah exchanged a look with fagin and darted out to the left whispered the lad take the left hand and keep on the other side he did so and by the light of the lamps saw the girls retreating figure already at some distance before him he advanced as near as he considered prudent and kept on the opposite side of the street the better to observe her motions she looked nervously round twice or thrice and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her pass on she seemed to gather courage as she advanced and to walk with a steadier and firmer step the spy preserved the same relative distance between them and followed with his eye upon her chapter xliv the appointment kept the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven as two figures emerged on london bridge one which advanced with a swift and rapid step was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object the other figure was that of a man who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find and at some distance accommodated his pace to hers stopping when she stopped and as she moved again creeping stealthily on but never allowing himself in the ardour of his pursuit to gain upon her footsteps thus they crossed the bridge from the middlesex to the surrey shore when the woman apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the footpassengers turned back the movement was sudden but he who watched her was not thrown off his guard by it for shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure he suffered her to pass by on the opposite pavement and when she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before he slipped quietly down and followed her again at nearly the centre of the bridge she stopped the man stopped too it was a very dark night the day had been unfavourable and at that hour and place there were few people stirring such as there were hurried quickly past very possibly without seeing but certainly without noticing either the woman or the man who kept her in view their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of londons destitute population as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads they stood there in silence neither speaking nor spoken to by any one who passed a mist hung over the river deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs and rendering darker and more indistinct the mirky buildings on the banks the old smokestained storehouses on either side rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes the tower of old saint saviours church and the spire of saint magnus so long the giantwarders of the ancient bridge were visible in the gloom but the forest of shipping below bridge and the thickly scattered spires of churches above were nearly all hidden from the sight the girl had taken a few restless turns to and froclosely watched meanwhile by her hidden observerwhen the heavy bell of st pauls tolled for the death of another day midnight had come upon the crowded city the palace the nightcellar the jail the madhouse the chambers of birth and death of health and sickness the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the childmidnight was upon them all the hour had not struck two minutes when a young lady accompanied by a greyhaired gentleman alighted from a hackneycarriage within a short distance of the bridge and having dismissed the vehicle walked straight towards it they had scarcely set foot upon its pavement when the girl started and immediately made towards them they walked onwards looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised when they were suddenly joined by this new associate they halted with an exclamation of surprise but suppressed it immediately for a man in the garments of a countryman came close upbrushed against them indeedat that precise moment not here said nancy hurriedly i am afraid to speak to you here come awayout of the public roaddown the steps yonder as she uttered these words and indicated with her hand the direction in which she wished them to proceed the countryman looked round and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for passed on illustration the meeting the steps to which the girl had pointed were those which on the surrey bank and on the same side of the bridge as saint saviours church form a landingstairs from the river to this spot the man bearing the appearance of a countryman hastened unobserved and after a moments survey of the place he began to descend these stairs are a part of the bridge they consist of three flights just below the end of the second going down the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pier or pedestal facing towards the thames at this point the lower steps widen so that a person turning that angle of the wall is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him if only a step the countryman looked hastily round when he reached this point and as there seemed no better place of concealment and the tide being out there was plenty of room he slipped aside with his back to the pier and there waited pretty certain that they would come no lower and that even if he could not hear what was said he could follow them again with safety so tardily stole the time in this lonely place and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect that he more than once gave the matter up for lost and persuaded himself either that they had stopped far above or resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation he was on the very point of emerging from his hidingplace and regaining the road above when he heard the sound of footsteps and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear he drew himself straight upright against the wall and scarcely breathing listened attentively this is far enough said a voice which was evidently that of the gentleman i will not suffer this young lady to go any further many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far but you see i am willing to humour you to humour me cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed youre considerate indeed sir to humour me well well its no matter why for what said the gentleman in a kinder tone for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place why not have let me speak to you above there where it is light and there is something stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole i told you before replied nancy that i was afraid to speak to you there i dont know why it is said the girl shuddering but i have such a fear and dread upon me tonight that i can hardly stand a fear of what asked the gentleman who seemed to pity her i scarcely know of what replied the girl i wish i did horrible thoughts of death and shrouds with blood upon them and a fear that has made me burn as if i was on fire have been upon me all day i was reading a book tonight to wile the time away and the same things came into the print imagination said the gentleman soothing her no imagination replied the girl in a hoarse voice ill swear i saw coffin written in every page of the book in large black lettersay and they carried one close to me in the streets tonight there is nothing unusual in that said the gentleman they have passed me often real ones rejoined the girl this was not there was something so uncommon in her manner that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words and the blood chilled within him he had never experienced a greater relief than hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies speak to her kindly said the young lady to her companion poor creature she seems to need it your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as i am tonight and preached of flames and vengeance cried the girl oh dear lady why arnt those who claim to be gods own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud instead of so much humbler ah said the gentleman a turk turns his face after washing it well to the east when he says his prayers these good people after giving their faces such a rub with the world as takes the smiles off turn with no less regularity to the darkest side of heaven between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first these words appeared to be addressed to the young lady and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording nancy time to recover herself the gentleman shortly afterwards addressed himself to her you were not here last sunday night he said i couldnt come replied nancy i was kept by force by whom billhim that i told the young lady of before you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here tonight i hope asked the old gentleman anxiously no replied the girl shaking her head its not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why i couldnt have seen the lady when i did but that i gave him a drink of laudanum before i came away did he awake before you returned inquired the gentleman no and neither he nor any of them suspect me good said the gentleman now listen to me i am ready replied the girl as he paused for a moment this young lady the gentleman began has communicated to me and some other friends who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly a fortnight since i confess to you that i had doubts at first whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe you are i am said the girl earnestly i repeat that i firmly believe it to prove to you that i am disposed to trust you i tell you without reserve that we propose to extort the secret whatever it may be from the fears of this man monks but ifif said the gentleman he cannot be secured or if secured cannot be acted upon as we wish you must deliver up the jew fagin cried the girl recoiling that man must be delivered up by you said the gentleman i will not do iti will never do it replied the girl devil that he is and worse than devil as he has been to me i will never do that you will not said the gentleman who seemed fully prepared for this answer never returned the girl tell me why for one reason rejoined the girl firmly for one reason that the lady knows and will stand by me in i know she will for i have her promise and for this other reason besides that bad life as he has led i have led a bad life too there are many of us who have kept the same courses together and ill not turn upon them who mightany of themhave turned upon me but didnt bad as they are then said the gentleman quickly as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attainput monks into my hands and leave him to me to deal with what if he turns against the others i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him there the matter will rest there must be circumstances in olivers little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free and if it is not suggested the girl then pursued the gentleman this jew shall not be brought to justice without your consent in such a case i could show you reasons i think which would induce you to yield it have i the ladys promise for that asked the girl eagerly you have replied rose my true and faithful pledge monks would never learn how you knew what you do said the girl after a short pause never replied the gentleman the intelligence should be so brought to bear upon him that he could never even guess i have been a liar and among liars from a little child said the girl after another interval of silence but i will take your words after receiving an assurance from both that she might safely do so she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said to describe by name and situation the publichouse whence she had been followed that night from the manner in which she occasionally paused it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated when she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation and the night and hour on which monks was most in the habit of frequenting it she seemed to consider a few moments for the purpose of recalling his features and appearance more forcibly to her recollection he is tall said the girl and a strongly made man but not stout he has a lurking walk and as he walks constantly looks over his shoulder first on one side and then on the other dont forget that for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other mans that you might almost tell him by that alone his face is dark like his hair and eyes but although he cant be more than six or eight and twenty withered and haggard his lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth for he has desperate fits and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with woundswhy did you start said the girl stopping suddenly the gentleman replied in a hurried manner that he was not conscious of having done so and begged her to proceed part of this said the girl ive drawn out from other people at the house i tell you of for i have only seen him twice and both times he was covered up in a large cloak i think thats all i can give you to know him by stay though she added upon his throat so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face there is a broad red mark like a burn or scald cried the gentleman hows this said the girl you know him the young lady uttered a cry of extreme surprise and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe i think i do said the gentleman breaking silence i should by your description we shall see many people are singularly like each other thoughit may not be the same as he expressed himself to this effect with assumed carelessness he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter it must be he now he said returning so it seemed by the sound to the spot where he had stood before you have given us most valuable assistance young woman and i wish you to be the better for it what can i do to serve you nothing replied nancy you will not persist in saying that rejoined the gentleman with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart think now tell me nothing sir rejoined the girl weeping you can do nothing to help me i am past all hope indeed you put yourself beyond its pale said the gentleman the past has been a dreary waste with you of youthful energies misspent and such priceless treasures lavished as the creator bestows but once and never grants again but for the future you may hope i do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind for that must come as you seek it but a quiet asylum either in england or if you fear to remain here in some foreign country it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure to you before the dawn of morning before this river wakes to the first glimpse of daylight you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates and leave as utter an absence of all traces behind you as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment come i would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion or take one look at any old haunt or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you quit them all while there is time and opportunity she will be persuaded now cried the young lady she hesitates i am sure i fear not my dear said the gentleman no sir i do not replied the girl after a short struggle i am chained to my old life i loathe and hate it now but i cannot leave it i must have gone too far to turn backand yet i dont know for if you had spoken to me so some time ago i should have laughed it off but she said looking hastily round this fear comes over me again i must go home home repeated the young lady with great stress upon the word home lady rejoined the girl to such a home as i have raised for myself with the work of my whole life let us part i shall be watched or seen go go if i have done you any service all i ask is that you leave me and let me go my way alone it is useless said the gentleman with a sigh we compromise her safety perhaps by staying here we may have detained her longer than she expected already yes yes urged the girl you have what cried the young lady can be the end of this poor creatures life what repeated the girl look before you lady look at that dark water how many times do you read of such as we who spring into the tide and leave no living thing to care for or bewail them it may be years hence or it may be only months but i shall come to that at last do not speak thus pray returned the young lady sobbing it will never reach your ears dear lady and god forbid such horrors shouldreplied the girl good night good night the gentleman turned away this purse cried the young lady take it for my sake that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble no no replied the girl i have not done this for money let me have that to think of and yetgive me something that you have worn i should like to have somethingno no not a ringyour gloves or handkerchiefanything that i can keep as having belonged to you sweet lady there bless yougod bless you good night good night the violent agitation of the girl and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to illusage and violence seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her as she requested the sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased the two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge they stopped at the summit of the stairs hark cried the young lady listening did she call i thought i heard her voice no my love replied mr brownlow looking sadly back she has not moved and will not till we are gone rose maylie lingered but the old gentleman drew her arm through his and led her with gentle force away as they disappeared the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears after a time she rose and with feeble and tottering steps ascended to the street the astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards and having ascertained with many cautious glances round him that he was again alone crept slowly from his hidingplace and returned stealthily and in the shade of the wall in the same manner as he had descended peeping out more than once when he reached the top to make sure that he was unobserved noah claypole darted away at his utmost speed and made for the jews house as fast as his legs would carry him chapter xlv fatal consequences it was nearly two hours before daybreakthat time which in the autumn of the year may be truly called the dead of night when the streets are silent and deserted when even sound appears to slumber and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dreamit was at this still and silent hour that the jew sat watching in his old lair with face so distorted and pale and eyes so red and bloodshot that he looked less like a man than like some hideous phantom moist from the grave and worried by an evil spirit he sat crouching over a cold hearth wrapped in an old torn coverlet with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side his right hand was raised to his lips and as absorbed in thought he bit his long black nails he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dogs or rats stretched upon a mattress on the floor lay noah claypole fast asleep towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant then brought them back again to the candle which with longburnt wick drooping almost double and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere indeed they were mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers an utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes the fear of detection and ruin and death and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by allthese were the passionate considerations that following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain of fagin as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart he sat without changing his attitude in the least or appearing to take the smallest heed of time until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street at last muttered the jew wiping his dry and fevered mouth at last the bell rang gently as he spoke he crept up stairs to the door and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin who carried a bundle under one arm sitting down and throwing back his outer coat the man displayed the burly frame of sikes there he said laying the bundle on the table take care of that and do the most you can with it its been trouble enough to get i thought i should have been here three hours ago fagin laid his hand upon the bundle and locking it in the cupboard sat down again without speaking but he did not take his eyes off the robber for an instant during this action and now that they sat over against each other face to face he looked fixedly at him with his lips quivering so violently and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair and surveyed him with a look of real affright wot now cried sikes wot do you look at a man so forspeak will you the jew raised his right hand and shook his trembling forefinger in the air but his passion was so great that the power of speech was for the moment gone damme said sikes feeling in his breast with a look of alarm hes gone mad i must look to myself here no no rejoined fagin finding his voice its notyoure not the person bill ive nono fault to find with you oh you havent havent you said sikes looking sternly at him and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket thats luckyfor one of us which one that is dont matter ive got that to tell you bill said the jew drawing his chair nearer will make you worse than me aye returned the robber with an incredulous air tell away look sharp or nance will think im lost lost cried fagin she has pretty well settled that in her own mind already sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the jews face and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly speak will you he said or if you dont it shall be for want of breath open your mouth and say wot youve got to say in plain words out with it you thundering old cur out with it suppose that lad thats lying there fagin began sikes turned round to where noah was sleeping as if he had not previously observed him well he said resuming his former position suppose that lad pursued the jew was to peachblow upon us allfirst seeking out the right folks for the purpose and then having a meeting with em in the street to paint our likenesses describe every mark that they might know us by and the crib where we might be most easily taken suppose he was to do all this and besides to blow upon a plant weve all been in more or lessof his own fancy not grabbed trapped tried earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and waterbut of his own fancy to please his own taste stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us and peaching to them do you hear me cried the jew his eyes flashing with rage suppose he did all this what then what then replied sikes with a tremendous oath if he was left alive till i came id grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head what if i did it cried the jew almost in a yell i that know so much and could hang so many besides myself i dont know replied sikes clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion id do something in the jail that ud get me put in irons and if i was tried along with you id fall upon you with them in the open court and beat your brains out afore the people i should have such strength muttered the robber poising his brawny arm that i could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it you would would i said the housebreaker try me if it was charley or the dodger or bet or i dont care who replied sikes impatiently whoever it was id serve them the same fagin again looked hard at the robber and motioning him to be silent stooped over the bed upon the floor and shook the sleeper to rouse him sikes leant forward in his chair looking on with his hands upon his knees as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in bolter bolter poor lad said fagin looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis hes tiredtired with watching for her so longwatching for her bill wot dye mean asked sikes drawing back the jew made no answer but bending over the sleeper again hauled him into a sitting posture when his assumed name had been repeated several times noah rubbed his eyes and giving a heavy yawn looked sleepily about him tell me that againonce again just for him to hear said the jew pointing to sikes as he spoke tell yer what asked the sleepy noah shaking himself pettishly that aboutnancy said the jew clutching sikes by the wrist as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough you followed her yes to london bridge yes where she met two people so she did a gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before who asked her to give up all her pals and monks first which she didand to describe him which she didand to tell her what house it was that we meet at and go to which she didand where it could be best watched from which she didand what time the people went there which she did she did all this she told it all every word without a threat without a murmurshe diddidnt she cried the jew half mad with fury all right replied noah scratching his head thats just what it was what did they say about last sunday demanded the jew about last sunday replied noah considering why i told yer that before again tell it again cried fagin tightening his grasp on sikes and brandishing his other hand aloft as the foam flew from his lips they asked her said noah who as he grew more wakeful seemed to have a dawning perception who sikes was they asked her why she didnt come last sunday as she promised she said she couldnt whywhy interrupted the jew triumphantly tell him that because she was forcibly kept at home by bill the man she had told them of before replied noah what more of him cried the jew what more of the man she had told them of before tell him that tell him that why that she couldnt very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to said noah and so the first time she went to see the lady sheha ha ha it made me laugh when she said it that it didshe gave him a drink of laudanum hells fire cried sikes breaking fiercely from the jew let me go flinging the old man from him he rushed from the room and darted wildly and furiously up the stairs bill bill cried the jew following him hastily a word only a word the word would not have been exchanged but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence when the jew came panting up let me out said sikes dont speak to meits not safe let me out i say hear me speak a word rejoined the jew laying his hand upon the lock you wont be well replied the other you wont betooviolent bill whined the jew the day was breaking and there was light enough for the men to see each others faces they exchanged one brief glance there was a fire in the eyes of both which could not be mistaken i mean said fagin showing that he felt all disguise was now useless not too violent for safety be crafty bill and not too bold sikes made no reply but pulling open the door of which the jew had turned the lock dashed into the silent streets without one pause or moments consideration without once turning his head to the right or left or raising his eyes to the sky or lowering them to the ground but looking straight before him with savage resolution his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin the robber held on his headlong course nor muttered a word nor relaxed a muscle until he reached his own door he opened it softly with a key strode lightly up the stairs and entering his own room doublelocked the door and lifting a heavy table against it drew back the curtain of the bed the girl was lying halfdressed upon it he had roused her from her sleep for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look get up said the man it is you bill said the girl with an expression of pleasure at his return it is was the reply get up there was a candle burning but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick and hurled it under the grate seeing the faint light of early day without the girl rose to undraw the curtain let it be said sikes thrusting his hand before her theres light enough for wot ive got to do bill said the girl in the low voice of alarm why do you look like that at me the robber sat regarding her for a few seconds with dilated nostrils and heaving breast and then grasping her by the head and throat dragged her into the middle of the room and looking once towards the door placed his heavy hand upon her mouth bill bill gasped the girl wrestling with the strength of mortal fearii wont scream or crynot oncehear mespeak to metell me what i have done you know you she devil returned the robber suppressing his breath you were watched tonight every word you said was heard then spare my life for the love of heaven as i spared yours rejoined the girl clinging to him bill dear bill you cannot have the heart to kill me oh think of all i have given up only this one night for you you shall have time to think and save yourself this crime i will not loose my hold you cannot throw me off bill bill for dear gods sake for your own for mine stop before you spill my blood i have been true to you upon my guilty soul i have the man struggled violently to release his arms but those of the girl were clasped round his and tear her as he would he could not tear them away bill cried the girl striving to lay her head upon his breast the gentleman and that dear lady told me tonight of a home in some foreign country where i could end my days in solitude and peace let me see them again and beg them on my knees to show the same mercy and goodness to you and let us both leave this dreadful place and far apart lead better lives and forget how we have lived except in prayers and never see each other more it is never too late to repent they told me soi feel it nowbut we must have timea little little time the housebreaker freed one arm and grasped his pistol the certainty of immediate detection if he fired flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon upon the upturned face that almost touched his own she staggered and fell nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead but raising herself with difficulty on her knees drew from her bosom a white handkerchiefrose maylies ownand holding it up in her folded hands as high towards heaven as her feeble strength would let her breathed one prayer for mercy to her maker it was a ghastly figure to look upon the murderer staggering backward to the wall and shutting out the sight with his hand seized a heavy club and struck her down chapter xlvi the flight of sikes of all bad deeds that under cover of the darkness had been committed within wide londons bounds since night hung over it that was the worst of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air that was the foulest and most cruel the sunthe bright sun that brings back not light alone but new life and hope and freshness to manburst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory through costlycoloured glass and papermended window through cathedral dome and rotten crevice it shed its equal ray it lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay it did he tried to shut it out but it would stream in if the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning what was it now in all that brilliant light he had not moved he had been afraid to stir there had been a moan and motion of the hand and with terror added to hate he had struck and struck again once he threw a rug over it but it was worse to fancy the eyes and imagine them moving towards him than to see them glaring upwards as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling he had plucked it off again and there was the bodymere flesh and blood no morebut such flesh and such blood he struck a light kindled a fire and thrust the club into it there was human hair upon the end which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder and caught by the air whirled up the chimney even that frightened him sturdy as he was but he held the weapon till it broke and then piled it on the coals to burn away and smoulder into ashes he washed himself and rubbed his clothes there were spots that would not be removed but he cut the pieces out and burnt them how those stains were dispersed about the room the very feet of the dog were bloody all this time he had never once turned his back upon the corpse no not for a moment such preparations completed he moved backwards towards the door dragging the dog with him lest he should carry out new evidences of the crime into the streets he shut the door softly locked it took the key and left the house he crossed over and glanced up at the window to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside there was the curtain still drawn which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again it lay nearly under there he knew that god how the sun poured down upon the very spot the glance was instantaneous it was a relief to have got free of the room he whistled on the dog and walked rapidly away he went through islington strode up the hill at highgate on which stands the stone in honour of whittington turned down to highgate hill unsteady of purpose and uncertain where to go struck off to the right again almost as soon as he began to descend it and taking the foot path across the fields skirted caen wood and so came out on hampstead heath traversing the hollow by the vale of health he mounted the opposite bank and crossing the road which joins the villages of hampstead and highgate made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at north end in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge and slept soon he was up again and awaynot far into the country but back towards london by the highroadthen back againthen over another part of the same ground as he had already traversedthen wandering up and down in fields and lying on ditches brinks to rest and starting up to make for some other spot and do the same and ramble on again where could he go to that was near and not too public to get some meat and drink hendon that was a good place not far off and out of most peoples way thither he directed his stepsrunning sometimes and sometimes with a strange perversity loitering at a snails pace or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with his stick but when he got there all the people he metthe very children at the doorsseemed to view him with suspicion back he turned again without the courage to purchase bit or drop though he had tasted no food for many hours and once more he lingered on the heath uncertain where to go he wandered over miles and miles of ground and still came back to the old place morning and noon had passed and the day was on the wane and still he rambled to and fro and up and down and round and round and still lingered about the same spot at last he got away and shaped his course for hatfield it was nine oclock at night when the man quite tired out and the dog limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village and plodding along the little street crept into a small publichouse whose scanty light had guided them to the spot there was a fire in the taproom and some countrylabourers were drinking before it they made room for the stranger but he sat down in the furthest corner and ate and drank alone or rather with his dog to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time the conversation of the men assembled here turned upon the neighbouring land and farmers and when those topics were exhausted upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous sunday the young men present considering him very old and the old men present declaring him to have been quite youngnot older one whitehaired grandfather said than he waswith ten or fifteen year of life in him at leastif he had taken care if he had taken care there was nothing to attract attention or excite alarm in this the robber after paying his reckoning sat silent and unnoticed in his corner and had almost dropped asleep when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a newcomer this was an antic fellow half pedlar and half mountebank who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones strops razors washballs harnesspaste medicines for dogs and horses cheap perfumery cosmetics and suchlike wares which he carried in a case slung to his back his entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen which slackened not until he had made his supper and opened his box of treasures when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement and what be that stoofgood to eat harry asked a grinning countryman pointing to some compositioncakes in one corner this said the fellow producing one this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain rust dirt mildew spick speck spot or spatter from silk satin linen cambric cloth crape stuff carpet merino muslin bombazeen or

directly and more of the listeners plainly hesitated the vender observing this increased in loquacity its all bought up as fast as it can be made said the fellow there are fourteen watermills six

waterstains paintstains pitchstains mudstains bloodstainshere is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company that ill take clean out before he can order me a pint of ale hah cried sikes starting up give that back ill take it clean out sir replied the man winking to the company before you can come across the room to get it gentlemen all observe the dark stain upon this gentlemans hat no wider than a shilling but thicker than a halfcrown whether it is a winestain fruitstain beerstain waterstain paintstain pitchstain mudstain or bloodstain the man got no farther for sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table and tearing the hat from him burst out of the house with the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him despite himself all day the murderer finding that he was not followed and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow turned back up the town and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stagecoach that was standing in the street was walking past when he recognised the mail from london and saw that it was standing at the little postoffice he almost knew what was to come but he crossed over and listened the guard was standing at the door waiting for the letterbag a man dressed like a gamekeeper came up at the moment and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement thats for your people said the guard now look alive in there will you damn that ere bag it warnt ready night afore last this wont do you know anything new up in town ben asked the gamekeeper drawing back to the windowshutters the better to admire the horses no nothing that i knows on replied the man pulling on his gloves corns up a little i heerd talk of a murder too down spitalfields way but i dont reckon much upon it oh thats quite true said a gentleman inside who was looking out of the window and a very dreadful murder it was was it sir rejoined the guard touching his hat man or woman pray sir a woman replied the gentleman it is supposed now ben cried the coachman impatiently damn that ere bag said the guard are you gone to sleep in there coming cried the officekeeper running out coming growled the guard ah and sos the young ooman of property thats going to take a fancy to me but i dont know when here give hold all riight the horn sounded a few cheerful notes and the coach was gone sikes remained standing in the street apparently unmoved by what he had just heard and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go at length he went back again and took the road which leads from hatfield to st albans he went on doggedly but as he left the town behind him and plunged further and further into the solitude and darkness of the road he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core every object before him substance or shadow still or moving took the semblance of some fearful thing but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that mornings ghastly figure following at his heels he could trace its shadow in the gloom supply the smallest item of the outline and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along he could hear its garments rustling in the leaves and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry if he stopped it did the same if he ran it followednot running too that would have been a relief but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life and borne upon one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell at times he turned with desperate determination resolved to beat this phantom off though it should look him dead but the hair rose from his head and his blood stood still for it had turned with him and was behind him then he had kept it before him that morning but it was behind him nowalways he leant his back against a bank and felt that it stood above him visibly out against the cold nightsky he threw himself upon the roadon his back upon the road at his head it stood silent erect and stilla living gravestone with its epitaph in blood let no man talk of murderers escaping justice and hint that providence must sleep there were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear there was a shed in a field he passed that offered shelter for the night before the door were three tall poplar trees which made it very dark within and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail he could not walk on till daylight came again and here he stretched himself close to the wallto undergo new torture for now a vision came before him as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped those widely staring eyes so lustreless and so glassy that he had better borne to see than think upon appeared in the midst of the darkness light in themselves but giving light to nothing there were but two but they were everywhere if he shut out the sight there came the room with every wellknown objectsome indeed that he would have forgotten if he had gone over its contents from memoryeach in its accustomed place the body was in its place and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away he got up and rushed into the field without the figure was behind him he reentered the shed and shrunk down once more the eyes were there before he had lain himself along and here he remained in such terror as none but he can know trembling in every limb and the cold sweat starting from every pore when suddenly there arose upon the nightwind the noise of distant shouting and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder any sound of men in that lonely place even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm was something to him he regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger and springing to his feet rushed into the open air the broad sky seemed on fire rising into the air with showers of sparks and rolling one above the other were sheets of flame lighting the atmosphere for miles round and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood the shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar and he could hear the cry of fire mingled with the ringing of an alarmbell the fall of heavy bodies and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle and shot aloft as though refreshed by food the noise increased as he looked there were people theremen and womenlight bustle it was like new life to him he darted onwardstraight headlongdashing through brier and brake and leaping gate and fence as madly as the dog who careered with loud and sounding bark before him he came upon the spot there were halfdressed figures tearing to and fro some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables others driving the cattle from the yard and outhouses and others coming laden from the burning pile amidst a shower of falling sparks and the tumbling down of redhot beams the apertures where doors and windows stood an hour ago disclosed a mass of raging fire walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well the molten lead and iron poured down white hot upon the ground women and children shrieked and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers the clanking of the enginepumps and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood added to the tremendous roar he shouted too till he was hoarse and flying from memory and himself plunged into the thickest of the throng hither and thither he dived that nightnow working at the pumps and now hurrying through the smoke and flame but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest up and down the ladders upon the roofs of buildings over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight under the lee of falling bricks and stonesin every part of that great fire was he but he bore a charmed life and had neither scratch nor bruise nor weariness nor thought till morning dawned again and only smoke and blackened ruins remained this mad excitement over there returned with tenfold force the dreadful consciousness of his crime he looked suspiciously about him for the men were conversing in groups and he feared to be the subject of their talk the dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger and they drew off stealthily together he passed near an engine where some men were seated and they called to him to share in their refreshment he took some bread and meat and as he drank a draught of beer heard the firemen who were from london talking about the murder he has gone to birmingham they say said one but theyll have him yet for the scouts are out and by tomorrow night therell be a cry all through the country illustration sikes attempting to destroy his dog he hurried off and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground then lay down in a lane and had a long but broken and uneasy sleep he wandered on again irresolute and undecided and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night suddenly he took the desperate resolution of going back to london theres somebody to speak to there at all events he thought a good hidingplace too theyll never expect to nab me there after this country scent why cant i lay by for a week or so and forcing blunt from fagin get abroad to france damme ill risk it he acted upon this impulse without delay and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis and entering it at dusk by a circuitous route to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination the dog thoughif any descriptions of him were out it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing and had probably gone with him this might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets he resolved to drown him and walked on looking about for a pond picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went the animal looked up into his masters face while these preparations were makingand whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose or the robbers sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinaryskulked a little further in the rear than usual and cowered as he came more slowly along when his master halted at the brink of a pool and looked round to call him he stopped outright do you hear me call come here cried sikes whistling the animal came up from the very force of habit but as sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat he uttered a low growl and started back come back said the robber stamping on the ground the dog wagged his tail but moved not here sikes made a running noose and called him again the dog advanced retreated paused an instant turned and scoured away at his hardest speed the man whistled again and again and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return but no dog appeared and he resumed his journey chapter xlvii monks and mr brownlow at length meet their conversation and the intelligence that interrupts it the twilight was beginning to close in when mr brownlow alighted from a hackneycoach at his own door and knocked softly the door being opened a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps while another man who had been seated on the box dismounted too and stood upon the other side at a sign from mr brownlow they helped out a third man and taking him between them hurried him into the house this man was monks they walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking and mr brownlow preceding them led the way into a backroom at the door of this apartment monks who had ascended with evident reluctance stopped the two men looked to the old gentleman as if for instructions he knows the alternative said mr brownlow if he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him drag him into the street call for the aid of the police and impeach him as a felon in my name how dare you say this of me asked monks how dare you urge me to it young man replied mr brownlow confronting him with a steady look are you mad enough to leave this house unhand him there sir you are free to go and we to follow but i warn you by all i hold most solemn and most sacred that the instant you set foot in the street that instant will i have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery i am resolute and immoveable if you are determined to be the same your blood be upon your own head by what authority am i kidnapped in the street and brought here by these dogs asked monks looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him by mine replied mr brownlow those persons are indemnified by me if you complain of being deprived of your libertyyou had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along but you deemed it advisable to remain quieti say again throw yourself for protection upon the law i will appeal to the law too but when you have gone too far to recede do not sue to me for leniency when the power will have passed into other hands and do not say i plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed yourself monks was plainly disconcerted and alarmed besides he hesitated you will decide quickly said mr brownlow with perfect firmness and composure if you wish me to prefer my charges publicly and consign you to a punishment the extent of which although i can with a shudder foresee i cannot control once more i say you know the way if not and you appeal to my forbearance and the mercy of those you have deeply injured seat yourself without a word in that chair it has waited for you two whole days monks muttered some unintelligible words but wavered still you will be prompt said mr brownlow a word from me and the alternative has gone for ever still the man hesitated i have not the inclination to parley further said mr brownlow and as i advocate the dearest interests of others i have not the right is there demanded monks with a faltering tongueis thereno middle course none emphatically none monks looked at the old gentleman with an anxious eye but reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination walked into the room and shrugging his shoulders sat down lock the door on the outside said mr brownlow to the attendants and come when i ring the men obeyed and the two were left alone together this is pretty treatment sir said monks throwing down his hat and cloak from my fathers oldest friend it is because i was your fathers oldest friend young man returned mr brownlow it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her god in youth and left me here a solitary lonely manit is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters deathbed when he was yet a boy on the morning that wouldbut heaven willed otherwisehave made her my young wifeit is because my seared heart clung to him from that time forth through all his trials and errors till he diedit is because old recollections and associations fill my heart and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of himit is all these things that move me to treat you gently nowyes edward leeford even nowand blush for your unworthiness who bear the name what has the name to do with it asked the other after contemplating half in silence and half in dogged wonder the agitation of his companion what is the name to me nothing replied mr brownlow nothing to you but it was hers and even at this distance of time brings back to me an old man the glow and thrill which i once felt only to hear it repeated by a stranger i am very glad you have changed itveryvery this is all mighty fine said monks to retain his assumed designation after a long silence during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro and mr brownlow had sat shading his face with his hand but what do you want with me you have a brother said mr brownlow rousing himselfa brother the whisper of whose name in your ear when i came behind you in the street was in itself almost enough to make you accompany me hither in wonder and alarm i have no brother replied monks you know i was an only child why do you talk to me of brothers you know that as well as i attend to what i do know and you may not said mr brownlow i shall interest you by and by i know that of the wretched marriage into which family pride and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition forced your unhappy father when a mere boy you were the sole and most unnatural issue returned mr brownlow i dont care for hard names interrupted monks with a jeering laugh you know the fact and thats enough for me but i also know pursued the old gentleman the misery the slow torture the protracted anguish of that illassorted union i know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both i know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts how indifference gave place to dislike dislike to hate and hate to loathing until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder and retiring a wide space apart carried each a galling fragment of which nothing but death could break the rivets to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume your mother succeeded she forgot it soonbut it rusted and cankered at your fathers heart for years well they were separated said monks and what of that when they had been separated for some time returned mr brownlow and your mother wholly given up to continental frivolities had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior who with prospects blighted lingered on at home he fell among new friends this circumstance at least you know already not i said monks turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground as a man who is determined to deny everything not i your manner no less than your actions assures me that you have never forgotten it or ceased to think of it with bitterness returned mr brownlow i speak of fifteen years ago when you were not more than eleven years old and your father but oneandthirtyfor he was i repeat a boy when his father ordered him to marry must i go back to events that cast a shade upon the memory of your parent or will you spare it and disclose to me the truth i have nothing to disclose rejoined monks in evident confusion you must talk on if you will these new friends then said mr brownlow were a naval officer retired from active service whose wife had died some halfayear before and left him with two childrenthere had been more but of all their family happily but two survived they were both daughters one a beautiful creature of nineteen and the other a mere child of two or three years old whats this to me asked monks they resided said mr brownlow without seeming to hear the interruption in a part of the country to which your father in his wanderings had repaired and where he had taken up his abode acquaintance intimacy friendship fast followed on each other your father was gifted as few men arehe had his sisters soul and person as the old officer knew him more and more he grew to love him i would that it had ended there his daughter did the same the old gentleman paused monks was biting his lips with his eyes fixed upon the floor seeing this he immediately resumed the end of a year found him contracted solemnly contracted to that daughter the object of the first true ardent only passion of a guileless untried girl your tale is of the longest observed monks moving restlessly in his chair it is a true tale of grief and trial and sorrow young man returned mr brownlow and such tales usually are if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness it would be very brief at length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed as others are oftenit is no uncommon casedied and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning left him his panacea for all griefsmoney it was necessary that he should immediately repair to rome whither this man had sped for health and where he had died leaving his affairs in great confusion he went was seized with mortal illness there was followed the moment the intelligence reached paris by your mother who carried you with her he died the day after her arrival leaving no willno willso that the whole property fell to her and you at this part of the recital monks held his breath and listened with a face of intense eagerness though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker as mr brownlow paused he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief and wiped his hot face and hands before he went abroad and as he passed through london on his way said mr brownlow slowly and fixing his eyes upon the others facehe came to me i never heard of that interrupted monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous but savouring more of disagreeable surprise he came to me and left with me among some other things a picturea portrait painted by himselfa likeness of this poor girlwhich he did not wish to leave behind and could not carry forward on his hasty journey he was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow talked in a wild distracted way of ruin and dishonour worked by him confided to me his intention to convert his whole property at any loss into money and having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition to fly the countryi guessed too well he would not fly aloneand never see it more even from me his old and early friend whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to botheven from me he withheld any more particular confession promising to write and tell me all and after that to see me once again for the last time on earth alas that was the last time i had no letter and i never saw him more i went said mr brownlow after a short pause i went when all was over to the scene of hisi will use the term the world would use for harshness or favour are now alike to himof his guilty love resolved that if my fears were realized that erring child should find one heart and home open to shelter and compassionate her the family had left that part a week before they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding discharged them and left the place by night why or whither none could tell monks drew his breath yet more freely and looked round with a smile of triumph when your brother said mr brownlow drawing nearer to the others chairwhen your brothera feeble ragged neglected childwas cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy what cried monks starting by me said mr brownlow i told you i should interest you before long i say by mei see that your cunning associate suppressed my name although for aught he knew it would be quite strange to your ears when he was rescued by me then and lay recovering from sickness in my house his strong resemblance to this picture i have spoken of struck me with astonishment even when i first saw him in all his dirt and misery there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream i need not tell you he was snared away before i knew his history why not asked monks hastily because you know it well i denial to me is vain replied mr brownlow i shall show you that i know more than that youyoucant prove anything against me stammered monks i defy you to do it we shall see returned the old gentleman with a searching glance i lost the boy and no efforts of mine could recover him your mother being dead i knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could and as when i had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the west indieswhither as you well know you retired upon your mothers death to escape the consequences of vicious courses herei made the voyage you had left it months before and were supposed to be in london but no one could tell where i returned your agents had no clue to your residence you came and went they said as strangely as you had ever done sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy i wearied them with new applications i paced the streets by night and day but until two hours ago all my efforts were fruitless and i never saw you for an instant and now you do see me said monks rising boldly what then fraud and robbery are highsounding wordsjustified you think by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead mans brother you dont even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair you dont even know that i did not replied mr brownlow rising too but within the last fortnight i have learnt it all you have a brother you know it and him there was a will which your mother destroyed leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death it contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection which child was born and accidentally encountered by you when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to his father you repaired to the place of his birth there existed proofsproofs long suppressedof his birth and parentage those proofs were destroyed by you and now in your own words to your accomplice the jew the only proofs of the boys identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin unworthy son coward liaryou who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at nightyou whose plots and wiles have hurled a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as youyou who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own fathers heart and in whom all evil passions vice and profligacy festered till they found a vent in a hideous disease which has made your face an index even to your mindyou edward leeford do you brave me still no no no returned the coward overwhelmed by these accumulated charges every word cried the old gentleman every word that has passed between you and this detested villain is known to me shadows on the wall have caught your whispers and brought them to my ear the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue murder has been done to which you were morally if not really a party no no interposed monks iiknow nothing of that i was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me i didnt know the cause i thought it was a common quarrel it was the partial disclosure of your secrets replied mr brownlow will you disclose the whole yes i will set your hand to a statement of truth and facts and repeat it before witnesses that i promise too remain quietly here until such a document is drawn up and proceed with me to such a place as i may deem most advisable for the purpose of attesting it if you insist upon that ill do that also replied monks you must do more than that said mr brownlow make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child for such he is although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love you have not forgotten the provisions of the will carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned and then go where you please in this world you need meet no more while monks was pacing up and down meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading ittorn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the otherthe door was hurriedly unlocked and a gentleman mr losberne entered the room in violent agitation the man will be taken he cried he will be taken tonight the murderer asked mr brownlow yes yes replied the other his dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt and there seems little doubt that his master either is or will be there under cover of the darkness spies are hovering about in every direction i have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture and they tell me he can never escape a reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by government tonight i will give fifty more said mr brownlow and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot if i can reach it where is mr maylie harryas soon as he had seen your friend here safe in a coach with you he hurried off to where he heard this replied the doctor and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them the jewsaid mr brownlow what of him when i last heard he had not been taken but he will be or is by this time theyre sure of him have you made up your mind asked mr brownlow in a low voice of monks yes he replied youyouwill be secret with me i will remain here till i return it is your only hope of safety they left the room and the door was again locked what have you done asked the doctor in a whisper all that i could hope to do and even more coupling the poor girls intelligence with my previous knowledge and the result of our good friends inquiries on the spot i left him no loophole of escape and laid bare the whole villany which by these lights became plain as day write and appoint the evening after tomorrow at seven for the meeting we shall be down there a few hours before but shall require rest and especially the young lady who may have greater need of firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now but my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature which way have they taken drive straight to the office and you will be in time replied mr losberne i will remain here the two gentlemen hastily separated each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable chapter xlviii the pursuit and escape near to that part of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe abuts where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of closebuilt lowroofed houses there exists at the present day the filthiest the strangest the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in london wholly unknown even by name to the great mass of its inhabitants to reach this place the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close narrow and muddy streets thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion the cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesmans door and stream from the houseparapet and windows jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class ballastheavers coalwhippers brazen women ragged children and the very raff and refuse of the river he makes his way with difficulty along assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner arriving at length in streets remoter and lessfrequented than those through which he has passed he walks beneath tottering housefronts projecting over the pavement dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away and every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect in such a neighbourhood beyond dockhead in the borough of southwark stands jacobs island surrounded by a muddy ditch six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in once called mill pond but known in these days as folly ditch it is a creek or inlet from the thames and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the lead mills from which it took its old name at such times a stranger looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at milllane will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows buckets pails domestic utensils of all kinds in which to haul the water up and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half adozen houses with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath windows broken and patched with poles thrust out on which to dry the linen that is never there rooms so small so filthy so confined that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and threatening to fall into itas some have done dirtbesmeared walls and decaying foundations every repulsive lineament of poverty every loathsome indication of filth rot and garbageall these ornament the banks of folly ditch in jacobs island the warehouses are roofless and empty the walls are crumbling down the windows are windows no more the doors are falling into the street the chimneys are blackened but they yield no smoke thirty or forty years ago before losses and chancery suits came upon it it was a thriving place but now it is a desolate island indeed the houses have no owners they are broken open and entered upon by those who have the courage and there they live and there they die they must have powerful motives for a secret residence or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed who seek a refuge in jacobs island in an upper room of one of these housesa detached house of fair size ruinous in other respects but strongly defended at door and window of which the back commanded the ditch in manner already describedthere were assembled three men who regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence one of these was toby crackit another mr chitling and the third a robber of fifty years whose nose had been almost beaten in in some old scuffle and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion this man was a returned transport and his name was kags i wish said toby turning to mr chitling that you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm and not come here my fine feller why didnt you blunderhead said kags well i thought youd have been a little more glad to see me than this replied mr chitling with a melancholy air why looke young gentleman said toby when a man keeps himself so very exclusive as i have done and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody prying and smelling about it its rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency circumstanced as you are especially when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him thats arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return added mr kags there was a short silence after which toby crackit seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devilmaycare swagger turned to chitling and said when was fagin took then just at dinnertimetwo oclock this afternoon was the reply charley and i made our lucky up the washus chimney and bolter got into the empty waterbutt head downwards but his legs was so precious long that they stuck out at the top and so they took him too and bet poor bet she went to see the body to speak to who it was replied chitling his countenance falling more and more and went off mad screaming and raving and beating her head against the boards so they put a strait weskut on her and took her to the hospitaland there she is wots come of young bates demanded kags he hung about not to come over here afore dark but hell be here soon replied chitling theres nowhere else to go to now for the people at the cripples are all in custody and the bar of the keni went up there and saw it with my own eyesis filled with traps this is a smash observed toby biting his lips theres more than one will go with this the sessions are on said kags if they get the inquest over if bolter turns kings evidence as of course he will from what hes said already they can prove fagin an accessory before the fact and get the trial on on friday hell swing in six days from this by g you should have heard the people groan said chitling the officers fought like devils or theyd have torn him away he was down once but they made a ring round him and fought their way along you should have seen how he looked about him all muddy and bleeding and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends i can see em now not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob and dragging him along amongst em i can see the people jumping up one behind another and snarling with their teeth and making at him like wild beasts i can see the blood upon his hair and beard and hear the dreadful cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner and swore theyd tear his heart out the horrorstricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears and with his eyes fast closed got up and paced violently to and fro like one distracted whilst he was thus engaged and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs and sikess dog bounded into the room they ran to the window down stairs and into the street the dog had jumped in at an open window he made no attempt to follow them nor was his master to be seen whats the meaning of this said toby when they had returned he cant be coming here iihope not if he was coming here hed have come with the dog said kags stooping down to examine the animal who lay panting on the floor here give us some water for him he has run himself faint hes drunk it all up every drop said kags after watching the dog some time in silence covered with mudlamehalfblindhe must have come a long way where can he have come from exclaimed toby hes been to the other kens of course and finding them filled with strangers come on here where hes been many a time and often but where can he have come from first and how comes he here alone without the other he none of them called the murderer by his old name he cant have made away with himself what do you think said chitling toby shook his head if he had said kags the dog ud want to lead us away to where he did it no i think hes got out of the country and left the dog behind he must have given him the slip somehow or he wouldnt be so easy this solution appearing the most probable one was adopted as the right and the dog creeping under a chair coiled himself up to sleep without further notice from anybody it being now dark the shutter was closed and a candle lighted and placed upon the table the terrible events of the two days had made a deep impression upon all three increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position they drew their chairs closer together starting at every sound they spoke little and that in whispers and were as silent and awestricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room they had sat thus some time when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below young bates said kags looking angrily round to check the fear he felt himself the knocking came again no it wasnt he he never knocked like that crackit went to the window and shaking all over drew in his head there was no need to tell them who it was his pale face was enough the dog too was on the alert in an instant and ran whining to the door we must let him in he said taking up the candle isnt there any help for it asked the other man in a hoarse voice none he must come in dont leave us in the dark said kags taking down a candle from the chimneypiece and lighting it with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished crackit went down to the door and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief and another tied over his head under his hat he drew them slowly offblanched face sunken eyes hollow cheeks beard of three days growth wasted flesh short thick breath it was the very ghost of sikes he laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room but shuddering as he was about to drop into it and seeming to glance over his shoulder dragged it back close to the wallas close as it would goground it against itand sat down not a word had been exchanged he looked from one to another in silence if an eye was furtively raised and met his it was instantly averted when his hollow voice broke silence they all three started they had never heard its tones before how came that dog here he asked alone three hours ago tonights paper says that fagins taken is it true or a lie quite true they were silent again damn you all said sikes passing his hand across his forehead have you nothing to say to me there was an uneasy movement among them but nobody spoke you that keep this house said sikes turning his face to crackit do you mean to sell me or to let me lie here till this hunt is over you may stop here if you think it safe returned the person addressed after some hesitation sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it and said isitthe bodyis it buried they shook their heads why isnt it said the man with the same glance behind him wot do they keep such ugly things as that above the ground forwhos that knocking crackit intimated by a motion of his hand as he left the room that there was nothing to fear and directly came back with charley bates behind him sikes sat opposite the door so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure toby said the boy falling back as sikes turned his eyes towards him why didnt you tell me this down stairs there had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad accordingly he nodded and made as though he would shake hands with him let me go into some other room said the boy retreating still further why charley said sikes stepping forward dont youdont you know me dont come nearer me answered the boy still retreating and looking with horror in his eyes upon the murderers face you monster the man stopped halfway and they looked at each other but sikess eyes sunk gradually to the ground witness you three cried the boy shaking his clenched fist and becoming more and more excited as he spoke witness you threeim not afraid of himif they come here after him ill give him up i will i tell you out at once he may kill me for it if he likes or if he dares but if im here ill give him up id give him up if he was to be boiled alive murder help if theres the pluck of a man among you three youll help me murder help down with him pouring out these cries and accompanying them with violent gesticulation the boy actually threw himself singlehanded upon the strong man and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise brought him heavily to the ground the three spectators seemed quite transfixed and stupified they offered no interference and the boy and man rolled on the ground together the former heedless of the blows that showered upon him wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderers breast and never ceasing to call for help with all his might the contest however was too unequal to last long sikes had him down and his knee was on his throat when crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm and pointed to the window there were lights gleaming below voices in loud and earnest conversation the tramp of hurried footstepsendless they seemed in numbercrossing the nearest woodenbridge one man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement the gleam of lights increased the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on then came a loud knocking at the door and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail help shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air hes here hes here break down the door in the kings name cried voices without and the hoarse cry arose again but louder break down the door screamed the boy i tell you theyll never open it run straight to the room where the light is break down the door strokes thick and heavy rattled upon the door and lower windowshutters as he ceased to speak and a loud huzzah burst from the crowdgiving the listener for the first time some adequate idea of its immense extent open the door of some place where i can lock this screeching hellbabe cried sikes fiercely running to and fro and dragging the boy now as easily as if he were an empty sack that door quick he flung him in bolted it and turned the key is the down stairs door fast doublelocked and chained replied crackit who with the other two men still remained quite helpless and bewildered the panelsare they strong lined with sheetiron and the windows too yes and the windows damn you cried the desperate ruffian throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd do your worst ill cheat you yet of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears none could exceed the cry of that infuriated throng some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire others roared to the officers to shoot him dead among them all none showed such fury as the man on horseback who throwing himself out of the saddle and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water cried beneath the window in a voice that rose above all others twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder the nearest voices took up the cry and hundreds echoed it some called for ladders some for sledgehammers some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them and still came back and roared again some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen and thus impeded the progress of those below some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the waterspout and crevices in the wall and all waved to and fro in the darkness beneath like a field of corn moved by an angry wind and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar the tide cried the murderer as he staggered back into the room and shut the faces out the tide was in as i came up give me a rope a long rope theyre all in front i may drop into the folly ditch and clear off that way give me a rope or i shall do three more murders and kill myself at last the panicstricken men pointed to where such articles were kept the murderer hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord hurried up to the housetop all the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked and that was too small even for the passage of his body but from this aperture he had never ceased to call on those without to guard the back and thus when the murderer emerged at last on the housetop by the door in the roof a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front who immediately began to pour round pressing upon each other in one unbroken stream he planted a board which he had carried up with him for the purpose so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside and creeping over the tiles looked over the low parapet the water was out and the ditch a bed of mud the crowd had been hushed during these few moments watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers again and again it rose those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning took up the sound it echoed and reechoed it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him on pressed the people from the fronton on on in one strong struggling current of angry faces with here and there a glaring torch to light them up and show them out in all their wrath and passion the houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob sashes were thrown up or torn bodily out there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window and cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every housetop each little bridge and there were three in sight bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it and still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts and only for an instant see the wretch they have him now cried a man on the nearest bridge hurrah the crowd grew light with uncovered heads and again the shout uprose i promise fifty pounds cried an old gentleman from the same quarter fifty pounds to the man who takes him alive i will remain here till he comes to ask me for it there was another roar at this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room the stream abruptly turned as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth and the people at the windows seeing those upon the bridges pouring back quitted their stations and running into the street joined the concourse that now thronged pellmell to the spot they had left each man crushing and striving with his neighbour and all panting with impatience to get near the door and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out the cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion were dreadful the narrow ways were completely blocked up and at this time between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer although the universal eagerness for his capture was if possible increased the man had shrunk down thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd and the impossibility of escape but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it occurred he sprung upon his feet determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch and at the risk of being stifled endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion roused into new strength and energy and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected he set his foot against the stack of chimneys fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second he could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop at the very instant that he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his armpits and when the old gentleman beforementioned who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd and retain his position earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself downat that very instant the murderer looking behind him on the roof threw his arms above his head and uttered a yell of terror the eyes again he cried in an unearthly screech staggering as if struck by lightning he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet the noose was at his neck it ran up with his weight tight as a bowstring and swift as the arrow it speeds he fell for fiveandthirty feet there was a sudden jerk a terrific convulsion of the limbs and there he hung with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand the old chimney quivered with the shock but stood it bravely the murderer swung lifeless against the wall and the boy thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view called to the people to come and take him out for gods sake a dog which had lain concealed till now ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl and collecting himself for a spring jumped for the dead mans shoulders missing his aim he fell into the ditch turning completely over as he went and striking his head against a stone dashed out his brains chapter xlix affording an explanation of more mysteries than one and comprehending a proposal of marriage with no word of settlement or pinmoney the events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old when oliver found himself at three oclock in the afternoon in a travelingcarriage rolling fast towards his native town mrs maylie and rose and mrs bedwin and the good doctor were with him and mr brownlow followed in a postchaise accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned they had not talked much upon the way for oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts and almost of speech and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions who shared it in at least an equal degree he and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by mr brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from monks and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense the same kind friend had with mr losbernes assistance cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that had so recently taken place it was quite true he said that they must know them before long but it might be at a better time than the present and it could not be at a worse so they travelled on in silence each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all but if oliver under these influences had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birthplace by a road he had never seen how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot a poor houseless wandering boy without a friend to help him or a roof to shelter his head see there there cried oliver eagerly clasping the hand of rose and pointing out at the carriage windowthats the stile i came over there are the hedges i crept behind for fear any one should overtake me and force me back yonder is the path across the fields leading to the old house where i was a little child oh dick dick my dear old friend if i could only see you now you will see him soon replied rose gently taking his folded hands between her own you shall tell him how happy you are and how rich you have grown and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too yes yes said oliver and wellwell take him away from here and have him clothed and taught and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and wellshall we rose nodded yes for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak you will be kind and good to him for you are to every one said oliver it will make you cry i know to hear what he can tell but never mind never mind it will be all over and you will smile again i know that tooto think how changed he is you did the same with me he said god bless you to me when i ran away cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion and i will say god bless you now and show him how i love him for it as they approached the town and at length drove through its narrow streets it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds there was sowerberrys the undertakers just as it used to be only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered itall the wellknown shops and houses with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connectedgamfields cart the very cart he used to have standing at the old publichouse doorthe workhouse the dreary prison of his youthful days with its dismal windows frowning on the streetthe same lean porter standing at the gate at sight of whom oliver involuntarily shrunk back and then laughed at himself for being so foolish then cried then laughed againscores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite wellnearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday and all his recent life had been but a happy dream but it was pure earnest joyful reality they drove straight to the door of the chief hotel which oliver used to stare up at with awe and think a mighty palace but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size and here was mr grimwig all ready to receive them kissing the young lady and the old one too when they got out of the coach as if he were the grandfather of the whole party all smiles and kindness and not offering to eat his headno not once not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to london and maintained he knew it best though he had only come that way once and that time fast asleep there was dinner prepared and there were bedrooms ready and everything was arranged as if by magic notwithstanding all this when the hurry of the first half hour was over the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down mr brownlow did not join them at dinner but remained in a separate room the two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces and during the short intervals that they were present conversed apart once mrs maylie was called away and after being absent for nearly an hour returned with eyes swollen with weeping all these things made rose and oliver who were not in any new secrets nervous and uncomfortable they sat wondering in silence or if they exchanged a few words spoke in whispers as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices at length when nine oclock had come and they began to think they were to hear no more that night mr losberne and mr grimwig entered the room followed by mr brownlow and a man whom oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see for they told him it was his brother and it was the same man he had met at the market town and seen looking in with fagin at the window of his little room he cast a look of hate which even then he could not dissemble at the astonished boy and sat down near the door mr brownlow who had papers in his hand walked to a table near which rose and oliver were seated this is a painful task said he but these declarations which have been signed in london before many gentlemen must be in substance repeated here i would have spared you the degradation but we must hear them from your own lips before we part and you know why go on said the person addressed turning away his face quick i have done enough dont keep me here this child said mr brownlow drawing oliver to him and laying his hand upon his head is your halfbrother the illegitimate son of your father and my dear friend edwin leeford by poor young agnes fleming who died in giving him birth yes said monks scowling at the trembling boy the beating of whose heart he might have heard that is their bastard child the term you use said mr brownlow sternly is a reproach to those who long since passed beyond the feeble censure of this world it reflects true disgrace on no one living except you who use it let that pass he was born in this town in the workhouse of this town was the sullen reply you have the story there he pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke i must have it here too said mr brownlow looking round upon the listeners listen then returned monks his father being taken ill at rome as you know was joined by his wife my mother from whom he had been long separated who went from paris and took me with herto look after his property for what i know for she had no great affection for him nor he for her he knew nothing of us for his senses were gone and he slumbered on till next day when he died among the papers in his desk were two dated on the night his illness first came on directed to yourself and enclosed in a few short lines to you with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead one of these papers was a letter to this girl agnes and the other a will what of the letter asked mr brownlow the lettera sheet of paper crossed and crossed again with a penitent confession and prayers to god to help her he had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mysteryto be explained one dayprevented his marrying her just then and so she had gone on trusting patiently to him until she trusted too far and lost what none could ever give her back she was at that time within a few months of her confinement he told her all he had meant to do to hide her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse his memory or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child for all the guilt was his he reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon herprayed her yet to keep it and wear it next her heart as she had done beforeand then ran on wildly in the same words over and over again as if he had gone distractedas i believe he had the will said mr brownlow as olivers tears fell fast i will go on to that the will was in the same spirit as that letter he talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him of the rebellious disposition vice malice and premature bad passions of you his only son who had been trained to hate him and left you and your mother each an annuity of eight hundred pounds the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portionsone for agnes fleming and the other for their child if it should be born alive and ever come of age if it was a girl it was to come into the money unconditionally but if a boy only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour meanness cowardice or wrong he did this he said to mark his confidence in the mother and his convictiononly strengthened by approaching deaththat the child would share her gentle heart and noble nature if he was disappointed in this expectation then the money was to come to you for then and not till then when both children were equal would he recognize your prior claim upon his purse who had none upon his heart but had from an infant repulsed him with coldness and aversion my mother said monks in a louder tone did what a woman should have doneshe burnt this will the letter never reached its destination but that and other proofs she kept in case they ever tried to lie away the blot the girls father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hatei love her for it nowcould add goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of wales changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat and here no great while afterwards he was found dead in his bed the girl had left her home in secret some weeks before he had searched for her on foot in every town and village near and it was on the night that he returned home assured that she had destroyed herself to hide her shame and his that his old heart broke there was a short silence here until mr brownlow took up the thread of the narrative years after this he said this mansedward leefords mothercame to me he had left her when only eighteen robbed her of jewels and money gambled squandered forged and fled to london where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts she was sinking under a painful and incurable disease and wished to recover him before she died inquiries were set on foot strict searches made unavailing for a long time but ultimately successful and he went back with her to france there she died said monks after a lingering illness and on her deathbed she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved though she need not have left me that for i had inherited it long before she would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself and the child too but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born and was alive i swore to her if ever it crossed my path to hunt it down never to let it rest to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it if i could to the very gallowsfoot she was right he came in my way at last i began well and but for babbling drabs i would have finished as i began i would i would as the villain folded his arms tight together and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice mr brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him and explained that the jew who had been his old accomplice and confident had a large reward for keeping oliver ensnared of which some part was to be given up in the event of his being rescued and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him the locket and ring said mr brownlow turning to monks i bought them from the man and woman i told you of who stole them from the nurse who stole them from the corpse answered monks without raising his eyes you know what became of them mr brownlow merely nodded to mr grimwig who disappearing with great alacrity shortly returned pushing in mrs bumble and dragging her unwilling consort after him do my his deceive me cried mr bumble with illfeigned enthusiasm or is that little oliver oh oliver if you knowd how ive been agrieving for you hold your tongue fool murmured mrs bumble isnt natur natur mrs bumble remonstrated the workhouse master cant i be supposed to feeli as brought him up porochiallywhen i see him asetting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description i always loved that boy as if hed been mymymy own grandfather said mr bumble halting for an appropriate comparison master oliver my dear you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat ah he went to heaven last week in a oak coffin with plated handles oliver come sir said mr grimwig tartly suppress your feelings i will do my endeavours sir replied mr bumble how do you do sir i hope you are very well this salutation was addressed to mr brownlow who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple and who inquired as he pointed to monks do you know that person no replied mrs bumble flatly perhaps you dont said mr brownlow addressing her spouse i never saw him in all my life said mr bumble nor sold him anything perhaps no replied mrs bumble you never had perhaps a certain gold locket and ring said mr brownlow certainly not replied the matron what are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this for again mr brownlow nodded to mr grimwig and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness but not again did he return with a stout man and wife for this time he led in two palsied women who shook and tottered as they walked you shut the door the night old sally died said the foremost one raising her shrivelled hand but you couldnt shut out the sound nor stop the chinks no no said the other looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws no no no we heard her try to tell you what shed done and saw you take a paper from her hand and watched you too next day to the pawnbrokers shop said the first yes added the second and it was a locket and gold ring we found out that and saw it given you we were bye oh we were bye and we know more than that resumed the first for she told us often long ago that the young mother had told her that feeling she should never get over it she was on her way at the time that she was taken ill to die near the grave of the father of the child would you like to see the pawnbroker himself asked mr grimwig with a motion towards the door no replied the woman if heshe pointed to monkshas been coward enough to confess as i see he has and you have sounded all these hags till you found the right ones i have nothing more to say i did sell them and theyre where youll never get them what then nothing replied mr brownlow except that it remains for us to take care that you are neither of you employed in a situation of trust again you may leave the room i hope said mr bumble looking about him with great ruefulness as mr grimwig disappeared with the two old women i hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office indeed it will replied mr brownlow you must make up your mind to that and think yourself well off besides it was all mrs bumbleshe would do it urged mr bumble first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room that is no excuse returned mr brownlow you were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets and indeed are the more guilty of the two in the eye of the law for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction if the law supposes that said mr bumble squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands the law is a assa idiot if that is the eye of the law the laws a bachelor and the worst i wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experienceby experience laying great stress on the repetition of these two words mr bumble fixed his hat on very tight and putting his hands in his pockets followed his helpmate down stairs young lady said mr brownlow turning to rose give me your hand do not tremble you need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say if they havei do not know how they can but if they haveany reference to me said rose pray let me hear them at some other time i have not strength or spirits now nay returned the old gentleman drawing her arm through his you have more fortitude than this i am sure do you know this young lady sir yes replied monks i never saw you before said rose faintly i have seen you often returned monks the father of the unhappy agnes had two daughters said mr brownlow what was the fate of the otherthe child the child replied monks when her father died in a strange place in a strange name without a letter book or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be tracedthe child was taken by some wretched cottagers who reared it as their own go on said mr brownlow signing to mrs maylie to approach go on you couldnt find the spot to which these people had repaired said monks but where friendship fails hatred will often force a way my mother found it after a year of cunning searchay and found the child she took it did she no the people were poor and began to sickenat least the man didof their fine humanity so she left it with them giving them a small present of money which would not last long and promising more which she never meant to send she didnt quite rely however on their discontent and poverty for the childs unhappiness but told the history of the sisters shame with such alterations as suited her bade them take good heed of the child for she came of bad blood and told them she was illegitimate and sure to go wrong one time or other the circumstances countenanced all this the people believed it and there the child dragged on an existence miserable enough even to satisfy us until a widow lady residing then at chester saw the girl by chance pitied her and took her home there was some cursed spell against us for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy i lost sight of her two or three years ago and saw her no more until a few months back do you see her now yesleaning on your arm but not the less my niece cried mrs maylie folding the fainting girl in her armsnot the less my dearest child i would not lose her now for all the treasures of the world my sweet companion my own dear girl the only friend i ever had cried rose clinging to herthe kindest best of friends my heart will burst i cannotcannotbear all this you have borne more and been through all the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew said mrs maylie embracing her tenderly come come my love remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms poor childsee herelook look my dear not aunt cried oliver throwing his arms about her neck ill never call her auntsister my own dear sister that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the firstrose dear darling rose let the tears which fell and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans be sacred a father sister and mother were gained and lost in that one moment joy and grief were mingled in the cup but there were no bitter tears for even grief itself arose so softened and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections that it became a solemn pleasure and lost all character of pain they were a long long time alone a soft tap at the door at length announced that some one was without oliver opened it glided away and gave place to harry maylie i know it all he said taking a seat beside the lovely girl dear rose i know it all i am not here by accident he added after a lengthened silence nor have i heard all this tonight for i knew it yesterdayonly yesterday do you guess that i have come to remind you of a promise stay said roseyou do know all all you gave me leave at any time within a year to renew the subject of our last discourse i did not to press you to alter your determination pursued the young man but to hear you repeat it if you would i was to lay whatever of station or fortune i might possess at your feet and if you still adhered to your former determination i pledged myself by no word or act to seek to change it the same reasons which influenced me then will influence me now said rose firmly if i ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering when should i ever feel it as i should tonight it is a struggle said rose but one i am proud to make it is a pang but one my heart shall bear the disclosure of tonight harry began the disclosure of tonight replied rose softly leaves me in the same position with reference to you as that in which i stood before you harden your heart against me rose urged her lover oh harry harry said the young lady bursting into tears i wish i could and spare myself this pain then why inflict it on yourself said harry taking her hand think dear rose think what you have heard tonight and what have i heard what have i heard cried rose that a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned allthere we have said enough harry we have said enough not yet not yet said the young man detaining her as she rose my hopes my wishes prospects feelingevery thought in life except my love for youhave undergone a change i offer you now no distinction among a bustling crowd no mingling with a world of malice and detraction where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame but a homea heart and homeyes dearest rose and those and those alone are all i have to offer what does this mean faltered the young lady it means but thisthat when i left you last i left you with the firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me resolved that if my world could not be yours i would make yours mine that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you for i would turn from it this i have done those who have shrunk from me because of this have shrunk from you and proved you so far right such power and patronagesuch relatives of influence and rankas smiled upon me then look coldly now but there are smiling fields and waving trees in englands richest county and by one village churchmine rose my ownthere stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of than all the hopes i have renounced measured a thousandfold this is my rank and station now and here i lay it down its a trying thing waiting supper for lovers said mr grimwig waking up and pulling his pocket handkerchief from over his head truth to tell the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time neither mrs maylie nor harry nor rose who all came in together could offer a word in extenuation i had serious thoughts of eating my head tonight said mr grimwig for i began to think i should get nothing else ill take the liberty if youll allow me of saluting the bride that is to be mr grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl and the example being contagious was followed both by the doctor and mr brownlow some people affirm that harry maylie had been observed to set it originally in a dark room adjoining but the best authorities consider this downright scandal he being young and a clergyman oliver my child said mrs maylie where have you been and why do you look so sad there are tears stealing down your face at this moment what is the matter it is a world of disappointmentoften to the hopes we most cherish and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour poor dick was dead chapter l the jews last night alive the court was paved from floor to roof with human faces inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space from the rail before the dock away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries all looks were fixed upon one manthe jew before him and behind above below on the right and on the lefthe seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament all bright with beaming eyes he stood there in all this glare of living light with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him the other held to his ear and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge who was delivering his charge to the jury at times he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness looked towards his counsel in mute appeal that he would even then urge something in his behalf beyond these manifestations of anxiety he stirred not hand or foot he had scarcely moved since the trial began and now that the judge ceased to speak he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention with his gaze bent on him as though he listened still a slight bustle in the court recalled him to himself and looking round he saw that the jurymen had turned together to consider of their verdict as his eyes wandered to the gallery he could see the people rising above each other to see his face some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence a few there were who seemed unmindful of him and looked only to the jury in impatient wonder how they could delay but in no one facenot even among the women of whom there were many therecould he read the faintest sympathy with him or any feeling but one of allabsorbing interest that he should be condemned as he saw all this in one bewildered glance the deathlike stillness came again and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge hush they only sought permission to retire he looked wistfully into their faces one by one when they passed out as though to see which way the greater number leant but that was fruitless the jailer touched him on the shoulder he followed mechanically to the end of the dock and sat down on a chair the man pointed it out or he should not have seen it he looked up into the gallery again some of the people were eating and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs for the crowded place was very hot there was one young man sketching his face in a little notebook he wondered whether it was like and looked on when the artist broke his pencilpoint and made another with his knife as any idle spectator might have done in the same way when he turned his eyes towards the judge his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress and what it cost and how he put it on there was an old fat gentleman on the bench too who had gone out some half an hour before and now came back he wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner what he had had and where he had had it and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another not that all this time his mind was for an instant free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet it was ever present to him but in a vague and general way and he could not fix his thoughts upon it thus even while he trembled and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death he fell to counting the iron spikes before him and wondering how the head of one had been broken off and whether they would mend it or leave it as it was then he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool itand then went on to think again at length there was a cry of silence and a breathless look from all towards the door the jury returned and passed him close he could glean nothing from their faces they might as well have been of stone perfect stillness ensuednot a rustlenot a breathguilty the building rang with a tremendous shout and another and another and then it echoed deep loud groans that gathered strength as they swelled out like angry thunder it was a peal of joy from the populace outside greeting the news that he would die on monday the noise subsided and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him he had resumed his listening attitude and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it and then he only muttered that he was an old manan old manan old manand so dropping into a whisper was silent again the judge assumed the black cap and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture a woman in the gallery uttered some exclamation called forth by this dread solemnity he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption and bent forward yet more attentively the address was solemn and impressive the sentence fearful to hear but he stood like a marble figure without the motion of a nerve his haggard face was still thrust forward his underjaw hanging down and his eyes staring out before him when the jailer put his hand upon his arm and beckoned him away he gazed stupidly about him for an instant and obeyed illustration fagin in the condemned cell they led him through a paved room under the court where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came and others were talking to their friends who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard there was nobody there to speak to him but as he passed the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars and they assailed him with opprobrious names and screeched and hissed he shook his fist and would have spat upon them but his conductors hurried him on through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps into the interior of the prison here he was searched that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law this ceremony performed they led him to one of the condemned cells and left him therealone he sat down on a stone bench opposite the door which served for seat and bedstead and casting his bloodshot eyes upon the ground tried to collect his thoughts after a while he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said though it had seemed to him at the time that he could not hear a word these gradually fell into their proper places and by degrees suggested more so that in a little time he had the whole almost as it was delivered to be hanged by the neck till he was deadthat was the end to be hanged by the neck till he was dead as it came on very dark he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffoldsome of them through his means they rose up in such quick succession that he could hardly count them he had seen some of them dieand joked too because they died with prayers upon their lips with what a rattling noise the drop went down and how suddenly they changed from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes some of them might have inhabited that very cellsat upon that very spot it was very dark why didnt they bring a light the cell had been built for many yearsscores of men must have passed their last hours thereit was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodiesthe cap the noose the pinioned armsthe faces that he knew even beneath that hideous veillight light at length when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls two men appeared one bearing a candle which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall and the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night for the prisoner was to be left alone no more then came nightdark dismal silent night other watchers are glad to hear the churchclocks strike for they tell of life and coming day to the jew they brought despair the boom of every iron bell came laden with the one deep hollow sounddeath what availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning which penetrated even there to him it was another form of knell with mockery added to the warning the day passed offday there was no day it was gone as soon as comeand night came on again night so long and yet so short long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours one time he raved and blasphemed and at another howled and tore his hair venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him but he had driven them away with curses they renewed their charitable efforts and he beat them off saturday night he had only one night more to live and as he thought of this the day brokesunday it was not until the night of this last awful day that a withering sense of his helpless desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul not that he had ever held any defined or positive hopes of mercy but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon he had spoken little to either of the two men who relieved each other in their attendance upon him and they for their parts made no effort to rouse his attention he had sat there awake but dreaming now he started up every minute and with gasping mouth and burning skin hurried to and fro in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even theyused to such sightsrecoiled from him with horror he grew so terrible at last in all the tortures of his evil conscience that one man could not bear to sit there eyeing him alone and so the two kept watch together he cowered down upon his stone bed and thought of the past he had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth his red hair hung down upon his bloodless face his beard was torn and twisted into knots his eyes shone with a terrible light his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up eightnineten if it was not a trick to frighten him and those were the real hours treading on each others heels where would he be when they came round again eleven another struck ere the voice of the hour before had ceased to vibrate at eight he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train at eleven those dreadful walls of newgate which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish not only from the eyes but too often and too long from the thoughts of men never held so dread a spectacle as that the few who lingered as they passed and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hung tomorrow would have slept but ill that night if they could have seen him then from early in the evening until nearly midnight little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodgegate and inquired with anxious faces whether any reprieve had been received these being answered in the negative communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out and showed where the scaffold would be built and walking with unwilling steps away turned back to conjure up the scene by degrees they fell off one by one and for an hour in the dead of night the street was left to solitude and darkness the space before the prison was cleared and a few strong barriers painted black had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd when mr brownlow and oliver appeared at the wicket and presented an order of admission to the prisoner signed by one of the sheriffs they were immediately admitted into the lodge is the young gentleman to come too sir said the man whose duty it was to conduct them its not a sight for children sir it is not indeed my friend rejoined mr brownlow but my business with this man is intimately connected with him and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villany i think it bettereven at the cost of some pain and fearthat he should see him now these few words had been said apart so as to be inaudible to oliver the man touched his hat and glancing at him with some curiosity opened another gate opposite to that at which they had entered and led them on through dark and winding ways towards the cells this said the man stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silencethis is the place he passes through if you step this way you can see the door he goes out at he led them into a stone kitchen fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food and pointed to a door there was an open grating above it through which came the sound of mens voices mingled with the noise of hammering and the throwing down of boards they were putting up the scaffold from this place they passed through several strong gates opened by other turnkeys from the inner side and having entered an open yard ascended a flight of narrow steps and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand motioning them to remain where they were the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys the two attendants after a little whispering came out into the passage stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell they did so the condemned criminal was seated on his bed rocking himself from side to side with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man his mind was evidently wandering to his old life for he continued to mutter without seeming conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision good boy charleywell done he mumbled oliver too ha ha ha oliver tooquite the gentleman nowquite thetake that boy away to bed the jailer took the disengaged hand of oliver and whispering him not to be alarmed looked on without speaking take him away to bed cried the jew do you hear me some of you he has been thethesomehow the cause of all this its worth the money to bring him up to itbolters throat bill never mind the girlbolters throat as deep as you can cut saw his head off fagin said the jailer thats me cried the jew falling instantly into precisely the same attitude of listening that he had assumed upon his trial an old man my lord a very old old man here said the turnkey laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down heres somebody wants to see you to ask you some questions i suppose fagin fagin are you a man i shant be one long replied the jew looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror strike them all dead what right have they to butcher me as he spoke he caught sight of oliver and mr brownlow and shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat demanded to know what they wanted there steady said the turnkey still holding him down now sir tell him what you wantquick if you please for he grows worse as the time gets on you have some papers said mr brownlow advancing which were placed in your hands for better security by a man called monks its all a lie together replied the jew i havent onenot one for the love of god said mr brownlow solemnly do not say that now upon the very verge of death but tell me where they are you know that sikes is dead that monks has confessed that there is no hope of any further gain where are these papers oliver cried the jew beckoning to him here here let me whisper to you i am not afraid said oliver in a low voice as he relinquished mr brownlows hand the papers said the jew drawing him towards him are in a canvass bag in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top frontroom i want to talk to you my deari want to talk to you yes yes returned oliver let me say a prayer do let me say one prayer say only one upon your knees with me and we will talk till morning outside outside replied the jew pushing the boy before him towards the door and looking vacantly over his head say ive gone to sleeptheyll believe you you can get me out if you take me so now then now then oh god forgive this wretched man cried the boy with a burst of tears thats right thats right said the jew thatll help us on this door first if i shake and tremble as we pass the gallows dont you mind but hurry on now now now have you nothing else to ask him sir inquired the turnkey no other question replied mr brownlow if i hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position nothing will do that sir replied the man shaking his head you had better leave him the door of the cell opened and the attendants returned press on press on cried the jew softly but not so slow faster faster the men laid hands upon him and disengaging oliver from his grasp held him back he writhed and struggled with the power of desperation and sent up shriek upon shriek that penetrated even those massive walls and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard it was some time before they left the prison for oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene and was so weak that for an hour or more he had not the strength to walk day was dawning when they again emerged a great multitude had already assembled the windows were filled with people smoking and playing cards to beguile the time the crowd were pushing quarrelling and joking everything told of life and animation but one dark cluster of objects in the very centre of allthe black stage the crossbeam the rope and all the hideous apparatus of death chapter li and last the fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed and what little remains to their historian to relate is told in few and simple words before three months had passed rose fleming and harry maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergymans labours on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home mrs maylie took up her abode with her son and daughterinlaw to enjoy during the tranquil remainder of her days the greatest felicity that age and worth can knowthe contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a wellspent life have been unceasingly bestowed it appeared on a full and careful investigation that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of monks which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother were equally divided between himself and oliver it would yield to each little more than three thousand pounds by the provisions of his fathers will oliver would have been entitled to the whole but mr brownlow unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career proposed this mode of distribution to which his young charge most joyfully acceded monks still bearing that assumed name retired with his portion to a distant part of the new world where having quickly squandered it he once more fell into his old courses and after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder and died in prison as far from home died the chief remaining members of his friend fagins gang mr brownlow adopted oliver as his own son and removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage house where his dear friends resided gratified the only remaining wish of olivers warm and earnest heart and thus linked together a little society whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world soon after the marriage of the young people the worthy doctor returned to chertsey where bereft of the presence of his old friends he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how for two or three months he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him and then finding that the place really was to him no longer what it had been before settled his business on his assistant took a bachelors cottage just outside the village of which his young friend was pastor and instantaneously recovered here he took to gardening planting fishing carpentering and various other pursuits of a similar kind all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity and in each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighbourhood as a most profound authority before his removal he had managed to contract a strong friendship for mr grimwig which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated he is accordingly visited by him a great many times in the course of the year and on all such occasions mr grimwig plants fishes and carpenters with great ardour doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration that his mode is the right one on sundays he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergymans face always informing mr losberne in strict confidence afterwards that he considers it an excellent performance but thinks it as well not to say so it is a standing and very favourite joke for mr brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning oliver and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them waiting his return but mr grimwig contends that he was right in the main and in proof thereof remarks that oliver did not come back after all which always calls forth a laugh on his side and increases his good humour mr noah claypole receiving a free pardon from the crown in consequence of being admitted approver against the jew and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish was for some little time at a loss for the means of a livelihood not burdened with too much work after some consideration he went into business as an informer in which calling he realizes a genteel subsistence his plan is to walk out once a week during church time attended by charlotte in respectable attire the lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans and the gentleman being accommodated with threepennyworth of brandy to restore her lays an information next day and pockets half the penalty sometimes mr claypole faints himself but the result is the same mr and mrs bumble deprived of their situations were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others mr bumble has been heard to say that in this reverse and degradation he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife as to mr giles and brittles they still remain in their old posts although the former is bald and the lastnamed boy quite grey they sleep at the parsonage but divide their attentions so equally between its inmates and oliver and mr brownlow and mr losberne that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong master charles bates appalled by sikess crime fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not after all the best arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was he turned his back upon the scenes of the past resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action he struggled hard and suffered much for some time but having a contented disposition and a good purpose succeeded in the end and from being a farmers drudge and a carriers lad is now the merriest young grazier in all northamptonshire and now the hand that traces these words falters as it approaches the conclusion of its task and would weave for a little longer space the thread of these adventures i would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom i have so long moved and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it i would show rose maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood shedding upon her secluded path in life such soft and gentle light as fell on all who trod it with her and shone into their heartsi would paint her the life and joy of the fireside circle and the lively summer group i would follow her through the sultry fields at noon and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk i would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home i would paint her and her dead sisters child happy in their mutual love and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost i would summon before me once again those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee and listen to their merry prattle i would recall the tones of that clear laugh and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in that soft blue eye these and a thousand looks and smiles and turns of thought and speechi would fain recall them every one illustration rose maylie and oliver how mr brownlow went on from day to day filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge and becoming attached to him more and more as his nature developed itself and showed the thriving seeds of all he could wish him to becomehow he traced in him new traits of his early friend that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances melancholy and yet sweet and soothinghow the two orphans tried by adversity remembered its lessons in mercy to others and mutual love and fervent thanks to him who had protected and preserved themthese are all matters which need not to be told for i have said that they were truly happy and without strong affection and humanity of heart and gratitude to that being whose code is mercy and whose great attribute is benevolence to all things that breathe true happiness can never be attained within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet which bears as yet but one wordagnes there is no coffin in that tomb and may it be many many years before another name is placed above it but if the spirits of the dead ever come back to earth to visit spots hallowed by the lovethe love beyond the graveof those whom they knew in life i do believe that the shade of that poor girl often hovers about that solemn nookay though it is a church and she was weak and erring the end london printed by samuel bentley dorset street fleet street transcribers notes punctuation errors repaired text across three
