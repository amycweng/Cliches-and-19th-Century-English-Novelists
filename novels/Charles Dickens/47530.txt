in three volumes vol ii london richard bentley new burlington street whiting beaufort house oliver twist chapter xx wherein oliver is delivered over to mr william sikes when oliver awoke in the morning he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes with strong thick soles had been placed at his bedside and that his old ones had been removed at first he was pleased with the discovery hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release but such thoughts were quickly dispelled on his sitting down to breakfast alone with the jew who told him in a tone and manner which increased his alarm that he was to be taken to the residence of bill sikes that night totostop there sir asked oliver anxiously no no my dear not to stop there replied the jew we shouldnt like to lose you dont be afraid oliver you shall come back to us again ha ha ha we wont be so cruel as to send you away my dear oh no no the old man who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread looked round as he bantered oliver thus and chuckled as if to shew that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could i suppose said the jew fixing his eyes on oliver you want to know what youre going to bills foreh my dear oliver coloured involuntarily to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts but boldly said yes he did want to know why do you think inquired fagin parrying the question indeed i dont know sir replied oliver bah said the jew turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boys face wait till bill tells you then the jew seemed much vexed by olivers not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject but the truth is that although he felt very anxious he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of fagins looks and his own speculations to make any further inquiries just then he had no other opportunity for the jew remained very surly and silent till night when he prepared to go abroad you may burn a candle said the jew putting one upon the table and heres a book for you to read till they come to fetch you good night good night sir replied oliver softly the jew walked to the door looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went and suddenly stopping called him by his name oliver looked up the jew pointing to the candle motioned him to light it he did so and as he placed the candlestick upon the table saw that the jew was gazing fixedly at him with lowering and contracted brows from the dark end of the room take heed oliver take heed said the old man shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner hes a rough man and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up whatever falls out say nothing and do what he bids you mind placing a strong emphasis on the last word he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin and nodding his head left the room oliver leant his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared and pondered with a trembling heart on the words he had just heard the more he thought of the jews admonition the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to sikes which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with fagin and after meditating for a long time concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker until another boy better suited for his purpose could be engaged he was too well accustomed to suffering and had suffered too much where he was to bewail the prospect of a change very severely he remained lost in thought for some minutes and then with a heavy sigh snuffed the candle and taking up the book which the jew had left with him began to read he turned over the leaves carelessly at first but lighting on a passage which attracted his attention soon became intent upon the volume it was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use here he read of dreadful crimes that make the blood run cold of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside and bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells which would not keep them down deep as they were but had yielded them up at last after many years and so maddened the murderers with the sight that in their horror they had confessed their guilt and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony here too he read of men who lying in their beds at dead of night had been tempted and led on by their own bad thoughts to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep and the limbs quail to think of the terrible descriptions were so real and vivid that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore and the words upon them to be sounded in his ears as if they were whispered in hollow murmurs by the spirits of the dead in a paroxysm of fear the boy closed the book and thrust it from him then falling upon his knees he prayed heaven to spare him from such deeds and rather to will that he should die at once than be reserved for crimes so fearful and appalling by degrees he grew more calm and besought in a low and broken voice that he might be rescued from his present dangers and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred it might come to him now when desolate and deserted he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt he had concluded his prayer but still remained with his head buried in his hands when a rustling noise aroused him whats that he cried starting up and catching sight of a figure standing by the door whos there meonly me replied a tremulous voice oliver raised the candle above his head and looked towards the door it was nancy put down the light said the girl turning away her head it hurts my eyes oliver saw that she was very pale and gently inquired if she were ill the girl threw herself into a chair with her back towards him and wrung her hands but made no reply god forgive me she cried after a while i never thought of all this has anything happened asked oliver can i help you i will if i can i will indeed she rocked herself to and fro caught her throat and uttering a gurgling sound struggled and gasped for breath nancy cried oliver greatly alarmed what is it the girl beat her hands upon her knees and her feet upon the ground and suddenly stopping drew her shawl close round her and shivered with cold oliver stirred the fire drawing her chair close to it she sat there for a little time without speaking but at length she raised her head and looked round i dont know what comes over me sometimes said the girl affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress its this damp dirty room i think now nolly dear are you ready am i to go with you asked oliver yes i have come from bill replied the girl you are to go with me what for said oliver recoiling what for echoed the girl raising her eyes and averting them again the moment they encountered the boys face oh for no harm i dont believe it said oliver who had watched her closely have it your own way rejoined the girl affecting to laugh for no good then oliver could see that he had some power over the girls better feelings and for an instant thought of appealing to her compassion on his helpless state but then the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven oclock and that many people were still in the streets of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale as the reflection occurred to him he stepped forward and said somewhat hastily that he was ready neither his brief consideration nor its purport were lost upon his companion she eyed him narrowly while he spoke and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently shewed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts hush said the girl stooping over him and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round you cant help yourself i have tried hard for you but all to no purpose you are hedged round and round and if ever you are to get loose from here this is not the time struck by the energy of her manner oliver looked up in her face with great surprise she seemed to speak the truth her countenance was white and agitated and she trembled with very earnestness i have saved you from being ill used once and i will again and i do now continued the girl aloud for those who would have fetched you if i had not would have been far more rough than me i have promised for your being quiet and silent if you are not you will only do harm to yourself and me too and perhaps be my death see here i have borne all this for you already as true as god sees me shew it she pointed hastily to some livid bruises upon her neck and arms and continued with great rapidity remember this and dont let me suffer more for you just now if i could help you i would but i have not the power they dont mean to harm you and whatever they make you do is no fault of yours hush every word from you is a blow for me give me your handmake haste your hand she caught the hand which oliver instinctively placed in hers and blowing out the light drew him after her up the stairs the door was opened quickly by some one shrouded in the darkness and as quickly closed when they had passed out a hackney cabriolet was in waiting and with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing oliver the girl pulled him in with her and drew the curtains close the driver wanted no directions but lashed his horse into full speed without the delay of an instant the girl still held oliver fast by the hand and continued to pour into his ear the warnings and assurances she had already imparted all was so quick and hurried that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was or how he came there when the carriage stopped at the same house to which the jews steps had been directed on the previous evening for one brief moment oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street and a cry for help hung upon his lips but the girls voice was in his ear beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her that he had not the heart to utter it while he hesitated the opportunity was gone for he was already in the house and the door was shut this way said the girl releasing her hold for the first time bill hallo replied sikes appearing at the head of the stairs with a candle oh thats the time of day come on this was a very strong expression of approbation and an uncommonly hearty welcome from a person of mr sikess temperament nancy appearing much gratified thereby saluted him cordially bullseyes gone home with tom observed sikes as he lighted them up hed have been in the way thats right rejoined nancy so youve got the kid said sikes when they had all reached the room closing the door as he spoke yes here he is replied nancy did he come quiet inquired sikes like a lamb rejoined nancy im glad to hear it said sikes looking grimly at oliver for the sake of his young carcase as would otherways have suffered for it come here young un and let me read you a lectur which is as well got over at once thus addressing his new protg mr sikes pulled off his cap and threw it into a corner and then taking him by the shoulder sat himself down by the table and stood oliver in front of him now first do you know wot this is inquired sikes taking up a pocket pistol which lay on the table oliver replied in the affirmative well then look here continued sikes this is powder that eres a bullet and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to and mr sikes proceeded to load the pistol with great nicety and deliberation now its loaded said mr sikes when he had finished yes i see it is sir replied oliver trembling well said the robber grasping olivers wrist tightly and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched at which moment the boy could not repress a shriek if you speak a word when youre out odoors with me except when i speak to you that loading will be in your head without noticeso if you do make up your mind to speak without leave say your prayers first having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning to increase its effect mr sikes continued as near as i know there isnt anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you if you was disposed of so i neednt take this devil and all of trouble to explain matters to you if it warnt for your own good dye hear me the short and the long of what you mean said nancy speaking very emphatically and slightly frowning at oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words is that if youre crossed by him in this job you have on hand youll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards by shooting him through the head and take your chance of swinging for it as you do for a great many other things in the way of business every month of your life thats it observed mr sikes approvingly women can always put things in fewest words except when its blowing up and then they lengthens it out and now that hes thoroughly up to it lets have some supper and get a snooze afore starting in pursuance of this request nancy quickly laid the cloth and disappearing for a few minutes presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheeps heads which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of mr sikes founded upon the singular coincidence of jemmies being a cant name common to them and an ingenious implement much used in his profession indeed the worthy gentleman stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being in active service was in great spirits and good humour in proof whereof it may be here remarked that he humorously drank all the beer at a draught and did not utter on a rough calculation more than fourscore oaths during the whole progress of the meal supper being endedit may be easily conceived that oliver had no great appetite for itmr sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water and threw himself upon the bed ordering nancy with many imprecations in case of failure to call him at five precisely oliver stretched himself in his clothes by command of the same authority on a mattress upon the floor and the girl mending the fire sat before it in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time for a long time oliver lay awake thinking it not impossible that nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice but the girl sat brooding over the fire without moving save now and then to trim the light weary with watching and anxiety he at length fell asleep when he awoke the table was covered with tea things and sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great coat which hung over the back of a chair while nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast it was not yet daylight for the candle was still burning and it was quite dark outside a sharp rain too was beating against the window panes and the sky looked black and cloudy now then growled sikes as oliver started up half past five look sharp or youll get no breakfast for its late as it is oliver was not long in making his toilet and having taken some breakfast replied to a surly inquiry from sikes by saying that he was quite ready nancy scarcely looking at the boy threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat and sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders thus attired he gave his hand to the robber who merely pausing to shew him with a menacing gesture that he had the pistol in a side pocket of his great coat clasped it firmly in his and exchanging a farewell with nancy led him away oliver turned for an instant when they reached the door in the hope of meeting a look from the girl but she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire and sat perfectly motionless before it chapter xxi the expedition it was a cheerless morning when they got into the street blowing and raining hard and the clouds looking dull and stormy the night had been very wet for large pools of water had collected in the road and the kennels were overflowing there was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet housetops and dreary streets there appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town for the windows of the houses were all closely shut and the streets through which they passed were noiseless and empty by the time they had turned into the bethnal green road the day had fairly begun to break many of the lamps were already extinguished a few country waggons were slowly toiling on towards london and now and then a stagecoach covered with mud rattled briskly by the driver bestowing as he passed an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who by keeping on the wrong side of the road had endangered his arriving at the office a quarter of a minute after his time the public houses with gas lights burning inside were already open by degrees other shops began to be unclosed and a few scattered people were met with then came straggling groups of labourers going to their work then men and women with fish baskets on their heads donkey carts laden with vegetables chaise carts filled with live stock or whole carcasses of meat milkwomen with pails and an unbroken concourse of people trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town as they approached the city the noise and traffic gradually increased and when they threaded the streets between shoreditch and smithfield it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle it was as light as it was likely to be till night came on again and the busy morning of half the london population had begun turning down sun street and crown street and crossing finsbury square mr sikes struck by way of chiswell street into barbican thence into long lane and so into smithfield from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled oliver twist with surprise and amazement it was market morning the ground was covered nearly ankle deep with filth and mire and a thick steam perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest upon the chimney tops hung heavily above all the pens in the centre of the large area and as many temporary ones as could be crowded into the vacant space were filled with sheep and tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen three or four deep countrymen butchers drovers hawkers boys thieves idlers and vagabonds of every low grade were mingled together in a dense mass the whistling of drovers the barking of dogs the bellowing and plunging of beasts the bleating of sheep and grunting and squeaking of pigs the cries of hawkers the shouts oaths and quarrelling on all sides the ringing of bells and roar of voices that issued from every public house the crowding pushing driving beating whooping and yelling the hideous and discordant din that resounded from every corner of the market and the unwashed unshaven squalid and dirty figures constantly running to and fro and bursting in and out of the throng rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene which quite confounded the senses mr sikes dragging oliver after him elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd and bestowed very little attention upon the numerous sights and sounds which so astonished the boy he nodded twice or thrice to a passing friend and resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram pressed steadily onward until they were clear of the turmoil and had made their way through hosier lane into holborn now young un said sikes surlily looking up at the clock of st andrews church hard upon seven you must step out come dont lag behind already lazy legs mr sikes accompanied this speech with a fierce jerk at his little companions wrist and oliver quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run kept up with the rapid strides of the housebreaker as well as he could they kept on their course at this rate until they had passed hyde park corner and were on their way to kensington when sikes relaxed his pace until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind came up when seeing hounslow written upon it he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume if he would give them a lift as far as isleworth jump up said the man is that your boy yes hes my boy replied sikes looking hard at oliver and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was your father walks rather too quick for you dont he my man inquired the driver seeing that oliver was out of breath not a bit of it replied sikes interposing hes used to it here take hold of my hand ned in with you thus addressing oliver he helped him into the cart and the driver pointing to a heap of sacks told him to lie down there and rest himself as they passed the different milestones oliver wondered more and more where his companion meant to take him kensington hammersmith chiswick kew bridge brentford were all passed and yet they kept on as steadily as if they had only begun their journey at length they came to a public house called the coach and horses a little way beyond which another road appeared to turn off and here the cart stopped sikes dismounted with great precipitation holding oliver by the hand all the while and lifting him down directly bestowed a furious look upon him and rapped the side pocket with his fist in a very significant manner good bye boy said the man hes sulky replied sikes giving him a shake hes sulkya young dog dont mind him not i rejoined the other getting into his cart its a fine day after all and he drove away sikes waited till he had fairly gone and then telling oliver he might look about him if he wanted once again led him forward on his journey they turned round to the left a short way past the public house and then taking a right hand road walked on for a long time passing many large gardens and gentlemens houses on both sides of the way and stopping for nothing but a little beer until they reached a town in which against the wall of a house oliver saw written up in pretty large letters hampton here they lingered about in the fields for some hours at length they came back into the town and keeping on past a public house which bore the sign of the red lion and by the river side for a short distance they came to an old public house with a defaced sign board and ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire the kitchen was an old low roofed room with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling and benches with high backs to them by the fire on which were seated several rough men in smock frocks drinking and smoking they took no notice of oliver and very little of sikes and as sikes took very little notice of them he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves without being much troubled by the company they had some cold meat for dinner and sat here so long after it while mr sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes that oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further being much tired with the walk and getting up so early he dozed a little at first and then quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco fell fast asleep it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from sikes rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man over a pint of ale so youre going on to lower halliford are you inquired sikes yes i am replied the man who seemed a little the worseor better as the case might befor drinking and not slow about it neither my horse hasnt got a load behind him going back as he had coming up in the mornin and he wont be long a doing of it heres luck to him ecod hes a good un could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there demanded sikes pushing the ale towards his new friend if youre going directly i can replied the man looking out of the pot are you going to halliford going on to shepperton replied sikes im your man as far as i go replied the other is all paid becky yes the other gentlemans paid replied the girl i say said the man with tipsy gravity that wont do you know why not rejoined sikes youre a going to accommodate us and wots to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so in return the stranger reflected upon this argument with a very profound face and having done so seized sikes by the hand and declared he was a real good fellow to which mr sikes replied he was jokingas if he had been sober there would have been strong reason to suppose he was after the exchange of a few more compliments they bade the company good night and went out the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so and lounging out to the door with her hands full to see the party start the horse whose health had been drunk in his absence was standing outside ready harnessed to the cart oliver and sikes got in without any further ceremony and the man to whom he belonged having lingered a minute or two to bear him up and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal mounted also then the hostler was told to give the horse his head and his head being given him he made a very unpleasant use of it tossing it into the air with great disdain and running into the parlour windows over the way after performing which feats and supporting himself for a short time on his hind legs he started off at great speed and rattled out of the town right gallantly the night was very dark a damp mist rose from the river and the marshy ground about and spread itself over the dreary fields it was piercing cold too all was gloomy and black not a word was spoken for the driver had grown sleepy and sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation oliver sat huddled together in a corner of the cart bewildered with alarm and apprehension and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees whose branches waved grimly to and fro as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene as they passed sunbury church the clock struck seven there was a light in the ferry house window opposite which streamed across the road and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew tree with graves beneath it there was a dull sound of falling water not far off and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind it seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead sunbury was passed through and they came again into the lonely road two or three miles more and the cart stopped sikes alighted and taking oliver by the hand they once again walked on they turned into no house at shepperton as the weary boy had expected but still kept walking on in mud and darkness through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance on looking intently forward oliver saw that the water was just below them and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge sikes kept straight on till they were close upon the bridge and then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left the water thought oliver turning sick with fear he has brought me to this lonely place to murder me he was about to throw himself on the ground and make one struggle for his young life when he saw that they stood before a solitary house all ruinous and decayed there was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance and one story above but no light was visible it was dark dismantled and to all appearance uninhabited sikes with olivers hand still in his softly approached the low porch and raised the latch the door yielded to the pressure and they passed in together chapter xxii the burglary hallo cried a loud hoarse voice directly they had set foot in the passage dont make such a row said sikes bolting the door shew a glim toby aha my pal cried the same voice a glim barney a glim shew the gentleman in barney and wake up first if convenient the speaker appeared to throw a boot jack or some such article at the person he addressed to rouse him from his slumbers for the noise of a wooden body falling violently was heard and then an indistinct muttering as of a man between asleep and awake do you hear cried the same voice theres bill sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him and you sleeping there as if you took laudanum with your meals and nothing stronger are you any fresher now or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly a pair of slipshod feet shuffled hastily across the bare floor of the room as this interrogatory was put and there issued from a door on the right hand first a feeble candle and next the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose and officiating as waiter at the public house on saffron hill bister sikes exclaimed barney with real or counterfeit joy cub id sir cub id here you get on first said sikes putting oliver in front of him quicker or i shall tread upon your heels muttering a curse upon his tardiness sikes pushed oliver before him and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire two or three broken chairs a table and a very old couch on which with his legs much higher than his head a man was reposing at full length smoking a long clay pipe he was dressed in a smartly cut snuff coloured coat with large brass buttons an orange neckerchief a coarse staring shawl pattern waistcoat and drab breeches mr crackit for he it was had no very great quantity of hair either upon his head or face but what he had was of a reddish dye and tortured into long corkscrew curls through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers ornamented with large common rings he was a trifle above the middle size and apparently rather weak in the legs but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top boots which he contemplated in their elevated situation with lively satisfaction bill my boy said this figure turning his head towards the door im glad to see you i was almost afraid youd given it up in which case i should have made a personal wentur hallo uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise as his eyes rested on oliver mr toby crackit brought himself into a sitting posture and demanded who that was the boyonly the boy replied sikes drawing a chair towards the fire wud of bister fagids lads exclaimed barney with a grin fagins eh exclaimed toby looking at oliver wot an inwalable boy thatll make for the old ladies pockets in chapels his mug is a fortun to him theretheres enough of that interposed sikes impatiently and stooping over his recumbent friend he whispered a few words in his ear at which mr crackit laughed immensely and honoured oliver with a long stare of astonishment now said sikes as he resumed his seat if youll give us something to eat and drink while were waiting youll put some heart in usor in me at all events sit down by the fire younker and rest yourself for youll have to go out with us again to night though not very far off oliver looked at sikes in mute and timid wonder and drawing a stool to the fire sat with his aching head upon his hands scarcely knowing where he was or what was passing around him here said toby as the young jew placed some fragments of food and a bottle upon the table success to the crack he rose to honour the toast and carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner advanced to the table filled a glass with spirits and drank off its contents mr sikes did the same a drain for the boy said toby half filling a wine glass down with it innocence indeed said oliver looking piteously up into the mans face indeed i down with it echoed toby do you think i dont know whats good for you tell him to drink it bill he had better said sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket burn my body if he isnt more trouble than a whole family of dodgers drink it you perwerse imp drink it frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing which delighted toby crackit and barney and even drew a smile from the surly mr sikes this done and sikes having satisfied his appetite oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap oliver retained his stool by the fire and barney wrapped in a blanket stretched himself on the floor close outside the fender they slept or appeared to sleep for some time nobody stirring but barney who rose once or twice to throw coals upon the fire oliver fell into a heavy doze imagining himself straying along through the gloomy lanes or wandering about the dark churchyard or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day when he was roused by toby crackit jumping up and declaring it was half past one in an instant the other two were on their legs and all were actively engaged in busy preparation sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls and drew on their great coats while barney opening a cupboard brought forth several articles which he hastily crammed into the pockets barkers for me barney said toby crackit here they are replied barney producing a pair of pistols you loaded them yourself all right replied toby stowing them away the persuaders ive got em replied sikes crape keys centre bits darkiesnothing forgotten inquired toby fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat all right rejoined his companion bring them bits of timber barney thats the time of day with these words he took a thick stick from barneys hands who having delivered another to toby busied himself in fastening on olivers cape now then said sikes holding out his hand oliver who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise and the air and the drink which had been forced upon him put his hand mechanically into that which sikes extended for the purpose take his other hand toby said sikes look out barney the man went to the door and returned to announce that all was quiet the two robbers issued forth with oliver between them and barney having made all fast rolled himself up as before and was soon asleep again it was now intensely dark the fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night and the atmosphere was so damp that although no rain fell olivers hair and eyebrows within a few minutes after leaving the house had become stiff with the half frozen moisture that was floating about they crossed the bridge and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before they were at no great distance off and as they walked pretty briskly they soon arrived at chertsey slap through the town whispered sikes therell be nobody in the way to night to see us toby acquiesced and they hurried through the main street of the little town which at that late hour was wholly deserted a dim light shone at intervals from some bedroom window and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night but there was nobody abroad and they had cleared the town as the church bell struck two quickening their pace they turned up a road upon the left hand after walking about a quarter of a mile they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall to the top of which toby crackit scarcely pausing to take breath climbed in a twinkling the boy next said toby hoist him up ill catch hold of him before oliver had time to look round sikes had caught him under the arms and in three or four seconds he and toby were lying on the grass on the other side sikes followed directly and they stole cautiously towards the house and now for the first time oliver well nigh mad with grief and terror saw that housebreaking and robbery if not murder were the objects of the expedition he clasped his hands together and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror a mist came before his eyes the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face his limbs failed him and he sunk upon his knees get up murmured sikes trembling with rage and drawing the pistol from his pocket get up or ill strew your brains upon the grass oh for gods sake let me go cried oliver let me run away and die in the fields i will never come near london never never oh pray have mercy upon me and do not make me steal for the love of all the bright angels that rest in heaven have mercy upon me the man to whom this appeal was made swore a dreadful oath and had cocked the pistol when toby striking it from his grasp placed his hand upon the boys mouth and dragged him to the house hush cried the man it wont answer here say another word and ill do your business myself with a crack on the head that makes no noise and is quite as certain and more genteel here bill wrench the shutter open hes game enough now ill engage ive seen older hands of his age took the same way for a minute or two on a cold night sikes invoking terrific imprecations upon fagins head for sending oliver on such an errand plied the crowbar vigorously but with little noise after some delay and some assistance from toby the shutter to which he had referred swung open on its hinges it was a little lattice window about five feet and a half above the ground at the back of the house which belonged to a scullery or small brewing place at the end of the passage the aperture was so small that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely but it was large enough to admit a boy of olivers size nevertheless a very brief exercise of mr sikess art sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice and it soon stood wide open also now listen you young limb whispered sikes drawing a dark lantern from his pocket and throwing the glare full on olivers face im a going to put you through there take this light go softly up the steps straight afore you and along the little hall to the street door unfasten it and let us in theres a bolt at the top you wont be able to reach interposed toby stand upon one of the hall chairs there are three there bill with a jolly large blue unicorn and a gold pitchfork on em which is the old ladys arms keep quiet cant you replied sikes with a threatening look the room door is open is it wide replied toby after peeping in to satisfy himself the game of that is that they always leave it open with a catch so that the dog whos got a bed in here may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful ha ha barney ticed him away to night so neat although mr crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper and laughed without noise sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent and to get to work toby complied by first producing his lantern and placing it on the ground and then planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window and his hands upon his knees so as to make a step of his back this was no sooner done than sikes mounting upon him put oliver gently through the window with his feet first and without leaving hold of his collar planted him safely on the floor inside take this lantern said sikes looking into the room you see the stairs afore you oliver more dead than alive gasped out yes and sikes pointing to the street door with the pistol barrel briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way and that if he faltered he would fall dead that instant its done in a minute said sikes in the same low whisper directly i leave go of you do your work hark whats that whispered the other man they listened intently nothing said sikes releasing his hold of oliver now in the short time he had had to collect his senses the boy had firmly resolved that whether he died in the attempt or not he would make one effort to dart up stairs from the hall and alarm the family filled with this idea he advanced at once but stealthily come back suddenly cried sikes aloud back back scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place and a loud cry which followed it oliver let his lantern fall and knew not whether to advance or fly the cry was repeateda light appeareda vision of two terrified half dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyesa flasha loud noisea smokea crash somewhere but where he knew notand he staggered back sikes had disappeared for an instant but he was up again and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away he fired his own pistol after the men who were already retreating and dragged the boy up clasp your arm tighter said sikes as he drew him through the window give me a shawl here theyve hit him quick damnation how the boy bleeds then came the loud ringing of a bell mingled with the noise of fire arms and the shouts of men and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace and then the noises grew confused in the distance and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boys heart and he saw or heard no more chapter xxiii which contains the substance of a pleasant conversation between mr bumble and a lady and shews that even a beadle may be susceptible on some points the night was bitter cold the snow lay upon the ground frozen into a hard thick crust so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad which as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found caught it savagely up in clouds and whirling it into a thousand misty eddies scattered it in air bleak dark and piercing cold it was a night for the well housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank god they were at home and for the homeless starving wretch to lay him down and die many hunger worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets at such times who let their crimes have been what they may can hardly open them in a more bitter world such was the aspect of out of doors affairs when mrs corney the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of oliver twist sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room and glanced with no small degree of complacency at a small round table on which stood a tray of corresponding size furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy in fact mrs corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea and as she glanced from the table to the fireplace where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice her inward satisfaction evidently increasedso much so indeed that mrs corney smiled well said the matron leaning her elbow on the table and looking reflectively at the fire im sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful fora great deal if we did but know it ah mrs corney shook her head mournfully as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it and thrusting a silver spoon private property into the inmost recesses of a two ounce tin tea caddy proceeded to make the tea how slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds the black teapot being very small and easily filled ran over while mrs corney was moralizing and the water slightly scalded mrs corneys hand drat the pot said the worthy matron setting it down very hastily on the hob a little stupid thing that only holds a couple of cups what use is it of to any bodyexcept said mrs corney pausingexcept to a poor desolate creature like me oh dear with these words the matron dropped into her chair and once more resting her elbow on the table thought of her solitary fate the small teapot and the single cup had awakened in her mind sad recollections of mr corney who had not been dead more than five and twenty years and she was overpowered i shall never get another said mrs corney pettishly i shall never get anotherlike him whether this remark bore reference to the husband or the teapot is uncertain it might have been the latter for mrs corney looked at it as she spoke and took it up afterwards she had just tasted her first cup when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room door oh come in with you said mrs corney sharply some of the old women dying i supposethey always die when im at meals dont stand there letting the cold air in dont whats amiss now eh nothing maam nothing replied a mans voice dear me exclaimed the matron in a much sweeter tone is that mr bumble at your service maam said mr bumble who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean and shake the snow off his coat and who now made his appearance bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other shall i shut the door maam the lady modestly hesitated to reply lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with mr bumble with closed doors mr bumble taking advantage of the hesitation and being very cold himself shut it without farther permission hard weather mr bumble said the matron hard indeed maam replied the beadle anti porochial weather this maam we have given away mrs corneywe have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half this very blessed afternoon and yet them paupers are not contented of course not when would they be mr bumble said the matron sipping her tea when indeed maam rejoined mr bumble why heres one man that in consideration of his wife and large family has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese full weight is he grateful maamis he grateful not a copper farthings worth of it what does he do maam but ask for a few coals if its only a pocket handkerchief full he says coalswhat would he do with coalstoast his cheese with em and then come back for more thats the way with these people maamgive em a apron full of coals to day and theyll came back for another the day after to morrow as brazen as alabaster the matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile and the beadle went on i never said mr bumble see anything like the pitch its got to the day afore yesterday a manyou have been a married woman maam and i may mention it to youa man with hardly a rag upon his back here mrs corney looked at the floor goes to our overseers door when he has got company coming to dinner and says he must be relieved mrs corney as he wouldnt go away and shocked the company very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal my god says the ungrateful villain whats the use of this to me you might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles very good says our overseer taking em away again you wont get anything else herethen ill die in the streets says the vagrantoh no you wont says our overseer ha hathat was very goodso like mr grannet wasnt it interposed the matron well mr bumble well maam rejoined the beadle he went away and did die in the streets theres a obstinate pauper for you it beats anything i could have believed observed the matron emphatically but dont you think out of door relief a very bad thing any way mr bumble youre a gentleman of experience and ought to know come mrs corney said the beadle smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information out of door relief properly managedproperly managed maamis the porochial safeguard the great principle of out of door relief is to give the paupers exactly what they dont want and then they get tired of coming dear me exclaimed mrs corney well that is a good one too yes betwixt you and me maam returned mr bumble thats the great principle and thats the reason why if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers youll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese thats the rule now mrs corney all over the countrybut however said the beadle stooping to unpack his bundle these are official secrets maam not to be spoken of except as i may say among the porochial officers such as ourselves this is the port wine maam that the board ordered for the infirmaryreal fresh genuine port wine only out of the cask this afternoonclear as a bell and no sediment having held the first bottle up to the light and shaken it well to test its excellence mr bumble placed them both on the top of a chest of drawers folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped put it carefully in his pocket and took up his hat as if to go youll have a very cold walk mr bumble said the matron it blows maam replied mr bumble turning up his coat collar enough to cut ones ears off the matron looked from the little kettle to the beadle who was moving towards the door and as the beadle coughed preparatory to bidding her good night bashfully inquired whetherwhether he wouldnt take a cup of tea mr bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again laid his hat and stick upon a chair and drew another chair up to the table as he slowly seated himself he looked at the lady she fixed her eyes upon the little teapot mr bumble coughed again and slightly smiled mrs corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet as she sat down her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle she coloured and applied herself to the task of making his tea again mr bumble coughedlouder this time than he had coughed yet sweet mr bumble inquired the matron taking up the sugar basin very sweet indeed maam replied mr bumble he fixed his eyes on mrs corney as he said this and if ever a beadle looked tender mr bumble was that beadle at that moment the tea was made and handed in silence mr bumble having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts began to eat and drink varying these amusements occasionally by fetching a deep sigh which however had no injurious effect upon his appetite but on the contrary rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department you have a cat maam i see said mr bumble glancing at one who in the centre of her family was basking before the fire and kittens too i declare i am so fond of them mr bumble you cant think replied the matron theyre so happy so frolicsome and so cheerful that they are quite companions for me very nice animals maam replied mr bumble approvingly so very domestic oh yes rejoined the matron with enthusiasm so fond of their home too that its quite a pleasure im sure mrs corney maam said mr bumble slowly and marking the time with his teaspoon i mean to say this maam that any cat or kitten that could live with you maam and not be fond of its home must be a ass maam oh mr bumble remonstrated mrs corney its no use disguising facts maam said mr bumble slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity that made him doubly impressive i would drown it myself with pleasure then youre a cruel man said the matron vivaciously as she held out her hand for the beadles cup and a very hard hearted man besides hard hearted maam said mr bumble hard mr bumble resigned his cup without another word squeezed mrs corneys little finger as she took it and inflicting two open handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat gave a mighty sigh and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire it was a round table and as mrs corney and mr bumble had been sitting opposite each other with no great space between them and fronting the fire it will be seen that mr bumble in receding from the fire and still keeping at the table increased the distance between himself and mrs corney which proceeding some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire and to consider an act of great heroism on mr bumbles part he being in some sort tempted by time place and opportunity to give utterance to certain soft nothings which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land members of parliament ministers of state lord mayors and other great public functionaries but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle who as is well known should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all illustration mr bumble and mrs corney taking tea whatever were mr bumbles intentions howeverand no doubt they were of the bestwhatever they were it unfortunately happened as has been twice before remarked that the table was a round one consequently mr bumble moving his chair by little and little soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron and continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle brought his chair in time close to that in which the matron was seated indeed the two chairs touched and when they did so mr bumble stopped now if the matron had moved her chair to the right she would have been scorched by the fire and if to the left she must have fallen into mr bumbles arms so being a discreet matron and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance she remained where she was and handed mr bumble another cup of tea hard hearted mrs corney said mr bumble stirring his tea and looking up into the matrons face are you hard hearted mrs corney dear me exclaimed the matron what a very curious question from a single man what can you want to know for mr bumble the beadle drank his tea to the last drop finished a piece of toast whisked the crumbs off his knees wiped his lips and deliberately kissed the matron mr bumble cried that discreet lady in a whisper for the fright was so great that she had quite lost her voice mr bumble i shall scream mr bumble made no reply but in a slow and dignified manner put his arm round the matrons waist as the lady had stated her intention of screaming of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door which was no sooner heard than mr bumble darted with much agility to the wine bottles and began dusting them with great violence while the matron sharply demanded who was there it is worthy of remark as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity if you please mistress said a withered old female pauper hideously ugly putting her head in at the door old sally is a going fast well whats that to me angrily demanded the matron i cant keep her alive can i no no mistress replied the old woman nobody can shes far beyond the reach of help ive seen a many people die little babes and great strong men and i know when deaths a coming well enough but shes troubled in her mind and when the fits are not on herand thats not often for she is dying very hardshe says she has got something to tell which you must hear shell never die quiet till you come mistress at this intelligence the worthy mrs corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldnt even die without purposely annoying their betters and muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up briefly requested mr bumble to stop till she came back lest anything particular should occur and bidding the messenger walk fast and not be all night hobbling up the stairs followed her from the room with a very ill grace scolding all the way mr bumbles conduct on being left to himself was rather inexplicable he opened the closet counted the tea spoons weighed the sugar tongs closely inspected a silver milk pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal and having satisfied his curiosity upon these points put on his cocked hat corner wise and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table having gone through this very extraordinary performance he took off the cocked hat again and spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture chapter xxiv treats of a very poor subject but is a short one and may be found of importance in this history it was no unfit messenger of death that had disturbed the quiet of the matrons room her body was bent by age her limbs trembled with palsy and her face distorted into a mumbling leer resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil than the work of natures hand alas how few of natures faces there are to gladden us with their beauty the cares and sorrows and hungerings of the world change them as they change hearts and it is only when those passions sleep and have lost their hold for ever that the troubled clouds pass off and leave heavens surface clear it is a common thing for the countenances of the dead even in that fixed and rigid state to subside into the long forgotten expression of sleeping infancy and settle into the very look of early life so calm so peaceful do they grow again that those who knew them in their happy childhood kneel by the coffins side in awe and see the angel even upon earth the old crone tottered along the passages and up the stairs muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion and being at length compelled to pause for breath gave the light into her hand and remained behind to follow as she might while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay it was a bare garret room with a dim light burning at the farther end there was another old woman watching by the bed and the parish apothecarys apprentice was standing by the fire making a toothpick out of a quill cold night mrs corney said this young gentleman as the matron entered very cold indeed sir replied the mistress in her most civil tones and dropping a curtsey as she spoke you should get better coals out of your contractors said the apothecarys deputy breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night theyre the boards choosing sir returned the matron the least they could do would be to keep us pretty warm for our places are hard enough the conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman oh said the young man turning his face towards the bed as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient its all u p there mrs corney it is is it sir asked the matron if she lasts a couple of hours i shall be surprised said the apothecarys apprentice intent upon the toothpicks point its a break up of the system altogether is she dozing old lady the attendant stooped over the bed to ascertain and nodded in the affirmative then perhaps shell go off in that way if you dont make a row said the young man put the light on the floorshe wont see it there the attendant did as she was bidden shaking her head meanwhile to intimate that the woman would not die so easily and having done so resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse who had by this time returned the mistress with an expression of impatience wrapped herself in her shawl and sat at the foot of the bed the apothecarys apprentice having completed the manufacture of the toothpick planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so when apparently growing rather dull he wished mrs corney joy of her job and took himself off on tiptoe when they had sat in silence for some time the two old women rose from the bed and crouching over the fire held out their withered hands to catch the heat the flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces and made their ugliness appear perfectly terrible as in this position they began to converse in a low voice did she say any more anny dear while i was gone inquired the messenger not a word replied the other she plucked and tore at her arms for a little time but i held her hands and she soon dropped off she hasnt much strength in her so i easily kept her quiet i aint so weak for an old woman although i am on parish allowanceno no did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have demanded the first i tried to get it down rejoined the other but her teeth were tight set and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as i could do to get it back again so i drank it and it did me good looking cautiously round to ascertain that they were not overheard the two hags cowered nearer to the fire and chuckled heartily i mind the time said the first speaker when she would have done the same and made rare fun of it afterwards ay that she would rejoined the other she had a merry heart a many many beautiful corpses she laid out as nice and neat as wax work my old eyes have seen themay and these old hands touched them too for i have helped her scores of times stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke the old creature shook them exultingly before her face and fumbling in her pocket brought out an old time discoloured tin snuff box from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion and a few more into her own while they were thus employed the matron who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor joined them by the fire and sharply asked how long she was to wait not long mistress replied the second woman looking up into her face we have none of us long to wait for death patience patience hell be here soon enough for us all hold your tongue you doting idiot said the matron sternly you martha tell me has she been in this way before often answered the first woman but will never be again added the second one that is shell never wake again but onceand mind mistress that wont be for long long or short said the matron snappishly she wont find me here when she does and take care both of you how you worry me again for nothing its no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die and i wontthats more mind that you impudent old harridans if you make a fool of me again ill soon cure you i warrant you she was bouncing away when a cry from the two women who had turned towards the bed caused her to look round the sick woman had raised herself upright and was stretching her arms towards them whos that she cried in a hollow voice hush hush said one of the women stooping over herlie down lie down ill never lie down again alive said the woman struggling i will tell her come herenearer let me whisper in your ear she clutched the matron by the arm and forcing her into a chair by the bedside was about to speak when looking round she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners turn them away said the woman drowsily make hastemake haste the two old crones chiming in together began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends and uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her when the superior pushed them from the room closed the door and returned to the bedside on being excluded the old ladies changed their tone and cried through the keyhole that old sally was drunk which indeed was not unlikely since in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin and water which had been privily administered in the openness of their hearts by the worthy old ladies themselves now listen to me said the dying woman aloud as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy in this very roomin this very bedi once nursed a pretty young creetur that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking and all soiled with dust and blood she gave birth to a boy and died let me thinkwhat was the year again never mind the year said the impatient auditor what about her ay murmured the sick woman relapsing into her former drowsy state what about herwhat abouti know she cried jumping fiercely up her face flushed and her eyes starting from her headi robbed her so i did she wasnt coldi tell you she wasnt cold when i stole it stole what for gods sake cried the matron with a gesture as if she would call for help it replied the woman laying her hand over the others mouththe only thing she had she wanted clothes to keep her warm and food to eat but she had kept it safe and had it in her bosom it was gold i tell yourich gold that might have saved her life gold echoed the matron bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back go on go onyeswhat of it who was the motherwhen was it she charged me to keep it safe replied the woman with a groan and trusted me as the only woman about her i stole it in my heart when she first shewed it me hanging round her neck and the childs death perhaps is on me besides they would have treated him better if they had known it all known what asked the other speak the boy grew so like his mother said the woman rambling on and not heeding the question that i could never forget it when i saw his face poor girl poor girlshe was so young toosuch a gentle lambwait theres more to tell i have not told you all have i no no replied the matron inclining her head to catch the words as they came more faintly from the dying womanbe quick or it may be too late the mother said the woman making a more violent effort than beforethe mother when the pains of death first came upon her whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive and thrived the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named and oh my god she said folding her thin hands together whether it be boy or girl raise up some friends for it in this troubled world and take pity upon a lonely desolate child abandoned to its mercy the boys name demanded the matron they called him oliver replied the woman feebly the gold i stole was yes yeswhat cried the other she was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply but drew back instinctively as she once again rose slowly and stiffly into a sitting posture and clutching the coverlid with both hands muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat and fell lifeless on the bed stone dead said one of the old women hurrying in as soon as the door was opened and nothing to tell after all rejoined the matron walking carelessly away the two crones were to all appearance too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply and were left alone hovering about the body chapter xxv wherein this history reverts to mr fagin and company while these things were passing in the country workhouse mr fagin sat in the old denthe same from which oliver had been removed by the girlbrooding over a dull smoky fire he held a pair of bellows upon his knee with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action but he had fallen into deep thought and with his arms folded upon them and his chin resting on his thumbs fixed his eyes abstractedly on the rusty bars at a table behind him sat the artful dodger master charles bates and mr chitling all intent upon a game of whist the artful taking dummy against master bates and mr chitling the countenance of the first named gentleman peculiarly intelligent at all times acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game and his attentive perusal of mr chitlings hand upon which from time to time as occasion served he bestowed a variety of earnest glances wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbours cards it being a cold night the dodger wore his hat as indeed was often his custom within doors he also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table which stood ready filled with gin and water for the accommodation of the company master bates was also attentive to the play but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin and water and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber indeed the artful presuming upon their close attachment more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties all of which remonstrances master bates took in extremely good part merely requesting his friend to be blowed or to insert his head in a sack or replying with some other neatly turned witticism of a similar kind the happy application of which excited considerable admiration in the mind of mr chitling it was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost and that the circumstance so far from angering master bates appeared to afford him the highest amusement inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days thats two doubles and the rub said mr chitling with a very long face as he drew half a crown from his waistcoat pocket i never see such a feller as you jack you win every thing even when weve good cards charley and i cant make nothing of em either the matter or manner of this remark which was made very ruefully delighted charley bates so much that his consequent shout of laughter roused the jew from his reverie and induced him to inquire what was the matter matter fagin cried charley i wish you had watched a play tommy chitling hasnt won the point and i went partners with him against the artful and dum ay ay said the jew with a grin which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason try em again tom try em again no more of it for me thankee fagin replied mr chitling ive had enough that ere dodger has such a run of luck that theres no standing again him ha ha my dear replied the jew you must get up very early in the morning to win against the dodger morning said charley bates you must put your boots on overnight and have a telescope at each eye and a opera glass between your shoulders if you want to come over him mr dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy and offered to cut any gentleman in company for the first picture card at a shilling a time nobody accepting the challenge and his pipe being by this time smoked out he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground plan of newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters whistling meantime with peculiar shrillness how precious dull you are tommy said the dodger stopping short when there had been a long silence and addressing mr chitling what do you think hes thinking of fagin how should i know my dear replied the jew looking round as he plied the bellows about his losses maybe or the little retirement in the country that hes just left ehha ha is that it my dear not a bit of it replied the dodger stopping the subject of discourse as mr chitling was about to reply what do you say charley i should say replied master bates with a grin that he was uncommon sweet upon betsy see how hes a blushing oh my eye heres a merry go roundertommy chitlings in loveoh fagin fagin what a spree thoroughly overpowered with the notion of mr chitling being the victim of the tender passion master bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence that he lost his balance and pitched over upon the floor where the accident abating nothing of his merriment he lay at full length till his laugh was over when he resumed his former position and began another never mind him my dear said the jew winking at mr dawkins and giving master bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows betsys a fine girl stick up to her tom stick up to her what i mean to say fagin replied mr chitling very red in the face is that that isnt anything to anybody here no more it is replied the jew charley will talk dont mind him my dear dont mind him betsys a fine girl do as she bids you tom and youll make your fortune so i do do as she bids me replied mr chitling i shouldnt have been milled if it hadnt been for her advice but it turned out a good job for you didnt it fagin and whats six weeks of it it must come some time or another and why not in the winter time when you dont want to go out a walking so much eh fagin ah to be sure my dear replied the jew you wouldnt mind it again tom would you asked the dodger winking upon charley and the jew if bet was all right i mean to say that i shouldnt replied tom angrily there now ah wholl say as much as that i should like to know eh fagin nobody my dear replied the jew not a soul tom i dont know one of em that would do it besides you not one of em my dear i might have got clear off if id split upon her mighnt i fagin angrily pursued the poor half witted dupe a word from me would have done it wouldnt it fagin to be sure it would my dear replied the jew but i didnt blab it did i fagin demanded tom pouring question upon question with great volubility no no to be sure replied the jew you were too stout hearted for thata deal too stout my dear perhaps i was rejoined tom looking round and if i was whats to laugh at in that eh fagin the jew perceiving that mr chitling was considerably roused hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing and to prove the gravity of the company appealed to master bates the principal offender but unfortunately charley in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar that the abused mr chitling without any preliminary ceremonies rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender who being skilful in evading pursuit ducked to avoid it and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman and caused him to stagger to the wall where he stood panting for breath while mr chitling looked on in intense dismay hark cried the dodger at this moment i heard the tinkler catching up the light he crept softly up stairs the bell rang again with some impatience while the party were in darkness after a short pause the dodger reappeared and whispered fagin mysteriously what cried the jew alone the dodger nodded in the affirmative and shading the flame of the candle with his hand gave charley bates a private intimation in dumb show that he had better not be funny just then having performed this friendly office he fixed his eyes on the jews face and awaited his directions the old man bit his yellow fingers and meditated for some seconds his face working with agitation the while as if he dreaded something and feared to know the worst at length he raised his head where is he he asked the dodger pointed to the floor above and made a gesture as if to leave the room yes said the jew answering the mute inquiry bring him down hushquiet charleygently tom scarce scarce this brief direction to charley bates and his recent antagonist to retire was softly and immediately obeyed there was no sound of their whereabout when the dodger descended the stairs bearing the light in his hand and followed by a man in a coarse smock frock who after casting a hurried glance round the room pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face and disclosedall haggard unwashed and unshaven the features of flash toby crackit how are you fagey said the worthy nodding to the jew pop that shawl away in my castor dodger so that i may know where to find it when i cut thats the time of day youll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now with these words he pulled up the smock frock and winding it round his middle drew a chair to the fire and placed his feet upon the hob see there fagey he said pointing disconsolately to his top boots not a drop of day and martin since you know when not a bubble of blacking by but dont look at me in that way man all in good time i cant talk about business till ive eat and drank so produce the sustainance and lets have a quiet fill out for the first time these three days the jew motioned to the dodger to place what eatables there were upon the table and seating himself opposite the housebreaker waited his leisure to judge from appearances toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation at first the jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought but in vain he looked tired and worn but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore and through dirt and beard and whisker there still shone unimpaired the self satisfied smirk of flash toby crackit then the jew in an agony of impatience watched every morsel he put into his mouth pacing up and down the room meanwhile in irrepressible excitement it was all of no use toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference until he could eat no more and then ordering the dodger out closed the door mixed a glass of spirits and water and composed himself for talking first and foremost fagey said toby yes yes interposed the jew drawing up his chair mr crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water and to declare that the gin was excellent and then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye quietly resumed first and foremost fagey said the housebreaker hows bill what screamed the jew starting from his seat why you dont mean to say began toby turning pale mean cried the jew stamping furiously on the ground where are theysikes and the boywhere are theywhere have they beenwhere are they hidingwhy have they not been here the crack failed said toby faintly i know it replied the jew tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it what more they fired and hit the boy we cut over the fields at the back with him between usstraight as the crow fliesthrough hedge and ditch they gave chase dme the whole country was awake and the dogs upon us the boy gasped the jew bill had him on his back and scudded like the wind we stopped to take him again between us his head hung down and he was cold they were close upon our heels every man for himself and each from the gallows we parted company and left the youngster lying in a ditch alive or dead thats all i know of him the jew stopped to hear no more but uttering a loud yell and twining his hands in his hair rushed from the room and from the house chapter xxvi in which a mysterious character appears upon the scene and many things inseparable from this history are done and performed the old man had gained the street corner before he began to recover the effect of toby crackits intelligence he had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed but was still pressing onward in the same wild and disordered manner when the sudden dashing past of a carriage and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers who saw his danger drove him back upon the pavement avoiding as much as possible all the main streets and skulking only through the byways and alleys he at length emerged on snow hill here he walked even faster than before nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court when as if conscious that he was now in his proper element he fell into his usual shuffling pace and seemed to breathe more freely near to the spot on which snow hill and holborn hill meet there opens upon the right hand as you come out of the city a narrow and dismal alley leading to saffron hill in its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second hand silk handkerchiefs of all sizes and patternsfor here reside the traders who purchase them from pickpockets hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door posts and the shelves within are piled with them confined as the limits of field lane are it has its barber its coffee shop its beer shop and its fried fish warehouse it is a commercial colony of itself the emporium of petty larceny visited at early morning and setting in of dusk by silent merchants who traffic in dark back parlours and go as strangely as they come here the clothesman the shoe vamper and the rag merchant display their goods as sign boards to the petty thief and stores of old iron and bones and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen stuff and linen rust and rot in the grimy cellars it was into this place that the jew turned he was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane for such of them as were on the lookout to buy or sell nodded familiarly as he passed along he replied to their salutations in the same way but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley when he stopped to address a salesman of small stature who had squeezed as much of his person into a childs chair as the chair would hold and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door why the sight of you mr fagin would cure the hoptalmy said this respectable trader in acknowledgment of the jews inquiry after his health the neighbourhood was a little too hot lively said fagin elevating his eyebrows and crossing his hands upon his shoulders well ive heerd that complaint of it once or twice before replied the trader but it soon cools down again dont you find it so fagin nodded in the affirmative and pointing in the direction of saffron hill inquired whether any one was up yonder to night at the cripples inquired the man the jew nodded let me see pursued the merchant reflecting yes theres some half dozen of em gone in that i knows i dont think your friends there sikes is not i suppose inquired the jew with a disappointed countenance non istwentus as the lawyers say replied the little man shaking his head and looking amazingly sly have you got anything in my line to night nothing to night said the jew turning away are you going up to the cripples fagin cried the little man calling after him stop i dont mind if i have a drop there with you but as the jew looking back waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone and moreover as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair the sign of the cripples was for a time bereft of the advantage of mr livelys presence by the time he had got upon his legs the jew had disappeared so mr lively after ineffectually standing on tiptoe in the hope of catching sight of him again forced himself into the little chair and exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour the three cripples or rather the cripples which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons was the same public house in which mr sikes and his dog have already figured merely making a sign to a man in the bar fagin walked straight up stairs and opening the door of a room and softly insinuating himself into the chamber looked anxiously about shading his eyes with his hand as if in search of some particular person the room was illuminated by two gas lights the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters and closely drawn curtains of faded red from being visible outside the ceiling was blackened to prevent its colour being injured by the flaring of the lamps and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything further by degrees however as some of it cleared away through the open door an assemblage of heads as confused as the noises that greeted the ear might be made out and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company male and female crowded round a long table at the upper end of which sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner as fagin stepped softly in the professional gentleman running over the keys by way of prelude occasioned a general cry of order for a song which having subsided a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through as loud as he could when this was over the chairman gave a sentiment after which the professional gentlemen on the chairmans right and left volunteered a duet and sang it with great applause it was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group there was the chairman himself the landlord of the house a coarse rough heavy built fellow who while the songs were proceeding rolled his eyes hither and thither and seeming to give himself up to joviality had an eye for every thing that was done and an ear for everything that was saidand sharp ones too near him were the singers receiving with professional indifference the compliments of the company and applying themselves in turn to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water tendered by their more boisterous admirers whose countenances expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade irresistibly attracted the attention by their very repulsiveness cunning ferocity and drunkenness in all its stages were there in their strongest aspects and womensome with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked and others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crimesome mere girls others but young women and none past the prime of lifeformed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture fagin troubled by no grave emotions looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search succeeding at length in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair he beckoned to him slightly and left the room as quietly as he had entered it what can i do for you mr fagin inquired the man as he followed him out to the landing wont you join us theyll be delighted every one of em the jew shook his head impatiently and said in a whisper is he here no replied the man and no news of barney inquired fagin none replied the landlord of the cripples for it was he he wont stir till its all safe depend on it that theyre on the scent down there and that if he moved hed blow upon the thing at once hes all right enough barney is else i should have heard of him ill pound it that barneys managing properly let him alone for that will he be here to night asked the jew laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before monks do you mean inquired the landlord hesitating hush said the jew yes certain replied the man drawing a gold watch from his fob i expected him here before now if youll wait ten minutes hell be no no said the jew hastily as though however desirous he might be to see the person in question he was nevertheless relieved by his absence tell him i came here to see him and that he must come to me to night no say to morrow as he is not here to morrow will be time enough good said the man nothing more not a word now said the jew descending the stairs i say said the other looking over the rails and speaking in a hoarse whisper what a time this would be for a sell ive got phil barker here so drunk that a boy might take him aha but its not phil barkers time said the jew looking up phil has something more to do before we can afford to part with him so go back to the company my dear and tell them to lead merry liveswhile they last ha ha ha the landlord reciprocated the old mans laugh and returned to his guests the jew was no sooner alone than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought after a brief reflection he called a hack cabriolet and bade the man drive towards bethnal green he dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of mr sikess residence and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot now muttered the jew as he knocked at the door if there is any deep play here i shall have it out of you my girl cunning as you are she was in her room the woman said so fagin crept softly up stairs and entered it without any previous ceremony the girl was alone lying with her head upon the table and her hair straggling over it she has been drinking thought the jew coolly or perhaps she is only miserable the old man turned to close the door as he made this reflection and the noise thus occasioned roused the girl she eyed his crafty face narrowly as she inquired whether there was any news and listened to his recital of toby crackits story when it was concluded she sunk into her former attitude but spoke not a word she pushed the candle impatiently away and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position shuffled her feet upon the ground but this was all during this silence the jew looked restlessly about the room as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of sikes having covertly returned apparently satisfied with his inspection he coughed twice or thrice and made as many efforts to open a conversation but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone at length he made another attempt and rubbing his hands together said in his most conciliatory tone and where should you think bill was now my deareh the girl moaned out some scarcely intelligible reply that she could not tell and seemed from the half smothered noise that escaped her to be crying and the boy too said the jew straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face poor leetle childleft in a ditch nance only think the child said the girl suddenly looking up is better where he is than among us and if no harm comes to bill from it i hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there what cried the jew in amazement ay i do returned the girl meeting his gaze i shall be glad to have him away from my eyes and to know that the worst is over i cant bear to have him about me the sight of him turns me against myself and all of you pooh said the jew scornfully youre drunk girl am i cried the girl bitterly its no fault of yours if i am not youd never have me anything else if you had your will except nowthe humour doesnt suit you doesnt it no rejoined the jew furiously it does not change it then responded the girl with a laugh change it exclaimed the jew exasperated beyond all bounds by his companions unexpected obstinacy and the vexation of the night i will change it listen to me you drab listen to me who with six words can strangle sikes as surely as if i had his bulls throat between my fingers now if he comes back and leaves that boy behind himif he gets off free and dead or alive fails to restore him to me murder him yourself if you would have him escape jack ketch and do it the moment he sets foot in this room or mind me it will be too late what is all this cried the girl involuntarily what is it pursued fagin mad with rage thiswhen the boys worth hundreds of pounds to me am i to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely through the whims of a drunken gang that i could whistle away the lives ofand me bound too to a born devil that only wants the will and has got the power to to panting for breath the old man stammered for a word and in that one instant checked the torrent of his wrath and changed his whole demeanour a moment before his clenched hands grasped the air his eyes had dilated and his face grown livid with passion but now he shrunk into a chair and cowering together trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villany after a short silence he ventured to look round at his companion and appeared somewhat reassured on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her nancy dear croaked the jew in his usual voice did you mind me dear dont worry me now fagin replied the girl raising her head languidly if bill has not done it this time he will another he has done many a good job for you and will do many more when he can and when he cant he wont so no more about that regarding this boy my dear said the jew rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together the boy must take his chance with the rest interrupted nancy hastily and i say again i hope he is dead and out of harms way and out of yoursthat is if bill comes to no harm and if toby got clear off hes pretty sure to for hes worth two of him any time and about what i was saying my dear observed the jew keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her you must say it all over again if its any thing you want me to do rejoined nancy and if it is you had better wait till to morrow you put me up for a minute but now im stupid again fagin put several other questions all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints but she answered them so readily and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor was fully confirmed nancy indeed was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the jews female pupils and in which in their tenderer years they were rather encouraged than checked her disordered appearance and a wholesale perfume of geneva which pervaded the apartment afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the jews supposition and when after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described she subsided first into dulness and afterwards into a compound of feelings under the influence of which she shed tears one minute and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of never say die and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman were happy mr fagin who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time saw with great satisfaction that she was very far gone indeed having eased his mind by this discovery and accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had that night heard and ascertaining with his own eyes that sikes had not returned mr fagin again turned his face homeward leaving his young friend asleep with her head upon the table it was within an hour of midnight and the weather being dark and piercing cold he had no great temptation to loiter the sharp wind that scoured the streets seemed to have cleared them of passengers as of dust and mud for few people were abroad and they were to all appearance hastening fast home it blew from the right quarter for the jew however and straight before it he went trembling and shivering as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way he had reached the corner of his own street and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door key when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow and crossing the road glided up to him unperceived fagin whispered a voice close to his ear ah said the jew turning quickly round is that yes interrupted the stranger harshly i have been lingering here these two hours where the devil have you been on your business my dear replied the jew glancing uneasily at his companion and slackening his pace as he spoke on your business all night oh of course said the stranger with a sneer well and whats come of it nothing good said the jew nothing bad i hope said the stranger stopping short and turning a startled look upon his companion the jew shook his head and was about to reply when the stranger interrupting him motioned to the house before which they had by this time arrived and remarked that he had better say what he had got to say under cover for his blood was chilled with standing about so long and the wind blew through him fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visiter at that unseasonable hour and muttered something about having no fire but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner he unlocked the door and requested him to close it softly while he got a light its as dark as the grave said the man groping forward a few steps make haste i hate this shut the door whispered fagin from the end of the passage as he spoke it closed with a loud noise that wasnt my doing said the other man feeling his way the wind blew it to or it shut of its own accord one or the other look sharp with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs and after a short absence returned with a lighted candle and the intelligence that toby crackit was asleep in the back room below and the boys in the front one beckoning the other man to follow him he led the way up stairs we can say the few words weve got to say in here my dear said the jew throwing open a door on the first floor and as there are holes in the shutters and we never shew lights to our neighbours well set the candle on the stairs there with these words the jew stooping down placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs exactly opposite the room door and led the way into the apartment which was destitute of all moveables save a broken arm chair and an old couch or sofa without covering which stood behind the door upon this piece of furniture the stranger flung himself with the air of a weary man and the jew drawing up the arm chair opposite they sat face to face it was not quite dark for the door was partially open and the candle outside threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall they conversed for some time in whispers although nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there a listener might easily have perceived that fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation they might have been talking thus for a quarter of an hour or more when monksby which name the jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquysaid raising his voice a little i tell you again it was badly planned why not have kept him here among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at once only hear him exclaimed the jew shrugging his shoulders why do you mean to say you couldnt have done it if you had chosen demanded monks sternly havent you done it with other boys scores of times if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldnt you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom perhaps for life whose turn would that have served my dear inquired the jew humbly mine replied monks but not mine said the jew submissively he might have become of use to me when there are two parties to a bargain it is only reasonable that the interest of both should be consulted is it my good friend what then demanded monks sulkily i saw it was not easy to train him to the business replied the jew he was not like other boys in the same circumstances curse him no muttered the man or he would have been a thief long ago i had no hold upon him to make him worse pursued the jew anxiously watching the countenance of his companion his hand was not in i had nothing to frighten him with which we always must have in the beginning or we labour in vain what could i do send him out with the dodger and charley we had enough of that at first my dear i trembled for us all that was not my doing observed monks no no my dear renewed the jew and i dont quarrel with it now because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes upon the boy to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for well i got him back for you by means of the girl and then she begins to favour him throttle the girl said monks impatiently why we cant afford to do that just now my dear replied the jew smiling and besides that sort of thing is not in our way or one of these days i might be glad to have it done i know what these girls are monks well as soon as the boy begins to harden shell care no more for him than for a block of wood you want him made a thief if he is alive i can make him one from this time and ifif said the jew drawing nearer to the otherits not likely mindbut if the worst comes to the worst and he is dead its no fault of mine if he is interposed the other man with a look of terror and clasping the jews arm with trembling hands mind that fagin i had no hand in it anything but his death i told you from the first i wont shed blood its always found out and haunts a man besides if they shot him dead i was not the cause do you hear me fire this infernal denwhats that what cried the jew grasping the coward round the body with both arms as he sprung to his feet where yonder replied the man glaring at the opposite wall the shadowi saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet pass along the wainscot like a breath the jew released his hold and they rushed tumultuously from the room the candle wasted by the draught was standing where it had been placed and shewed them the empty staircase and their own white faces they listened intently but a profound silence reigned throughout the house its your fancy said the jew taking up the light and turning to his companion ill swear i saw it replied monks trembling violently it was bending forward when i saw it first and when i spoke it darted away the jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate and telling him he could follow if he pleased ascended the stairs they looked into all the rooms they were cold bare and empty they descended into the passage and thence into the cellars below the green damp hung upon the low walls and the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light but all was still as death what do you think now said the jew when they had regained the passage besides ourselves theres not a creature in the house except toby and the boys and theyre safe enough see here as a proof of the fact the jew drew forth two keys from his pocket and explained that when he first went down stairs he had locked them in to prevent any intrusion on the conference this accumulated testimony effectually staggered mr monks his protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery and now he gave vent to several very grim laughs and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination he declined any renewal of the conversation however for that night suddenly remembering that it was past one oclock and so the amiable couple parted chapter xxvi atones for the unpoliteness of a former chapter which deserted a lady most unceremoniously as it would be by no means seemly in an humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting with his back to the fire and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him and as it would still less become his station or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words which coming from such a quarter might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree the faithful historian whose pen traces these words trusting that he knows his place and entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank and by consequence great virtues imperatively claim at his hands towards this end indeed he had purposed to introduce in this place a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles and elucidative of the position that a beadle can do no wrong which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled by want of time and space to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity on the arrival of which he will be prepared to shew that a beadle properly constitutedthat is to say a parochial beadle attached to a parochial workhouse and attending in his official capacity the parochial churchis in right and virtue of his office possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity and that to none of those excellences can mere companies beadles or court of law beadles or even chapel of ease beadles save the last and they in a very lowly and inferior degree lay the remotest sustainable claim mr bumble had recounted the tea spoons re weighed the sugar tongs made a closer inspection of the milk pot and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture down to the very horse hair seats of the chairs and had repeated each process full half a dozen times before he began to think that it was time for mrs corney to return thinking begets thinking and as there were no sounds of mrs corneys approach it occurred to mr bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time if he were further to allay his curiosity by a cursory glance at the interior of mrs corneys chest of drawers having listened at the keyhole to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber mr bumble beginning at the bottom proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers which being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers speckled with dried lavender seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction arriving in course of time at the right hand corner drawer in which was the key and beholding therein a small padlocked box which being shaken gave forth a pleasant sound as of the chinking of coin mr bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace and resuming his old attitude said with a grave and determined air ill do it he followed up this remarkable declaration by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog and then took a view of his legs in profile with much seeming pleasure and interest he was still placidly engaged in this latter survey when mrs corney hurrying into the room threw herself in a breathless state on a chair by the fireside and covering her eyes with one hand placed the other over her heart and gasped for breath mrs corney said mr bumble stooping over the matron what is this maam has anything happened maam pray answer me im onon mr bumble in his alarm could not immediately think of the word tenterhooks so he said broken bottles oh mr bumble cried the lady i have been so dreadfully put out put out maam exclaimed mr bumble who has dared to i know said mr bumble checking himself with native majesty this is them wicious paupers its dreadful to think of said the lady shuddering then dont think of it maam rejoined mr bumble i cant help it whimpered the lady then take something maam said mr bumble soothingly a little of the wine not for the world replied mrs corney i couldntoh the top shelf in the right hand corneroh uttering these words the good lady pointed distractedly to the cupboard and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms mr bumble rushed to the closet and snatching a pint green glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated filled a tea cup with its contents and held it to the ladys lips im better now said mrs corney falling back after drinking half of it mr bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness and bringing them down again to the brim of the cup lifted it to his nose peppermint explained mrs corney in a faint voice smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke try it theres a littlea little something else in it mr bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look smacked his lips took another taste and put the cup down empty it is very comforting said mrs corney very much so indeed maam said the beadle as he spoke he drew a chair beside the matron and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her nothing replied mrs corney i am a foolish excitable weak creetur not weak maam retorted mr bumble drawing his chair a little closer are you a weak creetur mrs corney we are all weak creeturs said mrs corney laying down a general principle so we are said the beadle nothing was said on either side for a minute or two afterwards and by the expiration of that time mr bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of mrs corneys chair where it had previously rested to mrs corneys apron string round which it gradually became intwined we are all weak creeturs said mr bumble mrs corney sighed dont sigh mrs corney said mr bumble i cant help it said mrs corney and she sighed again this is a very comfortable room maam said mr bumble looking round another room and this maam would be a complete thing it would be too much for one murmured the lady but not for two maam rejoined mr bumble in soft accents eh mrs corney mrs corney drooped her head when the beadle said this and the beadle drooped his to get a view of mrs corneys face mrs corney with great propriety turned her head away and released her hand to get at her pocket handkerchief but insensibly replaced it in that of mr bumble the board allow you coals dont they mrs corney inquired the beadle affectionately pressing her hand and candles replied mrs corney slightly returning the pressure coals candles and house rent free said mr bumble oh mrs corney what a angel you are the lady was not proof against this burst of feeling she sunk into mr bumbles arms and that gentleman in his agitation imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose such porochial perfection exclaimed mr bumble rapturously you know that mr slout is worse to night my fascinator yes replied mrs corney bashfully he cant live a week the doctor says pursued mr bumble he is the master of this establishment his death will cause a wacancy that wacancy must be filled up oh mrs corney what a prospect this opens what a opportunity for a joining of hearts and housekeeping mrs corney sobbed the little word said mr bumble bending over the bashful beautythe one little little little word my blessed corney yeyeyes sighed out the matron one more pursued the beadle compose your darling feelings for only one more when is it to come off mrs corney twice essayed to speak and twice failed at length summoning up courage she threw her arms round mr bumbles neck and said it might be as soon as ever he pleased and that he was a irresistible duck matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged the contract was solemnly ratified in another tea cupful of the peppermint mixture which was rendered the more necessary by the flutter and agitation of the ladys spirits while it was being disposed of she acquainted mr bumble with the old womans decease very good said that gentleman sipping his peppermint ill call at sowerberrys as i go home and tell him to send to morrow morning was it that as frightened you love it wasnt anything particular dear said the lady evasively it must have been something love urged mr bumble wont you tell your own b not now rejoined the lady one of these daysafter were married dear after were married exclaimed mr bumble it wasnt any impudence from any of them male paupers as no no love interposed the lady hastily if i thought it was continued mr bumbleif i thought any one of em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance they wouldnt have dared to do it love responded the lady they had better not said mr bumble clenching his fist let me see any man porochial or extra porochial as would presume to do it and i can tell him that he wouldnt do it a second time unembellished by any violence of gesticulation this might have sounded as no very high compliment to the ladys charms but as mr bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures she was much touched with this proof of his devotion and protested with great admiration that he was indeed a dove the dove then turned up his coat collar and put on his cocked hat and having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner once again braved the cold wind of the night merely pausing for a few minutes in the male paupers ward to abuse them a little with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse master with needful acerbity assured of his qualifications mr bumble left the building with a light heart and bright visions of his future promotion which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker now mr and mrs sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper and noah claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking the shop was not closed although it was past the usual hour of shutting up mr bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times but attracting no attention and beholding a light shining through the glass window of the little parlour at the back of the shop he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward and when he saw what was going forward he was not a little surprised the cloth was laid for supper and the table was covered with bread and butter plates and glasses a porter pot and a wine bottle at the upper end of the table mr noah claypole lolled negligently in an easy chair with his legs thrown over one of the arms an open clasp knife in one hand and a mass of buttered bread in the other close beside him stood charlotte opening oysters from a barrel which mr claypole condescended to swallow with remarkable avidity a more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentlemans nose and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated and these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties in cases of internal fever could have sufficiently accounted illustration mr claypole as he appeared when his master was out london richard bentley march heres a delicious fat one noah dear said charlotte try him do only this one what a delicious thing is a oyster remarked mr claypole after he had swallowed it what a pity it is a number of em should ever make you feel uncomfortable isnt it charlotte its quite a cruelty said charlotte so it is acquiesced mr claypole ant yer fond of oysters not overmuch replied charlotte i like to see you eat em noah dear better than eating them myself lor said noah reflectively how queer have another said charlotte heres one with such a beautiful delicate beard i cant manage any more said noah im very sorry come here charlotte and ill kiss yer what said mr bumble bursting into the room say that again sir charlotte uttered a scream and hid her face in her apron while mr claypole without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground gazed at the beadle in drunken terror say it again you vile owdacious fellow said mr bumble how dare you mention such a thing sir and how dare you encourage him you insolent minx kiss her exclaimed mr bumble in strong indignation faugh i didnt mean to do it said noah blubbering shes always a kissing of me whether i like it or not oh noah cried charlotte reproachfully yer are yer know yer are retorted noah shes always a doing of it mr bumble sir she chucks me under the chin please sir and makes all manner of love silence cried mr bumble sternly take yourself down stairs maam noah you shut up the shop and say another word till your master comes home at your peril and when he does come home tell him that mr bumble said he was to send a old womans shell after breakfast to morrow morning do you hear sir kissing cried mr bumble holding up his hands the sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful if parliament dont take their abominable courses under consideration this countrys ruined and the character of the peasantry gone for ever with these words the beadle strode with a lofty and gloomy air from the undertakers premises and now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home and have made all necessary preparations for the old womans funeral let us set on foot a few inquiries after young oliver twist and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where toby crackit left him chapter xxviii looks after oliver and proceeds with his adventures wolves tear your throats muttered sikes grinding his teeth i wish i was among some of you youd howl the hoarser for it as sikes growled forth this imprecation with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee and turned his head for an instant to look back at his pursuers there was little to be made out in the mist and darkness but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air and the barking of the neighbouring dogs roused by the sound of the alarm bell resounded in every direction stop you white livered hound cried the robber shouting after toby crackit who making the best use of his long legs was already aheadstop the repetition of the word brought toby to a dead stand still for he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol shot and sikes was in no mood to be played with bear a hand with the boy roared sikes beckoning furiously to his confederate come back toby made a show of returning but ventured in a low voice broken for want of breath to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along quicker cried sikes laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet and drawing a pistol from his pocket dont play the booby with me at this moment the noise grew louder and sikes again looking round could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them its all up bill cried toby drop the kid and show em your heels with this parting advice mr crackit preferring the chance of being shot by his friend to the certainty of being taken by his enemies fairly turned tail and darted off at full speed sikes clenched his teeth took one look round threw over the prostrate form of oliver the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ran along the front of the hedge as if to distract the attention of those behind from the spot where the boy lay paused for a second before another hedge which met it at right angles and whirling his pistol high into the air cleared it at a bound and was gone ho ho there cried a tremulous voice in the rear pincher neptune come here come here the dogs which in common with their masters seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged readily answered to this command and three men who had by this time advanced some distance into the field stopped to take counsel together my advice or leastways i should say my orders is said the fattest man of the party that we mediately go home again i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to mr giles said a shorter man who was by no means of a slim figure and who was very pale in the face and very polite as frightened men frequently are i shouldnt wish to appear ill mannered gentlemen said the third who had called the dogs back mr giles ought to know certainly replied the shorter man and whatever mr giles says it isnt our place to contradict him no no i know my sitiwationthank my stars i know my sitiwation to tell the truth the little man did seem to know his situation and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke you are afraid brittles said mr giles i ant said brittles you are said giles youre a falsehood mr giles said brittles youre a lie brittles said mr giles now these four retorts arose from mr giless taunt and mr giless taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment the third man brought the dispute to a close most philosophically ill tell you what it is gentlemen said he were all afraid speak for yourself sir said mr giles who was the palest of the party so i do replied the man its natural and proper to be afraid under such circumstances i am so am i said brittles only theres no call to tell a man he is so bounceably these frank admissions softened mr giles who at once owned that he was afraid upon which they all three faced about and ran back again with the completest unanimity till mr giles who had the shortest wind of the party and was encumbered with a pitchfork most handsomely insisted upon stopping to make an apology for his hastiness of speech but its wonderful said mr giles when he had explained what a man will do when his blood is up i should have committed murder i know i should if wed caught one of the rascals as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment and their blood like his had all gone down again some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament i know what it was said mr giles it was the gate i shouldnt wonder if it was exclaimed brittles catching at the idea you may depend upon it said giles that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement i felt all mine suddenly going away as i was climbing over it by a remarkable coincidence the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment so that it was quite conclusive that it was the gate especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the very instant of its occurrence this dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse and who had been roused together with his two mongrel curs to join in the pursuit mr giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion and brittles was a lad of all work who having entered her service a mere child was treated as a promising young boy still though he was something past thirty encouraging each other with such converse as this but keeping very close together notwithstanding and looking apprehensively round whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs the three men hurried back to a tree behind which they had left their lantern lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire catching up the light they made the best of their way home at a good round trot and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible it might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne the air grew colder as day came slowly on and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke the grass was wet the pathways and low places were all mire and water and the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by with a hollow moaning still oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left him morning drew on apace the air became more sharp and piercing as its first dull huethe death of night rather than the birth of dayglimmered faintly in the sky the objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness grew more and more defined and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes the rain came down thick and fast and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes but oliver felt it not as it beat against him for he still lay stretched helpless and unconscious on his bed of clay at length a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed and uttering it the boy awoke his left arm rudely bandaged in a shawl hung heavy and useless at his side and the bandage was saturated with blood he was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture and when he had done so he looked feebly round for help and groaned with pain trembling in every joint from cold and exhaustion he made an effort to stand upright but shuddering from head to foot fell prostrate on the ground after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged oliver urged by a creeping sickness at his heart which seemed to warn him that if he lay there he must surely die got upon his feet and essayed to walk his head was dizzy and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man but he kept up nevertheless and with his head drooping languidly on his breast went stumbling onward he knew not whither and now hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind he seemed to be still walking between sikes and crackit who were angrily disputing for the very words they said sounded in his ears and when he caught his own attention as it were by making some violent effort to save himself from falling he found that he was talking to them then he was alone with sikes plodding on as they had done the previous day and as shadowy people passed them by he felt the robbers grasp upon his wrist suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts lights gleamed before his eyes and all was noise and tumult as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away through all these rapid visions there ran an undefined uneasy consciousness of pain which wearied and tormented him incessantly thus he staggered on creeping almost mechanically between the bars of gates or through hedge gaps as they came in his way until he reached a road and here the rain began to fall so heavily that it roused him he looked about and saw that at no great distance there was a house which perhaps he could reach seeing his condition they might have compassion on him and if they did not it would be better he thought to die near human beings than in the lonely open fields he summoned up all his strength for one last trial and bent his faltering steps towards it as he drew nearer to this house a feeling came over him that he had seen it before he remembered nothing of its details but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him that garden wall on the grass inside he had fallen on his knees last night and prayed the two mens mercy it was the very same house they had attempted to rob oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place that for the instant he forgot the agony of his wound and thought only of flight flight he could scarcely stand and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame where could he fly to he pushed against the garden gate it was unlocked and swung open on its hinges he tottered across the lawn climbed the steps knocked faintly at the door and his whole strength failing him sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico it happened that about this time mr giles brittles and the tinker were recruiting themselves after the fatigues and terrors of the night with tea and sundries in the kitchen not that it was mr giless habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability which while it gratified could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society but death fires and burglary make all men equals and mr giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender leaning his left arm on the table while with his right he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery to which his hearers but especially the cook and housemaid who were of the party listened with breathless interest it was about half past two said mr giles or i wouldnt swear that it mightnt have been a little nearer three when i woke up and turning round in my bed as it might be so here mr giles turned round in his chair and pulled the corner of the table cloth over him to imitate bedclothes i fancied i heerd a noise at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale and asked the housemaid to shut the door who asked brittles who asked the tinker who pretended not to hear heerd a noise continued mr giles i says at first this is illusion and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd the noise again distinct what sort of a noise asked the cook a kind of a busting noise replied mr giles looking round him more like the noise of powdering an iron bar on a nutmeg grater suggested brittle it was when you heerd sir rejoined mr giles but at this time it had a busting sound i turned down the clothes continued giles rolling back the table cloth sat up in bed and listened the cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated lor and drew their chairs closer together i heerd it now quite apparent resumed mr giles somebody i says is forcing of a door or window whats to be done ill call up that poor lad brittles and save him from being murdered in his bed or his throat i says may be cut from his right ear to his left without his ever knowing it here all eyes were turned upon brittles who fixed his upon the speaker and stared at him with his mouth wide open and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror i tossed off the clothes said giles throwing away the table cloth and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid got softly out of bed drew on a pair of ladies present mr giles murmured the tinker of shoes sir said giles turning upon him and laying great emphasis on the word seized the loaded pistol that always goes up stairs with the plate basket and walked on tiptoes to his room brittles i says when i had woke him dont be frightened so you did observed brittles in a low voice were dead men i think brittles i says continued giles but dont be under any alarm was he frightened asked the cook not a bit of it replied mr giles he was as firmah pretty near as firm as i was i should have died at once im sure if it had been me observed the housemaid youre a woman retorted brittles plucking up a little brittles is right said mr giles nodding his head approvingly from a woman nothing else was to be expected we being men took a dark lantern that was standing on brittless hob and groped our way down stairs in the pitch darkas it might be so mr giles had risen from his seat and taken two steps with his eyes shut to accompany his description with appropriate action when he started violently in common with the rest of the company and hurried back to his chair the cook and housemaid screamed it was a knock said mr giles assuming perfect serenity open the door somebody nobody moved it seems a strange sort of thing a knock coming at such a time in the morning said mr giles surveying the pale faces which surrounded him and looking very blank himself but the door must be opened do you hear somebody mr giles as he spoke looked at brittles but that young man being naturally modest probably considered himself nobody and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him at all events he tendered no reply mr giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker but he had suddenly fallen asleep the women were out of the question illustration oliver twist at mrs maylies door if brittles would rather open the door in the presence of witnesses said mr giles after a short silence i am ready to make one so am i said the tinker waking up as suddenly as he had fallen asleep brittles capitulated on these terms and the party being somewhat reassured by the discovery made on throwing open the shutters that it was now broad day took their way up stairs with the dogs in front and the two women who were afraid to stop below bringing up the rear by the advice of mr giles they all talked very loud to warn any evil disposed person outside that they were strong in numbers and by a master stroke of policy originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman the dogs tails were well pinched in the hall to make them bark savagely these precautions having been taken mr giles held on fast by the tinkers arm to prevent his running away as he pleasantly said and gave the word of command to open the door brittles obeyed and the group peeping timorously over each others shoulders beheld no more formidable object than poor little oliver twist speechless and exhausted who raised his heavy eyes and mutely solicited their compassion a boy exclaimed mr giles valiantly pushing the tinker into the background whats the matter with theehwhybrittleslook heredont you know brittles who had got behind the door to open it no sooner saw oliver than he uttered a loud cry mr giles seizing the boy by one leg and one armfortunately not the broken limblugged him straight into the hall and deposited him at full length on the ground thereof here he is bawled giles calling in a great state of excitement up the staircase heres one of the thieves maam heres a thief misswounded miss i shot him miss and brittles held the light in a lantern miss cried brittles applying one hand to the side of his mouth so that his voice might travel the better the two women servants ran up stairs to carry the intelligence that mr giles had captured a robber and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore oliver lest he should die before he could be hung in the midst of all this noise and commotion there was heard a sweet female voice which quelled it in an instant giles whispered the voice from the stair head im here miss replied mr giles dont be frightened miss i aint much injured he didnt make a very desperate resistance miss i was soon too many for him hush replied the young lady you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did is the poor creature much hurt wounded desperate miss replied giles with indescribable complacency he looks as if he was a going miss bawled brittles in the same manner as before wouldnt you like to come and look at him miss in case he should hush pray theres a good man rejoined the young lady wait quietly one instant while i speak to aunt with a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice the speaker tripped away and soon retained with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried carefully up stairs to mr giless room and that brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to chertsey from which place he was to despatch with all speed a constable and doctor but wont you take one look at him first miss asked mr giles with as much pride as if oliver were some bird of rare plumage that he had skilfully brought down not one little peep miss not now for the world replied the young lady poor fellow oh treat him kindly giles if it is only for my sake the old servant looked up at the speaker as she turned away with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child then bending over oliver he helped to carry him up stairs with the care and solicitude of a woman chapter xxix has an introductory account of the inmates of the house to which oliver resorted and relates what they thought of him in a handsome roomthough its furniture had rather the air of old fashioned comfort than of modern elegancethere sat two ladies at a well spread breakfast table mr giles dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black was in attendance upon them he had taken his station some half way between the sideboard and the breakfast table and with his body drawn up to its full height his head thrown back and inclined the merest trifle on one side his left leg advanced and his right hand thrust into his waistcoat while his left hung down by his side grasping a waiter looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance of the two ladies one was well advanced in years but the high backed oaken chair in which she sat was not more upright than she dressed with the utmost nicety and precision in a quaint mixture of by gone costume with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect she sat in a stately manner with her hands folded on the table before her and her eyes of which age had dimmed but little of their brightness attentively fixed upon her young companion the younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring time of womanhood at that age when if ever angels be for gods good purposes enthroned in mortal forms they may be without impiety supposed to abide in such as hers she was not past seventeen cast in so slight and exquisite a mould so mild and gentle so pure and beautiful that earth seemed not her element nor its rough creatures her fit companions the very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye and was stamped upon her noble head seemed scarcely of her age or of the world and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour the thousand lights that played about the face and left no shadow there above all the smilethe cheerful happy smilewere intwined with the best sympathies and affections of our nature she was busily engaged in the little offices of the table and chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her playfully put back her hair which was simply braided on her forehead and threw into one beaming look such a gush of affection and artless loveliness that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her the elder lady smiled but her heart was full and she brushed away a tear as she did so and brittles has been gone upwards of an hour has he asked the old lady after a pause an hour and twelve minutes maam replied mr giles referring to a silver watch which he drew forth by a black ribbon he is always slow remarked the old lady brittles always was a slow boy maam replied the attendant and seeing by the by that brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one he gets worse instead of better i think said the elder lady it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys said the young lady smiling mr giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself when a gig drove up to the garden gate out of which there jumped a fat gentleman who ran straight up to the door and getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process burst into the room and nearly overturned mr giles and the breakfast table together i never heard of such a thing exclaimed the fat gentleman my dear mrs mayliebless my soulin the silence of night tooi never heard of such a thing with these expressions of condolence the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies and drawing up a chair inquired how they found themselves you ought to be deadpositively dead with the fright said the fat gentleman why didnt you send bless me my man should have come in a minute and so would i and my assistant would have been delighted or anybody im sure under such circumstances dear dearso unexpectedin the silence of night too the doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected and attempted in the night time as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon and to make an appointment by the twopenny post a day or two previous and you miss rose said the doctor turning to the young lady i oh very much so indeed said rose interrupting him but there is a poor creature up stairs whom aunt wishes you to see ah to be sure replied the doctor so there is that was your handiwork giles i understand mr giles who had been feverishly putting the tea cups to rights blushed very red and said that he had had that honour honour eh said the doctor well i dont know perhaps its as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at twelve paces fancy that he fired in the air and youve fought a duel giles mr giles who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory answered respectfully that it was not for the like of him to judge about that but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party gad thats true said the doctor where is he shew me the way ill look in again as i come down mrs maylie thats the little window that he got in at eh well i couldnt have believed it talking all the way he followed mr giles up stairs and while he is going up stairs the reader may be informed that mr losberne a surgeon in the neighbourhood known through a circuit of ten miles round as the doctor had grown fat more from goodhumour than from good living and was as kind and hearty and withal as eccentric an old bachelor as will be found in five times that space by any explorer alive the doctor was absent much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated a large flat box was fetched out of the gig and a bedroom bell was rung very often and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above at length he returned and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient looked very mysterious and closed the door carefully this is a very extraordinary thing mrs maylie said the doctor standing with his back to the door as if to keep it shut he is not in danger i hope said the old lady why that would not be an extraordinary thing under the circumstances replied the doctor though i dont think he is have you seen this thief no rejoined the old lady nor heard anything about him no i beg your pardon maam interposed mr giles but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in the fact was that mr giles had not at first been able to bring his mind to the avowal that he had only shot a boy such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery that he could not for the life of him help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes during which he had flourished in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage rose wished to see the man said mrs maylie but i wouldnt hear of it humph rejoined the doctor theres nothing very alarming in his appearance have you any objection to see him in my presence if it be necessary replied the old lady certainly not then i think it is necessary said the doctor at all events i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you postponed it he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now allow memiss rose will you permit me not the slightest fear i pledge you my honour with many more loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal the doctor drew the young ladys arm through one of his and offering his disengaged hand to mrs maylie led them with much ceremony and stateliness up stairs now said the doctor in a whisper as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom door let us hear what you think of him he has not been shaved very recently but he doesnt look at all ferocious notwithstanding stop thoughlet me see that he is in visiting order first stepping before them he looked into the room and motioning them to advance closed the door when they had entered and gently drew back the curtains of the bed upon it in lieu of the dogged black visaged ruffian they had expected to behold there lay a mere child worn with pain and exhaustion and sunk into a deep sleep his wounded arm bound and splintered up was crossed upon his breast and his head reclined upon the other which was half hidden by his long hair as it streamed over the pillow the honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand and looked on for a minute or so in silence whilst he was watching the patient thus the younger lady glided softly past and seating herself in a chair by the bedside gathered olivers hair from his face and as she stooped over him her tears fell upon his forehead the boy stirred and smiled in his sleep as though those marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known as a strain of gentle music or the rippling of water in a silent place or the odour of a flower or even the mention of a familiar word will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were in this life which vanish like a breath and which some brief memory of a happier existence long gone by would seem to have awakened for no power of the human mind can ever recall them what can this mean exclaimed the elder lady this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers vice sighed the surgeon replacing the curtain takes up her abode in many temples and who can say that a fair outside shall not enshrine her but at so early an age urged rose my dear young lady rejoined the surgeon mournfully shaking his head crime like death is not confined to the old and withered alone the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims but can youoh sir can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society said rose anxiously the surgeon shook his head in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible and observing that they might disturb the patient led the way into an adjoining apartment but even if he has been wicked pursued rose think how young he is think that he may never have known a mothers love or even the comfort of a home and that ill usage and blows or the want of bread may have driven him to herd with the men who have forced him to guilt aunt dear aunt for mercys sake think of this before you let them drag this sick child to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment oh as you love me and know that i have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection but that i might have done so and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child have pity upon him before it is too late my dear love said the elder lady as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom do you think i would harm a hair of his head oh no replied rose eagerly not you aunt not you no said the old lady with a trembling lip my days are drawing to their close and may mercy be shewn to me as i shew it to others what can i do to save him sir let me think maam said the doctor let me think mr losberne thrust his hands into his pockets and took several turns up and down the room often stopping and balancing himself on his toes and frowning frightfully after various exclamations of ive got it now and no i havent and as many renewals of the walking and frowning he at length made a dead halt and spoke as follows i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles and that little boy brittles i can manage it he is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides you dont object to that unless there is some other way of preserving the child replied mrs maylie there is no other said the doctor no other take my word for it then aunt invests you with full power said rose smiling through her tears but pray dont be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary you seem to think retorted the doctor that every body is disposed to be hard hearted to day except yourself i only hope for the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the very first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion and i wish i were a young fellow that i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for doing so as the present you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself returned rose blushing well said the doctor laughing heartily that is no very difficult matter but to return to this boy the great point of our agreement is yet to come he will wake in an hour or so i dare say and although i have told that thick headed constable fellow down stairs that he mustnt be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may converse with him without danger now i make this stipulationthat i shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we judge and i can shew to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall be left to his fate without any further interference on my part at all events oh no aunt entreated rose oh yes aunt said the doctor is it a bargain he cannot be hardened in vice said rose it is impossible very good retorted the doctor then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition finally the treaty was entered into and the parties thereto sat down to wait with some impatience until oliver should awake the patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than mr losberne had led them to expect for hour after hour passed on and still oliver slumbered heavily it was evening indeed before the kind hearted doctor brought them the intelligence that he had at length roused sufficiently to be spoken to the boy was very ill he said and weak from the loss of blood but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning which he should otherwise have done the conference was a long one for oliver told them all his simple history and was often compelled to stop by pain and want of strength it was a solemn thing to hear in the darkened room the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him oh if when we oppress and grind our fellow creatures we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error which like dense and heavy clouds are rising slowly it is true but not less surely to heaven to pour their after vengeance on our headsif we heard but one instant in imagination the deep testimony of dead mens voices which no power can stifle and no pride shut out where would be the injury and injustice the suffering misery cruelty and wrong that each days life brings with it olivers pillow was smoothed by womans hands that night and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept he felt calm and happy and could have died without a murmur the momentous interview was no sooner concluded and oliver composed to rest again than the doctor after wiping his eyes and condemning them for being weak all at once betook himself down stairs to open upon mr giles and finding nobody about the parlours it occurred to him that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen so into the kitchen he went there were assembled in that lower house of the domestic parliament the women servants mr brittles mr giles the tinker who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day in consideration of his services and the constable the latter gentleman had a large staff a large head large features and large half boots and looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale as indeed he had the adventures of the previous night were still under discussion for mr giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind when the doctor entered and mr brittles with a mug of ale in his hand was corroborating everything before his superior said it sit still said the doctor waving his hand thank you sir said mr giles misses wished some ale to be given out sir and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room sir and disposed for company i am taking mine among em here brittles headed a low murmur by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from mr giless condescension and mr giles looked round with a patronising air as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly he would never desert them how is the patient to night sir asked giles so so returned the doctor i am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there mr giles i hope you dont mean to say sir said mr giles trembling that hes going to die if i thought it i should never be happy again i wouldnt cut a boy off no not even brittles here not for all the plate in the country sir thats not the point said the doctor mysteriously mr giles are you a protestant yes sir i hope so faltered mr giles who had turned very pale and what are you boy said the doctor turning sharply upon brittles lord bless me sir replied brittles starting violently im the same as mr giles sir then tell me this said the doctor fiercely both of youboth of you are you going to take upon yourselves to swear that that boy up stairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night out with it come we are prepared for you the doctor who was universally considered one of the best tempered creatures on earth made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger that giles and brittles who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement stared at each other in a state of stupefaction pay attention to the reply constable will you said the doctor shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner and tapping the bridge of his nose with it to bespeak the exercise of that worthys utmost acuteness something may come of this before long the constable looked as wise as he could and took up his staff of office which had been reclining indolently in the chimney corner its a simple question of identity you will observe said the doctor thats what it is sir replied the constable coughing with great violence for he had finished his ale in a hurry and some of it had gone the wrong way heres a house broken into said the doctor and a couple of men catch one moments glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder smoke and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness heres a boy comes to that very same house next morning and because he happens to have his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon him by doing which they place his life in great danger and swear he is the thief now the question is whether these men are justified by the fact and if not what situation do they place themselves in the constable nodded profoundly and said that if that wasnt law he should be glad to know what was i ask you again thundered the doctor are you on your solemn oaths able to identify that boy brittles looked doubtfully at mr giles mr giles looked doubtfully at brittles the constable put his hand behind his ear to catch the reply the two women and the tinker leant forward to listen and the doctor glanced keenly round when a ring was heard at the gate and at the same moment the sound of wheels its the runners cried brittles to all appearance much relieved the what exclaimed the doctor aghast in his turn the bow street officers sir replied brittles taking up a candle me and mr giles sent for em this morning what cried the doctor yes replied brittles i sent a message up by the coachman and i only wonder they werent here before sir you did did you then confound your slow coaches down here thats all said the doctor walking away chapter xxx involves a critical position whos that inquired brittles opening the door a little way with the chain up and peeping out shading the candle with his hand open the door replied a man outside its the officers from bow street as was sent to to day much comforted by this assurance brittles opened the door to its full width and confronted a portly man in a great coat who walked in without saying anything more and wiped his shoes on the mat as coolly as if he lived there just send somebody out to relieve my mate will you young man said the officer hes in the gig minding the prad have you got a coachus here that you could put it up in for five or ten minutes brittles replying in the affirmative and pointing out the building the portly man stepped back to the garden gate and helped his companion to put up the gig while brittles lighted them in a state of great admiration this done they returned to the house and being shewn into a parlour took off their great coats and hats and shewed like what they were the man who had knocked at the door was a stout personage of middle height aged about fifty with shiny black hair cropped pretty close half whiskers a round face and sharp eyes the other was a red headed bony man in top boots with a rather ill favoured countenance and a turned up sinister looking nose tell your governor that blathers and duff is here will you said the stouter man smoothing down his hair and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table oh good evening master can i have a word or two with you in private if you please this was addressed to mr losberne who now made his appearance that gentleman motioning brittles to retire brought in the two ladies and shut the door this is the lady of the house said mr losberne motioning towards mrs maylie mr blathers made a bow and being desired to sit down put his hat upon the floor and taking a chair motioned duff to do the same the latter gentleman who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society or quite so much at his ease in it one of the two seated himself after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs and forced the head of his stick into his mouth with some embarrassment now with regard to this here robbery master said blathers what are the circumstances mr losberne who appeared desirous of gaining time recounted them at great length and with much circumlocution messrs blathers and duff looking very knowing meanwhile and occasionally exchanging a nod i cant say for certain till i see the place of course said blathers but my opinion at once isi dont mind committing myself to that extentthat this wasnt done by a yokeleh duff certainly not replied duff and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman said mr losberne with a smile thats it master replied blathers this is all about the robbery is it all replied the doctor now what is this about this here boy that the servants are talking of said blathers nothing at all replied the doctor one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house but its nonsensesheer absurdity wery easy disposed of it is remarked duff what he says is quite correct observed blathers nodding his head in a confirmatory way and playing carelessly with the handcuffs as if they were a pair of castanets who is the boy what account does he give of himself where did he come from he didnt drop out of the clouds did he master of course not replied the doctor with a nervous glance at the two ladies i know his whole historybut we can talk about that presently you would like to see the place where the thieves made their attempt first i suppose certainly rejoined mr blathers we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants arterwards thats the usual way of doing business lights were then procured and messrs blathers and duff attended by the native constable brittles giles and everybody else in short went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window and afterwards went round by way of the lawn and looked in at the window and after that had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with and after that a lantern to trace the footsteps with and after that a pitchfork to poke the bushes with this done amidst the breathless interest of all beholders they came in again and mr giles and brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous nights adventures which they performed some six times over contradicting each other in not more than one important respect the first time and in not more than a dozen the last this consummation being arrived at blathers and duff cleared the room and held a long council together compared with which for secrecy and solemnity a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine would be mere childs play meanwhile the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state and mrs maylie and rose looked on with anxious faces upon my word he said making a halt after a great number of very rapid turns i hardly know what to do surely said rose the poor childs story faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient to exonerate him i doubt it my dear young lady said the doctor shaking his head i dont think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal functionaries of a higher grade what is he after all they would saya runaway judged by mere world considerations and probabilities his story is a very doubtful one you credit it surely interrupted rose in haste i believe it strange as it is and perhaps may be an old fool for doing so rejoined the doctor but i dont think it is exactly the tale for a practised police officer nevertheless why not demanded rose because my pretty cross examiner replied the doctor because viewed with their eyes there are so many ugly points about it he can only prove the parts that look bad and none of those that look well confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and take nothing for granted on his own shewing you see he has been the companion of thieves for some time past he has been carried to a police office on a charge of picking a gentlemans pocket and is taken away forcibly from that gentlemans house to a place which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea he is brought down to chertsey by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no and put through a window to rob a house and then just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way that blundering dog of a half bred butler and shoots him as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself dont you see all this i see it of course replied rose smiling at the doctors impetuosity but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the poor child no replied the doctor of course not bless the bright eyes of your sex they never see whether for good or bad more than one side of any question and that is invariably the one which first presents itself to them having given vent to this result of experience the doctor put his hands into his pockets and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before the more i think of it said the doctor the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty to put these men into possession of the boys real story i am certain it will not be believed and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery oh what is to be done cried rose dear dear why did they send for these people why indeed exclaimed mrs maylie i would not have had them here for the world all i know is said mr losberne at last sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness that we must try and carry it off with a bold face thats all the object is a good one and that must be the excuse the boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be talked to any more thats one comfort we must make the best of it we can and if bad is the best it is no fault of ourscome in well master said blathers entering the room followed by his colleague and making the door fast before he said any more this warnt a put up thing and what the devils a put up thing demanded the doctor impatiently we call it a put up robbery ladies said blathers turning to them as if he compassioned their ignorance but had a contempt for the doctors when the servants is in it nobody suspected them in this case said mrs maylie wery likely not maam replied blathers but they might have been in it for all that more likely on that wery account said duff we find it was a town hand said blathers continuing his report for the style of work is first rate wery pretty indeed it is remarked duff in an under tone there was two of em in it continued blathers and they had a boy with em thats plain from the size of the window thats all to be said at present well see this lad that youve got up stairs at once if you please perhaps they will take something to drink first mrs maylie said the doctor his face brightening up as if some new thought had occurred to him oh to be sure exclaimed rose eagerly you shall have it immediately if you will why thank you miss said blathers drawing his coat sleeve across his mouth its dry work this sort of duty anything thats handy miss dont put yourself out of the way on our accounts what shall it be asked the doctor following the young lady to the sideboard a little drop of spirits master if its all the same replied blathers its a cold ride from london maam and i always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings this interesting communication was addressed to mrs maylie who received it very graciously while it was being conveyed to her the doctor slipped out of the room ah said mr blathers not holding his wine glass by the stem but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand and placing it in front of his chest i have seen a good many pieces of business like this in my time ladies that crack down in the back lane at edmonton blathers said mr duff assisting his colleagues memory that was something in this way warnt it rejoined mr blathers that was done by conkey chickweed that was you always gave that to him replied duff it was the family pet i tell you and conkey hadnt any more to do with it than i had get out retorted mr blathers i know better do you mind that time conkey was robbed of his money though what a start that was better than any novel book i ever see what was that inquired rose anxious to encourage any symptoms of goodhumour in the unwelcome visiters it was a robbery miss that hardly anybody would have been down upon said blathers this here conkey chickweed conkey means nosey maam interposed duff of course the lady knows that dont she demanded mr blathers always interrupting you are partner this here conkey chickweed miss kept a public house over battlebridge way and had a cellar where a good many young lords went to see cockfighting and badger drawing and that and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in for ive seen em offen he warnt one of the family at that time and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty seven guineas in a canvass bag that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night by a tall man with a black patch over his eye who had concealed himself under the bed and after committing the robbery jumped slap out of window which was only a story high he was wery quick about it but conkey was quick too for he was woke by the noise and darting out of bed fired a blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood they set up a hue and cry directly and when they came to look about em found that conkey had hit the robber for there was traces of blood all the way to some palings a good distance off and there they lost em however he had made off with the blunt and consequently the name of mr chickweed licensed witler appeared in the gazette among the other bankrupts and all manner of benefits and subscriptions and i dont know what all was got up for the poor man who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss and went up and down the streets for three or four days pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself one day he come up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview with the magistrate who after a good deal of talk rings the bell and orders jem spyers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go and assist mr chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house i see him spyers said chickweed pass my house yesterday morningwhy didnt you up and collar him says spyersi was so struck all of a heap that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick says the poor man but were sure to have him for between ten and eleven oclock at night he passed again spyers no sooner heard this than he put some clean linen and a comb in his pocket in case he should have to stop a day or two and away he goes and sets himself down at one of the public house windows behind a little red curtain with his hat on already to bolt at a moments notice he was smoking his pipe here late at night when all of a sudden chickweed roars outhere he is stop thief murder jem spyers dashes out and there he sees chickweed tearing down the street full cry away goes spyers on keeps chickweed round turns the people everybody roars out thieves and chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the time like mad spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a cornershoots roundsees a little crowddives in which is the mandme says chickweed ive lost him again it was a remarkable occurrence but he warnt to be seen nowhere so they went back to the public house and next morning spyers took his old place and looked out from behind the curtain for a tall man with a black patch over his eye till his own two eyes ached again at last he couldnt help shutting em to ease em a minute and the very moment he did so he hears chickweed roaring out here he is off he starts once more with chickweed half way down the street ahead of him and after twice as long a run as the yesterdays one the mans lost again this was done once or twice more till one half the neighbours gave out that mr chickweed had been robbed by the devil who was playing tricks with him arterwards and the other half that poor mr chickweed had gone mad with grief what did jem spyers say inquired the doctor who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story jem spyers resumed the officer for a long time said nothing at all and listened to everything without seeming to which shewed he understood his business but one morning he walked into the bar and taking out his snuff box said chickweed ive found out whos done this here robberyhave you said chickweed oh my dear spyers only let me have wengeance and i shall die contented oh my dear spyers where is the villaincome said spyers offering him a pinch of snuff none of that gammon you did it yourself so he had and a good bit of money he had made by it too and nobody would ever have found it out if he hadnt been so precious anxious to keep up appearances thats more said mr blathers putting down his wine glass and clinking the handcuffs together very curious indeed observed the doctor now if you please you can walk up stairs if you please sir returned mr blathers and closely following mr losberne the two officers ascended to olivers bedroom mr giles preceding the party with a lighted candle oliver had been dozing but looked worse and was more feverish than he had appeared yet being assisted by the doctor he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward and in fact without seeming to recollect where he was or what had been passing this said mr losberne speaking softly but with great vehemence notwithstanding this is the lad who being accidentally wounded by a spring gun in some boyish trespass on mr what dye call hims grounds at the back here comes to the house for assistance this morning and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand who has placed his life in considerable danger as i can professionally certify illustration oliver waited on by the bow street runners london richard bentley may messrs blathers and duff looked at mr giles as he was thus recommended to their notice and the bewildered butler gazed from them towards oliver and from oliver towards mr losberne with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity you dont mean to deny that i suppose said the doctor laying oliver gently down again it was all done for thefor the best sir answered giles i am sure i thought it was the boy or i wouldnt have meddled with him i am not of an inhuman disposition sir thought it was what boy inquired the senior officer the housebreakers boy sir replied giles theythey certainly had a boy well do you think so now inquired blathers think what now replied giles looking vacantly at his questioner think its the same boy stupid head rejoined mr blathers impatiently i dont know i really dont know said giles with a rueful countenance i couldnt swear to him what do you think asked mr blathers i dont know what to think replied poor giles i dont think it is the boy indeed im almost certain that it isnt you know it cant be has this man been a drinking sir inquired blathers turning to the doctor what a precious muddle headed chap you are said duff addressing mr giles with supreme contempt mr losberne had been feeling the patients pulse during this short dialogue but he now rose from the chair by the bedside and remarked that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject they would perhaps like to step into the next room and have brittles before them acting upon this suggestion they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment where mr brittles being called in involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities as tended to throw no particular light upon any thing save the fact of his own strong mystification except indeed his declarations that he shouldnt know the real boy if he were put before him that instant that he had only taken oliver to be he because mr giles had said he was and that mr giles had five minutes previously admitted in the kitchen that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty among other ingenious surmises the question was then raised whether mr giles had really hit anybody and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown papera discovery which made a considerable impression on every body but the doctor who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before upon no one however did it make a greater impression than on mr giles himself who after labouring for some hours under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow creature eagerly caught at this new idea and favoured it to the utmost finally the officers without troubling themselves very much about oliver left the chertsey constable in the house and took up their rest for that night in the town promising to return next morning with the next morning there came a rumour that two men and a boy were in the cage at kingston who had been apprehended overnight under suspicious circumstances and to kingston messrs blathers and duff journeyed accordingly the suspicious circumstances however resolving themselves on investigation into the one fact that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack which although a great crime is only punishable by imprisonment and is in the merciful eye of the english law and its comprehensive love of all the kings subjects held to be no satisfactory proof in the absence of all other evidence that the sleeper or sleepers have committed burglary accompanied with violence and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of deathmessrs blathers and duff came back again as wise as they went in short after some more examination and a great deal more conversation a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of mrs maylie and mr losberne for olivers appearance if he should ever be called upon and blathers and duff being rewarded with a couple of guineas returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the family pet and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great mr conkey chickweed meanwhile oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of mrs maylie rose and the kind hearted mr losberne if fervent prayers gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude be heard in heavenand if they be not what prayers arethe blessings which the orphan child called down upon them sunk into their souls diffusing peace and happiness chapter xxxi of the happy life oliver began to lead with his kind friends olivers ailings were neither slight nor few in addition to the pain and delay attendant upon a broken limb his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague which hung about him for many weeks and reduced him sadly but at length he began by slow degrees to get better and to be able to say sometimes in a few tearful words how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again he could do something to shew his gratitude only something which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full something however slight which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery or death was eager and anxious to serve them with all his heart and soul poor fellow said rose when oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lipsyou shall have many opportunities of serving us if you will we are going into the country and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us the quiet place the pure air and all the pleasures and beauties of spring will restore you in a few days and we will employ you in a hundred ways when you can bear the trouble the trouble cried oliver oh dear lady if i could but work for youif i could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers or watching your birds or running up and down the whole day long to make you happy what would i give to do it you shall give nothing at all said miss maylie smiling for as i told you before we shall employ you in a hundred ways and if you only take half the trouble to please us that you promise now you will make me very happy indeed happy maam cried oliver oh how kind of you to say so you will make me happier than i can tell you replied the young lady to think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us would be an unspeakable pleasure to me but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached in consequence would delight me more than you can well imagine do you understand me she inquired watching olivers thoughtful face oh yes maam yes replied oliver eagerly but i was thinking that i am ungrateful now to whom inquired the young lady to the kind gentleman and the dear old nurse who took so much care of me before rejoined oliver if they knew how happy i am they would be pleased i am sure i am sure they would rejoined olivers benefactress and mr losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey he will carry you to see them has he maam cried oliver his face brightening with pleasure i dont know what i shall do for joy when i see their kind faces once again in a short time oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition and one morning he and mr losberne set out accordingly in a little carriage which belonged to mrs maylie when they came to chertsey bridge oliver turned very pale and uttered a loud exclamation whats the matter with the boy cried the doctor as usual all in a bustle do you see anythinghear anythingfeel anythingeh that sir cried oliver pointing out of the carriage window that house yes well what of it stop coachman pull up here cried the doctor what of the house my maneh the thievesthe house they took me to whispered oliver the devil it is cried the doctor halloa there let me out but before the coachman could dismount from his box he had tumbled out of the coach by some means or other and running down to the deserted tenement began kicking at the door like a madman halloa said a little ugly hump backed man opening the door so suddenly that the doctor from the very impetus of his last kick nearly fell forward into the passage whats the matter here matter exclaimed the other collaring him without a moments reflection a good deal robbery is the matter therell be murder too replied the hump backed man coolly if you dont take your hands off do you hear me i hear you said the doctor giving his captive a hearty shake wheresconfound the fellow whats his rascally namesikesthats it wheres sikes you thief the hump backed man stared as if in excess of amazement and indignation and twisting himself dexterously from the doctors grasp growled forth a volley of horrid oaths and retired into the house before he could shut the door however the doctor had passed into the parlour without a word of parley he looked anxiously round not an article of furniture not a vestige of anything animate or inanimate not even the position of the cupboards answered olivers description now said the hump backed man who had watched him keenly what do you mean by coming into my house in this violent way do you want to rob me or to murder mewhich is it did you ever know a man come out to do either in a chariot and pair you ridiculous old vampire said the irritable doctor what do you want then demanded the hunchback fiercely will you take yourself off before i do you a mischief curse you as soon as i think proper said mr losberne looking into the other parlour which like the first bore no resemblance whatever to olivers account of it i shall find you out some day my friend will you sneered the ill favoured cripple if you ever want me im here i havent lived here mad and all alone for five and twenty years to be scared by you you shall pay for this you shall pay for this and so saying the mis shapen little demon set up a hideous yell and danced upon the ground as if frantic with rage stupid enough this muttered the doctor to himself the boy must have made a mistake there put that in your pocket and shut yourself up again with these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money and returned to the carriage the man followed to the chariot door uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way but as mr losberne turned to speak to the driver he looked into the carriage and eyed oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive that waking or sleeping he could not forget it for months afterwards he continued to utter the most fearful imprecations until the driver had resumed his seat and when they were once more on their way they could see him some distance behind beating his feet upon the ground and tearing his hair in transports of frenzied rage i am an ass said the doctor after a long silence did you know that before oliver no sir then dont forget it another time an ass said the doctor again after a further silence of some minutes even if it had been the right place and the right fellows had been there what could i have done single handed and if i had had assistance i see no good that i should have done except leading to my own exposure and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which i have hushed up this business that would have served me right though i am always involving myself in some scrape or other by acting upon these impulses and it might have done me good now the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything else but impulse all through his life and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him if the truth must be told he was a little out of temper for a minute or two at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of olivers story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any he soon came round again however and finding that olivers replies to his questions were still as straightforward and consistent and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth as they had ever been he made up his mind to attach full credence to them from that time forth as oliver knew the name of the street in which mr brownlow resided they were enabled to drive straight thither when the coach turned into it his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely draw his breath now my boy which house is it inquired mr losberne that that replied oliver pointing eagerly out of the window the white house oh make haste pray make haste i feel as if i should die it makes me tremble so come come said the good doctor patting him on the shoulder you will see them directly and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well oh i hope so cried oliver they were so good to me so very very good to me sir the coach rolled on it stopped no that was the wrong house the next door it went on a few paces and stopped again oliver looked up at the windows with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face alas the white house was empty and there was a bill in the windowto let knock at the next door cried mr losberne taking olivers arm in his what has become of mr brownlow who used to live in the adjoining house do you know the servant did not know but would go and inquire she presently returned and said that mr brownlow had sold off his goods and gone to the west indies six weeks before oliver clasped his hands and sank feebly backwards has his housekeeper gone too inquired mr losberne after a moments pause yes sir replied the servant the old gentleman the housekeeper and a gentleman a friend of mr brownlows all went together then turn towards home again said mr losberne to the driver and dont stop to bait the horses till you get out of this confounded london the book stall keeper sir said oliver i know the way there see him pray sir do see him my poor boy this is disappointment enough for one day said the doctor quite enough for both of us if we go to the book stall keepers we shall certainly find that he is dead or has set his house on fire or run away no home again straight and in obedience to the doctors first impulse home they went this bitter disappointment caused oliver much sorrow and grief even in the midst of his happiness for he had pleased himself many times during his illness with thinking of all that mr brownlow and mrs bedwin would say to him and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting upon what they had done for him and in bewailing his cruel separation from them the hope of eventually clearing himself with them too and explaining how he had been forced away had buoyed him up and sustained him under many of his recent trials and now the idea that they should have gone so far and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robbera belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying daywas almost more than he could bear the circumstance occasioned no alteration however in the behaviour of his benefactors after another fortnight when the fine warm weather had fairly begun and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms they made preparations for quitting the house at chertsey for some months sending the plate which had so excited the jews cupidity to the bankers and leaving giles and another servant in care of the house they departed for a cottage some distance in the country and took oliver with them who can describe the pleasure and delight the peace of mind and soft tranquillity which the sickly boy felt in the balmy air and among the green hills and rich woods of an inland village who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain worn dwellers in close and noisy places and carry their own freshness deep into their jaded hearts men who have lived in crowded pent up streets through whole lives of toil and never wished for change men to whom custom has indeed been second nature and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walkseven they with the hand of death upon them have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of natures face and carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being and crawling forth from day to day to some green sunny spot have had such memories wakened up within them by the mere sight of sky and hill and plain and glistening water that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline and they have sunk into their tombs as peacefully as the sunwhose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours beforefaded from their dim and feeble sight the memories which peaceful country scenes call up are not of this world or of its thoughts or hopes their gentle influence may teach us to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved may purify our thoughts and bear down before it old enmity and hatred but beneath all this there lingers in the least reflective mind a vague and half formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before in some remote and distant time which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it it was a lovely spot to which they repaired and oliver whose days had been spent among squalid crowds and in the midst of noise and brawling seemed to enter upon a new existence there the rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees and the garden flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours hard by was a little churchyard not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones but full of humble mounds covered with fresh turf and moss beneath which the old people of the village lay at rest oliver often wandered here and thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen but as he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground and weep for her sadly but without pain it was a happy time the days were peaceful and serene and the nights brought with them no fear or care no languishing in a wretched prison or associating with wretched men nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts every morning he went to a white headed old gentleman who lived near the little church who taught him to read better and to write and spoke so kindly and took such pains that oliver could never try enough to please him then he would walk with mrs maylie and rose and hear them talk of books or perhaps sit near them in some shady place and listen whilst the young lady read which he could have done till it grew too dark to see the letters then he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare and at this he would work hard in a little room which looked into the garden till evening came slowly on when the ladies would walk out again and he with them listening with such pleasure to all they said and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch that he could never be quick enough about it when it became quite dark and they returned home the young lady would sit down to the piano and play some melancholy air or sing in a low and gentle voice some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear there would be no candles at such times as these and oliver would sit by one of the windows listening to the sweet music while tears of tranquil joy stole down his face and when sunday came how differently the day was spent from any manner in which he had ever spent it yet and how happily too like all the other days in that most happy time there was the little church in the morning with the green leaves fluttering at the windows the birds singing without and the sweet smelling air stealing in at the low porch and filling the homely building with its fragrance the poor people were so neat and clean and knelt so reverently in prayer that it seemed a pleasure not a tedious duty their assembling there together and though the singing might be rude it was real and sounded more musical to olivers ears at least than any he had ever heard in church before then there were the walks as usual and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men and at night oliver read a chapter or two from the bible which he had been studying all the week and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased than if he had been the clergyman himself in the morning oliver would be a foot by six oclock roaming the fields and surveying the hedges far and wide for nosegays of wild flowers with which he would return laden home and which it took great care and consideration to arrange to the best advantage for the embellishment of the breakfast table there was fresh groundsel too for miss maylies birds with which oliverwho had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerkwould decorate the cages in the most approved taste when the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village or failing that there was always something to do in the garden or about the plants to which oliverwho had studied this science also under the same master who was a gardener by tradeapplied himself with hearty goodwill till miss rose made her appearance when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed upon all he had done for which one of those light hearted beautiful smiles was an ample recompence so three months glided away three months which in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals would have been unmixed happiness but which in olivers troubled and clouded dawn were felicity indeed with the purest and most amiable generosity on one side and the truest and warmest and most soul felt gratitude on the other it is no wonder that by the end of that short time oliver twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart was repaid by their pride in and attachment to himself chapter xxxii wherein the happiness of oliver and his friends experiences a sudden check spring flew swiftly by and summer came and if the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness the great trees which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months had now burst into strong life and health and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground converted open and naked spots into choice nooks where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect steeped in sunshine which lay stretched out beyond the earth had donned her mantle of brightest green and shed her richest perfumes abroad it was the prime and vigour of the year and all things were glad and flourishing still the same quiet life went on at the little cottage and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates oliver had long since grown stout and healthy but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings to those about him though they do in the feelings of a great many people and he was still the same gentle attached affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength and he was dependent for every slight attention and comfort on those who tended him one beautiful night they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them for the day had been unusually warm and there was a brilliant moon and a light wind had sprung up which was unusually refreshing rose had been in high spirits too and they had walked on in merry conversation until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds mrs maylie was fatigued and they returned more slowly home the young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet sat down to the piano as usual after running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes she fell into a low and very solemn air and as she played it they heard her sob as if she were weeping rose my dear said the elder lady rose made no reply but played a little quicker as though the sound had roused her from some painful thoughts rose my love cried mrs maylie rising hastily and bending over her what is this your face is bathed in tears my dear child what distresses you nothing auntnothing replied the young lady i dont know what it is i cant describe it but i feel so low to night and not ill my love interposed mrs maylie no no oh not ill replied rose shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her while she spoke at least i shall be better presently close the window pray oliver hastened to comply with the request and the young lady making an effort to recover her cheerfulness strove to play some livelier tune but her fingers dropped powerless on the keys and covering her face with her hands she sank upon a sofa and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress my child said the elder lady folding her arms about her i never saw you thus before i would not alarm you if i could avoid it rejoined rose but indeed i have tried very hard and cannot help this i fear i am ill aunt she was indeed for when candles were brought they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness its expression had lost nothing of its beauty but yet it was changed and there was an anxious haggard look about that gentle face which it had never worn before another minute and it was suffused with a crimson flush and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye again this disappeared like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud and she was once more deadly pale oliver who watched the old lady anxiously observed that she was alarmed by these appearances and so in truth was he but seeing that she affected to make light of them he endeavoured to do the same and they so far succeeded that when rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night she was in better spirits and appeared even in better health and assured them that she felt certain she should wake in the morning quite well i hope maam said oliver when mrs maylie returned that nothing serious is the matter miss maylie doesnt look well to night but the old lady motioned him not to speak and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room remained silent for some time at length she said in a trembling voice i hope not oliver i have been very happy with her for some yearstoo happy perhaps and it may be time that i should meet with some misfortune but i hope it is not this what misfortune maam inquired oliver the heavy blow said the old lady almost inarticulately of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness oh god forbid exclaimed oliver hastily amen to that my child said the old lady wringing her hands surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful said oliver two hours ago she was quite well she is very ill now rejoined mrs maylie and will be worse i am sure my dear dear rose oh what should i do without her the lady sank beneath her desponding thoughts and gave way to such great grief that oliver suppressing his own emotion ventured to remonstrate with her and to beg earnestly that for the sake of the dear young lady herself she would be more calm and consider maam said oliver as the tears forced themselves into his eyes despite his efforts to the contrary oh consider how young and good she is and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her i am surecertainquite certainthat for your sake who are so good yourself and for her own and for the sake of all she makes so happy she will not die god will never let her die yet hush said mrs maylie laying her hand on olivers head you think like a child poor boy and although what you say may be natural it is wrong but you teach me my duty notwithstanding i had forgotten it for a moment oliver and i hope i may be pardoned for i am old and have seen enough of illness and death to know the pain they leave to those behind i have seen enough too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them but this should give us comfort rather than sorrow for heaven is just and such things teach us impressively that there is a far brighter world than this and that the passage to it is speedy gods will be done but i love her and he alone knows how well oliver was surprised to see that as mrs maylie said these words she checked her lamentations as though by one struggle and drawing herself up as she spoke became quite composed and firm he was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted and that under all the care and watching which ensued mrs maylie was ever ready and collected performing all the duties which devolved upon her steadily and to all external appearance even cheerfully but he was young and did not know what strong minds are capable of under trying circumstances how should he indeed when their possessors so seldom know themselves an anxious night ensued and when morning came mrs maylies predictions were but too well verified rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever we must be active oliver and not give way to useless grief said mrs maylie laying her finger on her lip as she looked steadily into his face this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to mr losberne it must be carried to the market town which is not more than four miles off by the footpath across the fields and thence dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey the people at the inn will undertake to do this and i can trust you to see it done i know oliver could make no reply but looked his anxiety to be gone at once here is another letter said mrs maylie pausing to reflect but whether to send it now or wait until i see how rose goes on i scarcely know i would not forward it unless i feared the worst is it for chertsey too maam inquired oliver impatient to execute his commission and holding out his trembling hand for the letter no replied the old lady giving it him mechanically oliver glanced at it and saw that it was directed to harry maylie esquire at some lords house in the country where he could not make out shall it go maam asked oliver looking up impatiently i think not replied mrs maylie taking it back i will wait till to morrow with these words she gave oliver her purse and he started off without more delay at the greatest speed he could muster swiftly he ran across the fields and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them now almost hidden by the high corn on either side and now emerging into an open field where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work nor did he stop once save now and then for a few seconds to recover breath until he emerged in a great heat and covered with dust on the little market place of the market town here he paused and looked about for the inn there was a white bank and a red brewery and a yellow town hall and in one corner a large house with all the wood about it painted green before which was the sign of the george to which he hastened directly it caught his eye oliver spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway and who after hearing what he wanted referred him to the hostler who after hearing all he had to say again referred him to the landlord who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth a white hat drab breeches and boots with tops to match and was leaning against a pump by the stable door picking his teeth with a silver toothpick this gentleman walked with much deliberation to the bar to make out the bill which took a long time making out and after it was ready and paid a horse had to be saddled and a man to be dressed which took up ten good minutes more meanwhile oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself and galloped away full tear to the next stage at length all was ready and the little parcel having been handed up with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery the man set spurs to his horse and rattling over the uneven paving of the market place was out of the town and galloping along the turnpike road in a couple of minutes it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for and that no time had been lost oliver hurried up the inn yard with a somewhat lighter heart and was turning out of the gateway when he accidentally stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak who was that moment coming out at the inn door hah cried the man fixing his eyes on oliver and suddenly recoiling what the devils this i beg your pardon sir said oliver i was in a great hurry to get home and didnt see you were coming death muttered the man to himself glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes whod have thought it grind him to ashes hed start up from a marble coffin to come in my way i am sorry sir stammered oliver confused by the strange mans wild look i hope i have not hurt you rot his bones murmured the man in a horrible passion between his clenched teeth if i had only had the courage to say the word i might have been free of him in a night curses light upon your head and black death upon your heart you imp what are you doing here the man shook his fist and gnashed his teeth as he uttered these words incoherently and advancing towards oliver as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him fell violently on the ground writhing and foaming in a fit oliver gazed for a moment at the fearful struggles of the madman for such he supposed him to be and then darted into the house for help having seen him safely carried into the hotel he turned his face homewards running as fast as he could to make up for lost time and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted the circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long however for when he reached the cottage there was enough to occupy his mind and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory rose maylie had rapidly grown worse and before midnight was delirious a medical practitioner who resided on the spot was in constant attendance upon her and after first seeing the patient he had taken mrs maylie aside and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature in fact he said it would be little short of a miracle if she recovered how often did oliver start from his bed that night and stealing out with noiseless footstep to the staircase listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber how often did a tremble shake his frame and cold drops of terror start upon his brow when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of had even then occurred and what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever uttered compared with those he poured forth now in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature who was tottering on the deep graves verge the suspense the fearful acute suspense of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love is trembling in the balancethe racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind and make the heart beat violently and the breath come thick by the force of the images they conjure up before itthe desperate anxiety to be doing something to relieve the pain or lessen the danger which we have no power to alleviate and the sinking of soul and spirit which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produceswhat tortures can equal these and what reflections or efforts can in the full tide and fever of the time allay them morning came and the little cottage was lonely and still people spoke in whispers anxious faces appeared at the gate from time to time and women and children went away in tears all the livelong day and for hours after it had grown dark oliver paced softly up and down the garden raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber and shuddering to see the darkened window looking as if death lay stretched inside late at night mr losberne arrived it is hard said the good doctor turning away as he spoke so youngso much belovedbut there is very little hope another morning the sun shone brightlyas brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care and with every leaf and flower in full bloom about herwith life and health and sounds and sights of joy surrounding her on every side the fair young creature lay wasting fast oliver crept away to the old churchyard and sitting down on one of the green mounds wept for her in silence there was such peace and beauty in the scene so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook careering overhead so much of life and joyousness in all that when the boy raised his aching eyes and looked about the thought instinctively occurred to him that this was not a time for death that rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay that graves were for cold and cheerless winter not for sunlight and fragrance he almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken and never wrapped the young and graceful form within their ghastly folds a knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts anotheragain it was tolling for the funeral service a group of humble mourners entered the gate and they wore white favours for the corpse was young they stood uncovered by a grave and there was a mothera mother onceamong the weeping train but the sun shone brightly and the birds sang on oliver turned homewards thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady and wishing that the time could come over again that he might never cease shewing her how grateful and attached he was he had no cause for self reproach on the score of neglect or want of thought for he had been devoted to her service and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him on which he fancied he might have been more zealous and more earnest and wished he had been we need be careful how we deal with those about us for every death carries with it to some small circle of survivors thoughts of so much omitted and so little doneof so many things forgotten and so many more which might have been repaired that such recollections are among the bitterest we can have there is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing if we would be spared its tortures let us remember this in time when he reached home mrs maylie was sitting in the little parlour olivers heart sank at sight of her for she had never left the bedside of her niece and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away he learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep from which she would waken either to recovery and life or to bid them farewell and die they sat listening and afraid to speak for hours the untasted meal was removed and with looks which shewed that their thoughts were elsewhere they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower and at length cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep and they both involuntarily darted towards the door as mr losberne entered what of rose cried the old lady tell me at once i can bear it anything but suspense oh tell me in the name of heaven you must compose yourself said the doctor supporting her be calm my dear maam pray let me go in gods name gasped mrs maylie my dear child she is dead she is dying no cried the doctor passionately as he is good and merciful she will live to bless us all for years to come the lady fell upon her knees and tried to fold her hands together but the energy which had supported her so long fled to heaven with her first thanksgiving and she sank back into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her chapter xxxiii contains some introductory particulars relative to a young gentleman who now arrives upon the scene and a new adventure which happened to oliver it was almost too much happiness to bear oliver felt stunned and stupified by the unexpected intelligence he could not weep or speak or rest he had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed until after a long ramble in the quiet evening air a burst of tears came to his relief and he seemed to awaken all at once to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast the night was fast closing in when he returned homewards laden with flowers which he had culled with peculiar care for the adornment of the sick chamber as he walked briskly along the road he heard behind him the noise of some vehicle approaching at a furious pace looking round he saw that it was a post chaise driven at great speed and as the horses were galloping and the road was narrow he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him by as it dashed on oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap whose face seemed familiar to him although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person in another second or two the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise window and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop which he did as soon as he could pull up his horses when the nightcap once again appeared and the same voice called oliver by his name here cried the voice master oliver whats the news miss rosemaster o li ver is it you giles cried oliver running up to the chaise door giles popped out his nightcap again preparatory to making some reply when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise and who eagerly demanded what was the news in a word cried the gentleman better or worse bettermuch better replied oliver hastily thank heaven exclaimed the gentleman you are sure quite sir replied oliver the change took place only a few hours ago and mr losberne says that all danger is at an end the gentleman said not another word but opening the chaise door leaped out and taking oliver hurriedly by the arm led him aside this is quite certainthere is no possibility of any mistake on your part my boy is there demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice pray do not deceive me by awakening any hopes that are not to be fulfilled i would not for the world sir replied oliver indeed you may believe me mr losbernes words were that she would live to bless us all for many years to come i heard him say so the tears stood in olivers eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness and the gentleman turned his face away and remained silent for some minutes oliver thought he heard him sob more than once but he feared to interrupt him by any further remarkfor he could well guess what his feelings wereand so stood apart feigning to be occupied with his nosegay all this time mr giles with the white nightcap on had been sitting upon the steps of the chaise supporting an elbow on each knee and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket handkerchief dotted with white spots that the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman when he turned round and addressed him i think you had better go on to my mothers in the chaise giles said he i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time before i see her you can say i am coming i beg your pardon mr harry said giles giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you it wouldnt be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir i should never have any more authority with them if they did well rejoined harry maylie smiling you can do as you like let him go on with the portmanteaus if you wish it and do you follow with us only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering or we shall be taken for madmen mr giles reminded of his unbecoming costume snatched off and pocketed his nightcap and substituted a hat of grave and sober shape which he took out of the chaise this done the postboy drove off and giles mr maylie and oliver followed at their leisure as they walked along oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer he seemed about five and twenty years of age and was of the middle height his countenance was frank and handsome and his demeanour singularly easy and prepossessing notwithstanding the differences between youth and age he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady that oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship even if he had not already spoken of her as his mother mrs maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage and the meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides oh mother whispered the young man why did you not write before i did write replied mrs maylie but on reflection i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard mr losbernes opinion but why said the young man why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened if rose hadi cannot utter that word nowif this illness had terminated differently how could you ever have forgiven yourself or i been happy again if that had been the case harry said mrs maylie i fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival here a day sooner or later would have been of very very little import and who can wonder if it be so mother rejoined the young man or why should i say ifit isit isyou know it motheryou must know it i know that she well deserves the best and purest love that the heart of man can offer said mrs maylie i know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and lasting if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty this is unkind mother said harry do you still suppose that i am so much a boy as not to know my own mind or to mistake the impulses of my own soul i think my dear fellow returned mrs maylie laying her hand upon his shoulder that youth has many generous impulses which do not last and that among them are some which being gratified become only the more fleeting above all i think said the lady fixing her eyes on her sons face that if an enthusiastic ardent ambitious young man has a wife on whose name is a stain which though it originate in no fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her and upon his children also and in exact proportion to his success in the world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against him he mayno matter how generous and good his natureone day repent of the connexion he formed in early life and she may have the pain and torture of knowing that he does so mother said the young man impatiently he would be a mere selfish brute unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe who acted thus you think so now harry replied his mother and ever will said the young man the mental agony i have suffered during the last two days wrings from me the undisguised avowal to you of a passion which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i have lightly formed on rose sweet gentle girl my heart is set as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman i have no thought or view or hope in life beyond her and if you oppose me in this great stake you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to the wind mother think better of this and of me and do not disregard the warm feelings of which you seem to think so little harry said mrs maylie it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded but we have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now let it rest with rose then interposed harry you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle in my way i will not rejoined mrs maylie but i would have you consider i have considered was the impatient replyi have considered for yearsconsidered almost since i have been capable of serious reflection my feelings remain unchanged as they ever will and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent which can be productive of no earthly good no before i leave this place rose shall hear me she shall said mrs maylie there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly mother said the young man anxiously not coldly rejoined the old lady far from it how then urged the young man she has formed no other attachment no indeed replied his mother you have or i mistake too strong a hold on her affections already what i would say resumed the old lady stopping her son as he was about to speak is this before you stake your all on this chancebefore you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope reflect for a few moments my dear child on roses history and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decisiondevoted as she is to us with all the intensity of her noble mind and that perfect sacrifice of self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her characteristic what do you mean that i leave to you to discover replied mrs maylie i must go back to rose god bless you i shall see you again to night said the young man eagerly by and by replied the lady when i leave rose you will tell her i am here said harry of course replied mrs maylie and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how i long to see heryou will not refuse to do this mother no said the old lady i will tell her that and pressing her sons hand affectionately she hastened from the room mr losberne and oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding the former now held out his hand to harry maylie and hearty salutations were exchanged between them the doctor then communicated in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend a precise account of his patients situation which was quite as consolatory and full of promise as olivers statement had encouraged him to hope and to the whole of which mr giles who affected to be busy about the luggage listened with greedy ears have you shot anything particular lately giles inquired the doctor when he had concluded nothing particular sir replied mr giles colouring up to the eyes nor catching any thieves nor identifying any housebreakers said the doctor maliciously none at all sir replied mr giles with much gravity well said the doctor i am sorry to hear it because you do that sort of thing so well pray how is brittles the boy is very well sir said mr giles recovering his usual tone of patronage and sends his respectful duty sir thats well said the doctor seeing you here reminds me mr giles that on the day before that on which i was called away so hurriedly i executed at the request of your good mistress a small commission in your favour just step into this corner a moment will you mr giles walked into the corner with much importance and some wonder and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor on the termination of which he made a great many bows and retired with steps of unusual stateliness the subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it for mr giles walked straight thither and having called for a mug of ale announced with an air of majestic majesty which was highly effective that it had pleased his mistress in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery to deposit in the local savings bank the sum of twenty five pounds for his sole use and benefit at this the two women servants lifted up their hands and eyes and supposed that mr giles would begin to be quite proud now whereunto mr giles pulling out his shirt frill replied no noand that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors he would thank them to tell him so and then he made a great many other remarks no less illustrative of his humility which were received with equal favour and applause and were withal as original and as much to the purpose as the remarks of great men commonly are above stairs the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away for the doctor was in high spirits and however fatigued or thoughtful harry maylie might have been at first he was not proof against the worthy gentlemans good humour which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections and an abundance of small jokes which struck oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard and caused him to laugh proportionately to the evident satisfaction of the doctor who laughed immoderately at himself and made harry laugh almost as heartily by the very force of sympathy so they were as pleasant a party as under the circumstances they could well have been and it was late before they retired with light and thankful hearts to take that rest of which after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone they stood so much in need oliver rose next morning in better heart and went about his usual early occupations with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days the birds were once more hung out to sing in their old places and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found were once more gathered to gladden rose with their beauty and fragrance the melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang for days past over every object beautiful as they all were was dispelled by magic the dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music and the sky itself to look more blue and bright such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts exercises even over the appearance of external objects men who look on nature and their fellow men and cry that all is dark and gloomy are in the right but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts the real hues are delicate and require a clearer vision it is worthy of remark and oliver did not fail to note it at the time that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone harry maylie after the very first morning when he met oliver coming laden home was seized with such a passion for flowers and displayed such a taste in their arrangement as left his young companion far behind if oliver were behind hand in these respects however he knew where the best were to be found and morning after morning they scoured the country together and brought home the fairest that blossomed the window of the young ladys chamber was opened now for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in and revive her with its freshness but there always stood in water just inside the lattice one particular little bunch which was made up with great care every morning oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away although the little vase was regularly replenished nor could he help observing that whenever the doctor came into the garden he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner and nodded his head most expressively as he set forth on his mornings walk pending these observations the days were flying by and rose was rapidly and surely recovering nor did olivers time hang heavy upon his hands although the young lady had not yet left her chamber and there were no evening walks save now and then for a short distance with mrs maylie he applied himself with redoubled assiduity to the instructions of the white headed old gentleman and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself it was while he was engaged in this pursuit that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence the little room in which he was accustomed to sit when busy at his books was on the ground floor at the back of the house it was quite a cottage room with a lattice window around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle that crept over the casement and filled the place with their delicious perfume it looked into a garden whence a wicket gate opened into a small paddock all beyond was fine meadow land and wood there was no other dwelling near in that direction and the prospect it commanded was very extensive one beautiful evening when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth oliver sat at this window intent upon his books he had been poring over them for some time and as the day had been uncommonly sultry and he had exerted himself a great deal it is no disparagement to the authors whoever they may have been to say that gradually and by slow degrees he fell asleep there is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes which while it holds the body prisoner does not free the mind from a sense of things about it and enable it to ramble as it pleases so far as an overpowering heaviness a prostration of strength and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion can be called sleep this is it and yet we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us and even if we dream words which are really spoken or sounds which really exist at the moment accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost a matter of impossibility to separate the two nor is this the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state it is an ascertained fact that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead yet our sleeping thoughts and the visionary scenes that pass before us will be influenced and materially influenced by the mere silent presence of some external object which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness illustration monks and the jew oliver knew perfectly well that he was in his own little room that his books were lying on the table before him and that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outsideand yet he was asleep suddenly the scene changed the air became close and confined and he thought with a glow of terror that he was in the jews house again there sat the hideous old man in his accustomed corner pointing at him and whispering to another man with his face averted who sat beside him hush my dear he thought he heard the jew say it is him sure enough come away he the other man seemed to answer could i mistake him think you if a crowd of devils were to put themselves into his exact shape and he stood amongst them there is something that would tell me how to point him out if you buried him fifty feet deep and took me across his grave i should know if there wasnt a mark above it that he lay buried there wither his flesh i should the man seemed to say this with such dreadful hatred that oliver awoke with the fear and started up good god what was that which sent the blood tingling to his heart and deprived him of voice or power to move therethereat the windowclose before himso close that he could have almost touched him before he started backwith his eyes peering into the room and meeting histhere stood the jew and beside him white with rage or fear or both were the scowling features of the very man who had accosted him at the inn yard it was but an instant a glance a flash before his eyes and they were gone but they had recognised him and he them and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory as if it had been deeply carved in stone and set before him from his birth he stood transfixed for a moment and then leaping from the window into the garden called loudly for help chapter xxxiv containing the unsatisfactory result of olivers adventure and a conversation of some importance between harry maylie and rose when the inmates of the house attracted by olivers cries hurried to the spot from which they proceeded they found him pale and agitated pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house and scarcely able to articulate the words the jew the jew mr giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant but harry maylie whose perceptions were something quicker and who had heard olivers history from his mother understood it at once what direction did he take he asked catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner that replied oliver pointing out the course the men had taken i missed them all in an instant then they are in the ditch said harry follow and keep as near me as you can so saying he sprang over the hedge and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him giles followed as well as he could and oliver followed too and in the course of a minute or two mr losberne who had been out walking and just then returned tumbled over the hedge after them and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess struck into the same course at no contemptible speed shouting all the while most prodigiously to know what was the matter on they all went nor stopped they once to breathe until the leader striking off into an angle of the field indicated by oliver began to search narrowly the ditch and hedge adjoining which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up and for oliver to communicate to mr losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit the search was all in vain there were not even the traces of recent footsteps to be seen they stood now on the summit of a little hill commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles there was the village in the hollow on the left but in order to gain that after pursuing the track oliver had pointed out the men must have made a circuit of open ground which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time a thick wood skirted the meadow land in another direction but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason it must have been a dream oliver said harry maylie taking him aside oh no indeed sir replied oliver shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretchs countenance i saw him too plainly for that i saw them both as plainly as i see you now who was the other inquired harry and mr losberne together the very same man that i told you of who came so suddenly upon me at the inn said oliver we had our eyes fixed full upon each other and i could swear to him they took this way demanded harry are you certain of that as i am that the men were at the window replied oliver pointing down as he spoke to the hedge which divided the cottage garden from the meadow the tall man leaped over just there and the jew running a few paces to the right crept through that gap the two gentlemen watched olivers earnest face as he spoke and looking from him to each other seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said still in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight the grass was long but it was trodden down nowhere save where their own feet had crushed it the sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay but in no one place could they discern the print of mens shoes or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before this is strange said harry strange echoed the doctor blathers and duff themselves could make nothing of it notwithstanding the evidently inefficacious nature of their search however they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its farther prosecution hopeless and even then they gave it up with reluctance giles was dispatched to the different alehouses in the village furnished with the best description oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers of whom the jew was at all events sufficiently remarkable to be remembered supposing he had been seen drinking or loitering about but he returned without any intelligence calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery on the next day further search was made and the inquiries renewed but with no better success on the day following oliver and mr maylie repaired to the market town in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there but this effort was equally fruitless and after a few days the affair began to be forgotten as most affairs are when wonder having no fresh food to support it dies away of itself meanwhile rose was rapidly recovering she had left her room was able to go out and mixing once more with the family carried joy into the hearts of all but although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage there was at times an unwonted restraint upon some thereeven upon rose herselfwhich oliver could not fail to remark mrs maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time and more than once rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face after mr losberne had fixed a day for his departure to chertsey these symptoms increased and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady and of somebody else besides at length one morning when rose was alone in the breakfast parlour harry maylie entered and with some hesitation begged permission to speak with her for a few moments a fewa very fewwill suffice rose said the young man drawing his chair towards her what i shall have to say has already presented itself to your mind the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you though from my lips you have not yet heard them stated rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance although that might have been the effect of her recent illness she merely bowed and bending over some plants that stood near waited in silence for him to proceed iiought to have left here before said harry you should indeed replied rose forgive me for saying so but i wish you had i was brought here by the most dreadful and agonizing of all apprehensions said the young man the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are centred you had been dyingtrembling between earth and heaven we know that when the young the beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest and hence it is that the best and fairest of our kind so often fade in blooming there were tears in the eye of the gentle girl as these words were spoken and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent and glistened brightly in its cup making it more beautiful it seemed as though the outpourings of a fresh young heart claimed common kindred with the loveliest things in nature an angel continued the young man passionately a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of gods own angels fluttered between life and death oh who could hope when the distant world to which she was akin half opened to her view that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this rose rose to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow which a light from above casts upon the earthto have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here and to know no reason why you shouldto feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many gifted creatures in infancy and youth have winged their early flightand yet to pray amid all these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved youthese are distractions almost too great to bear they were mine by day and night and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never know how devotedly i loved you as almost bore down sense and reason in its course you recoveredday by day and almost hour by hour some drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a high and rushing tide i have watched you change almost from death to life with eyes that moistened with their own eagerness and deep affection do not tell me that you wish i had lost this for it has softened my heart to all mankind i did not mean that said rose weeping i only wish you had left here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits againto pursuits well worthy of you there is no pursuit more worthy of memore worthy of the highest nature that existsthan the struggle to win such a heart as yours said the young man taking her hand rose my own dear rose for yearsfor years i have loved you hoping to win my way to fame and then come proudly home and tell you it had been sought only for you to share thinking in my day dreams how i would remind you in that happy moment of the many silent tokens i had given of a boys attachment and rally you who had blushed to mark them and then claim your hand as if in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us that time has not arrived but here with no fame won and no young vision realized i give to you the heart so long your own and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer your behaviour has ever been kind and noble said rose mastering the emotions by which she was agitated as you believe that i am not insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer it is that i may endeavour to deserve youis it dear rose it is replied rose that you must endeavour to forget menot as your old and dearly attached companion for that would wound me deeply but as the object of your love look into the world think how many hearts you would be equally proud to gain are there confide some other passion to me if you will and i will be the truest warmest most faithful friend you have there was a pause during which rose who had covered her face with one hand gave free vent to her tears harry still retained the other and your reasons rose he said at length in a low voice your reasons for this decisionmay i ask them you have a right to know them rejoined rose you can say nothing to alter my resolution it is a duty that i must perform i owe it alike to others and to myself to yourself yes harry i owe it to myself that i a friendless portionless girl with a blight upon my name should not give the world reason to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion and fastened myself a clog upon all your hopes and projects i owe it to you and yours to prevent you from opposing in the warmth of your generous nature this great obstacle to your progress in the world if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty harry began they do not replied rose colouring deeply then you return my love said harry say but that rose say but that and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment if i could have done so without doing heavy wrong to him i loved rejoined rose i could have have received this declaration very differently said harry with great eagerness do not conceal that from me at least rose i could said rose stay she added disengaging her hand why should we prolong this painful interview most painful to me and yet productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding for it will be happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness farewell harry for as we have met to day we meet no more but in other relations than those in which this conversation would have placed us may we be long and happily intwined and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from where all is truth and sincerity cheer and prosper you another word rose said harry your reason in your own words from your own lips let me hear it the prospect before you answered rose firmly is a brilliant one all the honours to which great talents and powerful connexions can help men in public life are in store for you but those connexions are proud and i will neither mingle with such as hold in scorn the mother who gave me life nor bring disgrace or failure upon the son of her who has so well supplied that mothers place in a word said the young lady turning away as her temporary firmness forsook her there is a stain upon my name which the world visits on innocent heads i will carry it into no blood but my own and the reproach shall rest alone on me one word more rosedear rose one more cried harry throwing himself before her if i had been less less fortunate as the world would call itif some obscure and peaceful life had been my destinyif i had been poor sick helplesswould you have turned from me then or has my probable advancement to riches and honour given this scruple birth do not press me to reply answered rose the question does not arise and never will it is unfair unkind to urge it if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is retorted harry it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way and light the dreary path before me it is not an idle thing to do so much by the utterance of a few brief words for one who loves us beyond all else oh rose in the name of my ardent and enduring attachmentin the name of all i have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergoanswer me that one question then if your lot had been differently cast rejoined rose if you had been even a little but not so far above me if i could have been a help and comfort to you in some humble scene of peace and retirement and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds i should have been spared this trial i have every reason to be happy very happy now but then harry i own i should have been happier busy recollections of old hopes cherished as a girl long ago crowded into the mind of rose while making this avowal but they brought tears with them as old hopes will when they come back withered and they relieved her i cannot help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger said rose extending her hand i must leave you now indeed i ask one promise said harry once and only once moresay within a year but it may be much soonerlet me speak to you again on this subject for the last time not to press me to alter my right determination replied rose with a melancholy smile it will be useless no said harry to hear you repeat it if you will finally repeat it i will lay at your feet whatever of station or fortune i may possess and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not seek by word or act to change it then let it be so rejoined rose it is but one pang the more and by that time i may be enabled to bear it better she extended her hand again but the young man caught her to his bosom and imprinting one kiss upon her beautiful forehead hurried from the room chapter xxxv is a very short one and may appear of no great importance in its place but it should be read notwithstanding as a sequel to the last and a key to one that will follow when its time arrives and so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morningeh said the doctor as harry maylie joined him and oliver at the breakfast table why you are not in the same mind or intention two half hours together you will tell me a different tale one of these days said harry colouring without any perceptible reason i hope i may have good cause to do so replied mr losberne though i confess i dont think i shall but yesterday morning you had made up your mind in a great hurry to stay here and accompany your mother like a dutiful son to the sea side before noon you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as i go on your road to london and at night you urge me with great mystery to start before the ladies are stirring the consequence of which is that young oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds too bad isnt it oliver i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and mr maylie went away sir rejoined oliver thats a fine fellow said the doctor you shall come and see me when you return but to speak seriously harry has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone the great nobs replied harry under which designation i presume you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at all since i have been here nor at this time of the year is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them well said the doctor you are a queer fellow but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life theres something in that good training is always desirable whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes harry maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little but he contented himself with saying we shall see and pursued the subject no further the post chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards and giles coming in for the luggage the good doctor bustled out to see it packed away oliver said harry maylie in a low voice let me speak a word with you oliver walked into the window recess to which mr maylie beckoned him much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits which his whole behaviour displayed you can write well now said harry laying his hand upon his arm i hope so sir replied oliver i shall not be at home again perhaps for some time i wish you would write to mesay once a fortnight every alternate monday to the general post office in london will you said mr maylie oh certainly sir i shall be proud to do it exclaimed oliver greatly delighted with the commission i should like to know howhow my mother and miss maylie are said the young man and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take and what you talk about and whether shethey i mean seem happy and quite well you understand me oh quite sir quite replied oliver i would rather you did not mention it to them said harry hurrying over his words because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener and it is a trouble and worry to her let it be a secret between you and me and mind you tell me every thing i depend upon you oliver quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications and mr maylie took leave of him with many warm assurances of his regard and protection the doctor was in the chaise giles who it had been arranged should be left behind held the door open in his hand and the women servants were in the garden looking on harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window and jumped into the carriage drive on he cried hard fast full gallop nothing short of flying will keep pace with me to day halloa cried the doctor letting down the front glass in a great hurry and shouting to the postilion something very short of flying will keep pace with me do you hear jingling and clattering till distance rendered its noise inaudible and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye the vehicle wound its way along the road almost hidden in a cloud of dust now wholly disappearing and now becoming visible again as intervening objects or the intricacies of the way permitted it was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen that the gazers dispersed and there was one looker on who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared long after it was many miles away for behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when harry raised his eyes towards the window sat rose herself he seems in high spirits and happy she said at length i feared for a time he might be otherwisei was mistaken i am very very glad tears are signs of gladness as well as grief but those which coursed down roses face as she sat pensively at the window still gazing in the same direction seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy chapter xxxvi in which the reader if he or she resort to the fifth chapter of this second book will perceive a contrast not uncommon in matrimonial cases mr bumble sat in the workhouse parlour with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate whence as it was summer time no brighter gleam proceeded than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun which were sent back from its cold and shining surface a paper fly cage dangled from the ceiling to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought and as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy network mr bumble would heave a deep sigh while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance mr bumble was meditating and it might be that the insects brought to mind some painful passage in his own past life nor was mr bumbles gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator there were not wanting other appearances and those closely connected with his own person which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs the laced coat and the cocked hat where were they he still wore knee breeches and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs but they were not the breeches the coat was wide skirted and in that respect like the coat but oh how different the mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one mr bumble was no longer a beadle there are some promotions in life which independent of the more substantial rewards they offer acquire peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them a field marshal has his uniform a bishop his silk apron a counsellor his silk gown a beadle his cocked hat strip the bishop of his apron or the beadle of his cocked hat and gold lace what are they menmere men dignity and even holiness too sometimes are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine mr bumble had married mrs corney and was master of the workhouse another beadle had come into power and on him the cocked hat gold laced coat and staff had all three descended and to morrow two months it was done said mr bumble with a sigh it seems a age mr bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks but the sighthere was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh i sold myself said mr bumble pursuing the same train of reflection for six tea spoons a pair of sugar tongs and a milk pot with a small quantity of second hand furniter and twenty pound in money i went very reasonablecheap dirt cheap cheap cried a shrill voice in mr bumbles ear you would have been dear at any price and dear enough i paid for you lord above knows that mr bumble turned and encountered the face of his interesting consort who imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture mrs bumble maam said mr bumble with sentimental sternness well cried the lady have the goodness to look at me said mr bumble fixing his eyes upon her if she stands such a eye as that said mr bumble to himself she can stand anything it is a eye i never knew to fail with paupers and if it fails with her my power is gone whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye is sufficient to quell paupers who being lightly fed are in no very high condition or whether the late mrs corney was particularly proof against eagle glances are matters of opinion the matter of fact is that the matron was in no way overpowered by mr bumbles scowl but on the contrary treated it with great disdain and even raised a laugh thereat which sounded as though it were genuine on hearing this most unexpected sound mr bumble looked first incredulous and afterwards amazed he then relapsed into his former state nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner are you going to sit snoring there all day inquired mrs bumble i am going to sit here as long as i think proper maam rejoined mr bumble and although i was not snoring i shall snore gape sneeze laugh or cry as the humour strikes me such being my prerogative your prerogative sneered mrs bumble with ineffable contempt i said the word maam observed mr bumble the prerogative of a man is to command and whats the prerogative of a woman in the name of goodness cried the relict of mr corney deceased to obey maam thundered mr bumble your late unfortnate husband should have taught it you and then perhaps he might have been alive now i wish he was poor man mrs bumble seeing at a glance that the decisive moment had now arrived and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other must necessarily be final and conclusive no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone than she dropped into a chair and with a loud scream that mr bumble was a hard hearted brute fell into a paroxysm of tears but tears were not the things to find their way to mr bumbles soul his heart was waterproof like washable beaver hats that improve with rain his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous by showers of tears which being tokens of weakness and so far tacit admissions of his own power pleased and exalted him he eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction and begged in an encouraging manner that she should cry her hardest the exercise being looked upon by the faculty as strongly conducive to health it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and softens down the temper said mr bumble so cry away as he discharged himself of this pleasantry mr bumble took his hat from a peg and putting it on rather rakishly on one side as a man might do who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered towards the door with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance now mrs corney that was had tried the tears because they were less troublesome than a manual assault but she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding as mr bumble was not long in discovering the first proof he experienced of the fact was conveyed in a hollow sound immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room this preliminary proceeding laying bare his head the expert lady clasping him tight round the throat with one hand inflicted a shower of blows dealt with singular vigour and dexterity upon it with the other this done she created a little variety by scratching his face and tearing his hair off and having by this time inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence she pushed him over a chair which was luckily well situated for the purpose and defied him to talk about his prerogative again if he dared get up said mrs bumble in a voice of command and take yourself away from here unless you want me to do something desperate mr bumble rose with a very rueful countenance wondering much what something desperate might be and picking up his hat looked towards the door are you going demanded mrs bumble certainly my dear certainly rejoined mr bumble making a quicker motion towards the door i didnt intend toim going my dearyou are so very violent that really i at this instant mrs bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet which had been kicked up in the scuffle and mr bumble immediately darted out of the room without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence leaving the late mrs corney in full possession of the field mr bumble was fairly taken by surprise and fairly beaten he had a decided bullying propensity derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty and consequently was it is needless to say a coward this is by no means a disparagement to his character for many official personages who are held in high respect and admiration are the victims of similar infirmities the remark is made indeed rather in his favour than otherwise and with the view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office but the measure of his degradation was not yet full after making a tour of the house and thinking for the first time that the poor laws really were too hard upon people and that men who ran away from their wives leaving them chargeable to the parish ought in justice to be visited with no punishment at all but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much mr bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen and whence the sound of voices in conversation now proceeded hem said mr bumble summoning up all his native dignity these women at least shall continue to respect the prorogative hallo hallo therewhat do you mean by this noise you hussies with these words mr bumble opened the door and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife my dear said mr bumble i didnt know you were here didnt know i was here repeated mrs bumble what do you do here i thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly my dear replied mr bumble glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the washtub who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse masters humility illustration mr bumble degraded in the eyes of the paupers you thought they were talking too much said mrs bumble what business is it of yours why my dear urged mr bumble submissively what business is it of yours demanded mrs bumble again its very true youre matron here my dear submitted mr bumble but i thought you mightnt be in the way just then ill tell you what mr bumble returned his lady we dont want any of your interference and youre a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that dont concern you making everybody in the house laugh the moment your back is turned and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day be off come mr bumble seeing with excruciating feelings the delight of the two old paupers who were tittering together most rapturously hesitated for an instant mrs bumble whose patience brooked no delay caught up a bowl of soap suds and motioning him towards the door ordered him instantly to depart on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person what could mr bumble do he looked dejectedly round and slunk away and as he reached the door the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight it wanted but this he was degraded in their eyes he had lost caste and station before the very paupers he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen peckery all in two months said mr bumble filled with dismal thoughts two monthsnot more than two months ago i was not only my own master but everybody elses so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned and now it was too much mr bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him for he had reached the portal in his reverie and walked distractedly into the street he walked up one street and down another until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty he passed a great many public houses and at length paused before one in a by way whose parlour as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds was deserted save by one solitary customer it began to rain heavily at the moment and this determined him mr bumble stepped in and ordering something to drink as he passed the bar entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street the man who was seated there was tall and dark and wore a large cloak he had the air of a stranger and seemed by a certain haggardness in his look as well as by the dusty soils on his dress to have travelled some distance he eyed bumble askance as he entered but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation mr bumble had quite dignity enough for two supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar so he drank his gin and water in silence and read the paper with great show of pomp and importance it so happened howeveras it will happen very often when men fall into company under such circumstancesthat mr bumble felt every now and then a powerful inducement which he could not resist to steal a look at the stranger and that whenever he did so he withdrew his eyes in some confusion to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him mr bumbles awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the strangers eye which was keen and bright but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion unlike anything he had ever observed before and most repulsive to behold when they had encountered each others glance several times in this way the stranger in a harsh deep voice broke silence were you looking for me he said when you peered in at the window not that i am aware of unless youre mr here mr bumble stopped short for he was curious to know the strangers name and thought in his impatience he might supply the blank i see you were not said the stranger an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth or you would have known my name you dont know it and i should recommend you not to inquire i meant no harm young man observed mr bumble majestically and have done none said the stranger another silence succeeded this short dialogue which was again broken by the stranger i have seen you before i think said he you were differently dressed at that time and i only passed you in the street but i should know you again you were beadle here once were you not i was said mr bumble in some surprise porochial beadle just so rejoined the other nodding his head it was in that character i saw you what are you now master of the workhouse rejoined mr bumble slowly and impressively to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume master of the workhouse young man you have the same eye to your own interest that you always have had i doubt not resumed the stranger looking keenly into mr bumbles eyes as he raised them in astonishment at the question dont scruple to answer freely man i know you pretty well you see i suppose a married man replied mr bumble shading his eyes with his hand and surveying the stranger from head to foot in evident perplexity is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can than a single one porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner the stranger smiled and nodded his head again as much as to say he found he had not mistaken his man then rang the bell fill this glass again he said handing mr bumbles empty tumbler to the landlord let it be strong and hot you like it so i suppose not too strong replied mr bumble with a delicate cough you understand what that means landlord said the stranger drily the host smiled disappeared and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum of which the first gulp brought the water into mr bumbles eyes now listen to me said the stranger after closing the door and window i came down to this place to day to find you out and by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes you walked into the very room i was sitting in while you were uppermost in my mind i want some information from you and dont ask you to give it for nothing slight as it is put up that to begin with as he spoke he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion carefully as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without and when mr bumble had scrupulously examined the coins to see that they were genuine and put them up with much satisfaction in his waistcoat pocket he went on carry your memory backlet me seetwelve years last winter its a long time said mr bumble very good ive done it the scene the workhouse good and the time night yes and the place the crazy hole wherever it was in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselvesgave birth to puling children for the parish to rear and hid their shame rot em in the grave the lying in room i suppose that means said mr bumble not quite following the strangers excited description yes said the stranger a boy was born there a many boys observed mr bumble shaking his head despondingly a murrain on the young devils cried the stranger impatiently i speak of one a meek looking pale faced hound who was apprenticed down here to a coffin maker i wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in it and who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed why you mean oliveryoung twist said mr bumble i remember him of course there wasnt a obstinater young rascal its not of him i want to hear ive heard enough of him said the stranger stopping mr bumble in the very outset of a tirade on the subject of poor olivers vices its of a woman the hag that nursed his mother where is she where is she said mr bumble whom the gin and water had rendered facetious it would be hard to tell theres no midwifery there whichever place shes gone to so i suppose shes out of employment any way what do you mean demanded the stranger sternly that she died last winter rejoined mr bumble the man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted and he seemed lost in thought for some time he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence but at length he breathed more freely and withdrawing his eyes observed that it was no great matter and rose as if to depart mr bumble was cunning enough and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half he well remembered the night of old sallys death which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect as the occasion on which he had proposed to mrs corney and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old womans attendance as workhouse nurse upon the young mother of oliver twist hastily calling this circumstance to mind he informed the stranger with an air of mystery that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died and that she could as he had reason to believe throw some light on the subject of his inquiry how can i find her said the stranger thrown off his guard and plainly shewing that all his fears whatever they were were aroused afresh by the intelligence only through me rejoined mr bumble when cried the stranger hastily to morrow rejoined bumble at nine in the evening said the stranger producing a scrap of paper and writing down an obscure address by the water side upon it in characters that betrayed his agitation at nine in the evening bring her to me there i neednt tell you to be secret for its your interest with these words he led the way to the door after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk and shortly remarking that their roads were different departed without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night on glancing at the address the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name the stranger had not gone far so he made after him to ask it whos that cried the man turning quickly round as bumble touched him on the arm following me only to ask a question said the other pointing to the scrap of paper what name am i to ask for monks
